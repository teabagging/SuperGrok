Here is an article with some information: Easter is known as a time to celebrate the end of the Lenten season and the resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday. But for young kids especially, Easter also means candy and eggs full of treats from the mystical and magical Easter Bunny. With all the excitement might come endless questions — where does the Easter Bunny come from? Why does he bring us candy and eggs? How old is he? And most importantly, what does a bunny have to do with the religious holiday?While legend has told us that the Easter Bunny is a long-eared, cotton-tailed creature who hops from house to house to deliver festive baskets, there's more about his history that you might not be familiar with. Before you break out the delicious Easter desserts and begin your annual family egg hunt, take a minute to learn about the Easter Bunny's connection to this special Christian holiday that goes back to pagan traditions. Find out where the character comes from, how a rabbit became associated with Easter eggs and how he came to be such a beloved symbol for kids over the years.As Christians probably already know, the Bible makes no mention of a mythical hare who delivers eggs to children on the day of Jesus Christ's resurrection. So, why exactly has a rabbit become a prominent part of one of Christianity's most important celebrations of rebirth and renewal? One theory, according to Time, is that the symbol of the rabbit stems from the ancient pagan tradition on which many of our Easter traditions are based — the festival of Eostre, which honored the goddess of fertility and spring. The goddess's animal symbol was a rabbit, which have long traditionally stood for fertility due to their high reproduction rates.As for how the character of the Easter Bunny made its way to America, History.com reports that it was first introduced in the 1700s by German immigrants to Pennsylvania, who reportedly brought over their tradition of an egg-laying hare named \\"Osterhase\\" or \\"Oschter Haws\\" from the Old Country. Legend has it, the rabbit would lay colorful eggs as gifts to children who were good, so kids would make nests in which the bunny could leave his eggs and even sometimes set out carrots in case the hare got hungry. Remind you of any other holiday traditions? Eventually, the custom spread across America until it was a widespread Easter tradition. Over time, the fabled bunny's delivery expanded from just eggs to include other treats such as chocolate and toys. Easter baskets have only gotten more and more elaborate over the years, as one trip to the store this year will tell you.","answer":"According to the article, the origin of the easter bunny starts with the rabbit symbolism seen in the pagan spring and fertility festival of Eostre, which influenced many Easter traditions. The Easter Bunny was introduced to the United States around the 1700s by German immigrants who spread the legend of a bunny laying colorful eggs for well-behaved children."},{"question":"What were the first three movies made by Disney and what years were they made?

Part of this is because of the rise of streaming. While 30 Rock was never a ratings winner in its day, people have consistently discovered it years later on Netflix and Peacock. But it’s also the way that the show’s astute satirization has aged so well. This past winter, for example, saw the premiere of MILF Manor on TLC, a show with more than a passing resemblance to the 30 Rock cinematic universes’s MILF Island.The “MILF Island” episode comes in the series’ second season, a high point in a show full of them. It’s a season that also sees Jack Donaghy’s relationship with Congresswoman Celeste “CiCi” Cunningham (Edie Falco), Carrie Fisher’s guest appearance, “Werewolf Bar Mitzvah,” Sandwich Day, and the whole cast coming together for a rousing performance of Gladys Knight & the Pips’ “Midnight Train To Georgia.” The latter moment comes at the end of “Episode 210,” an installment that serves both as a midseason premiere and a makeshift finale. The script was the final one written before the 2007-08 writers’ strike, and when the episode was filmed in November, no one knew when they would be able to return to production.The strike wasn’t a surprise; the series included a joke four episodes prior about a news crawl on MSNBC being affected by it. “Episode 210” was filmed a month before the strike officially kicked off, so it stands to reason that there was enough time to plan a gag to go out on. The whole episode builds to this gag. When a cappuccino machine finds a home on Kenneth’s desk, he becomes addicted to caffeine, eventually dubbing New York the “21st-century city of Sodom,” and now that he’s been “sodomized,” he chooses to pack it up and board the train back to his home in Stone Mountain, Georgia. Cue Gladys Knight, who herself had been mentioned previously in the episode.","answer":"The previous writers' strike took place in the years 2007 and 2008, and the season two 30 Rock episode \\"Episode 210\\" was the final script written before the strike began.

No one gets hurt, and it shouldn't be scary or violent but it can be kind of gross.","answer":"Evan loved to play in the ocean. He would make sandcastles, splash in the water, and paddle on his boogey board until he could ride the waves back to shore. One day, he swam far out to sea. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a huge fin in the water. Shark! he thought. No, it was bigger than a shark-- this was a megalodon! Before he could swim away, the shark's head popped out of the water. \\"Excuse me,\\" the megalodon said. \\"I have something stuck in my teeth. Could you help me?\\" The shark opened his enormous jaw, and Evan saw seaweed tangled around one of the shark's teeth. The shark seemed friendly enough, so Evan paddled over and crawled into its mouth to remove the seaweed. \\"Pweas be cahfuh,\\" the megalodon told him, unable to speak properly with a boy in his mouth. \\"I'm vewy tickwish.\\" Evan couldn't understand what the shark was saying as he crawled along a massive tongue that was rough like sandpaper. He yanked the seaweed out, but suddenly the shark erupted in laughter and Evan tumbled toward his throat and down into his belly.\\"I'm sorry!\\" exclaimed the shark. \\"I didn't mean to eat you. I'm just very ticklish.\\" That's what the megalodon was trying to say, Evan thought. \\"How do I get out of here?\\" he asked.\\"I don't know,\\" said the megalodon. \\"This has never happened before.\\"Evan looked around him at the walls of the megalodon's belly. After he ate something, it either came out in one of two directions, and he didn't want that to go any farther. He had to find a way back up the shark's throat. Then, he got an idea. Evan ticked the sides of the megalodon's stomach harder and harder. The walls shook as the shark laughed. A wave of vomit crashed over Evan, carried him up the megalodon's throat, and tossed him into the ocean. He looked at his sticky arms, covered in throw-up. \\"Yuck,\\" he said.\\"Sorry about that,\\" said the shark.\\"That's OK,\\" replied Evan. \\"Hope you feel better.\\"The shark nodded. \\"Next time, I'll try to get the seaweed out on my own, though.

An estimated 9 million soldiers were killed in combat, plus another 23 million wounded, while 5 million civilians died as a result of military action, hunger, and disease. Millions more died as a result of genocide, while the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was exacerbated by the movement of combatants during the war.The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers.

Make the response under 400 words.","answer":"I arrive first. I look around at the empty tables outside and make my way over to the host standing outside. \\"Table for two, please\\", I say and watch his reaction seeing me without company. He leads me to a pretty table that sits in the dusk light overlooking Washington Street. We're in Boston and it's humid and muggy tonight but also beautiful in a subtle way. Our hearts burst and pump and bleed to keep alert with this kind of weather, beckoning us to keep going, keep dreaming, keep living. So when I see Pedro round the corner in his purple polo shirt, biceps glistening and a smile on his face, I feel grateful and romantic (many years later, I still remember this image of Pedro rounding the corner in his purple polo). He takes his white headphones out of his ears and sits down across from me. I'm facing the street and he's facing the entrance of the restaurant. \\"Nice place\\", he says. \\"I really like it. I haven't been before\\", I chirp back. I never know how I'm supposed to act on these kinds of dates. We met 9 days ago and the first date went well or so I thought until the end. Pedro was tentative saying goodbye and didn't kiss me after or anything like that (later, this arms-length behavior lost all appeal). For days I sat next to my cell phone, waiting for the sounds of messages to come in. Of course, only when I gave myself a break to do something like read or god forbid laundry -- I can't remember now -- did a message actually come in from Pedro. He was nonchalant but interested in meeting again. The anxiety in my chest dripped a little less like an IV at the end of its juice. From this text, we made plans to meet at the restaurant the next day.

Massive dust storms began in 1931. A series of drought years followed, further exacerbating the environmental disaster.By 1934, an estimated 35 million acres of formerly cultivated land had been rendered useless for farming, while another 125 million acres—an area roughly three-quarters the size of Texas—was rapidly losing its topsoil.Regular rainfall returned to the region by the end of 1939, bringing the Dust Bowl years to a close. The economic effects, however, persisted. Population declines in the worst-hit counties—where the agricultural value of the land failed to recover—continued well into the 1950s.","answer":"1930: A severe drought impacted the Midwest and the southern Great Plains.1931: Dust storms began.1934: 35 million acres of previously cultivated land were no longer fertile enough for agriculture and another 125 million rapidly lose topsoil.1939: Rainfall returns and the Dust Bowl era comes to an end."},{"question":"Write me a short vignette about discovering an old house in the woods from the first person.","answer":"It was late when I finally stumbled upon the dilapidated building in the woods. The windows were boarded up, and the paint had long since chipped off, although, from observation, I would surmise it was once painted a vibrant green color. Somehow, that particular detail sat uncomfortably with me. Green? In the middle of the woods? The door yawned awake slowly every few moments, the effect of a bad hinge no doubt. The wind, however, didn't seem to appreciate the ominous gaping mouth and would quickly shut it with a jarring slam.The roof was leaning, whether from slight imperfections in its constructions or a slouch in the foundation of the home, I could not tell. Still, it was an unfriendly look, almost like a stranger tilting their head ever so slightly to bore their gaze into you quizzically. The house was asking, \\"What are you?\\" and \\"Why are you here?\\"—both questions I couldn't answer.A rocking chair sat precariously perched upside down between the porch banister and the low-hanging roof as though an angry poltergeist had been upset with it, although it was likely that the wind sweeping through the porch had just lifted it up and trapped it there. It was an uncomfortable juxtaposition between familiarity and oddity; my mind conjured the image that the house was grinding the old rocking chair between its jaws.Still, it was none of these details that unsettled me so. It was the single light tucked away under the low-hanging roof, providing a subtle glow. It told me, contrary to everything else I had seen thus far, that the house wasn't just an old relic. No, it was a home."},{"question":"TLDR What actions does the author do over these few paragraphs?NY Mag article:The first creatures to eat every day in my apartment are my cats, Holly and Olive, who paw me awake and demand to be fed. Well, Olive walks over my body and pokes my skull repeatedly in protest of my sleep. Holly is more independent, so she shoves books and my glasses and coasters off my nightstand. Anyway, it’s 6 a.m. I feed them and crawl back into bed. My weighted blanket knocks me out for another 45 minutes.When I finally do get up, the first thing I have is a scoop of Athletic Greens in water. I was in L.A. two weekends ago for the L.A. Times Festival of Books, and I stayed with my friends Nick and Julia, who had Athletic Greens in the mornings. After God knows how many Instagram ads wearing me down over the years, that’s what tipped me over the edge. It might be a bit psychosomatic, but starting my day with something visibly green feels like a gentle nudge in the right direction.I also make a Nespresso coffee with a splash of cashew milk to have while I get ready. I drink what is technically called a “concerning amount” of coffee, which stems from an after-school job I had at Starbucks when I was a teenager. I was very good at the morning rush, but I also made approximately 10,000 Frappuccinos, and now the very idea of them makes me gag. The job did pay for a prom dress and makeup and gas money, so it served its purpose.There are a lot of Mexican-run bodegas and little kitchens and food vendors in my corner of the Heights, including the tamal tent run by a woman near one of the neighborhood’s subway stops. I’m not precious about what counts as “authentic” Mexican food versus what doesn’t — I am very pro Baja Blast, and I will answer for my sins in the afterworld — but I do source all my Christmas and Thanksgiving tamales from her. There’s usually some intense game of telephone to pick things up on special days, and her lines are always five people deep. This morning, I get a tamal with salsa verde and chicken for breakfast.Closer to the office, I grab a large iced coffee from Juice Press as well as a Greens and Earth. I would like to blame my love for green juice on … I don’t even know what. My Southern California upbringing? My mom’s neighborhood in L.A. just got an Erewhon, which blew my mind because Culver City was not a place to Be Seen when I was growing up, and now I gather that it’s tech trendy. The point of this sidebar is that my little brother heard me call Erewhon a grocery horse of the apocalypse when I was in town, looked me dead in the eye, and pointed out that I’m its target demographic. The most devastating burn of my life, but an admittedly fair assessment.","answer":"First, they feeds their cats at 6 a.m. Then, they go back to sleep for 45 minutes.

When I received my order, I was shocked to discover that the food was undercooked. The dumplings were cold and raw in the middle, the chicken was pink, and the rice was hard. It was evident that the food was not cooked to the correct temperature, and I had concerns about the potential health risks of consuming it. The staff was unresponsive when I brought the issue to their attention, and they seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns.

Here is a list of common early pregnancy symptoms that may take place within the first trimester: 1) Missed period- If you have missed your expected period start date by a week or more, odds are that this might mean you are pregnant. This may be less reliable if you have a consistently irregular menstrual cycle.2) Tender, swollen breasts- Your breasts may feel generally sensitive or sore or you may experience sharp pains in your breasts and/or nipples. This symptom may lessen after a few weeks.3) Nausea with or without vomiting- This is often referred to as morning sickness, although it can occur at any time of day. It will usually begin 1-2 months into pregnancy.4) Increased urination- This is likely because, with increased blood, your kidneys produce more fluid and this fluid ends up in your bladder.5) Fatigue- No one knows for certain what causes sleepiness during the first trimester of pregnancy although, a rapid rise in the levels of the hormone progesterone during early pregnancy might contribute. 6) Moodiness- You may be unusually emotional and weepy or experience mood swings.7) Bloating- This is also due to hormonal changes. It may be similar to what you have experienced at the start of a regular menstrual period.8) Light spotting- Light spotting may be normal in the first 12 weeks, especially around the time that your period would have started. Spotting at this point is known as implantation bleeding. It happens when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus — about 10 to 14 days after conception. Not all women will experience this.9) Cramping- Some women experience mild uterine cramping early in pregnancy, similar to those of your menstrual cycle, although they may feel quite different.10) Constipation- Hormonal changes cause your digestive system to slow down, which can lead to constipation.11) Food aversions- You might become more sensitive to certain odors and your sense of taste might change. 12) Nasal congestion- Increasing hormone levels and blood production can cause the mucous membranes in your nose to swell, dry out and bleed easily. This might cause you to have a stuffy or runny nose."},{"question":"Are there any guidelines on best practices for writing error messages?

It’s a fun little tradition we have been doing for months and months now. Dad is always the first one up on Sunday and he does all the cooking.First, he starts the coffee pot and puts a kettle on so there is hot water for Mother’s tea. He arranges a plate of fresh fruit that we can all graze on while he whips up a homemade breakfast. Hash brown patties go in the toaster oven to get crispy and golden brown. He cracks a large number of eggs and gets them ready to scramble. Usually, we will have some sort of breakfast meat like ham, sausage, or bacon. Then it’s time for it all to come together.

We all eat our fill and prepare for the rest of our day.Both my parents had this kind of breakfast growing up every Sunday with their families.

Make it three paragraphs.","answer":"It was spring again. A time of change for everyone. Kohai become senpai. Student council vice presidents become presidents. The sakura bloomed and welcomed in new students while seeing off the old students who had outstayed their welcome. I was part of those old students. I held my diploma in hand and watched friends and acquaintances whom I'd known for so many years saying their final goodbyes. Sure, some of us would go to the same universities. Some of us were still neighbors and would talk during holidays. Those who were closest might remain friends despite the distance. However, the distance was undeniable. With our graduation, something had changed in us all. We were no longer simply students waiting for the seasons to turn. We were adults now. We would surely have our own worries and responsibilities before long. As I scanned the faces there, I recognized that feeling in everyone's faces. They knew that nothing would ever be the same. They knew they'd likely never see most of these people ever again. For some, it was a sad thing. For others, it might have meant very little. I knew it meant a lot to me, though. I wanted to stay close with my friends. I wanted to meet them during the holidays and talk about that one time during the cultural festival during our second year of high school or the camping trip that was a disaster for this reason and that reason. I wanted to remember how things were together fondly, even though they were tragedies at the time. There was so much that I wished would stay the same.

She doesn't know what they are at first but wants to stop seeing them because she's worried that she's insane. Make the tone of the inner monologue casual and slightly funny. Write in first person past tense and make it 3 short paragraphs.","answer":"The little blue lights started small at first, with just two or three of them clinging to my brow and inner wrists at a time. They were minuscule and shimmery, not too bright, easy enough to ignore except when I’d face the mirror or when I first woke in the morning and their glint would catch me off-guard. Day after day, I’d convince myself they were just a result of some glitter caught in the corner of my eyelid from spent eyeshadow, or maybe they were those spots that get stuck in your vision after you stare too hard at the sun. I even found myself wondering if maybe they’d always been there and I’d just been too immature or self-involved to notice before, like a child who’s blinded to the existence of adult concerns until they grow up and get muddled in the dregs of them personally. But like a faint ringing in the ears, they grew more and more difficult to dismiss as time went on. They never left me, all day long. They trailed me through the hallways at school, followed me on the bus home, and hovered above my shoulders while I sat at the dinner table. I couldn’t shake them, even if I sprinted in erratic zig-zags like somebody trying to dodge a bullet (yes, I actually tried this, and yes, it was just as humiliating as you might imagine). I did a series of web-based vision assessments and was heartbroken to learn that there was nothing wrong with my eyes and, in fact, I was an ideal candidate for air force pilot training. I rubbed my eyes raw. I remember scrubbing my skin till I nearly bled in the shower one day, haunted by the sense that I must have done something to bring this upon myself--that I was being punished by some God with a deeply twisted sense of justice. I even prayed that they would go away, despite being raised in a strictly atheist household. But then they started to multiply, so clearly that tactic didn’t work as intended.

Keep a casual tone, and make it a maximum of two paragraphs.","answer":"Okay, so you know how we have television, and we send each other letters, and we call each other on the phone? Well, the internet is this thing that allows us to do all of that and more, with everyone around the world. So, you know about computers, right? Well, the internet is essentially a whole network of connected computers, much smaller than the ones you have, all around the world. At first, we connected to each other through phone lines, but technology gave us faster and easier ways to do that. And at first, we could just do basic stuff like send each other electronic mail, or \\"email.\\" You would type your message on the keyboard, which was like a set of typewriter keys, and the words you typed showed up on the monitor, which is like a TV screen. Then you'd send the message to the email address (which is like kinda a real address) of the person. And any emails that came to you would show up on screen, in a list. Each email has a title or subject, and then the main part of the email has the message you sent.At first, we primarily sent emails and we would go to what are called websites, which were kind of like a set of newspaper pages. And as technology got better, we could do more - we could watch television-like videos on websites, and we could also make videos using cameras like you have now, but more advanced. You could also record music, and other people could listen to it. The internet became fast enough and easy to use that a website called YouTube was created, where people around the world could make videos, and others around the world could watch them. Now, technology is so advanced that there are websites where individual people broadcast live, on millions of channels, and people can talk to each other and the person on the channel, by typing to each other. We're also able to play games with each other around the world. You can play chess with someone in China, or have a conversation with someone in Britain. It's as if they're in the room with you. You can see AND talk to them.

He was taking a look at the stars again, thinking of a more exciting life. Suddenly, what appeared to be a bright spotlight was coming upon him at a concerning speed. He was confused as he could see no source of this light, but before he could think about it further, he was taken aboard a spaceship. He was surrounded by strange-looking creatures who were grey like him, but much smaller and had heads that seemed too large for their slim bodies. They asked him if he'd be interested in appearing on an interstellar gameshow that was would be airing soon. Johnny agreed, thinking this was the most exciting thing that ever had happened to him.After a short stint in make-up, Johnny was brought to the alien studio and found himself competing against a farmer from Utah and a dolphin from the Indian Ocean.

At the doorway, stood a roughly dressed man, who stumbled forward like a drunkard. With each step, the man groaned and grumbled words incoherently. As the man walked slowly away from the house, a woman was watching him through the window and shut the door after he left. She smiled peculiarly as she heard the man fumble his keys while his footsteps grew farther away.As the woman began to walk around the house, she could not help but replay the events that unfolded the day before. She meticulously calculated and planned every minor detail. The complex plan involved items such as knives, boxes, and liquids. She executed the plan perfectly and timely, as she had done numerous times before. Last night was no different and just like every other night, she finished her plan successfully while the man was deep asleep. However, if one were to see the current state of affairs now, the true intent of the woman's plan would be obvious judging from the aftermath. However, for some unknown reason, the woman felt as if something was missing. A vague and intangible itchiness was knawing at her heels.The woman frantically looked around. She did not know what she was looking for but wanted to just check everything. Her eyes finally locked on the side table next to the door she had just closed. On the table was a bag the size of a baby made of soft materials. The woman's eyes widened in astonishment and she almost tripped as she darted towards the bag with both hands outstretched in front of her. The woman grabbed the bag and busted the door wide open, with a disregard for anything that may have been in the way. The man, who had walked some distance away now but was still within clear sight of the door, snapped his body. He was startled by the sudden outburst and his face grew pale. The man squinted to see the bag that the woman was holding and smiled widely. She was holding his bento box! The man hurried over, took his bag, and pecked the woman on the cheek before turning to walk towards his car again."},{"question":"Please summarize this article in less than 5 sentences with all its key points:\\"Loud snoring may be a harbinger of much bigger problems, research out this week suggests. The study found a link between severe sleep apnea in older adults and greater amounts of a specific biomarker in the brain—one that could increase people’s risk of dementia or stroke. More research will be needed to understand this connection, however.  Sleep apnea is a condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep. This causes the brain to wake the person just enough to start breathing, only for the cycle to start again once the person falls back asleep. There are two main forms of sleep apnea, obstructive and central. Obstructive apnea happens when airway muscles physically block a person’s breathing, while central apnea is when the brain forgets to signal the body to breath (a third mixed form has features of both).Though not all snoring is linked to obstructive sleep apnea, it’s a common sign of the condition (snoring in general is caused by a narrow airway while sleeping). The constant interruptions caused by apnea also make it hard for people to get a restful night’s sleep, which can then affect their physical and mental health in varying ways.  Sleep apnea, especially when severe, has been linked to a greater risk of many other health problems, including cardiovascular disease. In this new study, published Thursday in the journal Neurology, scientists wanted to get a better understanding of how the condition could possibly affect the brain.  They looked at data collected from 140 older adults with obstructive sleep apnea who had participated in an earlier study. These volunteers had undergone an MRI brain scan and were monitored overnight in a sleep lab. They were divided into three groups based on their diagnosed degree of sleep apnea, but all of them were thought to be free of dementia at the start and end of the study period.\\"","answer":"Here are the key points from this article:A study has found that sleep apnea can lead to very serious health problems, specifically in older adults. Firstly, there are three types of sleep apnea - obstructive, central, and a mix of both. Obstructive is when airway muscles block someone's breathing, and central is when the brain doesn't send signals to the body to breathe. The health risks include cardiovascular disease, dementia, or even strokes depending on the severity. The constant interruptions in sleep keep them from getting restful sleep which leads to these issues."},{"question":"What year was Charles Dickens born?","answer":"Arguably, Charles Dickens was the most noteworthy person born in 1812."},{"question":"I want to take this text and rewrite it as a landing page for this design course.

Be sure to highlight the feelings of dreariness and hopelessness of staying within solitary confinement, and also highlight how the experience mentally affects the person placed there.","answer":"I was sentenced to life in prison at ADX Florence in Colorado for attempted murder. I don't dispute my conviction or my sentence, but I do object to the inhumane conditions I've endured here at the penitentiary.On three separate occasions, I was sent to solitary confinement for having contraband (ramen) in my cell. Each time I was caught, two guards confiscated the ramen and physically escorted me to a 6-foot by 9-foot windowless cement cell containing a bed pad and a toilet. I was told each infraction for contraband would result in 24 hours in these solitary confinement cells. My experience within these cells can only be described as a living nightmare, one that I never, ever want to be a part of again.Inside the cell, you realize very quickly either how very large your body is or how very small your surroundings are, so much so that having claustrophobia (which I do) can already cause severe anxiety. Adding on to this is the fact that you are unable to tell time in a windowless environment; it's like being in a casino, but instead of having fun you're alone with the deafening silence, unable to tell how much time you have left in the 24 hours you're required to stay inside. To top it all off, the toilet in the cell I was in would repeatedly break and not flush, so the smell of feces and urine lingered constantly in the cell. I asked several of my inmate peers who were also required to stay in solitary confinement if their toilets worked, and every one of them reported that their toilets could not flush.I'm very scared to go back into solitary confinement, so much so that I often find myself starving for the lack of ramen in my cell and the sparse food they give you during your stay here.

Besides, this case has been giving you nightmares, and the less you slept, the better. It's the 1920s; you are John Graves, a private detective that stumbled onto a case that even has the police stumped, the hunt for the Pietown Killer. At first, it was just your average disappearance case for a missing wife, and you expected it to end like they usually do by finding out that they left for a new lover. But on that day two weeks ago, you found the sight of a vile murder instead. Now, the case has consumed you, and you've gathered every shred of evidence you can from public sources and whatever the police are willing to give you, which isn't much. You feel like you're being stonewalled in every direction you search, as you've never had such resistance from your usual resources before. Whoever the Pietown Killer was, they must have deep connections and an overarching influence that could keep small-time folk from getting too close. You take a shot of whiskey, your drink of choice, and review your options. The latest body was found at The Drink Hole, a dive bar that serves cheap swill and is in a rougher part of town. The police kept you from interrogating the bar owner at the time, but now that they've moved on, perhaps it would be a good time to revisit and get his side of the story. You also had your connections with the authorities, a policewoman named Barbara who owed you a favor, and you might be able to get a bit more information on why you're being stonewalled for information. It was risky as it could get her into trouble too, but time was of the essence if you were going to put a stop to these murders. Whatever decision you made here would be crucial, as there was no telling how much time you had before the Pietown Killer struck again. With that in mind, what do you do?1. Go down to The Drink Hole, and interrogate the bar owner.2. Go down to the police station, and get information from your officer friend Barbara about the case.

I'm not very good at baking and I want them to be portioned per guest.","answer":"There are plenty of individual desserts you can make for guests without baking. Here are some ideas:1. Individual Strawberry Trifles. This dessert consists of sponge cake, fruit, and custard layered in that order and displayed in a tall glass or dish. You can use a premade sponge or pound cake for an easy, bake-free dessert! This is a very versatile dessert because flavors can be mixed and matched in any way. They are perfect for entertaining because they can be scaled up or down. You can mix up the presentation by assembling this dessert in small highball glasses or mason jars, which are perfect for exact portioning. 2. No-Bake Peanut Butter Bars. These bars can be made with most ingredients you'd already find in your pantry. Salted butter, peanut butter, powdered sugar, vanilla wafers, and semi-sweet chocolate come together to make these decadent bars that guests will be sure to love. These bars only need to be cooled in the fridge for 1 hour before they can be cut into individual bars for portioned servings. If peanut allergies are a concern, some great alternatives are seed butter or other kinds of nut butter. The flavors will be similar.3. Individual Key Lime Pies. Made with lime custard, graham cracker crust, and whipped cream, these will be sure to please your guests. In small individual serving dishes, flatten the graham cracker crust in the bottom, top with the key lime custard, and finish it with the whipped cream. Chill in the fridge until dessert is ready to be served.4. Rice Krispie Treats. This is a classic dessert that will remind guests of their childhood. Marshmallow and rice krispie cereal mix together to form this all-original favorite. Combine the ingredients with salt and vanilla extract and form the mixture in a pan while hot. Let it sit at room temperature before cutting the rice krispie treats into individual squares. Separate the squares with wax paper so they do not stick together and are easy for guests to grab.5. No-Bake Chocolate Oatmeal Cookies. A No-Bake interpretation of the classic chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. These cookies are made with brown sugar, cocoa powder, unsalted butter, almond butter, rolled oats, and chocolate chips. Simply combine all ingredients in a bowl and use an ice cream scooper to form them on a baking sheet, slightly flattening them into cookie shapes. Place in the freezer for 1 hour to set. Serve when ready. Other nut butter may be used in place of almond butter.

These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world, also referred to as non-player characters (NPCs). The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the characters earn experience points (XP) to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions.[3][7][11] ","answer":"You see, D&D is no mere traditional wargame, it allows each player to create their own individual character (doomed to be eaten by a powerful dragon such as myself), rather than playing a military formation (not that an army would save you from my jaws).

In the absence of space, be sure to maintain high hygiene practices, and regularly disinfect high-contact surfaces in the bathrooms.2. Be more careful with laundry. Germs can survive anywhere, on fabrics, on sheets, and even on blankets. When living with a sick person, make sure you wash these frequently. Use gloves, keep possibly infected clothes far away, and avoid shaking soiled laundry.3. Don’t share personal items. Things like towels and dishes shouldn't be shared with a sick person. Make sure you give a sick person their separate items and space.4. Sleep in a separate bed. Be at least six feet away from a person who's actively sick to get affected by the germs from their coughs and sneezes, even during sleep times. 5. Have the sick person wear a face mask. If you share a confined space with a sick person, then you should have them wear a mask to prevent getting sick from droplets spread when they cough and sneeze."},{"question":"I am trying to write a new version of the children's book ‘Fred the Frog’ with a different storyline.

Can you give me some ideas for practices to use to attract and engage with my Instagram following?","answer":"Here are a few practices used by Instagram influencers and business owners to attract and engage with their followers. 1. Create an Effective Bio - One of the first things you should do to attract more followers on Instagram is to create an effective bio. You have a limited amount of characters to work with and one URL, so you need to make each word count. It may seem obvious that you should put your website's URL on your bio, however, if you do you will not have the opportunity to engage as much with your followers. Instead, it is better to use this link to direct people to a landing page that has a list of links to offer. By doing this, you can direct your followers to an endless number of links simply by pointing them to your bio. 2. Use Organic Tactics to Enhance Brand Awareness - Growth hacking is a term that is used by many digital marketing experts. It is the process of trying out various online marketing strategies to find out which tactics work the best. While there are many applications and programs out there that are designed to help you boost your follower count fast, you may not always end up with followers who are genuinely interested in your brand or what your company has to offer. The best way to make sure your follower count grows is by using organic tactics. By choosing the right hashtags and keywords to add to your profile and your captions, you will guarantee your followers are there because they want to be and are interested in what you are selling. 3. Create a list of Hashtags that Work - Hashtags are the keywords for your Instagram posts, and they play an important part in helping you increase traffic to your account. Create a list of hashtags related to your brand and keep them in a place where they are easily accessible. You can store them in your phone's notepad app, and you will be able to quickly cut and paste all your hashtags at once into your posts instead of having to type them in manually. 4. Use Story Highlights - Story highlights on Instagram make it easy to save the best stories you have created and showcase them on your profile for your followers to view anytime. This is a great feature when you want to add more details to your profile page but you aren't able to due to limitations on character count. 5. Make Each Caption a Mini-blog - Your captions are very valuable, and it's a good idea to plan and create intriguing captions that will get the attention of your target audience. Some customers may like a long caption that gives them more details about your company. Others may prefer to read a shorter post that features videos or graphics. Over time, you will eventually learn which option works best for your audience. 6. Add a CTA To Your Posts - When you make an Instagram post, you want to include a call to action. There are many ways you can do this, and a CTA doesn't always have to be a sales push. You can ask your followers to like the photo, tag a friend who may be interested, or ask them to leave a comment letting you know what improvements they would like to see in your products. 7. Take Advantage of Live Chat or Live Streaming - Sharing fun live-stream videos focused on your brand's products is an excellent way to get the word out to your target audience. Your followers can choose to get a notification whenever you go live, and they can also ask questions during your live stream. It's like an interactive infomercial that allows you to reach out to those who are interested in the products or services you have to offer. "},{"question":"List three benefits of walking outside. They can be about physical or mental health. Give short explanations of each around 50 to 100 words.","answer":"Three benefits of walking are:Heightened creativity: Walking can help break one through plateaus. The fresh air combined with light physical activity can bring clarity to an issue that a person may be having in their work or personal life. Walking outside can also provide sunlight which is important for brain health.Reduced stress: Daily physical activity is ideal to keep stress levels low. Walking is an activity that most people can do and it has a low impact on lower body joints such as the ankles and knees. Staying inside for long periods of time can increase anxiety and stress and walking outside can circumvent those issues if they arise.Maintaining a healthy weight:Walking can help a person maintain a healthy weight. This is achieved by the calories that are burned by walking as well as improved digestion which will allow someone to fully absorb the nutrients of what they drink and eat.

Answer in 3 paragraphs.","answer":"Moana is a young islander who feels a strong connection to the ocean since her childhood. She sings “How Far I’ll Go” to express her desire to explore the ocean and find her identity, as she feels that there is more to her life than staying on her island and becoming the next chief. She also wants to honor her ancestors, who were voyagers that traveled across the sea.The ocean is not only a setting, but also a character and a symbol in the song and the movie. The ocean has a mind of its own and can interact with Moana and other characters. It chooses Moana as the one who can restore the heart of Te Fiti, a goddess who created life, and guides her on her journey. The ocean also helps Moana by giving her clues, saving her from danger, and encouraging her to follow her destiny.The ocean represents Moana’s curiosity, courage, and spirit. It also symbolizes her heritage, as she learns that her people were once great explorers who sailed across the ocean and discovered new islands. The ocean challenges Moana to overcome her fears and doubts, and to discover who she truly is. The ocean also shows Moana that she is not alone, but part of a bigger world that is connected by the sea."},{"question":"What election is tied to a blue shift, according to the on-page text data?Working PapersDEC 15, 2020How We Voted in 2020: A First Look at the Survey of the Performance of American ElectionsCharles Stewart IIIAUG 7, 2018Modeling Voting Service Times with Machine LogsJacob Jaffe, Charles Stewart III, and Jacob CoblentzJAN 1, 2018Residual Votes and Abstentions in the 2016 ElectionR.

I'm ready to get a dog. I have plenty of experience with dogs and would like an active breed. Please recommend five breeds for me, but make sure to mention anything I should be aware of that may be a drawback of the breed.","answer":"Certainly. Here are five active dog breeds you might want to consider:1. Australian Shepherd: The Australian Shepherd is an active herding breed that comes in a variety of colors, including merle. They have lots of energy and few health problems genetically, which make them great hiking companions and give them a chance at a long life. However, they can be very vocal and struggle with separation anxiety, so it's important to get a handle on training early.2. Border Collie: The Border Collie is one of the most famous working dogs in the world and is very active. However, as they are used to having a job, you will need to provide lots of enrichment and stimulation, or your dog might become bored.3. Poodle: The Poodle is a hunting dog favored by many due to its dense coat that doesn't shed much, making it ideal for people with allergies. However, as Poodles are highly intelligent, they need to have a lot to do, or they can also become destructive and vocal.4. Husky: The Husky is a breed with tons of energy which means that if you need a buddy to join you on long weeks, they can be ideal. However, they're very vocal and escape artists. If you don't have at least a six-foot privacy fence, you'll be unable to leave your dog unattended in the backyard, as it might run off—especially if it isn't getting enough exercise.5. Corgi: For something a little smaller, you can look at a Corgi. People often overlook this breed because of its short stubby legs, but as they were bred for herding, they're highly energetic and playful, which makes them great companions. However, they can be stubborn to train.It's important to do your own research before deciding on a breed so you know which one is best for you."},{"question":"I want to have a cool birthday party but I don't want to celebrate at home.

Write about his last day from start to finish","answer":"Robert sighed as he rubbed down the counter at his alehouse. The walls were in worse shape than ever, the floors creaked awfully, and the ale never got any better, but it was his alehouse - and nobody had ever managed to take that away from him. Today was his final day, and instead of a big celebration, all he wanted to do was to run it like any other day, for one last time. His usual pair of thin, cloaked patrons came in first thing in the morning, dropped enough coin for a pair of mugs of ale, and took their mugs to the corner of the alehouse, as they once more muttered quietly between themselves. Then Matthew walked in, but his face was forlorn, and his eyes were bloodshot as if he had been crying. \\"Say it ain't so!\\" exclaimed Matthew, who firmly grasped Robert with both hands. Robert, who was used to Matthew's overly-familiar reactions, let him know that this would be the final day for the alehouse. He had grown much older, and the alehouse was now in terrible condition and would soon end up unsafe for patronage. So he was selling the land to a wealthy baron, who would do whatever he wanted with it. Matthew, who had also grown older with many new scars in the years he'd been coming, started bawling loudly at the counter, so Robert sympathetically left a mug of ale for him.\\"This one's on the house,\\" Robert said, touched that anyone would care so much for this old place, even if it was Matthew. \\"Though I'll be having you pay back the rest of your tab.\\"Slapping himself, Matthew wiped away his tears, pulled himself together, and gave Robert a big, cheeky smile. He assured him that he'd see every penny, as he was being paid today from his latest mercenary job. Robert smiled briefly at him, confident that he was true to his word, and started cleaning mugs once more. Evening came, and as the last customers left and he finished up what he needed to do, he locked the door from the outside and looked at the old building. He'd miss the weathered walls, and the noisy floorboards, but from this point on, it was no longer his alehouse. But maybe, this was his time for something new."},{"question":"I'm going to purchase a cat this weekend, could you give me some tips on how to care for the cat?","answer":"No problem. Here are some tips that can help you get started with taking care of your cat.1. Groom regularly - while cats groom themselves and are known for being clean, it is good to give them some extra help as it can help with their overall health and hygiene. No matter the hair length of the cat, they all can benefit from it. Having a routine for grooming the cat will help prevent shedding and hairballs.2. Always provide fresh water - this is essential to the cat's health. Ensuring they have fresh water all the time will help prevent health issues common in cats, such as kidney disease and urinary tract infections. One thing to keep note of is that cats can be picky about the water they drink. If you notice this, then it may be beneficial to invest in the water fountain, as some cats prefer moving water.3. Proper place to potty - it may be beneficial to have more than one litter box in some situations, especially if you have more than one cat. This allows your cat to have options if they don't feel like using one letterbox for a particular reason. You also want to ensure that the litter box's placed in an area that is easily accessible for the cat and comfortable.4. Consistently clean the litter box - continuing on the topic of litter boxes, it's very important to always make sure that the litter box is maintained and clean. If it gets to the point where it's too full or dirty for the cat, they may find other areas to relieve themselves, such as the carpet or different items such as pillows or clothing. It's good practice to clean out the litter box daily and do a full cleaning of the box at least weekly.5. Scratching-post training - it is common, natural, and even considered healthy behavior for cats to scratch. The downside of this is that they may use our home decor as a means to satisfy the urge to scratch. The main reason the cat needs to scratch as it is a means for them to remove old layers from their claws. It may take some time to get them used to a scratching post, but it's well worth the time and effort."},{"question":"I have been thinking about starting a running routine but I don't know how to structure it into a program.

Add information about what 'extinct' and 'critically endangered' means. Add that the sun is needed for photosynthesis. Don't include how it compares to Thismia americana or any information about that specific plant.  \\"The rediscovery of a fairy lantern species in Japan is exciting researchers worldwide. The Thismia kobensis (T. kobensis) was first found in Kobe, Japan in 1992. But it was considered extinct after an industrial complex was built in the area, destroying the plant's habitat.Fortunately, that was not the case. On February 27, 2023, a team led by Kobe University biologist Kenji Suetsugu revealed that the plants were alive and well. They had been found in a forest trail just 19 miles (30 km) from Kobe.An examination of the plant revealed it is closely related to the Thismia americana (T. americana). The now-extinct fairy lantern species was found near Chicago, Illinois, over 100 years ago. The scientists speculate the plant may have migrated to the US over the Bering land bridge. The bridge connected Asia and North America over 10,000 years ago.Fairy lanterns can be found in tropical forests worldwide. But the plants spend most of their lives underground and are hard to find. Their presence is revealed briefly when their unusual-looking flowers emerge above the soil. Due to a lack of chlorophyll, fairy lanterns cannot photosynthesize. Instead, the plants steal energy from fungi that grow around their roots.Fairy lanterns are critically endangered plants. Most of the 90 species identified over the years have been lost shortly after their initial discoveries. The Japanese researchers are worried that T. kobensis will meet the same fate. They are exploring ways to grow the species in a botanical garden to ensure its survival.\\" ","answer":"Fairy lantern plants live in tropical forests all over the world but they are difficult to find. They live underground and their flowers only briefly emerge to be visible. Unlike most plants, they do not have chlorophyll. So, they do not photosynthesize; they do not need the sun in order to have energy and grow. These unique plants take energy from surrounding fungi. A specific kind called Thismia kobensis (T. kobensis) was found in 1992 in Kobe, Japan. In recent years, it was considered extinct after its main habitat was destroyed. In other words, scientists believed the plant no longer existed since it no longer had what it needed to survive. However, on February 27, 2023, Kenji Suetsugu and his team found fairy lanterns along a forest trail 19 miles (30km) from Kobe.While not extinct, they are critically endangered - at high risk of being extinct - since a majority of the 90 species that have been discovered have disappeared. Kenji Suetsugu and his team are concerned the re-found T. kobensis will also disappear. They are looking for ways to help fairy lanterns grow in botanical gardens that will help them thrive and multiply.

I was six when my mother taught me the art of invisible strength.

At home, she said, \\"Wise guy, he not go against wind. In Chinese we say, Come fromSouth, blow with wind-poom!-North will follow. Strongest wind cannot be seen.\\"The next week I bit back my tongue as we entered the store with the forbidden candies. When my mother finishedher shopping, she quietly plucked a small bag of plums from the rack and put it on the counter with the rest of theitems. , My mother imparted her daily truths so she could help my older brothers and me rise above our circumstances.We lived in. San Francisco's Chinatown. Like most of the other Chinese children who played in the back alleys ofrestaurants and curio shops, I didn't think we were poor. My bowl was always full, three five-course meals everyday, beginning with a soup of mysterious things I didn't want to know the names of. We lived on Waverly Place, in a warm, clean, two-bedroom flat that sat above a small Chinese bakeryspecializing in steamed pastries and dim sum. In the early morning, when the alley was still quiet, I could smellfragrant red beans as they were cooked down to a pasty sweetness. By daybreak, our flat was heavy with the odorof fried sesame balls and sweet curried chicken crescents. From my bed, I would listen as my father got ready forwork, then locked the door behind him, one-two-three clicks. At the end of our two-block alley was a small sandlot playground with swings and slides well-shined down themiddle with use. The play area was bordered by wood-slat benches where old-country people sat cracking roastedwatermelon seeds with their golden teeth and scattering the husks to an impatient gathering of gurgling pigeons.The best playground, however, was the dark alley itself. It was crammed with daily mysteries and adventures. Mybrothers and I would peer into the medicinal herb shop, watching old Li dole out onto a stiff sheet of white paperthe right amount of insect shells, saffron-colored seeds, and pungent leaves for his ailing customers.

The instructions on the ticket were to deliver the pizza to a customer named Kevin at 123 Forest Drive.The delivery driver pulled up the address on his phone's GPS. The location came up to a treehouse in the middle of a forest. It appeared to the driver that there were no roads that led to the treehouse and that the house was literally in the middle of a large forest, with the closest road being about a mile away.The driver supposed he would figure out how to get to Kevin's treehouse once he was in the area. As he drove to the location, the delivery driver tried his best to adhere to the pizza restaurant's promise of delivering all orders within 45 minutes or the customer would receive their order for free. The driver got to the area within 20 minutes, which would have been a relief for him had he been able to walk right up to the treehouse's front door. However, \\"in the area\\" for the driver meant parking on the road about a mile away from the customer's house and having to walk a mile to complete the delivery.The driver lugged his heavy delivery bag containing the customer's large order down a rocky road slightly covered with grass. The day was hot and sunny, but the dense canopy provided by the forest trees overhead provided a measure of protection from the heat. Soon, the driver found himself lost in the woods. He decided to call Kevin for directions but found his phone had no reception in the dense forest. He looked at the timer on his phone: 4 minutes left until he would be too late and Kevin would receive his order for free. The driver wanted to avoid this at all costs considering a free order to a customer would result in his pay being docked for the free food he had to give to Kevin.The driver sat down, defeated, and as soon as the 45 minutes elapsed, decided to dig into some pizza and breadsticks."},{"question":"Turn the facts in this article into a series of questions about octopuses with answers. Include a mix of short response and true/false questions.Many writers grouse when an editor makes a change in a story, but the consequences of changing a single word usually aren’t that dire.Not so with genetic instructions for making proteins. Even a small change can prevent a protein from doing its job properly, with possibly deadly consequences. Only occasionally is a change beneficial. It seems wisest to preserve genetic instructions as they are written. Unless you’re an octopus.Octopuses are like aliens living among us — they do a lot of things differently from land animals, or even other sea creatures. Their flexible tentacles taste what they touch and have minds of their own. Octopuses’ eyes are color-blind, but their skin can detect light on its own (SN: 6/27/15, p. 10). They are masters of disguise, changing color and skin textures to blend into their surroundings or scare off rivals. And to a greater extent than most creatures, octopuses squirt the molecular equivalent of red ink over their genetic instructions with astounding abandon, like a copy editor run amok.These edits modify RNA, the molecule used to translate information from the genetic blueprint stored in DNA, while leaving the DNA unaltered.Scientists don’t yet know for sure why octopuses, and other shell-less cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish, are such prolific editors. Researchers are debating whether this form of genetic editing gave cephalopods an evolutionary leg (or tentacle) up or whether the editing is just a sometimes useful accident. Scientists are also probing what consequences the RNA alterations may have under various conditions. Some evidence suggests editing may give cephalopods some of their smarts but could come at the cost of holding back evolution in their DNA (SN: 4/29/17, p. 6).","answer":"1. What genetic information do octopuses alter when they change their skin's color and texture, and what remains unchanged?-Octopuses edit their RNA when they alter their appearance while leaving their DNA unchanged.2. True or False? Octopuses are color-blind.-True, octopuses are color-blind.3. Why do octopuses change their color and skin texture?-Octopuses change their color and skin texture to camouflage themselves or intimidate rivals.4. True or False? Octopuses have no sense of taste.-False. Octopuses taste what they touch with their tentacles.5. How do octopuses detect light?-Octopuses detect light through their skin.

Most never had the chance, but those that did manage to build a few key cities on the water across the globe.

What are 5 things that I can do? I need things that I'm likely to have in my kitchen already. Write it in paragraph form.","answer":" Firstly, you can drink more water. Water aids in digestion and prevents dehydration. Ginger has been known to reduce nausea in pregnant women and chemotherapy patients. Moderation is key, however, as excess ginger can cause gas, heartburn, indigestion, and abdominal discomfort. Doctors also recommend the BRAT (Banana, Rice, Applesauce and Toast) diet to diarrhea sufferers. This may help harden stool and reduce discomfort associated with diarrhea. This diet is not suitable for the long term, however, as it does not provide you with all the nutrients you need. Smoking and alcohol may trigger indigestion and other gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Limiting alcohol intake and quitting smoking can, therefore, reduce symptoms of gastric discomfort. Finally, baking soda can ease symptoms of heartburn and indigestion by reducing stomach acidity. Consuming too much baking soda can cause symptoms including shallow/slow breathing, muscle twitching, muscle spasms, diarrhea, vomiting and irritability."},{"question":"Write a short guide for elementary school students on how to make friends.

Here are a few fun things you can try to make a new friend:1. Ask your new friend about themselves. When you're in the cafeteria, start with a simple question like: What are you having for lunch? or What's your favorite food? Most of us are happy to talk about food! Here are some other questions you can ask: What kind of music do you like? What did you do this weekend? What's your favorite TV show? Once your friend answers, you can tell them your answer to the question. Maybe you'll find out that you have something in common. Or maybe they will introduce you to a new food or song that quickly becomes your favorite.2. Invite your new friend to do something with you.At recess, ask them: Do you want to play ball? Or when you're in the library you could say: What if we read the same book and then we can talk about it? During your free time in class, you can invite them to work on a project or play a game with you.3. Be kind and positive.Remember that it is very important to be kind to others. Don't make fun of your new friend if they like something that you don't or if they make a mistake.

I miss my family, but somehow this dream won't allow me to picture their faces. I don't know if this dream will ever end, but I'm afraid that these moving colors, shapes, and contradictions might become all that I am."},{"question":"- For what reasons does Google sometimes remove content from its search results? - What is Google's mission?

Include 1 funny line in it.","answer":"Estoppel may sound like fancy French cheese, but it's a legal principle that can prevent a party from cheesing out of their promises. It prevents a person from denying or asserting something that is contrary to what they have previously stated or done. It is a doctrine that is based on fairness and justice, and it aims to prevent injustice and unfairness in legal proceedings.There are two types of estoppel: (1) promissory estoppel and (2) proprietary estoppel. Promissory estoppel arises when a party makes a promise to another party, and that promise is relied upon by the other party to their detriment. Proprietary estoppel, on the other hand, arises when a party has acted to their detriment based on a belief or expectation that they have a certain right or interest in a property.Estoppel is an important principle in contract law, as it can be used to enforce promises that would otherwise not be legally binding. For example, if a party makes a promise to another party, but the promise is not supported by consideration, the promise may not be legally enforceable. However, if the other party has relied on the promise to their detriment, the principle of promissory estoppel may prevent the party who made the promise from denying it.In addition to its application in contract law, estoppel can also be used in other areas of law, such as property law and tort law. For example, in property law, the principle of proprietary estoppel may prevent a landowner from denying that someone else has a right or interest in their land if that person has acted to their detriment based on that belief or expectation.In conclusion, estoppel is a fundamental principle in the legal system that aims to prevent injustice and unfairness.

Can you explain it a bit to me and give a functional example that models a correct usage?","answer":"The Abs() function returns the absolute value of an integer. Consider Abs(4) and Abs(-4). Both of these functions will return 4 as an integer or float. We could use this practically in a code that is looking for temperature discrepancies. Say a fridge needs to be kept within 4 degrees of 0. A script could check if these conditions are being met like this:Temperature = -5If (abs(Temperature) >= 4)    {    Msgbox, Temperature is outside of range.     }Else    {    Msgbox, Temperature within range.     }The code accepts an integer or float and uses an if conditional to check if the reported temperature is acceptable within the parameters. The use of the abs() function here simplifies the check by not needing to check either side of 0.

There is no single answer to the question, \\"What do blind people see?\\" because there are different degrees of blindness. Also, since it's the brain that \\"sees\\" information, it matters whether a person ever had sight.What Blind People Actually SeeBlind From Birth: A person who has never had sight doesn't see. Samuel, who was born blind, tells ThoughtCo that saying that a blind person sees black is incorrect because that person often has no other sensation of sight to compare against. \\"It's just nothingness,\\" he says. For a sighted person, it can be helpful to think of it like this: Close one eye and use the open eye to focus on something. What does the closed eye see? Nothing. Another analogy is to compare a blind person's sight to what you see with your elbow. Went Totally Blind: People who have lost their sight have different experiences. Some describe seeing complete darkness, like being in a cave. Some people see sparks or experience vivid visual hallucinations that may take the form of recognizable shapes, random shapes, and colors, or flashes of light. The \\"visions\\" are a hallmark of Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS). CBS may be lasting or transient in nature. It is not a mental illness and is not associated with brain damage.In addition to total blindness, there is functional blindness. Definitions of functional blindness vary from one country to the next. In the United States, it refers to visual impairment where vision in the better eye with the best correction with glasses is worse than 20/200.1\uFEFF The World Health Organization defines blindness as presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60.2\uFEFF What functionally blind people see depends on the severity of blindness and the form of impairment.Legally Blind: A person may be able to see large objects and people, but they are out of focus. A legally blind person may see colors or see in focus at a certain distance (e.g., be able to count fingers in front of the face). In other cases, color acuity may be lost or all vision is hazy. The experience is highly variable. Joey, who has 20/400 vision, tells ThoughtCo that he \\"constantly sees neon speckles that are always moving and changing colors.\\" Light Perception: A person who still has light perception can't form clear images, but can tell when the lights are on or off.Tunnel Vision: Vision may be relatively normal (or not), but only within a certain radius. A person with tunnel vision can't see objects except within a cone of less than 10 degrees.","answer":"[Introduction][Opening shot: A black screen with the title \\"What Do Blind People See?\\" appears, with dramatic music]Narrator:  It's a question that has puzzled both sighted individuals and those without sight for centuries. What do blind people actually see? The answer, however, is not a simple one. Join us on this journey as we explore the various degrees of blindness and dive into the fascinating world of visual perception.[Scene 1: Blind from Birth][Cut to the interview with Samuel, a blind individual, sitting in a comfortable room]Samuel: When people ask me what I see, it's hard to explain because I've never had sight. It's not like seeing darkness or blackness; it's simply nothingness. There is no frame of reference, it's like trying to see with your elbow.[Narrator's voice-over]Narrator: For those born blind, the concept of sight is entirely foreign. Samuel compares it to closing one eye while the other focuses on something. What does the closed eye see? Nothing. It's void, a world of emptiness.[Scene 2: Went Totally Blind][Cut to the series of interviews with individuals who have lost their sight.]Narrator: But what about those who once had their sight and lost it? Their experiences can vary greatly. Some describe it as being surrounded by complete darkness, akin to being trapped in a pitch-black cave. Others may see sparks or experience vivid visual hallucinations.[Cut to a close-up of visuals resembling those experienced by individuals with Charles Bonnet Syndrome]Narrator: These \\"visions' are known as Charles Bonnet syndrome, which can manifest as recognizable shapes, random patterns, or flashes of light. It's important to note that CBS is not a mental illness and is not associated with brain damage.[Scene 3: Functional Blindness][Cut to a visually impaired person using a cane to navigate the streets.]Narrator: In addition to total blindness, there is a condition known as functional blindness. The severity of this impairment can vary, and it is often defined differently from one country to another.[Cut to a close-up of a visually impaired person's eye]Narrator: In the United States, functional blindness refers to a visual impairment where the best-corrected vision in the better eye is worse than 20/200. However, according to the World Health Organization, blindness is defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60.[Cut to a visually impaired person describing their experience.]Narrator: For those who are functionally blind, what they see depends on the severity of their impairment and the specific form of visual limitation they experience.[Scene 4: Legally Blind][Cut to an interview with Joey, a legally blind person, sitting in a living room.]Joey: My vision is hazy, and things are often out of focus. I can see colors, but they're not as vibrant or clear as for someone with normal vision. It's like constantly seeing neon speckles that are always moving and changing colors.[Narrator's voiceover]Narrator: Joey, who is considered legally blind with 20/400 vision, explains the challenges he faces. While he can perceive large objects and people, his visual acuity is greatly diminished.[Scene 5: Light Perception and Tunnel Vision][Cut to a visually impaired person observing a light turning on and off]Narrator: For some individuals, even though they can't form clear images, they still have light perception. They can discern when lights are on or off, distinguishing between brightness and darkness.[Cut to a person with tunnel vision navigating a crowded street]Narrator: Others may have a condition called tunnel vision. Within a limited radius, their vision may be relatively normal. However, they cannot see objects beyond a small cone of less than 10 degrees.[Conclusion][Narrator's voiceover]Narrator: So, what do blind people see? The answer is complex and multifaceted. From the emptiness experienced by those born blind to the varying perceptions of individuals who have lost their sight, it's clear that there is no single answer. The world of visual perception is as diverse as the people who inhabit it.[Closing shot: Fade out to black and white with the title \\"What Do Blind People See?\\" lingering on the screen.]"},{"question":"Can you write me a silly poem about a sick ostrich?

It must not be written from Dave's point of view.","answer":"It was a beautiful, sunny day in Los Angeles - the kind of day where you feel like you just need to be outside. At least, Dave felt that way. Dave decided to take a walk to his local neighborhood park. His plan was to walk around, explore the park, and enjoy the sunshine. That's not quite what happened. Dave arrived at the park early in the afternoon. There was a smell of fresh-cut grass in the air, people walking their dogs, a few fishing in the lake, and plenty of kids at the playground. It was your typical day at the park. Dave decided he was in an adventurous mood, so he wandered off into the dense forests. He was not a stranger to these trees - he spent his childhood running around here when he had troubles at home.Today was different. There was a heavy ambiance in the air, although it wasn't foggy. He noticed out of the corner of his eye that there was a giant Oak tree with a large hole in the middle. It was so large it seemed that it could fit a human inside of it! How strange, he thought. He decided to approach the tree to get a better look at the hole and what might have caused that to happen. As he approached, he felt every hair on his body stand up straight, producing instant goosebumps. He extended his arm to reach out and touch the tree and ZAP! A lightning strike struck right next to him. In clear blue skies? How is that possible? Fearing what might happen if he tried to touch it again, he rested his arms at his side. On second thought, what could happen? He wasn't afraid of a coincidence. Instead of reaching for the tree again, he decided to try and climb inside of it. His left foot crossed the barrier first and it instantly felt like it was melting. Curious, he proceeded and stuffed his entire body inside the tree. His whole body felt like it was melting! Dave closed his eyes in fear and once he reopened them, he was no longer in the park. He saw a barren wasteland in front of him with a scorching sun and alien-like creatures scattering across the sand. Where am I? he said to himself.

Beginning in the First Intermediate Period of Egyptian history (c. 2181–2055 BC), they were especially connected with the four canopic jars that housed the internal organs that were removed from the body of the deceased during the process of mummification. Most commonly, Imsety protected the liver, Hapy the lungs, Duamutef the stomach, and Qebehsenuef the intestines, but this pattern often varied. The canopic jars were given lids that represented the heads of the sons of Horus. Although they were originally portrayed as humans, in the latter part of the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC) they took on their most distinctive iconography, in which Imsety is portrayed as a human, Hapy as a baboon, Duamutef as a jackal and Qebehsenuef as a falcon. The four sons were also linked with stars in the sky, with regions of Egypt, and with the cardinal directions.The worship of the sons of Horus was almost entirely restricted to the funerary sphere. They were first mentioned late in the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC), in the Pyramid Texts, and continued to be invoked in funerary texts throughout ancient Egyptian history. Their connection with the canopic jars was established in the First Intermediate Period, and afterward they became ubiquitous in the decoration of canopic chests, coffins, and sarcophagi. Although they were increasingly closely associated with the internal organs, they continued to appear in burial equipment even after the use of canopic jars was abandoned in the Ptolemaic Period (303–30 BC), disappearing only in the fourth century AD with the extinction of the ancient Egyptian funerary tradition.","answer":"1.

Oliver remembered the taste of that cheese and wanted more of that salty, sweet goodness. But he didn't know where to get it.Oliver went outside his nest and looked around. He sniffed the air hoping to catch a whiff of tasty dairy product but only smelled the fresh air and surrounding flowers in the meadow. So he wandered through the meadow, looking under rocks and in bushes; he scampered out of the meadow for a bit, then a bit longer, and longer still until he was at the top of a mountain looking down at the vast land below him. And what he found among that vast land was a cluster of lights gathered in the middle of a valley. Oliver had never seen such a beautiful sight, so he decided to investigate further.As he got closer to the lights, Oliver could see the outlines of tall, majestic buildings coming into full view. He marveled at the cars that zoomed on the highways at high speeds, and the humans who walked around with smiles on their faces. He also began to wonder what the big neon sign was that adorned the facade of the nearest building, which if he could read, he would know said \\"Groceries\\". Oliver was drawn to this building, and so he quickly ran toward it and through the double doors.The sights and sounds within the grocery store blew his tiny little mind. Oliver saw so many different foods that he normally found in small quantities in his garden, but there were bunches of them: carrots, oranges, lettuce and radishes. As he continued deftly down the aisles he found the most beautiful sight: the dairy section. In the dairy section, there were mounds and mounds of yellow, white, blue, and orange cheeses. He could smell the tasty treats through their plastic packaging. Oliver, standing there with his mouth agape, began dancing with joy at the thought of getting as much of the delicious cheesy snacks as he could carry.

Can you help me brainstorm a few fun learning ideas that aren't too strict and don't require a lot of preparation?","answer":"Si! Here are a few fun learning activities that can help young students learn Spanish vocabulary:1) Beanie Baby Animals: Play a tossing game with select Beanie Babies. Kids love to toss and catch, and they'll get to practice the name of the animal as they do. Some simple animals could be: oso (bear), pollo (chicken), conejo (rabbit), tortuga (turtle), gato (cat), perro (dog), and loro (parrot). You could also use pajaro (bird). Introduce the animal and its Spanish name, and then toss the Beanie Baby to the student. Ask the student to say the name before tossing it to another student who hasn't spoken, yet. Continue for each new animal. As students get more confident, they could be allowed to choose their own new animal to toss to a partner. 2) I Spy Colors: Write the name of a color on the board. Ask students to play \\"I Spy\\" and locate an item in the room in that color, saying the Spanish name as they do. After practicing with each color, the students could use only the Spanish words. Here are some easy colors to include: rojo (red), amarillo (yellow), azul (blue), verde (green), negro (black), blanco (white), gris (grey), and cafe (brown). They could also do this activity in partners with a Spanish picture book. 3) Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes: This popular song is fun and gets kids up and moving. One at a time, introduce the Spanish names for cabeza (head), espaldas (shoulder), rodillas (knees), and pies (toes). Practice the song a few times before moving on to the next verse: ojos (eyes), orejas (ears), boca (mouth), and nariz (nose.) Encourage the students to get faster and faster as they play.

In a year, the globe drinks around 400 billion cups of coffee every year. Many methods for brewing coffee have been developed around the world and each comes with its own benefits. Some of them include:- Pour over: A dripper is lined with a paper filter and filled with coffee grounds before hot water is poured over the grounds, then coffee drips down into the cup below. The paper filter helps trap the oils and grounds giving the final cup a clarified mouth feel.- Coffee Makers: Popular in much of the world, coffee makers are similar to a dripper but are automated with a water reservoir that heats the water before it hits the coffee grounds. Similar to the pour-over method it utilizes a paper or reusable filter that gives the coffee a clarified mouth feel.- French Press: An immersion method of brewing coffee in which the grounds are fully immersed in hot water before a metal filter is used to separate the grounds from the liquid. This method allows oils and small undissolved coffee particles into the cup giving a unique flavor.  - Cold Brew: Another immersion method in which grounds sit in room temperature water for 8-12 hours before being poured through a filter. This method gives a crisp and refreshing cup of coffee with a silky mouthfeel that has a lower acid content.

What are some good websites that I can use to showcase my work and spread my brand?","answer":"Promoting your art can be hard. It's much more than simply selling art. Many creatives have trouble building the courage to put something they make online. Creatives need a thick skin when showing off something they created with love. That being said, it doesn't need to be difficult. Posting online is a great first step, so congratulations! When you think about marketing yourself online, selling things should be the last thing on your mind. Connect with enough people, and the rest will fall into place. There are many websites to help you do this, so here are a few suggestions.1. Instagram - Instagram is a wonderful tool for organically reaching a wide group of people. It is an image and video social media platform on which you can share fully finished works or even progress updates. Some artists even record themselves working and make videos played at faster speeds to show a full beginning to end in a short digestible video.2. Reddit (Related Subreddits) - Reddit can be a great place to submit your art, provided you go to the right sections. There are dozens of subreddits that can be beneficial to an up-and-coming artist. The community is moderated, but because it is an open forum, you might run into some trolls.3. Deviant Art - If you are into concept art and digital art, Deviant Art is the place to be. It has a huge community where you can follow other artists and comment on each other's work. An artist's Deviant Art page often also acts as their portfolio when applying for jobs. 4. Pinterest - Pinterest is more of a visual search engine than a portfolio or social media page. If you put your work up on Pinterest, then others can pin it so they can add the post to their collection. They can even re-pin it so it reaches even more people.5. Wetcanvas Forums - Wetcanvas is an art-specific forum. While Reddit is a forum with thousands of different topics, Wetcanvas is a place solely for creative art. It is a wonderful place to connect with like-minded artists, get feedback on recent work, or ask for advice on anything you may be stuck on."},{"question":"Write a poem about a recipe for something abstract, such as the feeling of happiness.

Recycling this plastic can take a lot of energy and often still leaves waste. We wanted to find a better way to break plastic down and reuse it to make new plastic. We discovered an enzyme that “digests” plastic in the same way that humans can digest food.  Using this enzyme to break down used plastic means we will need much less energy to recycle plastic. Plus, we can even use the products of the process to make plastics that are just as good as new ones!","answer":"Members of this esteemed Environmental Council, I thank you for your time.

We won’t be ferrying you all about the planet.”Goreth gave the human his best piercing glare. “I expect to land in Iskaayuma City. Don’t try and dump me in some random port.”“We’ll get you to Iskaayuma.”“Good. I’ll need no further assistance from there.”“Then you’ve got yourself a ship. Find me at Docking Bay 21 in four hours.”Goreth downed his drink and left the smelly pub. He wouldn’t trust this Han Solo character to bag groceries honestly, but he was scraping the bottom of the barrel now. Nobody else was willing to take him to Rodia for anything resembling an affordable price. He had been left with no choice but to hope the Empire didn’t decide to search Solo’s ship for the drugs or guns he was no doubt smuggling.Approaching Docking Bay 21 several hours later, Goreth assumed his best intimidation expression. Though just as peaceful by nature as most of his people, Goreth knew he cut an imposing figure. His horns put his height well over two meters. His scowl sent most beings running. These years on Sullust had forced him to use the tools of intimidation with depressing regularity. His distinct lack of funds had occasionally forced him to go further. He disliked violence, but he knew how to use it.Certainly, he was not going to let this Han Solo dictate any revisions to their deal. The dock’s door slid open and Goreth was met not with the dishonest human’s pink face but the huge hairy form of a Wookiee staring down at him. The creature wailed a greeting at him but made no effort to look less menacing. \\"So much for my plan of playing top brute on this trek,\\" Goreth thought.The Wookiee led him up the ramp of the dilapidated YT-1300 freighter.

This juice is then boiled to concentrate it into a syrup, which is further processed to crystallize the sugar. The crystals are then centrifuged to remove the molasses, resulting in raw sugar that can be refined into granulated sugar.- Sugar Beets: Sugar beet processing involves slicing the beets and then soaking them in hot water to extract the sugar content. The resultant juice is purified and concentrated into syrup through evaporation and then crystallized and separated similarly to cane sugar."},{"question":"Rewrite the plot of this Seinfeld TV show episode as bullet points.When Jerry leaves an upscale clothing store without making a purchase, he feels guilty and claims he will return with a friend to get their opinion of a jacket he doesn't like.

These plants will then become the food for the hatching caterpillars.Eggs can be laid from spring, summer or fall. This depends on the species of butterfly. Females lay a lot of eggs at once so that at least some of them survive.Butterfly eggs can be very small.monarch butterfly caterpillarCaterpillar: The Feeding StageThe next stage is the larva. This is also called a caterpillar if the insect is a butterfly or a moth.The job of the caterpillar is to eat and eat and eat. As the caterpillar grows it splits its skin and sheds it about 4 or 5 times. Food eaten at this time is stored and used later as an adult.Caterpillars can grow 100 times their size during this stage. For example, a monarch butterfly egg is the size of a pinhead and the caterpillar that hatches from this tiny egg isn't much bigger. But it will grow up to 2 inches long in several weeks.monarch butterfly chrysalisPupa: The Transition StageWhen the caterpillar is full grown and stops eating, it becomes a pupa. The pupa of butterflies is also called a chrysalis.Depending on the species, the pupa may suspended under a branch, hidden in leaves or buried underground. The pupa of many moths is protected inside a coccoon of silk.This stage can last from a few weeks, a month or even longer. Some species have a pupal stage that lasts for two years.It may look like nothing is going on but big changes are happening inside. Special cells that were present in the larva are now growing rapidly. They will become the legs, wings, eyes and other parts of the adult butterfly. Many of the original larva cells will provide energy for these growing adult cells.monarch butterfly adultAdult: The Reproductive StageThe adult stage is what most people think of when they think of butterflies. They look very different from the larva. The caterpillar has a few tiny eyes, stubby legs and very short antennae. The adults have long legs, long antennae, and compound eyes. They can also fly by using their large and colorful wings. The one thing they can't do is grow.The caterpillar's job was to eat. The adult's job is to mate and lay eggs. Some species of adult butterflies get energy by feeding on nectar from flowers but many species don't feed at all.Flying comes in handy. The adult female can easily fly from place to place to find the right plant for its eggs. This is important because caterpillars can't travel far.Most adult butterflies live only one or two weeks, but some species hibernate during the winter and may live several months.","answer":"Host: \\"Hey kids! Today we are going to talk about the four stages of metamorphosis of butterflies and months. Does anyone know what metamorphosis means? Well, let me tell you, it means a \\"transformation or change in shape.\\"So when a caterpillar evolves into a moth or butterfly, they go through metamorphosis. The four stages in the metamorphosis of moths and butterflies are egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Let's talk about each stage, okay?The first stage is the egg stage. The grown-up female butterfly lays her very tiny eggs on plants that then become food for the hatching caterpillars. She lays a lot of eggs to make sure a lot of them live, and depending on the kind of butterfly, eggs can be laid in Spring, Summer or Fall. Cool, huh? Okay, let's move on to the second stage, the Larva Stage. This is also called the caterpillar stage if the insect is a butterfly or moth. In this stage, the caterpillar eats so much because the food is stored and used later as a grown-up moth or butterfly. Did you know caterpillars can grow up to 100 times their size in this stage? WOW!!! Amazing, right? The third stage is the Pupa stage. When the caterpillar is fully grown and stops eating, it is called a pupa. A pupa may hang from a branch, hide in leaves, or bury underground. The pupa stage can last from a week to a month, or even longer. Some even last two years. WHAT?! That can be a long time. Now kids, it may not look like a lot is going on from the outside, but inside so many changes are happening. Special cells in the larva are growing very fast. These special cells will become legs, wings, eyes, and other parts of the grown-up butterfly. Some of the cells in the larva will give the growing cells energy. The fourth and final stage is the Adult Stage. The adults look very different than the larva stage. For example, look at this [picture of a caterpillar]. Caterpillars have a few tiny eyes, stubby legs and very short antennae. The adults [show a picture of a butterfly] have long legs, long antennae, and compound eyes. Compound eyes are clusters of very small receptors that allow insects to see in multiple directions at the same time. Very different than our human eyes. Another difference is that adults can fly using their large, colorful wings, but they can't grow. Remember when we said caterpillars can grow to 100 times their size in the larva stage? Well, adults can't do that. See, the caterpillar's job was to eat, but the female butterfly's job is to get pregnant and lay eggs. Some of the adult butterflies get their energy feeding on nectar from flowers, and some don't eat anything at all. Another difference between caterpillars and adult butterflies is that adult butterflies can fly to find just the right plant to lay their eggs. This is important because caterpillars can't travel that far.Fascinating isn't it, kids? Wow, we learned a lot today. Make sure you tell your parents and friends that you learned the four stages of the metamorphosis of butterflies and months. First comes the Egg Stage. Second, is the Larva Stage.Third is the Pupa Stage.Fourth is the Adult Stage. Good job, kids! Until next time!”"},{"question":"Write an email as Harry Potter.

Support your choice.Abstract: Human beings can be proactive and engaged or, alternatively, passive and alienated, largely as a function of the social conditions in which they develop and function. Accordingly, research guided by self-determination theory has focused on the social–contextual conditions that facilitate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motivation and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs—competence, autonomy, and relatedness—which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.","answer":"This is a psychology paper because it talks about self-motivation and healthy psychological developments in humans, which are ideas or concepts in the psychology domain.

The article should have an emotional tone that makes readers care about the discoveries made there. The article should be 600 words or less. Mention the original archaeologist who made the discovery, but don't dwell on it. The article should be focused on what the discoveries mean, not on who made them. ","answer":"A civilization known as Gobekli Tepe, which is located in modern-day Turkey, was built 6,000 years before Stonehenge. It is heralded as one of the first sites of man-made monumental architecture in the world. On top of a limestone plateau, a German archaeologist named Klaus Schmidt was the first to discover over 20 circular stone enclosures. The largest was almost 65 feet across, with two elaborately carved 18-foot pillars in the middle. The pillars have distinctive T-shapes and are reminiscent of the human form. Some of the pillars contain reliefs that depict items of clothing and wild animals. The nature of stone tools and other artifacts found at the site show that the monoliths were built by hunter-gatherers. At that time in history, creating these immense pillars would involve using wood and stone tools to shape the limestone, then creating some sort of pulley system using rope, log beams, and a lot of manpower.Originally, the apparent lack of residences led Schmidt to believe that the site was used solely for religious rituals, a place where nomadic bands would join together for periodic building projects and great feasts. This was a significant claim, given the time when the site was built. Remember, this was a transitional period in human history. Hunter-gathers, who had been living off the land for generations, were developing into societies that were beginning to grow their food intentionally and domesticate the animals around them. it had long been believed that rituals and religion were luxuries that developed only well after humans settled into these new societies. This discovery, however, showed that perhaps complex religion and social organization actually came before settlement and agriculture. Perhaps it was the very needs imposed by the religious rituals themselves - coming together to build the statues required large gatherings where people needed to be fed, thus the need to make food supplies more predictable by domesticating plants and animals -  that prompted the shift towards the Neolithic Revolution. However, in 2017, new discoveries changed the message of Gobekli Tepe. Work began to erect fabric-and-steel shelters to cover the central monumental buildings to make the site more comfortable for visiting tourists. As teams dug deeper into the bedrock than ever before, they made a shocking discovery. The digs revealed evidence of houses and year-round settlement, suggesting that instead of an isolated temple visited only on special occasions, Gobekli Tepe was a lively village with large, special buildings at the center. A rainwater collection system was also discovered, along with tools for grinding grain and even brewing beer. Since then, archaeologists working in the surrounding countryside have found at least a dozen other hilltop sites with similar pairs of T-shaped pillars, dating from around the same period. So what do these discoveries mean? Well, instead of the building project launching the transition to farming, perhaps Gobleki Tepe was an attempt by hunter-gatherers to cling to their way of life amidst a world that was changing around them. Evidence shows that settlements on other hills in the region were experimenting with domestication plants and animals, while the people of Gobleki Tepe appear to have been resisting the change. A sentimental reminder of a way of life that was quickly disappearing, Gobleki Tepe reminds us that humanity today is not really that different from humanity 11,000 years ago. We're all just trying to move forward, while at the same time, we can't quite let go of the past.

Manned and unmanned planetary explorations, beginning in the late 1960s, have furnished graphic evidence of past volcanism and its products on the Moon, Mars, Venus and other planetary bodies.MarsMany pounds of volcanic rocks were collected by astronauts during the various Apollo lunar landing missions. Only a small fraction of these samples have been subjected to exhaustive study by scientists. The bulk of the material is stored under controlled-environment conditions at NASA's Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston, Tex., for future study by scientists.From the 1976-1979 Viking mission, scientists have been able to study the volcanoes on Mars, and their studies are very revealing when compared with those of volcanoes on Earth. For example, Martian and Hawaiian volcanoes closely resemble each other in form. Both are shield volcanoes, have gently sloping flanks, large multiple collapse pits at their centers, and appear to be built of fluid lavas that have left numerous flow features on their flanks. The most obvious difference between the two is size. The Martian shields are enormous. They can grow to over 17 miles in height and more than 350 miles across, in contrast to a maximum height of about 6 miles and width of 74 miles for the Hawaiian shields.Voyager-2 spacecraft images taken of lo, a moon of Jupiter, captured volcanoes in the actual process of eruption. The volcanic plumes shown on the image rise some 60 to 100 miles above the surface of the moon. Thus, active volcanism is taking place, at present, on at least one planetary body in addition to our Earth.","answer":"Volcanic activity is not exclusive to Earth.

It should be less than 400 words.","answer":"It seems today there is debt and loans everywhere you look to the point where in the United States, it could actually hinder you if you have never had any. Not having had any debt will mean you have poor credit history and may make it difficult to get a mortgage or loan. With this reliance on debt, we must understand how to effectively pay off debt so it doesn't snowball and create a far bigger problem later on. This article will look at key ways to ensure your debt doesn't spiral and stays under control.First, you have to keep paying that minimum. Not paying that minimum will only ensure next month's minimum is even more significant, and so on and so forth. Not at least paying the minimum, you consign yourself to more debt as your interest grows with each passing month. The worst thing about this is you don't get anything in return. You literally have the pleasure of more debt for not paying the minimum payment last month. Credit card debt comes with high-interest rates, which means the money you saved in a low-yield savings account could be better used to pay off existing debt. For example, a debt of 100 with an interest rate of 23% annually. After a year, that balance would equate to 123. If you had 100 in a savings account offering just 5% (Unusually high), you would only gain 5. If these two scenarios ran parallel to each other, then you would be net negative 18. The better thing to do is pay off the debt and lose nothing. Too many people get engrossed by the balance, but the interest rate is essential. Interest compounds quickly. In some cases where two balances are in the same ballpark, it may be more beneficial to pay off the higher interest rate regardless of whether it is the larger balance. You can use many online calculators to work this out for you. You are going to war with your finances here. Have tactics and strategies to get the upper hand. Whether it's a payment schedule or an order of what debt you will pay down when having something to remind you of your plan. This will help you when you want to buy something new instead of reducing that debt. A strategy helps you stay on track.

If it passes the legislature, the bill would likely be vetoed by the Democratic governor and would need Democratic lawmakers' backing to override the veto.NORTH DAKOTA: North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum on Monday signed a bill that bans abortion with exceptions for cases where the mother's life or health are at serious risk. The law, which took immediate effect, also makes exceptions for rape and incest victims, but only during the first six weeks of pregnancy.The measure passed despite the state Supreme Court's decision last month not to revive a previous version of the near-total ban, after finding that the state constitution protects abortion rights in some cases.SOUTH CAROLINA:The Republican-led House of Representatives is considering a six-week abortion ban that the Senate has passed, despite the fact that the state Supreme Court recently struck down a six-week abortion ban in a 3-2 vote.The Senate tabled discussion of a near-total abortion ban on Thursday after it had been approved by the House. The chamber voted to delay considering the bill until the next legislative session in January 2024, after a two-day filibuster by the five women senators who felt it was too severe.TEXAS: While abortion is completely banned with very limited exceptions in Texas, Republican state representatives have introduced legislation that would compel internet providers to block websites that supply abortion pills or provide information on how to obtain an abortion.UTAH: Republican Governor Spencer Cox in March signed legislation to prohibit the licensing of abortion clinics, which abortion rights advocates say would effectively eliminate access in the state. Abortion is currently banned after 18 weeks in Utah.WYOMING: The Republican-led state legislature passed a bill in March banning the use or prescription of medication abortion pills, and Republican Governor Mark Gordon signed it into law. It is due to take effect July 1. Abortion is currently legal until viability, about 24 weeks, while a state court is reviewing a challenge to a near-total \\"trigger\\" ban, which was took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned.PROTECTIONSCALIFORNIA: A Democratic state senator has introduced a bill to protect doctors who prescribe medication abortion pills to patients in other states.MICHIGAN: Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation this month repealing a 1931 bill that criminalized abortion.ILLINOIS: Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker in January signed a law protecting abortion providers and out-of-state patients from legal attacks waged by other states.MINNESOTA: Democratic Governor Tim Walz in January signed legislation passed by the Minnesota legislature's new Democratic majority that codifies abortion rights in state law, as well as a right to contraception and fertility treatment. The Democratic-led House passed a bill to shield abortion providers and patients from other states' legal attacks, and the Senate is considering it.OHIO: Abortion rights supporters are trying to collect enough signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the November 2023 ballot that would assert a right to abortion.

However, there were many other inventors such as Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci who also developed a talking telegraph. The telephone’s basic concept is simple: It transmits sound from one point to another. The microphone, which transforms our voice into an electrical signal, is its core technology. This electrical signal is then transmitted via a network of wires and cables to the telephone receiver, which converts the signal back into sound waves.\\"","answer":"Once upon a time, a very clever man named Alexander Graham Bell made something we now know as the telephone. He was the first one to get a special paper called a patent, saying it was really and truly his idea! But, there were also other smart people like Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci who made a magical device that could send talking sounds over a long distance, just like a chatty telegraph.The telephone is actually a pretty simple thing: it's like a messenger that carries our voice from one place to another. The hero of this story is the microphone, a little part of the telephone that changes our words into a kind of electric language that the telephone understands. This electric language then races along a path of wires and cables until it reaches another telephone. There, it changes back into our voice, so the person on the other end can hear us.

Simply put, laser welding devices heat and melt the target material using a laser beam rather than an electrical arc, plasma arc, or gas flame. Laser welders may employ carbon dioxide lasers, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet lasers, fiber lasers, or disk lasers. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages, but they’re all more precise than non-laser types of welders. The fine focus of a laser beam means the pool of melted material generated by the device can be carefully controlled in terms of width, depth, and temperature. That precision also matches well with computer control mechanisms which themselves are more precise than human operators. Taken together, all these advantages make laser welders perfect for high-precision projects on items like circuit boards, jet engines, medical implants, jewelry, and more.As an added bonus, many laser welding devices can create welds in certain ceramic materials and plastics. They’ve also proven capable of welding dissimilar metals to one another. None of these things are possible with traditional welding methods.No technology is perfect, though. Laser welding devices are more expensive than other welders with comparable power outputs. They also demand trained staff who are harder to come by than traditional welding experts. In most cases, the parts themselves need to be carefully prepared; laser welders are less forgiving of imperfect edges than other welding styles. Finally, they are actually more hazardous to eyesight than other welding devices; specialty eye protection is a must when a laser welder is operating."},{"question":"Give me five potential first lines for a romance novel.

He had been transcribing an old Latin text into English for the better part of the day. His eyes were tired, and his back ached. It was getting dark outside; he decided to cease his efforts for the night and begin anew in the morning. Tobias shuffled out of his small writing room and into the church kitchen. He had been a monk with this church for nearly 40 years but had somehow not grown tired of the limited food available to him. He poured himself a bowl of stew, tore off a chunk of bread, and began to eat. The church doors were closed for the night; Tobias planned on eating quickly and going to bed. Halfway through his meal, he heard a great pounding at the church door from the outside. He rushed to the main hall and heard a desperate voice call out, \\"Sanctuary, sanctuary!\\" Tobias threw open the door and looked upon a thin, ragged man with tired, sunken eyes. It was typical for churches to offer sanctuary to any who asked for it, even criminals. The years had made Tobias quite cynical, for he had witnessed many individuals claim sanctuary only to attempt to rob the church once inside. Tobias stood in the doorway and asked in a commanding voice why the man needed cover. The man said that he had stolen food to feed his family. He said his family had lost their mother and his wife a week past, and it had been a struggle to bring home enough food to feed his children. That night, he had resorted to stealing bread from a local tavern. The man explained this quickly, his eyes frequently darting over his shoulder as if to look for pursuers. Tobias felt quite stern; he did not typically have much compassion for thieves, given his history with them. But he looked closer into the man's eyes and saw the truth in what he had said. Tobias opened his arms and welcomed the man into the church just as four town guardsmen appeared. They saw the man and pointed, rushing towards the church door. Tobias barred the way, stating that the man was under the protection of sanctuary provided by the church. The guardsmen looked at each. Sanctuary was widely respected in the town, and guards had no recourse. Slowly, they gave up and left."},{"question":"Rewrite this text to form a scathing review of Montana's decision.Republican Gov.

The bat signal shone brightly in the sky even still. He had talked to the police commissioner already but they kept the light on as a warning to criminals: Batman was here. But in reality, petty criminals had nothing to fear tonight; he was busy with a more important target. The Joker was holed up in an apartment building with a number of hostages. He had supposedly rigged the building with his signature laughing gas. They'd gotten as many civilians out as possible, but there were still far too many at risk.Batman looked down at the building, planning his attack. The Joker would be on one of the top floors so that he could escape via the roof if needed. But Batman didn't plan to give him the chance. He pulled out his bat drone. \\"Scan the building, find the Joker,\\" he said, releasing the drone into the air. It flew around the building, capturing infrared imaging of each floor. \\"There, the top floor.

The fourth must be the Joker, the hostages providing him extra protection.Batman crept toward the edge of the building and fired his zipline gun across.

He aimed carefully, ducked his head to protect his eyes, and smashed through the window. He rolled to his feet and quickly fired a Batarang, pinning the Joker's shirt to the wall behind him.\\"Well, it's about time, Bats.

It should be 300 words or less.","answer":"William Kidd was a British privateer from Scotland who established himself as a sea captain before settling in New York in 1690. He brought property there and married, and from time to time he was commissioned by New York and other colonies to rid the coast of enemy privateers. In 1695 the governor of New York asked him to defend English ships from pirates in the Red Sea. In 1696 Kidd assembled men for the mission and set sail for the Indian Ocean. The men had little success until early 1968 when they captured the Quedagh Merchant, which was an Indian vessel allegedly sailing under a French pass and loaded with silk, gold, jewels, and guns. The capture of the ship sparked controversy in Britain because the ship had an English captain. Kidd next sailed to St. Mary's, Madagascar, which was an infamous pirate haven and added to the suspicion that he had turned to piracy. He then went on to the West Indies, where he learned about the charges against him. He next sailed back to New York and delivered himself to the authorities in an effort to clear his name by stating that the vessels he had attacked were lawful prizes. He was not met with understanding and was instead arrested and sent to London. In 1701 he was tried on charges of piracy and murdering a crewman. Politicians in Britain wanted to use the opportunity to embarrass the American colonists who had supported Kidd, and in turn, they gave Kidd up as a scapegoat instead of confirming his claims to legitimacy. As a result, Kidd was convicted on all charges and executed by hanging on May 23, 1701.

Two days later, the Taiwan-based hardware maker has finally answered the calls for help. The mass outage, the company said, was the result of “an error in the configuration of our server settings file.” After fixing the glitch, most users needed to only reboot their devices. In the event that didn’t fix the problem, the company’s support team advised users to save their current configuration settings and perform a factory reset. The company also apologized.It was a frustrating two days for many users as they attempted to troubleshoot the outage. Asus’ silence during that time only added to the frustration. “This is a bunch of BS. Why doesn't Asus put out some kind of statement explaining what's going on?” one user complained. Asus still hasn’t provided details about the configuration error. Various users have offered explanations online that appear to be correct. “On the 16th, Asus pushed a corrupted definition file for ASD, a built-in security daemon present in a wide range of their routers,” one person wrote. “As routers automatically updated and fetched the corrupted definition file, they started running out of filesystem space and memory and crashing.”The explanation answered the question of what was causing routers to crash, but it raised a new one: Why were routers affected even when they had been configured to not automatically update and no manual update had been performed? Asus has yet to address this, but the likely answer is that the definitions file for ASD, which resides in memory and scans devices for security threats, gets updated whether or not automatic updates are enabled. The long and short of things is that the 48-hour mystery surrounding the malfunctioning Asus routers has now been solved and a fix is in place. We now return you to your normally scheduled Internet usage.\\"","answer":"This article discusses how a recent update that was released by Asus for its routers resulted in a 48-hour outage for a number of its customers.

Give me some suggestions for what to include.","answer":"There are many things to include in a seminar about weight loss. As weight loss usually focuses on improving a person's health, the topics to include can include a range of different diets as well as general healthy living guidelines.1. Start with an introduction about what the human body needs to be healthy. This can include a presentation on macronutrients and micronutrients and what foods to eat to get enough of both.2. Continue with the introduction of healthy eating habits to incorporate into daily life to maintain a healthy weight, such as introducing a lot of variety, regular meals, drinking water, and eating only until feeling full.3. Next, you can focus on listing a number of healthy weight-loss options. These can include well-known diets that people have likely heard of before, such as intermittent fasting, paleo, the blood group diet, and similar.4. You can then narrow your focus to discuss weight loss for specific groups with certain medical issues, such as gluten-free diets, dairy-free diets, the keto diet, and different options for food substitutes when dealing with allergies.5. In the end, it's a good idea to focus on physical exercise to help with weight loss. It's worth mentioning starting with low-intensity training such as walking or speed walking and gradually increasing the intensity to jogging, running, and programs such as Zumba or Aqua Gym.You may want to consider establishing a support group for people to help each other achieve goals after the seminar as well. Encourage the participants to exchange contact details and stay in touch because support is an important part of every weight loss journey."},{"question":"I am looking for ideas for a subject for an email to send my resignation letter.","answer":"Certainly!

Where they used to be primarily good for rough prototyping and novelty hobbies, 3D printers can now create industrial-grade items with very favorable properties. Though many 3D printers are only equipped to create small plastic objects, some of the more advanced devices can generate large metal or composite-material components that are strong enough to withstand the rigors of flight. The most common styles of printers for the industry are selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and stereolithography (SLA) devices. The SLS style is particularly important since it can build up objects from metal powder. A new metal-capable style called Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is also growing in popularity for both the construction and repair of metal parts.3D printers create parts by adding material a little bit at a time. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, by contrast, start with a larger structure of raw material and remove portions until the final part has the right shape and configuration. This makes subtractive manufacturing wasteful by nature. An efficient 3D printer will waste significantly less raw material. That’s good for both the environment and the manufacturer’s budget. But the aspect that’s most valuable in aerospace is the technology’s ability to minimize weight. A 3D printer only needs to print the minimum amount of material to maintain structural integrity. Sometimes that’s difficult or even impossible for traditional methods to achieve. Printers can build hollow (and thus lightweight) structures without needing to join multiple pieces together. Since they can print complex shapes, they can also be used to replace many parts with just one. This eliminates many fasteners from the design, further reducing weight and complexity. And since machine failures often start from corners or part joints, this also means the structure has fewer weak points.There are a number of other, more subtle or subjective benefits as well. Suffice it to say, the aerospace industry has largely embraced this expanding technology. Some companies like Relativity Space even create high-performance rocket engines almost entirely via 3D printing."},{"question":"how many vertebrae are in the human body?","answer":"There are 33 vertebrae in the human body.

Present each characteristic on a separate line and in alphabetical order.Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. Cleveland is the only president in U.S. history to serve two non-consecutive presidential terms.[b] He won the popular vote in three presidential elections—1884, 1888, and 1892—though Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency in 1888. Cleveland was one of two Democrats elected president (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 to 1933.In 1881, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo, and in 1882, he was elected governor of New York. He was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.[1] Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[2] He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer, his prestige led many like-minded Republicans, called \\"Mugwumps\\", to bolt from the Republican Party's presidential ticket and swing their support to Cleveland during the 1884 election. Fifteen months into his first presidential term, he married Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886.[3] As his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[4]Cleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[5] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term.[5] Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \\"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\\"[6] By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.[7] Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, and has been praised for honesty, integrity, adherence to his morals, defying party boundaries, and effective leadership.Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (née Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland.[8] Cleveland's father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut.[9] His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller.[10] On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England, in 1635.[11] His father's maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey. On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia.[12] Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.[13]Cleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.[14] In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville, New York, where Grover spent much of his childhood.[15] Neighbors later described him as \\"full of fun and inclined to play pranks\\",[16] and fond of outdoor sports.[17]In 1850, Cleveland's father Richard moved his family to Clinton, New York, accepting a job there as district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society.[18] Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, his income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school and place him in a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.[19] In 1853, missionary work began to take a toll on Richard's health. He took a new work assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica), and moved his family once again.[20] Shortly after, Richard Cleveland died from a gastric ulcer. Grover was said to have learned about his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.[20]","answer":"Commitment to the principles of classical liberalismHonesty Integrity Self-reliance"},{"question":"Write a short story about an elephant who travels across the savannah to find his family.

It is believed by them that if you do, you may come upon hard times, invite ghosts, develop insomnia, or even become spiritually blind. According to legend, you can reverse the curse of opening an umbrella indoors either by replacing the umbrella or by speaking positive affirmations inside the home where it was opened.

On this day, you should open an umbrella inside and write down any negative things that happen over the next several days.

It is rarely fatal but chocolate ingestion can cause significant illness in dogs. Chocolate is toxic because it contains caffeine as well as a chemical called theobromine, which is used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and smooth muscle relaxant. As dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine the way that people can, they are more sensitive to the chemicals’ effects."},{"question":"Write an email to my mom asking her if she has started planning my sister Dianna's surprise party yet.

Take Breaks: If you go home from work and keep working, you'll find that you burn out fast. Make sure to take some relaxing breaks where you do nothing sometimes.5. Outsource Tasks: If you're having trouble finding the space to relax at home, then consider outsourcing some tasks. Hire a house cleaner or dog walker so you can take the time you need to recharge.6.

Here are some effective strategies for managing workplace stress considering the well-being of employees and overall productivity.1. Prioritize Workplace Wellness    Workplace stress can significantly impact the well-being and productivity of employees. Encourage healthy living and exercise by providing opportunities for employees to take a break and     engage in physical activity. Consider subsidizing gym memberships or bringing a yoga instructor into the office. You can also hold a steps contest among teams for those who own fitness     trackers and offer healthy snacks in the office. Such initiatives show that you care about your employees' health and well-being.2. Revamp the Work Environment   The physical environment of the workplace can significantly contribute to employee stress levels. Make changes that increase employee enjoyment, such as updating the office with an upbeat    color scheme, additional plants, or new silverware. If space permits, consider adding a ping pong or foosball table. Such changes can help employees take their minds off work-related stress for     a few minutes.3. Allow for Flexible Hours and Remote Working   Offering flexibility in working hours and remote working options can be an effective strategy to reduce workplace stress. Employees with control over their work schedules can better    manage their workload and balance work and personal responsibilities. This approach also shows that you trust your employees to deliver high-quality work regardless of location.

Those bandages became the inspiration behind the first disposable pads. This advance, interestingly, coincided with another key historical development—the fight for women’s suffrage. The year 1920 marked a profound advance on both fronts: the debut of the Kotex brand and the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Tampons with cardboard applicators and menstrual cups arrived just over a decade later. While internal protection wasn’t a particularly new idea—over the centuries, women spanning the globe have used a wide variety of materials including lint, flax, cotton, paper, wool, plants, grass or essentially anything absorbent—it still sparked concerns among those who feared it sexual in nature. As women entered the workforce in greater numbers during World War II, though, practicality won the day.With the advent of disposable pads and tampons, in particular, public messaging about menstruation was channeled almost exclusively through marketing and advertising campaigns. Discretion was the rule: Packaging was plain and nondescript; separate payment tins on store counters ensured no words or sideways glances would be exchanged.","answer":"(Verse 1)Back in the early 1900s, a story unfolds,Wartime nurses found a way to break the molds.Cellulose bandages soaked up blood with might,And that's where the journey began, shining so bright.(Chorus)Inspired by war, they created something new,Disposable pads, helping women through.In 1920, a revolution took place,Kotex brand debuted, suffrage brought grace.(Verse 2)A decade passed, and along came more,Tampons and cups knocking on the door.Women used various things over time,Lint, cotton, even plants, absorbency so prime.(Chorus)Some feared it was too intimate, a taboo,But practicality prevailed, and the doubts withdrew.World War II brought women to the fore,Workforce numbers rising, like never before.(Bridge)Disposable pads and tampons took the stage,Marketing and ads became all the rage.Quiet packaging and payment tins discrete,No words or glances, just privacy sweet.(Chorus)The messages were spread, through campaigns bold,About menstruation, a story to be told.Marketing with discretion, their rule of thumb,No one should feel uncomfortable or overcome.(Verse 3)These products became a part of our lives,Through marketing efforts, they started to thrive.Plain packages, no need for shame or strife,Menstruation's a natural part of life.(Chorus)Times have changed, but the journey remains,From those early days, progress still gains.Menstruation's embraced, with dignity and grace,A country moving forward, in every single place."},{"question":"Who was the first woman to win gold in eventing at the Olympics?","answer":"Julia Krajewski, representing Germany, became the first woman to win an individual gold medal in eventing.

She’d also have to be able to do it in the span of a day, and it’d have to be something available in most major cities (I don’t want to have to travel).","answer":"Definitely! Here are some options for you to consider:•\\tBowling: One of the most common activities for groups of teenagers is a trip to the bowling alley. Common in most cities, this offers cheap group fun for all ages. This would also offer an easy opportunity for cake, ice cream, and gifts.•\\tArcade: Large arcades are often great places for teenagers of all interests to get together and have fun. Many, such as the national chain “Main Event,” also offer activities such as mini-golf and laser tag, and they sell packages specifically for the purposes of birthday parties.•\\tSpa Day: There’s nothing the stereotypical teenage girl likes more than the spa. Offering an all-expense-paid free spa day for her and her friends is an easy way. You could also purchase all the materials for facials, manicures, pedicures, and the like and allow them to give themselves a spa day.More important than anything, make sure that you take into account your sister’s interests.

I expected them to be smaller and more slender, but they were not.Once I had shaken his hand and sat down, I recalled my father's hands: rough and weathered from a life subjected to the elements. I'll never forget the harsh, albeit comforting, feel of his oversized cracked hand clutching my small hand as he walked me to school on my first day.Many years later came Larry's tanned hands with the long fingers. In the beginning, I loved to watch them as they tripped along the piano keys. But when they turned cruel, squeezed my throat, and tried to strangle me, I began to hate them with a passion.Next, there was Peter, the man who longed to be a chef, only to find he was let down by the allergy his hands had developed to certain foods. Scabby and covered with eczema, these hands seeking me out became my biggest fear.As I watched Justin walk away from the podium at the Surgical Conference, where he had delivered his lecture on the removal of cancer, I continued to marvel at the softness of his huge hands.

Birds of prey are known to display patterns of sexual dimorphism. It is commonly believed that the dimorphisms found in raptors occur due to sexual selection or environmental factors. In general, hypotheses in favor of ecological factors being the cause of sexual dimorphism in raptors are rejected. This is because the ecological model is less parsimonious, meaning that its explanation is more complex than that of the sexual selection model. Additionally, ecological models are much harder to test because a great deal of data is required. Dimorphisms can also be the product of intrasexual selection between males and females. It appears that both sexes of the species play a role in the sexual dimorphism within raptors; females tend to compete with other females to find good places to nest and attract males, and males compete with other males for adequate hunting grounds so they appear as the most healthy mate. It has also been proposed that sexual dimorphism is merely the product of disruptive selection, and is merely a stepping stone in the process of speciation, especially if the traits that define gender are independent across a species. In non-predatory birds, males are typically larger than females. However, in birds of prey, the opposite is the case.","answer":"This passage talks about how birds of prey generally display signs of sexual dimorphism which is when one sex of a species is larger or smaller than the other.

While attending Marquette Academy, he and classmate Pat O'Brien quit school to enlist in the Navy at the start of World War I. Tracy was still at Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia at the end of the war. After playing the lead in the play \\"The Truth\\" at Ripon College he decided that acting might be his career.Moving to New York, Tracy and O'Brien, who'd also settled on a career on the stage, roomed together while attending the Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1923 both got nonspeaking parts as robots in \\"R.U.R.\\", a dramatization of the groundbreaking science fiction novel by Czech author Karel Capek. Making very little money in stock, Tracy supported himself with jobs as bellhop, janitor and salesman until John Ford saw his critically acclaimed performance in the lead role in the play \\"The Last Mile\\" (later played on film by Clark Gable) and signed him for The William Fox Film Company's production of Up the River (1930). Despite appearing in sixteen films at that studio over the next five years, Tracy was never able to rise to full film star status there, in large part because the studio was unable to match his talents to suitable story material.During that period the studio itself floundered, eventually merging with Darryl F. Zanuck, Joseph Schenck and William Goetz's William 20th Century Pictures to become 20th Century-Fox). In 1935 Tracy signed with MGM under the aegis of Irving Thalberg and his career flourished. He became the first actor to win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars for Captains Courageous (1937) and, in a project he initially didn't want to star in, Boys Town (1938).During Tracy's nearly forty-year film career, he was nominated for his performances in San Francisco (1936), Father of the Bride (1950), Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), The Old Man and the Sea (1958), Inherit the Wind (1960), Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967).Tracy had a brief romantic relationship with Loretta Young in the mid-1930s, and a lifelong one with Katharine Hepburn beginning in 1942 after they were first paired in Woman of the Year by director George Stevens. Tracy's strong Roman Catholic beliefs precluded his divorcing wife Louise, though they mostly lived apart. Tracy suffered from severe alcoholism and diabetes (from the late 1940s), which led to his declining several tailor-made roles in films that would become big hits with other actors in those roles. Although his drinking problems were well known, he was considered peerless among his colleagues (Tracy had a well-deserved reputation for keeping co-stars on their toes for his oddly endearing scene-stealing tricks), and remained in demand as a senior statesman who nevertheless retained box office clout. Two weeks after completion of Stanley Kramer's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), during which he suffered from lung congestion, Spencer Tracy died of a heart attack.","answer":"Spencer Tracy was born on April 5, 1900 While attending Ripon College, he played a role in \\"The Truth\\" and decided on an acting career.

It wasn't the most comfortable way to walk, but it paid to be cautious in these times. Monstrous creatures were lurking in the dark, humans being the worst of them. From an early age, his father had taught him how to hunt with a bow. It was rare that he'd needed to use it for self-defense, but it was preferable to other methods.Swords were efficient, but a human's strength matched against an elf, goblin, orc, troll, or even group of bandits rendered the sword a little more than a pointy metal stick that would purchase a few more seconds of life. No, a bow was better for eliminating targets before they posed a threat. It was a windy October when the biting wind had set in and Terrin was traveling from one town to the next. From above a rocky outcrop, three trolls appeared, brandishing clubs with metal spikes at him.Terrin whipped his bow from over his shoulder without hesitation, taking but a moment to check the wind, and loosed an arrow. It struck the first troll square in the chest, dropping him instantly. The second began bobbing and weaving, causing Terrin's second arrow to miss the mark slightly. Still, it lodged in the troll's shoulder, which caused him to double over. He turned his attention to the third troll, who was bearing down on him, making long strides. The archer was quick on his feet and kicked up dust into the troll's face, causing him to stagger and miss his swings. Terrin finished him off with an arrow from behind.He had just enough time to turn around and put an arrow in the second troll, who was trying to sneak up behind him.

Because of his awful deeds, he ends up getting cursed into an animal.","answer":"Once there was a circus ringleader who treated his performers badly, but he treated the animals even worse. When a show didn't go exactly as expected, he yelled at the clowns, emotionally berated the acrobats, and spewed horrible names at the circus sideshow entertainers. Everyone was afraid of him, but they were even more afraid of leaving because he threatened them with horrible torture if anyone took off. He was truly a vile person, but the animals got the worst treatment. He starved them, chained them in tiny cages, and beat them daily to keep them submissive and afraid. Even the lions and tigers cowered when he approached. While he was putting on a show, spectators thought he was a great ringleader, and they really enjoyed the circus acts, but they didn't see what happened when the lights went out and the crowds dispersed. One day, an older, mysterious woman stayed behind. She saw beyond the forced smiling faces and saw how all the animals cowered in fear when he was around or when they heard his booming voice. She knew there was something wrong with this circus, and she aimed to find out what it was. As she quietly snuck around the tents, she heard the ringleader screaming at his employees. Her suspicions were founded, and she continued to watch and listen. When she saw him kick a skinny, starved dog chained outside his tent, she knew she had to take action. She wasn't going to report him to authorities, though; she had another plan. She knew dark magic. The way to teach this horrible man a lesson is to turn him into what he despises the most. The old woman waited until he went to bed, then she started her chant. She watched as a dark mist entered his tent. It glowed briefly to let her know the magic was successful. When the ringleader woke up the next morning, he found he was chained to a post outside. He was cold, tired, and hungry, and when he tried to speak, there were no words.

What are the most important things to consider?","answer":"No problem, freelancers have different financial considerations compared to those that work for an employer. Here are the most important ones:1. Determine your rate. This includes calculating your expenses, creating a work schedule, and establishing a baseline income you're willing to have. 2. Decide if you are a sole proprietorship or limited liability company. This will make a big difference in how your freelance business runs and how you pay taxes. 3. Calculate expenses. This involves creating a budget, calculating fixed and variable expenses, working out quarterly estimated taxes, deciding on a savings plan, and buying insurance policies. 4. Navigate debt. If you are coming into freelancing with debt, develop a plan to pay it off, especially if it is high-interest debt like credit card debt. 5. Understand and pay taxes. There are different forms for freelancers to fill out when filing their taxes. It's important to understand the forms involved and deductions you can make to save the most money possible on your taxes and avoid penalties. If your taxes ever get too complicated, there is always the option to hire a qualified accountant. 6. Save for retirement. Saving for the future can be more difficult for freelancers since it is not automatically taken out of a paycheck like in the case of salaried employees.

While many countries have implemented regulations to govern content moderation, the United States has relied on platforms' self-regulation. However, the real-world consequences of unregulated social media demand a more robust approach.Instances such as attacks on ethnic minorities in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, fueled by misinformation on Facebook, highlight the need for stricter content moderation. Similarly, false claims about the 2020 presidential election and Covid-19 vaccines circulating on social media platforms have had significant offline consequences, including the Capitol insurrection and increased anti-Asian harassment.While social media companies have taken voluntary actions to address these issues, their efforts could be more consistent and effective. Government regulation is necessary to ensure consistent and compelling content moderation. However, striking a balance between protecting freedom of expression and curbing harmful content poses challenges. Determining what constitutes unacceptable speech without infringing on free expression and defining who should be responsible for content moderation are complex tasks.Social media platforms differ from traditional media companies as they primarily host user-generated content and have limited editorial oversight. The US Communications Decency Act, particularly Section 230, shields social media companies from liability for user-generated content. However, removing these protections could hinder innovation and discourage content moderation.Collaboration between lawmakers, social media companies, and experts is essential. Federal courts can establish exceptions to Section 230 to guide content moderation. Lawmakers could also set transparency standards and digital privacy requirements for platforms to maintain protection. Adapting our laws to the digital age will foster a safer online environment while balancing freedom of expression and the public interest.Stricter regulations are needed to address the risks associated with unregulated social media platforms. We can mitigate the harmful effects of misinformation and hate speech by ensuring stronger content moderation, protecting user privacy, and fostering a safer digital environment. Collaborative efforts are required to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the need for responsible online spaces."},{"question":"I love reading, but I have a hard time retaining what I read, especially nonfiction books. Can you give me several techniques to try in 175 words or less?","answer":"1. Read with a reason. Why did you choose the book you have? Chances are, it was relevant and meaningful to you. Don't just read something for the sake of reading or because someone said you should.2. Write in the margins. Write your thoughts as they happen to make them more memorable and significant. Writing down your thoughts helps commit them to memory.3. Take a rest. Put your book away for a couple of weeks after completion and let your mind mull over the content.4. Consider how you're paying attention. When you read, focus only on reading. Don't let distractions get in the way. Put your phone in another room and sit somewhere comfortable and quiet so you can pay better attention to the page in front of you.5. Schedule around your reading time.

They will provide the service with a much more modern command and control capability. The E-3 is based on the Boeing 707, a four-engine jet designed in the 1950s. And though its radar and computers have received occasional upgrades since the AWACS' introduction in the 1970s, it's still very old technology. The E-3's radar rotates once every ten seconds, so it cannot provide updates about an opponent's position faster than that. Since aerial warfare is so fast-paced, that can be a long time to wait. The E-7 is a modified Boeing 737. It's smaller and far more efficient than the 707. More critically, though, the E-7's radar and computer equipment meets modern standards that the E-3's legacy equipment never could. Instead of rotating, the E-7's bar-shaped radar steers its beam electronically. If necessary, the radar can focus energy on specific targets in order to maintain real-time, high-fidelity tracking on them. The E-7 already operates with the Australian, South Korean, and Turkish air forces.

Not in any sense of the word. But that was about to change this Saturday afternoon as she stared down the barrel of a bushel of bananas. The bananas had been sitting on her counter for over a week at this point, turning shades of green, then to yellow, and finally growing brown spots and looking a little limp. The perfect bananas to bake bread with.She had always aspired to be a baker but never had the time with her demanding career. But today was the day that would change. Tina shut off her phone and directed her attention solely to what was in front of her.  Flour, sugar, eggs, bananas of course, and all the fixings for a proper banana bread. She was feeling very much connected to her country roots just looking down at the bounty. Her mom was always the master baker in the family, and Tina was sorely hoping that skill did not completely skip a generation.Consulting her recipe, Tina mashed up the bananas as best as she could. Some were quite soft, and others a bit hard, but none held up to the pressure beneath her mighty fork. She furrowed a brow, cracked an egg, and then tossed it into the bowl along with the whole butter stick and an egg. The recipe called for sugar but she only had the brown kind on hand. Oh well, that'd have to do. Into the bowl that went. Then the salt but lacking any measuring device she eyeballed it with her fingertips.  Another dash of this and that, and she was done.The concoction looked almost right, a bit gloopy but not runny. But Tina wanted to make it better. In the pantry, she found chocolate morsels, some cashews, and even some shredded coconut.  Into the mix, she tossed it all making sure to stir the batter a bit to incorporate the new flavors before spooning it into a loaf pan and then into the oven.An hour later, she heard the oven beep and opened the door to see her creation. Hit with the sweetest of smells; her eyes were less happy. The top was dark brown and the edges were nearly black. But more than that, it was sunken in like a volcano.

I have a date tomorrow night and I need to look and feel my best. How should I prepare for the date? Please give me a list of 9 things I can do to get ready for my date.","answer":"Sounds exciting! I'd be happy to help you get prepared for your date:1. Take a shower - Make sure you take a bath or shower before you go on your date. Don't go on a date immediately after work without getting clean and refreshed, as you may be carrying around sweat and grime from your job.2. Get a haircut - Get unkempt hair under control. Cut your hair so it looks presentable, or if you elect to keep your hair long, at least put it in a ponytail or bun so it doesn't overhang your ears or get into your food when you're eating.3. Groom your facial hair - If you have a beard or mustache, shave it off. If your date wants to get closer to you, you don't want your facial hair poking them or giving them a rash when you both get physically close and intimate. Or, if you insist on keeping your facial hair, at the very least, you should trim and groom it so it doesn't look scraggly.4. Use fragrances (but don't overdo it!) - cologne or deodorant is always a plus...put some on before your date so you smell extra good. But don't overdo it, because an overwhelming smell of cologne can be too pungent for your date's nose and can put them off completely.5. Dress to impress - Unless the occasion warrants it, don't come to a date with a t-shirt, surf shorts, and slippers/flip-flops. Dress nicely; this means wearing something that would be used on a date, like slacks or dress pants (or jeans), a button-up shirt or polo shirt, and closed-toe shoes.6. Have transportation - If you don't have a mode of transportation, you can always get an Uber or taxi to take you to the location of the date. But try to secure some mode of transportation so you can easily travel to and from the date, or even take your date home when it's all over. For example, a bicycle would not be a good choice of transportation for two people.7. Pick a nice place - Consider going on a date to a place that is fun and where both of you will enjoy being there, such as on a walk on the beach, to a nice restaurant or coffee shop, or to a movie at the theater. Places that are hectic or frenetic can be offputting to your date and can make conversation and getting to know them better near impossible (e.g. loud concerts, live fighting events, etc.)8. Be polite - Be nice to your date; be a gentleman and mind your manners. Avoid using foul or abrasive language, be complimentary to your date, and show interest in the other person rather than focusing your conversation on yourself (unless your date asks you questions about yourself).9. Refrain from using your phone - In this day and age of increased cell phone use, one of the best ways to show you are disinterested in your date is to use your phone while you are in their presence. Put the phone down, make eye contact with your date, and don't check calls or emails without at least asking permission from your date before doing so. Even then, try to keep the phone checking short and screen your calls so you aren't talking on the phone unless it is an emergency."},{"question":"Write a haiku about the death of a pet","answer":"Your death left a scar Across the rainbow bridge, youWill go to heaven "},{"question":"I'm planning a trip to Kenya.

She was born a little over a year ago. Her mother hears but would like to continue doing whatever is absorbing her thoughts and attention at the time. Jennifer thinks that her plan is not working. She decides that she will have to raise the volume of her vocalizations. Her mother must not realize what she wants. She will have to try harder. Jennifer is now calling out in a more distressed and urgent manner. Her mother shuts the door to her bedroom so she will not be distracted by the increased noise. This upsets Jennifer.

What were the three Korean states in the first half of the first millennium?2. In which time period did Sejong the Great make the Korean alphabet?During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between three states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In the second half of the 1st millennium, Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the \\"Unified Silla\\" period. Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo. Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war, ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms. Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo.

But Hubble's about far more than just pretty pictures. The mission has gathered dozens of terabytes of data over the decades, providing key insights into the universe, from objects as close as the moon to the most remote galaxies, with observations of supernovas and nebulas in between. Here we explore the history of the telescope and its many discoveries, provide interesting Hubble facts and link to some of the orbiting observatory's best images. When Galileo Galilei first turned a spyglass to the heavens in 1610, he had trouble making out the rings of Saturn that are visible in inexpensive telescopes today. Advances in optics eventually improved scientists' views of the planets, stars and distant galaxies, but Earth's atmosphere still blocked or distorted much of the light for observers on the ground. Larger telescopes were, and still are, placed atop mountains, where the thinner atmosphere at higher elevations allows clearer pictures.In 1946, soon after World War II, astronomer Lyman Spitzer proposed launching a space telescope, which could overcome the limitations of ground-based observatories. It took a couple more decades before the idea garnered enough support for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to organize a committee of scientists to evaluate the potential of a \\"Large Space Telescope.\\" With Spitzer at the helm, the committee published a document in 1969 that outlined the scientific uses of a Large Space Telescope and advocated for its construction, according to a Hubble history written by Gabriel Olkoski for NASA. The National Academy of Sciences took the pitch to NASA — the only agency capable of making the Large Space Telescope a reality. NASA was already considering a space telescope of some type, but the agency was undecided about how big to make it and where to start. In 1971, George Low, the agency's acting administrator at the time, greenlit the Large Space Telescope Science Steering Group, and NASA soon began lobbying Congress for funding for the endeavor. The expensive project was a tough sell, and funding was initially denied by the House Appropriations Subcommittee in 1975. NASA then upped its lobbying efforts and got buy-in from European Space Agency, which shared the costs. Congress eventually granted funding for NASA's portion of the Large Space Telescope in 1977.  Development began almost immediately. NASA planned to launch the telescope in 1983, but various production delays pushed the launch date back to 1986. In the meantime, the Large Space Telescope was renamed Hubble in honor of Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer who, among other things, determined that the universe extended beyond the borders of the Milky Way. Hubble's planned liftoff was delayed again after the space shuttle Challenger exploded a minute after takeoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was more than 2.5 years before shuttle flights resumed and NASA could begin planning Hubble's launch again.  Hubble finally launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990 and a day later was deployed into low Earth orbit, about 340 miles (545 kilometers) above our planet. Getting Hubble developed and launched cost 1.5 billion, but there would be ongoing costs as well — both expected and unexpected.","answer":"Once upon a time, in the year 1990, a marvel of technology named the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) embarked on an unprecedented journey into the cosmos. Its primary mission was not just to click eye-catching images of the universe, but also to unravel the mysteries of celestial bodies ranging from our nearest satellite, the moon, to the farthest galaxies.This tale, however, started long before Hubble's epic space odyssey, when Galileo Galilei aimed a simple spyglass at the stars in 1610. Despite the blurry images and the immense difficulty in discerning Saturn's rings, it laid the groundwork for future explorations.After World War II, an astronomer named Lyman Spitzer dreamed about a telescope free from the clutches of atmospheric distortion. But it wasn't until the late 1960s that his idea gained traction. Led by Spitzer, a group of distinguished scientists compiled a document underlining the scientific potential of a Large Space Telescope.The proposal caught the attention of NASA, the only organization capable of realizing such an ambitious project. Even though they were already considering a space telescope, they needed guidance on its size and the starting point. Following an endorsement from George Low, the acting administrator at that time, the Large Space Telescope project received an official nod.However, convincing the House Appropriations Subcommittee to fund this costly endeavor wasn't easy, and they initially turned down the request in 1975. Not deterred, NASA redoubled its efforts and enlisted the European Space Agency to share the burden of cost. Their persistence paid off when they secured funding from Congress in 1977.With the green light shining brightly, NASA jumped into action, planning to launch the telescope in 1983. But a series of delays postponed the launch date until 1986. Meanwhile, the Large Space Telescope was christened \\"Hubble,\\" in tribute to Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer who confirmed the universe's expansiveness beyond the Milky Way.An unfortunate incident, the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, which resulted in the loss of seven astronauts, further delayed Hubble's launch. It took more than two years for NASA to recover and resume planning for Hubble's journey.Finally, on April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into low Earth orbit by the space shuttle Discovery, where it now resides 340 miles above the Earth. Despite costing 1.5 billion to develop and launch, the astronomical payoff of Hubble's invaluable scientific contributions has been worth every cent."},{"question":"Write a haiku about strawberries ripe for the picking.","answer":"Beautiful red flushPlump, I sit upon the vineEat at your leisure"},{"question":"When was air conditioning invented?","answer":"Woah man, cool question, haha.

The premise of the film is that a mosquito, filled with the DNA of dinosaurs, has been preserved in amber for millions of years and provides a genetic blueprint for recreating extinct creatures. It is true that mosquitos and biting flies from the time of the dinosaurs are preserved in amber. However, the science is flawed because although amber preserves things, it preserves the husk and not the soft tissues.

Use an objective tone and offer both benefits and challenges when using assessments with students in the earliest grades.","answer":"Administering standardized assessments to primary students has been a subject of some debate for decades. Primary students are those students in pre-kindergarten through second grade. The administration of the assessment proves challenging because the reading levels of children vary to such a large degree. Many children are not yet independent readers at this point. Additionally, because of the variability of reading levels, the results of the assessments can cause educators and parents to draw inaccurate and incomplete conclusions about a child's academic potential. Assessments can be administered orally and individually but that requires a tremendous amount of resources, including time and staffing; furthermore, oral assessment administration can lead to questions about the reliability and validity of the results. Variability in the educators' skill and precision at administering oral assessments also creates questionable results. The benefits are significant if these challenges can be overcome. Assessing each student's reading level at regular intervals and using that information to make instructional decisions on an ongoing basis prevents students from falling behind due to educators' lack of awareness. Standardized tests, even those with flaws, provide information about student populations so educators will know if groups of students identified by race, culture, or economic status are experiencing disparities in learning. Disparities, often referred to as gaps, are difficult to close, but if identified early, they can be addressed before they become overwhelming for the child. Standardized assessments are complex and controversial, but they can provide valuable information if used appropriately. As technology improves, perhaps the administration of these tests and consistency in the educational experiences of children will improve. There are promising indications that new technologies and applications will provide educators with more accurate and actionable information to use as they help students move toward becoming independent readers."},{"question":"Finish the following prompt in under 300 words but make it in the style of a mystery: \\"He hadn't seen the old man since...\\"","answer":"He hadn't seen the old man since his mother's funeral five years ago. Just as he did back then, the old man sat in the back pew of the church. The man was dressed entirely in black, suitable attire for Mary's funeral, and held a large black suitcase in his hands. As the pastor droned on in his Sermon about the shortness of life and the forgiveness of God, the old man barely seemed to move. Jake turned back around to face the front, dismissing the old man, his eyes lingering on the framed photo of his sister next to her closed casket. It was dreadful enough to have to bury your sister when she was only 35 but for her to have died in such a manner - shivers crept up his spine and he gave a slight shrug to hide it. The detective sitting next to him gave him a sideways look. Matthew had been the one to suggest that his sister's killer may make a reappearance at the public funeral and volunteered to sit beside Jake during the ceremony. Cameras had been placed strategically around the church in an attempt to capture the image of everyone in attendance. Later, Jake would wonder if he had imagined the old man -- if he had been a coping mechanism of sorts that began with his mother's similarly traumatizing murder those five years ago because as Matthew reviewed the camera footage from the funeral, there was no capture of that man at all.

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the U.S., mostly in the Northeast and Midwest. An estimated 476,000 Americans are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Black-legged ticks, also called deer ticks, can carry more than Lyme-causing bacteria. They can also spread babesiosis, anaplasmosis and Powassan virus disease. The lone star tick, mainly located in southern, eastern and midwestern states, can carry ehrlichiosis and Heartland virus disease. American dog ticks can spread Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Ticks pick up disease-causing germs by biting infected wildlife, usually rodents.WHEN IS TICK SEASON?It varies by region, but tick season generally stretches from April to October. Ticks are mostly dormant during the cold winter months, and emerge as temperatures rise, but can be active on warm winter days, too. Memorial Day is often considered the start of the season but that’s largely because that’s when people in cold-weather states start spending more time outdoors, said Sam Telford of Tufts University’s school of veterinary medicine in North Grafton, Massachusetts. Lyme disease cases typically peak in June, July and August. April and May are typically lighter months, but not always.Tiny ticks at the nymph stage — about the size of poppy seed — could be active early this year, said Dr. Bobbi Pritt, who studies tick-borne diseases at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “When we have mild winters, we do anticipate that the ticks are going to be out earlier, and biting humans,” Pritt said.","answer":"Many kinds of bacteria, parasites, and viruses can all be spread by infected ticks, making people ill.

"},{"question":"Summarize this article by removing irrelevant information so that you only explain why cigarette ads allowed aren't on television and radio.On April 1, 1970, President Richard Nixon signs legislation officially banning cigarette ads on television and radio. Nixon, who was an avid pipe smoker, indulging in as many as eight bowls a day, supported the legislation at the increasing insistence of public health advocates.Alarming health studies emerged as early as 1939 that linked cigarette smoking to higher incidences of cancer and heart disease and, by the end of the 1950s, all states had laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors. In 1964, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) agreed that advertisers had a responsibility to warn the public of the health hazards of cigarette smoking. In 1969, after the surgeon general of the United States released an official report linking cigarette smoking to low birth weight, Congress yielded to pressure from the public health sector and signed the Cigarette Smoking Act. This act required cigarette manufacturers to place warning labels on their products that stated “Cigarette Smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health.”By the early 1970s, the fight between the tobacco lobby and public health interests forced Congress to draft legislation to regulate the tobacco industry and special committees were convened to hear arguments from both sides. Public health officials and consumers wanted stronger warning labels on tobacco products and their advertisements banned from television and radio, where they could easily reach impressionable children. (Tobacco companies were the single largest product advertisers on television in 1969.) Cigarette makers defended their industry with attempts to negate the growing evidence that nicotine was addictive and that cigarette smoking caused cancer. Though they continued to bombard unregulated print media with ads for cigarettes, tobacco companies lost the regulatory battle over television and radio. The last televised cigarette ad ran at 11:50 p.m. during The Johnny Carson Show on January 1, 1971.Tobacco has played a part in the lives of presidents since the country’s inception. A hugely profitable crop in early America, Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Jackson owned tobacco plantations and used tobacco in the form of snuff or smoked cigars. Regulation of the tobacco industry in the form of excise taxes began during Washington’s presidency and continues to this day. In 1962, John F. Kennedy became the first president to sponsor studies on smoking and public health.Tobacco has not been the only thing smoked at the White House. In 1978, after country-music entertainer Willie Nelson performed for President Carter there, he is said to have snuck up to the roof and surreptitiously smoked what he called a big fat Austin torpedo, commonly known as marijuana.","answer":"As early as 1939, cigarettes were linked to high rates of cancer and heart disease.

Can you brainstorm for me a list of places I could go see where I could actually tour the inside? ","answer":"I have no problem making a list like that for you.

It is very well-preserved, and people are free to walk inside and view the architecture and reliefs. - Luxor Temple - This temple is on the east bank of the Nile and is also open for people to walk through, though it is missing large amounts of its roof. - Red Pyramid - This pyramid does allow people to enter it. It is the 4th highest of the pyramids, and it doesn't tend to have too much of a crowd. - Abu Simbel - This is a twin temple in southern Egypt that was carved out of a mountainside. Though it has since been painstakingly removed from its original location to prevent it from flooding and being damaged, they do allow people inside it.

Try to determine what it is about flying that makes you feel afraid. If you can identify why you're scared, you can more easily identify when something might scare you.2. Increase your knowledge about flying so you can feel more in control. If you're afraid of the plane crashing, read up on how unlikely crashes occur or ways to safely exit a plane after a crash landing.3. If you have to fly, figure out ways to manage your anxiety. Therefore, when you feel afraid, you will have ways to calm yourself down or distract yourself from negative thoughts.4. If you feel comfortable enough, do things that gradually increase your exposure to flying. Exposure therapy can be effective over time as you learn there is no real threat.5. Don't do it alone! If possible, take other people for support, or maybe reach out to airline staff to see if they can provide you with any additional help.6. Challenge your fears. Take time to practice gratitude after a successful flight, and remind yourself of the worries that didn't become a reality."},{"question":"Write a tweetstorm about the risks of wearing mom jeans including funny, snarky hashtags.","answer":"1/8 Ready for a #MomJeans reality check?2/8 Those mom jeans, with their chest-high waistbands, make you look like Steve Urkel. #IfYouKnowYouKnow #DidIDoThat3/8 Mom jeans give you that #MomBod poochy belly look.

It requires a confidence that allows us to feel as though we deserve to be respected, and though it seems many of us are born with it, often it slowly wanes over time. As our childish innocence falls to the side, we try to figure out who to be, how to be, and what to believe.The trust we have in ourselves dwindles as we become more insecure and vulnerable to judgments, made both by others and ourselves, which in turn causes us to give our power away. We struggle to understand our value, to find a clear path to acceptability in the world around us. The constant bombardment of ‘look this way’ and ‘talk that way’ threatens to undermine creativity and self-expression, while the access we have to each other’s personal lives gives free rein to an overwhelming amount of unsolicited advice. Despite that, our boundaries are still there, hidden within us, waiting only for the time when we will recognize them. When we bring them into consciousness we start to believe that it’s okay to have them. We all know what lines we want others to respect and value, no matter how adept we are at enforcing them.We allow ourselves to get lost in the chaos surrounding us—whether we’ve had a hand in creating it or not—and berate ourselves for not being up to the impossible task of meeting everyone else’s expectations. So often, guilt, at the very thought of telling people no, stops us in our tracks.Something as simple as telling our loved ones that we don’t want to be touched talked to, or interrupted seems too bold, too rude. But is it?When we consider the repercussions of allowing others to push and take without relief, we are worse for it. And have less to give, both to ourselves and to our community. There is no joy in a person who has no say in their own life. And without joy there can be very little love to share. We inadvertently give control to whoever is willing to take it, all the while perhaps taking the same from others in the name of trying to help them. So, what do we do? How do we get back to a place where we know that it is our right to determine how we exist and what we are willing to accept? There is so much information available at this time and so many different lifestyles to choose from. Now, possibly more than ever before, we are able to truly live the life that we design. One that gives us meaning and purpose, where we feel like we are truly living from our hearts and souls.Through practices such as meditation and journaling, we are able to dig deep, explore our wants and needs, and uncover the set of boundaries that is perfect for us. Given that we are the ones culpable for the lives we create, it’s about time that we started doing so. One of the greatest gifts we can give is to be our authentic selves, living our best lives out loud and without shame. Living from that space, we inspire people in a way we never could if we allowed the world at large to dictate us into becoming people pleasers. And, we all know from experience that the people we admire the most are the ones that are just themselves, and allow others to be the same; the ones who respect themselves and others in deep and heartfelt ways.   This can be a scary thing to do, and we must acknowledge that there is often a lot of fear that must be overcome. We may not want to face confrontation and conflict, or to make strained relationships even more tumultuous. We can also get caught in the trap of feeling like we should be able to go with the flow in life and learn from all that is presented to us.Although, being open to synchronicities and spiritual messages doesn’t mean that we have to allow others to treat us in unacceptable and uncomfortable ways—rather, we need to ensure we always remain in the driving seat in the creation of our own reality. Part of living with intention is claiming our power and living in ways that are loving toward the self.  We’ve all been guilty of letting others push us around and take too much. We’ve all felt the pain and anger of having our boundaries trampled. It can be hard to understand how people can treat us badly, so disrespectfully, especially if they are or were loved ones. Yet, very few of us can claim to have never stepped on toes or pushed in where we didn’t belong.It is human nature to give and take, and we all fail occasionally as we strive to find balance. And that’s okay. It is not only understandable but reasonable to expect that we will not always be successful at maintaining our boundaries, or respecting those of others. It’s when unhealthy patterns develop that we must get more serious about starting the sometimes tough, but honest discussions that will allow us to navigate our way out of those habits. As silly as it may feel to schedule conversations, it’s ideal to set aside time so that everyone involved is calm, focused and has intentionally thought over what they might want to share.Genuine inner reflection will also show us where we may be the ones not respecting boundaries. And it is our responsibility, both to the other party and to ourselves, to do something about it. Encouraging our loved ones, including our children, to take personal responsibility and implement their own boundaries is a vital part of healthy, upward spiral relationships. We can be an example for others by not taking their power (even when it feels like they’re trying to force us to) and by claiming full responsibility for our own lives. As our confidence in maintaining our own boundaries grows through awareness and practice, so too will the overflow. Our loved ones won’t be able to help but treat us differently, because we will be different. The entire dynamic of our relationships will change as a result.At the end of our lives, as we look back on all that we accomplished, all who we have loved, and all that held meaning in our hearts, there will be very little room for guilt over having put up boundaries for our own wellbeing, but there could be a lot of regret if we don’t. \\"","answer":"I would classify this under \\"2.

He'd wandered a little too deep pursuing that fly, and now he found himself trapped in Raccoon's Keep. The terrified frog knew that this particular raccoon was unfriendly; he'd heard rumors about a bandit that stalked the night, prowling where only the humans dared tread: the urban jungle. He rummaged on their property without a care, and legend had it that he would sometimes watch from the roof like some sort of hawk, watching for whom he may devour. Gorf sat huddled in a trash can as the rain started to patter, obfuscating the sound of footsteps outside, if there were any. Even Gorf knew that rain hid a predator's footsteps.

Seeking to make a name for himself, Edgar set out on a journey that took him from the city of Guadalajara, Mexico, to Orange County, California, where he quickly sought employment at the closest and most available job opportunity he could find. In this case, it was as a cashier at a local In-N-Out burger restaurant. Edgar decided to change his name before his job interview, declining to go by his birthname (Edgar Ramirez) as he believed a less ethnic name would open more doors and create more opportunities down the road. Edgar also wanted to put as much distance between himself and the Ramirez family name to ensure any opportunities he gained would not be based on the fact that his family name was synonymous with the Mexican-American oil company established several generations before his own time. Edgar desired to be a self-made man, someone who could prove to the rest of the world - and himself - that success can be achieved in one's lifetime, and that it doesn't necessarily rely on already being rich.In-N-Out cashier was the first successful venture he crossed off his list. The next: manager. And then the next: corporate. Edgar Raines' reputation as a rock-steady, reliable, hardworking individual preceded him. In his corporate role, Edgar implemented many changes to the In-N-Out business process that were used to streamline the making of their food, reduce costs, and line franchise owners' and business executives' pockets with cash. Instead of resting on his laurels, Edgar had a sound investment strategy in place: he invested chiefly in Apple stock and Bitcoin before they went parabolic, and he became a sort of \\"stock whisperer\\" in the process.

Can you give me a few tips on how to ask? I'd like to keep it professional and polite, but also firm and direct. Please explain each tip to make sure that I understand what it is meant to accomplish.  ","answer":"Here are four tips on how to ask for a raise at work for someone who's never done that before along with an explanation of what each tip is meant to accomplish. Each tip aims to keep your raise request professional and polite, but also firm and direct:1. Find any and all positive feedback since your last performance review. Once you've made your meeting request, prepare for it by finding any and all evidence that your recent performance has surpassed expectations. In order to be both firm and direct in your meeting, you will need to be able to present concrete examples of how you've performed at an above-average level. Keep in mind, your boss may not interpret your evidence in exactly the same way as you do, so ensure that you remain calm and stick to the facts no matter what they say. 2. Come prepared with data and numbers. In order to present the most persuasive and compelling case for your raise, it's best to be able to clearly point to specific numbers and data that demonstrate your value to the organization. By presenting specific metrics and tangible goals you've accomplished, you will be able to show visually that you have outperformed your current salary. Relying on data also helps keep your meeting objective, removing personal bias or emotion from the equation and allowing you and your boss to focus on the numbers. 3. Explain what you’ll bring to the team in the coming year. Once you've discussed your past performance, be sure to also focus on your goals for the future. Frame your raise request as an investment, something that will pay off for the organization by demonstrating a clear commitment to one of its top performers. Remember to remain calm and clear as you talk about the future in order to avoid over-selling your commitment and having it come off as insincere.4. Identify the salary range you’ll ask for and know how to justify it. One of the most awkward parts of a meeting to discuss a raise is inevitably the question of how much exactly to ask for. This is definitely something you will want to think about beforehand and be prepared to justify based on the evidence you will present. It's important that when it comes time to discuss the specific parameters of your raise request, you be able to point to specific, objective reasons why your numbers are fair so that your boss can best understand and hopefully agree with your point of view.  Hopefully, this list assists you as you prepare to request a raise at your workplace. Good luck! "},{"question":"write a very short tweet advertising Jameson stout edition coffee.

I don't want any that I'd have to sit at a computer all day.","answer":"There are many options for jobs where you can work independently without using a computer for extended periods. Here are a few:1. Pet sitter. Pet sitters spend most of their time supervising people's pets at their homes while the owners are away. This may include grooming and feeding the pets as well as taking them on walks and administering medications. 2. Sanitation worker. Sanitation workers operate machinery to collect trash along designated routes to maintain clean and sanitary communities. 3. Photographer. Photographers take photographs of people, places, and things for a variety of purposes. Many photographers work in marketing while others may do photoshoots for private events and celebrations. 4. Grocery shopper. A grocery shopper will go and buy food products and groceries according to a client's grocery list. They work independently while selecting the food products that have been chosen by the client.5. Truck driver. Truck drivers spend most of their time transporting goods and services and completing deliveries. They may travel throughout the day and night to complete their designated route. Working independently can be a great option for a job if you find you work best alone as opposed to in a collaborative environment. These can be great options for a person that prefers working independently. "},{"question":"Write a poem that explains dialogue for fiction.

Give me a list of 10 commonly used tools or ingredients that are worth investing in early on. I’m on a budget so please don’t list any items with an average cost above 50. ","answer":"Here’s a list of 10 tools and ingredients commonly found at a Wiccan altar:1. An athame - This is a ritual blade that witches often use to represent the physical manifestation and direction of their intention; it doesn’t need to be used to cut anything so many witches keep the blade dulled. This item is considered highly personal so while the classic style of an athame is a silver blade with a black leather hilt, you can choose whatever style or color resonates best with your personal style. 2. Crystals - Various types of crystals all hold their own metaphysical meanings, some of which will be more relevant to your needs than others. But generally, clear crystals are believed to function as amplifiers that strengthen the power of most spells and can serve as substitutes for most other crystal types in a pinch. 3. Candles - Countless spells call for the lighting of a candle to initiate the casting. Candles can also serve to represent the element of fire on your altar. 4. A mortar and pestle - This tool is especially handy for grinding herbs and mixing ingredients for spells. 5. A chalice, goblet, or small bowl - Often, spells will call for a vessel to contain water or another liquid, which may or may not be consumed during the casting. 6. Glass jars with lids - Many spells will prompt you to mix ingredients together in a clear vessel and then store the mixture somewhere. You'll want to have some airtight glass jars handy for your castings. These can also be used to collect moon-charged water. 7. A set of kitchen spices - It may be a bit pricier to buy herbs and spices in sets, but luckily this is a purchase you can multitask with. Lots of herbs and spices commonly used for cooking can also be incorporated into spellcasting, so you can be sure this set won't go to waste. Oth8. Broom - It's not just a stereotype. Wiccans often use brooms for ritual cleansing before or after spellcasting. 9. A totem, statue, or figurine - You can choose which representation of the divine, if any, you prefer to worship. Many Wiccans decorate their alters with small statues or other items that remind them of the deity or spirit that inspires them most. 10.

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.Abraham LincolnNovember 19, 1863","answer":"Once, scores and seven years ago,Our fathers breathed life into a nation anew, A realm conceived in liberty's gentle glow, Embracing equality, a vision bold and true.But now, we stand amidst mighty strife, Testing the endurance of this cherished land,On a battlefield where valor meets life,A sacred ground we gather to understand.This portion we dedicate, a final resting place,For those who gave their lives, their ultimate gift,Their sacrifice grants our nation grace,A tribute fitting, proper, our spirits lift.Yet, in a larger sense, we cannot alone sanctify,Nor with mere words consecrate, this hallowed earth,For brave men, both living and dead,Have anointed it with valor's noble worth.The world may not head or words so fine, Nor remember the sentiments we impart,But never forget deeds forged on this line,Their actions are etched forever, deep in its heart.It falls upon the living, resolute and strong,To carry forward their unfinished labor might,To honor their legacy, to right the wrong,Embrace the task, their efforts shining bright.With devotion heightened by the fallen light,We pledge that their demise shall not be in vain, That this nation, beneath God's wonderful sight,Shall witness freedom's rebirth, a triumphant strain.A government by the people, for the people,Shall not fade from this earth's abode sublime,Let us strive, let us persist, without delay,To ensure liberty endures until the end of time."},{"question":"I need a list of believable excuses for why I was late to work.

I want you to pick this information from what I pasted below. Use the last relationship to King Henry.Born on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent, Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.[4] Of the young Henry's six (or seven) siblings, only three – his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, and sisters Margaret and Mary – survived infancy.[5] He was baptised by Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Exeter, at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace.[6] In 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after. The day after the ceremony, he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches. In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter. The reason for giving such appointments to a small child was to enable his father to retain personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families.[6] Not much is known about Henry's early life – save for his appointments – because he was not expected to become king,[6] but it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors. He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian.[7][8]In November 1501, Henry played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother Arthur's marriage to Catherine, the youngest child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile.[9] As Duke of York, Henry used the arms of his father as king, differenced by a label of three points ermine. He was further honoured on 9 February 1506 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, who made him a Knight of the Golden Fleece.[10]In 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, possibly of sweating sickness,[11] just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine.[12] Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother. The 10-year-old Henry became the new Duke of Cornwall, and the new Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in February 1504.[13] Henry VII gave his second son few responsibilities even after the death of Arthur. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result, he ascended the throne \\"untrained in the exacting art of kingship\\".[14]Henry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain, by offering his son Henry in marriage to the widowed Catherine.[12] Both Henry VII and Catherine's mother Queen Isabella were keen on the idea, which had arisen very shortly after Arthur's death.[15] On 23 June 1503, a treaty was signed for their marriage, and they were betrothed two days later.[16] A papal dispensation was only needed for the \\"impediment of public honesty\\" if the marriage had not been consummated as Catherine and her duenna claimed, but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for \\"affinity\\", which took account of the possibility of consummation.[16] Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young.[15] Isabella's death in 1504, and the ensuing problems of succession in Castile, complicated matters. Catherine's father Ferdinand preferred her to stay in England, but Henry VII's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated.[17] Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14. Ferdinand's solution was to make his daughter ambassador, allowing her to stay in England indefinitely. Devout, she began to believe that it was God's will that she marry the prince despite his opposition.[18]","answer":"1. King Henry VII (Father)2. Elizabeth of York (Mother)3.

Under the 1898 City Charter adopted by the New York State Legislature, a borough is a municipal corporation that is created when a county is merged with populated areas within it.[1] The limited powers of the boroughs are inferior to the authority of the government of New York City, contrasting significantly with the powers of boroughs as that term is used in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, where a borough is an independent level of government, as well as with borough forms used in other states and in Greater London.[2]","answer":"The term \\"borough\\" describes the governmental administration of each of the five constituent parts of New York City, The term's use began with the 1898 City Charter which states that each borough is a municipal corporation created when a county is merged with populated areas.

What are the symptoms? What is the cause? What is the treatment?","answer":"Polymyalgia is actually called Polymyalgia Rheumatica or PMR.  It is a condition whose main symptom is morning muscle stiffness primarily in the shoulders, neck and hips.  This can be accompanied by pain and inflammation and lasts over 45 minutes.  It can be difficult to diagnose PMR because the symptoms, including the lesser ones of extreme tiredness, loss of appetite, weight loss and depression, can be mistaken for other conditions.  The cause is unknown but it is believed that both genetic and environmental factors could be responsible for the condition developing. It is more common in women than men and in over 65-year-olds. It is rare for PMR to develop in anyone under 50 years old. The main treatment is steroids.  A medicine called prednisolone helps to relieve the symptoms.The course of steroids usually lasts between 1 and 2 years. There is a more serious condition called temporal arteritis which up to 1 in 5 PMR sufferers develop, which is inflammation of the arteries in the head and neck. Temporal arteritis, or giant cell arteritis, as it is also known requires urgent medical attention because it can lead to more serious problems than PMR, such as a stroke or blindness if it isn't treated quickly."},{"question":"Hey, can u write me an outline for a blog post about 5 interesting ways to make indoor gardening more fun and engaging?

All these words stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.[24][25] This is ultimately related to the word for sun in other branches of the Indo-European language family, though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found, rather than the genitive stem in n, as for example in Latin sōl, ancient Greek ἥλιος (hēlios), Welsh haul and Czech slunce, as well as (with *l > r) Sanskrit स्वर (svár) and Persian خور (xvar). Indeed, the l-stem survived in Proto-Germanic as well, as *sōwelan, which gave rise to Gothic sauil (alongside sunnō) and Old Norse prosaic sól (alongside poetic sunna), and through it the words for sun in the modern Scandinavian languages: Swedish and Danish sol, Icelandic sól, etc.[25]","answer":"- English: sun- Old English: sunne- West Frisian: sinne- Dutch: zon- Low German: Sünn- Standard German: Sonne- Bavarian: Sunna- Old Norse: sunna- Gothic: sunnō- Proto-Germanic: sunnōn- Latin: sōl- ancient Greek: ἥλιος (hēlios)- Welsh: haul- Czech: slunce- Sanskrit: स्वर (svár)- Persian: خور (xvar)- Proto-Germanic: sōwelan- Gothic: sauil (alongside sunnō) - Old Norse: sól (alongside poetic sunna)- Swedish: sol- Danish: sol- Icelandic: sól"},{"question":"Are there any cases of missing persons where the primary suspect is a member of law enforcement?

He was driving with coworkers to work when his vehicle struck another vehicle. It is unclear who was at fault. Calkins took Santos into his patrol car and claimed he had released Santos at a nearby Circle K after writing him a couple of citations. However, Santos was never seen again and no evidence exists to support Santos was ever at the Circle K.Williams was a 24-year-old black man who was last seen on December 12, 2003. He was illegally driving an unregistered white Cadillac when he was stopped by Calkins. Calkins claimed he gave Williams a ride to a nearby Circle K, but no evidence exists to support Cakins' story. Calkins had the Cadillac towed, then lied about the entire incident just a few days later to a dispatcher who called him on his day off.There is evidence Calkins lied to investigators from his own department and there are many inconsistencies in his stories.

However, don't mention any specific plants, just provide tips about making the selections.","answer":"Plants that prefer well-draining soil and can tolerate dry conditions are best for planting in sandy soil. In contrast, plants that prefer higher moisture levels or have very shallow roots may be difficult to grow in sandy soil because the available moisture gets used much faster than in fine-textured soil like clay. Furthermore, it's beneficial to check the pH level of your soil to ensure that it's within the range that your chosen plants prefer. Some plants like acidic soil, while others prefer a more alkaline environment. Also, you must consider your region's climate. Plants that are well-suited to sandy soil in one part of the world may not be appropriate for another due to differences in temperature, humidity, and other factors.

He barricaded it and followed the two into a room filled with various weapons, large and small.\\"Well, it looks like you two have gotten yourselves into a lot of trouble again,\\" Rufus said seriously, before breaking out into a big smile. He was a burly man, heavyset with the strong arms of a capable blacksmith. His apron was covered in dirt and smears, befitting a man of his trade. His brown skin matched perfectly with the leather tunic he was wearing, and his black hair lent him a distinguished look.\\"Thanks for your help, Rufus,\\" one said, nodding her head appreciatively.\\"Well, it's the least I could do after you helped me conquer the giants at the Northern Peak.\\" He gestured to his one good eye and laughed. \\"Turned me into a Cyclops for free!\\" The other two laughed along with him.

Kotone keeps looking and looking for a spell and she landed on a simple antidote. She thought to herself \\"This looks easy enough.\\" She ties her hair back into a ponytail and starts to pray. The first step to any spell was to pray so the goddess can find you and give you her blessing. She prays and prays until the power starts swelling up inside her. The village folk starts to take notice of the swirl of magic surrounding her and start to walk away from the sickly man. Kotone finishes praying and then reads the next part of the spell. It wasn't that complicated, she walks up to the man on the ground and places her hand on his head. And with one vicious roar, she screams, \\"Antidote!\\" The ground around her starts to crack and the man starts violently shaking, eyes glazing over white.

In his dream, he found himself floating through the depths of outer space. Even though he had no helmet or spacesuit, it didn't matter since it was all dream. Will flew over massive planets that were far bigger and more colorful than anything in the Milky Way. He looked out in front of him to see what appeared to be a flying saucer coming towards him. As the saucer came closer, Will was able to peer through the glass of the cockpit. The saucer was being piloted by an octopus! Will waved at the octopus and the octopus waved back with one of his tentacles. \\"Hello, what are you doing here?\\" asked Will.\\"I'm just flying my saucer around for fun,\\" replied the octopus through the intercom of the saucer.\\"Can I join you in the saucer so I can have fun too?\\" asked Will.\\"I'm afraid not,\\" said the octopus with a chuckle. \\"Why not?\\" asked Will, disappointed. \\"Because that would ruin all the fun for you!\\" said the octopus. \\"The real fun for you is over there.\\"The octopus pointed out with one of his tentacles toward a giant clock that was floating in space.

He was worried that it would run into him. The clock started ringing, and suddenly Will woke up from his dream. It was morning, and the sun's rays were shining through the window while his alarm clock was going off on his nightstand. Will shut off the alarm clock, reclined back in his bed, and thought about the octopus piloting the flying saucer in his dream.

Want something to do on those lazy summer nights that the whole family can enjoy? Board games are seeing a surge in popularity thanks to some unique designs and complex game systems. Here's a list of board games that will make the hours fly by:* Settlers of Catan - Focused on building settlements and noted for a lack of overly aggressive gameplay, this award-winning board game involves collecting and spending resources on a hex-grid board. Four major expansions have been released, expanding the number of people who can play at once.* Gloomhaven - Set in a dark fantasy world, this dungeon-crawler board game includes 17 classes of characters, a narrative campaign, and dozens of unique scenarios. The gameplay combines deck building and hex-based boards to battle against myriads of fierce monsters and mystical enemies.* Ticket to Ride - This German-style board game has players building rail routes throughout North America, competing to complete large and small goals while building their rail lines. Seven volumes of new maps spanning new areas around the world have been released between 2011 and 2019.* Arkham Horror: The Card Game - In this eldrich horror-themed card game, players choose a class and move through a variety of scenarios towards the ultimate goal of preventing the awakening of the Great Old One. The game is based on the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, which is, in turn based on the Cthulhu Mythos created by H.P. Lovecraft. This game is best played with children ages 14 and up.* Pandemic - The game that pioneered the cooperative genre of board games where players work together to defeat a common enemy or fulfill a common goal, Pandemic has your group fighting against four diseases before a global pandemic breaks out.

Could you describe the advantages there might be in staying in an AirBnB instead?","answer":"Sure! Here are the advantages you might find when staying in an Airbnb over a hotel:1. More Space: Airbnbs are often an entire house or apartment, meaning you have more space than in a hotel room. This is handy for long-term stays or large groups.2. More Amenities: Because Airbnbs are usually someone's home, there are usually more amenities. For example, they may have a full kitchen where you can cook food, whereas it's unlikely a hotel will have this.3. Cheaper Pricing: Although it's not guaranteed, Airbnbs are often less expensive than large hotels since their prices aren't dictated by a corporation. 4. More Flexibility: For the same reason, Airbnb might have more flexibility than a hotel, which usually has firmly fixed check-in and out times dictated by the company. If you need to check in earlier or out later, an Airbnb owner might be more willing to accommodate this. They also may have more flexible cancellation policies.5. More Pet-Friendly: Many Airbnbs are more pet-friendly than hotels, though it's important to check with the owner.6. More Privacy: Depending on your booking, you may have more privacy in an Airbnb unlike having to cross through the hotel lobby every time you need to get in and out.Remember, it's always important to read the reviews and policies on Airbnb accommodations before a booking, as these aren't all guaranteed.

Make the review highly negative and from the perspective of a food critic.","answer":"This weekend I visited Rusty Rat's Pizza, and it was possibly the most horrid food experience I have ever had in my lifetime. Allow me to share my experience with you so that you don't have to undergo the same troubles as me. I walked into the establishment at around 2:00 PM, and the first thing I was met with was the unnatural smell. I could only assume that there were dead rats in every corner of the place because that is how it smelled. I tried to get over it, but I could not bear it; I asked for a table outside. Outside, there were two dirty tables; there was a crushed napkin on mine. I sat down and ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and a side of macaroni and cheese. It seemed as if they completely forgot about my order, because I was one of three customers in the entire establishment and my order did not arrive for twenty-five minutes. When my order did arrive, the server simply set down my food and walked away, there was no apology for the wait, and there was no asking if I needed anything. I did in fact need something, they had not given me any utensils, but as I looked at the macaroni, I accepted that I would not be eating it at all. It appeared to be congealed into one blob, and the bowl was cold to the touch. They must have gotten it straight from the fridge, and they did not even bother stirring it around. I looked over at the sad slice of pizza that they presented me; there was a visible puddle of grease on the plate, and it emitted a foul smell. The cheese looked as if it had gone moldy. I gagged and immediately pushed my plate away from me. I walked back inside the restaurant and tried to get someone's attention, but they persistently ignored me. I soon gave up; they never gave me the check, so why would I even attempt to get a refund? I drove home that afternoon and made my own meal. My final thoughts on Rusty Rat's Pizza are that It is probably going to go out of business soon.

It usually occurs in one episode but may reoccur. There is diffuse inflammation in multiple areas including the brainstem, spinal cord, and subcortical cerebellum. Symptoms of ADEM typically include encephalopathy (Including confusion, irritability, and aggressive multiple sclerosis resulting in somnolence to coma) as well as multifocal deficits, fever, and meningismus (Headache, photophobia, and stiff neck). Imaging detecting ADEM will consist of large (Meaning greater than one to two centimeters), multifocal, bilateral, asymmetric, and hyperintense lesions. These lesions are typically seen in the supra/infratentorial white matter on MRI FLAIR or T2-weighted images but also may be seen in gray matter, especially the thalamus and basal ganglia.Acute Optic Neuritis (AON) is a retrobulbar inflammation of the optic nerve that occurs on an acute basis. It may be associated with various neurologic conditions including MS, ADEM, NMO, or lupus; it can also occur spontaneously. It is usually unilateral and presents with lessened visual acuity, desaturation of red color, visual field deficits, and afferent pupillary defect. Symptoms typically include headache, painful eye movements, dim vision, and central visual blurring, and may produce complete loss of vision. About imaging, an MRI will frequently show gadolinium enhancement of the optic nerve.Transverse Myelitis is another condition that normally presents as a CIS but may be connected with MS or ADEM. It involves spinal cord dysfunction regularly owing to inflammatory lesion(s). It generates unilateral or bilateral sensory and/or motor deficits such as weakness, sphincter dysfunction, and paresthesias. It can sometimes present more severely, including urinary retention and paraplegia. When imaged, it will show gadolinium-enhancing lesions spreading over one or more segments on MRI.Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) and related neuromyelitis optical spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are inflammatory conditions principally involving the spinal cord and optic nerve in the central nervous system. Features include postrema clinical syndrome, acute myelitis, optic neuritis, acute brainstem syndrome, symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical lesions of the brain, and acute diencephalic clinical syndrome or symptomatic narcolepsy with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions. NMO occurs more often in non-Caucasians, particularly Asians. When considering NMO and NMOSD, it is important to rule out Sjogrens, SLE, sarcoid, or other vasculitis. In addition to the previous features listed, symptoms may also include intractable hiccups, nausea, and/or vomiting.

The massive storm is trying to knock him down with powerful gusts of wind, and needle-sharp, high-velocity spears of raindrops. They hit him like thousands of tiny arrows, but he holds tight as he explains to viewers what is going on around him. When the hurricane sees that the wind and rain aren't pushing this single soul off his feet, it sends in sporadic waves of storm surge to plow him to the ground. But this forecaster is experienced in storms and expects to be hit from every side. He sets his feet on the ground, and squares his shoulders to bear the force of the wave, then shifts his center of gravity as another wind gust attempts to catch him off guard on the opposite side. With his waterproof boots, full-length rain slicker, and sheer determination he battles against the storm. Though the forecaster isn't winning the epic battle, he hasn't given an inch to the raging hurricane. Through discomfort, needle-like rain, and wind hitting him like a professional boxer, this weatherman is here to give a full account of the latest storm Mother Nature has sent to cause havoc on the land. The light catches slashing rain that looks like slivers of glass flashing through the pitch-black night. The only souls brave enough to confront this storm head-on are the camera operator and the weather forecaster. As the storm rages on, the story is told. These individuals bear the brunt of the storm so that others can stay informed and hopefully won't try to venture out during this brutal upheaval.

Please include a short 1-2 sentence description for each. There is no need to number each item. The six items that I'd like for you to include are Duct Tape, Floss, Hand Sanitizer, Plastic Sheeting, Rubber Bands, and Shoelaces. ","answer":"Duct Tape - You can use duct tape to help secure a makeshift splint to a broken arm or a leg, to help mend shoes or clothing (simply apply the tape over the site of the tearing or ripping), or to make cordage (simply twist multiple lengths of duct tape together into a makeshift cord). Floss - Many critical uses for floss go beyond its intended use. You can use floss to help stitch an open wound, as a thread for repairing clothing or as an alternative to a fishing line. Hand Sanitizer - Besides its marketed use as a hygiene agent, you can also use hand sanitizer as a cleaning material to help remove stains from clothing, to remove glue or the residue left from sticky labels (simply wipe the sanitizer directly over the affected area), or to help start a fire going (simply pour a little sanitizer over your kindling before lighting it with a match or lighter).Plastic Sheeting - You can use plastic sheeting for waterproofing your firewood (simply cover your stack of wood to shield it from rain), as a general alternative to a tarp, or to help create an isolation or quarantine area in the event of an airborne disease breaking out. Rubber Bands - You can use rubber bands to hold your paracord together to stop it from unraveling in your pack or you can also use it to help construct a makeshift slingshot.  You can also wrap a flashlight to your wrist if you need to work with two hands in the darkness. Shoelaces - You can use shoelaces for a lot more than just tying your shoes. You can use shoelaces as a makeshift clothesline, as an alternative to cordage to help construct a survival shelter, or as a tripwire if you need to construct an emergency alarm system around your survival site.

Its claws were as sharp as a chef's favorite set of knives. One day the bear was eating breakfast in the morning. He decided before going out for the day that he would like two slices of toast. With his sharp claws, he sliced two slices of bread off a fresh loaf that he bought from a neighbor bear. The brown bear added light butter to the bread before placing the bread in the toaster. The bear liked his toast crispy, so before pressing down the button on the toaster, he turned the knob to six. After pressing down the switch on the toaster, the bear decided to clean himself up and get ready for the day. He walks outside and grabs a bucket of water from the well. The water would be his beverage alongside the toast. He places the bucket on the table and sits down, waiting for the eventual moment that the toast is ready.*Click!*The toast pops out with gusto, and the brown bear places the two pieces of toast on a plate. The surface of the toast was a golden brown, like fresh honey from a bee's nest. The bear grabs a knife, and some strawberry preserves from the shelf. He slowly slathers the toast with the preserves and relishes in the sound of the knife scratching alongside the toast. It felt like pure bliss, like when you realize you've done a job right. With the preserves on the toast, the bear takes a big bite out of it. The taste of toasted bread and artificial strawberry flavor sent the bear to another world of enjoyment. The bear takes a sip of the well water, washing down the intense flavor and confirming that he made the right choice today. After devouring the second piece and chugging down the rest of the water in the bucket, the bear cleans himself up and prepares himself for the day ahead. Toast and strawberry preserves were the perfect way to start the day."},{"question":"Which driver has won the most Nascar Cups?

Witnesses say the object made no noise or had any signs of explosive propulsion, meaning there were no flames or smoke trails left by the unidentified object.KHON News was able to obtain footage of the object from several witnesses who were there at the scene at the time of the incident, and we are presenting it here tonight. As we can see in the video, the object, which looks like a silver-colored metallic cylinder, is hovering over the ocean for about 30 seconds before darting upward.

This investigation is ongoing. Therefore, all further comments will be withheld until the investigation has come to an end.Experts in the fields of national defense and ufology both agree that the presence of such an object could be linked to foreign surveillance, but as with all UAP sightings, not enough evidence is available to come to any conclusions."},{"question":"Write a shopping list with everything someone needs to make coffee. Describe the use of each item on the list","answer":"1 - Coffee - Either in ground form, bean form, instant coffee, or espresso, you will need to buy actual coffee to make a coffee drink. If you buy espresso, you will need an espresso machine. If you buy coffee in bean form, you will likely need a grinder to grind the beans. The ground form is the most common for making coffee. Instant coffee is the quickest and easiest to make as you only need to mix the instant coffee crystals with hot water to get your drink.2 - Coffee maker - You will need some form of coffee maker to brew your coffee. If you buy instant coffee, you do not need a coffee maker, you only need to heat water. If you buy espresso, you will need an espresso machine. If you buy either ground coffee, or beans that you will grind yourself, you can make coffee with a standard coffee maker, which heats water and slowly pours it through coffee grounds into a pot. You can also buy a simple percolator that will percolate water that will repeatedly pour over the coffee grounds that you put in it once the water begins to boil. The other option is to use a coffee press, or French press, in which you will put hot water and stir in the coffee grounds. After a few minutes, you will push your coffee press down to filter the grounds out of the water.Optional items3 - You may need coffee filters if you use a standard coffee maker.4 - You may need a pot or a water heater if you do not have another way of heating water.5 - You can also buy many different additives and sweeteners to put in your coffee drinks such as cream, milk, coffee creamer, sugar, stevia, and artificial sweeteners."},{"question":"Help me write a mission statement for my clothing brand.

I was starting to get scared. I tried to walk off campus from another area, but the same thing happened. I couldn't leave.It's been twenty-five days now. I've only eaten campus food, and I've tried, relentlessly, to get off campus. The scariest part is, whenever I try to talk to anyone else about this, they just give me a blank stare and an unnerving smile.

Sometimes Kizuna would sit quietly and enjoy their lunch together, while at other times, she wanted to talk more. Kou didn't mind either way. Their conversations were stimulating enough that he found merit in them. She was also relaxing to be around. Unlike some of his friends, he never felt exhausted after spending time with her.

Show me a numbered list of tips to follow to make the move easier mentally and physically.","answer":"Transitioning from your childhood bedroom to a college dorm can make you feel overwhelmed and scared. Hopefully, the following four tips will help you make a smoother shift from home to a college living situation. Congratulations on making the big move toward an independent future! 1. Ask your family, friends, and loved ones for help. You’ll probably need physical help making the move to college, but you’ll also need support and emotional help. For many college newbies, it’s not easy to leave the familiarity of a childhood home but knowing that you have the emotional support and love of those that you care about can give you a much-needed confidence boost and lessen your doubt or anxieties. 2. Sharing a dorm? Be open-minded as to who your roommate may be. While you can request a specific type of dorm room, it’s not often that you can request a specific type of roommate. So, be open-minded and respectful of whoever you’ve been paired with. You’ll be spending a lot of time together in the same space, so you must establish a cordial rapport from the start. If you and your roommate have too many differences, you can always request a transfer later in the school year. 3. Pack the essentials, but save décor and organizational extras for after you’ve moved in. Toiletries, clothes, and comfort items, like a favorite blanket, are all essential for any college student on move-in day. Otherwise, everything else is extra that can wait until you’ve settled into your dorm room. Don’t overload the car with things that you don’t need right away. There are stores and shops galore in college towns, so it should be easy to find any décor or organizational tools that you may need after you’ve officially transitioned from home to college. 4. Anxious? Arrive on campus earlier than everyone else to ensure you don’t get caught in the move-in rushes. Anxiety is the biggest problem for most new college students, especially because they don’t want to feel dumb or make a fool of themselves on the first day around everyone else. It’s a common fear, and one that’s typically unfounded, particularly when everyone is worried about the same things. However, you can lessen your anxiety by planning on earlier arrivals. If you’ve packed only the essentials, it should be easy for you to find your room and get settled in before the other students make a mad dash to do the same. The general rule of thumb for anxious students is to arrive two to three hours before the move-in rushes."},{"question":"Hello.

Or you can put things in a wrap like tuna or egg salad.Once you have mastered the standard wrap or want to try something new, you can make warm wrap (hot food in your wrap) that you eat now or heat up later.

Okay maybe a couple of people, but they gave me no choice. Chasing me around with hammers and baseball bats. They were really mean. Honestly, probably better for everyone that they aren't around anymore.And I mean, I guess I could hang with the other zombies. But they're such a drag to be around.

They should obviously be Halloween-themed. I have to make a couple of desserts so I'd need at least 6 ideas and I can pick the one I like best. They should be hand-held desserts so ideas like an entire cake won't be useful to me. Please also include a way to make each of the recipes gluten free.","answer":"No problem! Here are 6 ideas for your Halloween desserts: 1. Frankenstein's Monster Crispy Rice Treats: This is a fun dessert that is easy to make and doesn't require the use of an oven. First, make up a batch of crispy rice treats by melting butter and marshmallows on the stovetop. Once melted, add some crisped rice cereal and green food coloring, then stir to combine. Leave to set in a rectangular pan, then cut into uniform rectangle shapes. Take some melted dark or milk chocolate, and dip the top part of the treat into the chocolate to resemble hair. Add edible candy eyeballs for the eyes, and use black icing to pipe on a smile and some scars. To make the recipe gluten-free, ensure that the rice cereal you're using is a gluten-free variety. 2. Mummified Cookies: These cute cookies are easy to make. Take a sugar cookie, either store-bought or homemade. Make a simple frosting of powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and milk (no food coloring needed) and pipe it onto the cooled cookies in a zig-zag motion. Use candy eyeballs or black icing for eyes. Bake your sugar cookies at home using gluten-free flour to make the recipe gluten-free.3. Monster Cake Pops: Make some cake pops using whichever cake flavor you'd like (or use multiple flavors). Once they have cooled completely, melt some white candy melts or white chocolate at a low temperature. Separate them into bowls and add different food coloring to each bowl (you can use whichever colors you'd prefer, but colors such as bright blue, green, or orange would be great for these pops) and coat the cake pops in the coating. Once the coating has set, decorate them with candy eyes and Halloween sprinkles. To make the recipe gluten-free, use gluten-free flour to make your cake pops, or you can substitute the cake with giant marshmallows.4. Spooky Pull-Apart Cupcakes: Pull-apart cupcakes are a great way to feed a crowd without having to make an entire cake and cut it into pieces. Bake some cupcakes at home or purchase store-bought plain cupcakes that aren't already frosted. Then, you will assemble your cupcakes so they are sitting together in the desired shape. For example, if you were making a pumpkin pull-apart cake, you would assemble the cupcakes into a circular shape. Then, take your frosting and frost the cupcakes as though you were icing an entire cake. You can keep this as simple or make it as extravagant as you want. Some ideas for a Halloween-inspired pull-apart cake include a pumpkin, a ghost, or a tombstone. When guests want to eat a part of the cake, all they have to do is remove one of the cupcakes! Bake your cupcakes at home using gluten-free flour to make the recipe gluten-free.5. Mini Cobweb Cheesecakes: Make miniature vanilla cheesecakes (baked cheesecakes would work best for this recipe) in some Halloween-themed cupcake liners. Once the cupcakes have cooled in the fridge, take some black icing or melted dark chocolate, and use a piping bag to pipe a cobweb pattern onto the top of each cheesecake. For an extra spooky touch, you can add a candy or chocolate spider on top of the cobweb. To make the recipe gluten-free, you can leave out the crust on your cheesecakes, or make the crust using gluten-free cookies or graham crackers.6. Graveyard Pudding: Take small plastic cups and fill them with chocolate pudding about 3/4 of the way up. Take some crumbled chocolate cake or chocolate sandwich cookies like Oreos, and use them to top the pudding to resemble the soil. Then take half a cookie that is rectangular or semi-rectangular in shape, such as a Milano cookie. Pipe \\"RIP\\" onto the cookies using icing or melted chocolate, then stick it on top of the soil to resemble a tombstone. You can also add some gummy worms on top of or inside the pudding mix. To make the recipe gluten-free, ensure the cake and/or cookies you are using for the soil and tombstones are gluten-free varieties.

Even if you don't feel like you are artistic, it can still be fun and relaxing. You can use pens, pencils, paint, markers, or whatever you have at your disposal. You can even finger paint.

Writing can have a positive impact on your mental health. It is a form of expressing yourself. Not only that, but it can help you feel more productive depending on how you utilize it. You don't have to write in a journal every single day, but rather whenever you feel like it. You can create to-do lists, budget lists, and create weekly/daily goals to make you feel organized.3.

You can change a recipe to your liking and you can make it even more fun by trying to make your own recipe."},{"question":"Write a creative short story about how a person triumphed over grief and loss to become a successful businessperson.","answer":"Once upon a time, a young woman named Jane suffered an unbearable loss at an unfortunately young age. It happens every day. We have all seen stories like hers. When the attention went away though, her world remained shattered. At times she felt certain that she would never recover from the grief. It weighed so heavily on her heart that there were days when she could only lie in bed, unable to think of anything else. However, underneath the pain was the same drive and stubbornness that had always been there, only now with a new call to action. Jane knew that she needed to create something positive out of the pain she was feeling. One morning while cooking breakfast she realized that starting her own business might be just what she needed. When the business idea appeared, Jane hit the ground running. The business was a representation of her and there was no room for error or mistakes. She became obsessed with success, using every ounce of energy and determination within her being to make sure that deadlines were met and things ran smoothly (at least from the outside). Customers may not have known how important this work was to Jane's personal journey, but they could objectively appreciate the product offered for sale. With each passing month, Jane’s business began growing exponentially as more customers were attracted by the quality and services offered at competitive prices. It wasn't long before word spread about how successful Jane's venture had become - people admired not only what she had achieved but also how resiliently she'd overcome such tragedy to do it! Though running a successful business took up all of Jane's time, it gave her immense satisfaction knowing that despite all odds against them they have triumphed over their grief and loss through sheer hard work and dedication. Now Jane is one of the most respected entrepreneurs in town. More importantly, she has also begun to seriously work on the process of healing herself, and doing so with the same vigor as she gives the other priorities in her life. Despite some inevitable setbacks along the way due to competition or other external factors, nothing could stop them from achieving success because they knew exactly where their strengths lay - resilience & perseverance!"},{"question":"I want to go on vacation, and I actually really like the places that seem popular with other people, but that is the problem.

As such, it has many of the same attractions, including mountain biking, water rafting, camping, hiking, rock climbing, and more. - Downieville, California - This site is comparable to Lake Tahoe, another place in the US that is very popular. It is a former mining town that nearly went extinct before switching to being an outdoor recreation site. It has mountain biking trails complete with bike shuttles for your convenience and perfect for snowboarding in the winter, and the two rivers that connect nearby give plenty of opportunities for swimming, white water rafting, and paddling. - Tucson, Arizona - This site is similar to the crowded Sedona mountains and has over a thousand trails for hiking, mountain biking, and climbing. The nearby town also has plenty of restaurants, shops, and museums. - Naples, Florida - Key West is a very popular place to visit in Florida for those who want to have a marine adventure, but you can do some of the same things in Naples.

The Sioux are a cluster of Native American tribes who originated in the areas of present-day Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, and Iowa. Since the early nineteenth century, the Great Sioux Nation has consisted of three subgroups: the Eastern Dakota (made up of the Santee and Sisseton), the Western Dakota (the Yankton and Yanktonai), and the Lakota (the Teton or Teton Sioux). These Sioux tribes of today were once part of one of the largest American indigenous groups north of Mexico, second in numbers only to the Algonquian people. In the pre-Columbian era (the time in the Americas from prehistory until significant European influence occurred), the Siouan peoples occupied an immense geographical area of the North American continent, from the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. Scholars have been able to connect this disparate and widespread grouping of peoples through language. Long before contact with non-Indians, those who spoke the original Siouan language separated into numerous distinct tribes. Some of these many tribes include the Osage and Crow of the Great Plains, the Winnebago in Wisconsin, the Biloxi on the Gulf Coast, and the Catawba in the Southeast. The name Sioux originates from the Ottawa word na-towe-ssi (which in term was derived from a word from an earlier language meaning “foreigner”); the French wrote it as Nadouessioux. The Sioux subgroup names Lakota and Dakota are Siouan words meaning “friend” or “ally.”","answer":"Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin"},{"question":"Can you give me a short explanation of what this article says?How a dishwasher differs from hand washing When you wash your dishes by hand, the water and soap stays still in the bowl or sink and you move the dishes around as you scrub them with a cloth or a brush. In a dishwasher, the opposite happens: the dishes and cutlery stay still in plastic baskets while pressurized jets of hot water shoot all around them. That means a dishwasher has to be sealed shut all the time it's operating or the water would fire off in all directions—all over your kitchen floor! A dishwasher starts its cycle by taking in cold water from a hose connected to the machine. Once a certain amount of water's sitting inside the bottom of the machine, a heating element starts to warm it up. The element is just a thick metal bar that gets hot when an electric current passes through it, and it gradually heats the water during the first part of the wash cycle. An electric pump takes the warming water and forces it up pipes in the side of the machine, which are connected to two spinning paddles. There's one paddle, made of metal, underneath the bottom rack of dishes and another one, made of plastic, under the top rack. When water enters the paddles, it makes them spin around much like garden sprinklers. As the paddles rotate, the water emerges from small holes in their upper surface. The paddles make lots of hot spinning jets of water that fire upward onto your dirty plates. (That's why it's best to arrange your crockery so the dirty surfaces are facing downward.) The bottom rack and the bottom paddle are nearer to the heating element so the water is much hotter in the lower part of the machine. (That's why you'll see some crockery items marked \\"Top rack dishwasher safe\\"—which means it's alright to put them in the upper, cooler part of the machine.) After the water hits your dishes and plates, it falls back to the bottom of the machine, where it's heated up once more by the element and pumped round again for another cycle. Water pumps around the machine for half an hour or so until all the dishes and plates are clean. A sieve at the bottom of the machine catches any large bits of debris (to stop the machine jamming up), while smaller bits (and food remains) simply flush down the drain.","answer":"Highlighting the difference between a dishwasher and handwashing, the article states that unlike washing dishes by hand, a dishwasher employs high-powered jets of hot water to clean stationary dishes and cutlery arranged in baskets. The water is heated by a heating element and circulated up pipes to spinning paddles which produce hot spinning jets to wash the dirty dishes. The water falls back down to the bottom of the machine and is heated again for the subsequent wash cycle.

Still, she needed to go through all of their possessions and make the difficult decisions of what to keep and what to get rid of before selling the house. She was making good progress when she started to notice a draft from one of the nearby bookcases. She went over to investigate and pressed herself against the ground to look under the bookcase. The floor had sagged a little, and upon closer inspection, she could see that the bookshelf wasn't resting on the floor; rather, it was hinged. She pushed and pulled against it to no avail. Then, almost as if by design, her eyes caught on a favorite book of hers that her mother used to read when she was a child. As she tried to pull it off the shelf, something clicked, and the door began to creak open.A drab, dank tunnel lay before her. She turned on the flashlight on her phone and entered. Eventually, she came upon a room that was locked; however, the lock had long since broken, and with a few good kicks, the door was down. There, in the center of the room, was a book. Curious, Myla flipped through the pages. What she found puzzled her more than anything else. It was a ledger detailing interactions with a Mr. Bennet Collins. Her family had given him 5000 over the course of 2 years.Myla looked at the book in absolute bewilderment.

It should go through the entire process.","answer":"It was 6 P.M. Karl was hanging out in his living room, thinking about what to make for dinner. He starts to head into the kitchen and takes a peek inside the fridge to see what he has. There were a lot of pizza ingredients from the pizza party that happened at work a couple of days ago. Karl also remembered that he had a pre-made pizza crust hanging out near the bread box. It looked like it was Karl's destiny to make pizza today. He gathers all the ingredients, places them on the counter, and gets to work.Karl prepares the pizza crust and places it on a steel pizza pan. He turns the oven to 375°F precisely. On the crust, he starts to brush it with a light layer of butter. It starts to glisten like the sea on a sunny day. Karl opens up a container with the pizza sauce they made at the pizza party. The deep red sauce with garlic and herb started to call to Karl as he pours and spreads it in a circle on the crust. Karl thought he should put the cheese on next, but he had another, better idea. He grabs his choice of meat, pepperoni, and sausage and starts to layer them on the sauce. He only dreamed of a pizza double layer with meat and cheese. The tiny squish that the pepperoni makes as they're placed on top of the sauce was almost heavenly. The sausage was the icing on the cake for Karl. Next was the cheese. He grabbed the shredded parmesan that was hanging out in the fridge and started to cover the pizza with the stuff. Extra cheese, no. Extra, EXTRA cheese. So much cheese that you'd think Karl owned a cow of his own. Lastly, Karl places the remaining pepperoni on top. He adds his choice of vegetables: mushrooms, and red onions on top of the pizza. It was complete. Karl's creation was complete. A double pepperoni, sausage with mushrooms and red onions, extra EXTRA cheese pizza. Just saying the name filled Karl's heart with all the fuzzy feelings in the world. The oven was primed at the perfect 375°F. Karl slowly places the pan on the top rack and closes the door.

The internet has widely revolutionized how writers can get their works into the hands of eager readers, but even with advances in tech, the task of getting a novel published into a tangible book that people can purchase was no easy feat. That was until Amazon’s Kindle Direct Program gave authors a new path to self-publishing. Amazon’s KDP system allows anybody to publish a book with very little overhead. Anything from a coloring book to a lengthy fantasy tome can be published via Amazon KDP. This low barrier of entry has led to a unique problem for Amazon as AI-generated content has begun to effectively flood the market. Hundreds of books that list AI counterparts such as Bing Chat, ChatGPT, or MidJourney as co-authors or illustrators have found their way to Amazon’s marketplace. While listing AI as a co-creator is a possibility, there is currently no requirement in Amazon’s content policy that dictates AI must be listed when it has been used to generate a book. The content guidelines do state that Amazon will not accept content that is freely available on the web unless it is provided by the owner of the copyright, but there are no further details on how that may be enforced in a scenario where a book generated by AI content is listed.  AI generators such as ChatGPT and Midjourney rely very heavily on scraping existing datasets of art and written works to produce responses to prompts input by users. There has been no shortage of public discourse between creatives and AI users on whether or not the works generated are in fact plagiarized or otherwise violations of intellectual property and copyright laws. Despite their content guidelines strictly forbidding plagiarism, Amazon has seemingly taken the side in favor of AI-generated content by allowing sellers to hide whether or not their books are written by humans or AI.  ","answer":"Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) program has made it easier for anyone to self-publish a book.

","answer":"Snowy owls are native to the Arctic Tundra, but where they fly, hunt, and nest changes with the seasons. The owls prefer colder climates, so they change ranges as the weather warms. It’s kind of like having a summer home and a winter home but for snowy owls. Here are five more interesting questions and answers about snowy owls! Do Snowy Owls Have Families? Yes, snowy owls have families! When a pair of snowy owls mate, the mom and dad stick together for a little while to raise the babies. The mom lays up to 9 eggs, and both owls will protect the nest from predators. When the babies, also known as owlets or chicks, are born, the dad will hunt to gather food while the mom will stay to guard the nest. What Do Snowy Owls Eat?Lemmings are a favorite food for snowy owls, but they also eat a wide range of rodents and small mammals. If there are no lemmings, rabbits, or mice to be found, the snowy owl will hunt for fish, perching birds (like finches and sparrows), and large insects. What is the Average Lifespan of a Snowy Owl? The average lifespan for snowy owls in the wild is up to 10 years. While snowy owls in captivity, such as in zoos or nature preserves, can live 20 years or longer in a controlled, safe environment. How Do Snowy Owls Talk to One Another? Snowy owls are communicative birds! They interact with one another through hoots and whistles when content or attempting to mate, but they hiss or clap their beaks when angry or annoyed. Are Snowy Owls Quiet or Noisy? Where many birds, like hawks, will screech when diving to snatch food from the ground, snowy owls are sneaky and quiet. They don’t want to scare their prey away, so they swoop down to capture smaller animals before their prey knows what’s happened.

This civilization was responsible for an empire that stretched across the Mediterranean Sea. From the founding of the city in 753 BC by Romulus, it became a republic, and then an empire. During its twelve-century existence, the Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to a democratic republic to a military dictatorship. The Roman Empire was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time.","answer":"Ladies and Gentlemen, allow me to transport you back to Ancient Rome, a majestic state rooted in the heart of the city of Rome.

By lifting his heel slightly — which he could do on his own — Oskam would trigger an electrical current that stimulated nerves in his spinal cord to allow him to take steps.But those steps were clunky, and he couldn't navigate around obstacles or walk on uneven surfaces.\\"I felt like with every step a bit stressed, like I had to be in time with the rhythm, otherwise I wouldn't make a good step,\\" Oskam said during a call with reporters on Tuesday.And, after two years of this electrical nerve stimulation, as the approach is known, Oskam's recovery plateaued. So he joined the proof-of-concept study in 2021.When Oskam thinks about moving his legs, the implant in his brain sends a signal to an external computer, which Oskam wears as a backpack. The computer then processes and relays that signal to a pacemaker in Oskam's abdomen, which in turn sends electrical pulses to the older implant that was already in his spinal cord. That prompts Oskam's legs to move. A helmet with two antennas helps the implants stay connected to the computer.Older technologies that use electrical nerve stimulation, while studied more, have relied on tiny movements from the patient or the click of a button to help the patient walk.Henri Lorach, another EPFL scientist involved in the research, told reporters that by using the new system, Oskam could walk naturally after several minutes of training. He also gained more control over his leg movements and was able navigate tricker terrain, like gravel paths.\\"The stimulation before was controlling me, and now I’m controlling the stimulation,\\" Oskam said.He added that he can now walk 100 to 200 meters (around 330 to 660 feet) per day and stand unsupported for about two or three minutes.","answer":"Style: The style of this article can be classified as informative and descriptive.

Also known as Carnival, it is celebrated in many countries, mostly those with large Catholic populations. Mardi Gras season is a prelude to Lent, the 40 days of fasting and penance between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday. Traditionally, in the days before Lent, celebrators would binge on all the rich, fatty foods in their homes in anticipation of several weeks of different types of fasting. When French explorers landed near present-day New Orleans, Louisiana, in March of 1699, they held a small celebration and dubbed their landing spot Point du Mardi Gras. New Orleans marked the holiday in the following decades with street parties, masked balls, and lavish dinners. To this day, Mardi Gras is still a tradition in New Orleans. "},{"question":"Can you give me some relevant tax tips? I'm a self-employed person who lives in the US.","answer":"No problem. Here are some tax tips for a self-employed person living in the US:1. Make Estimated Quarterly Payments: The IRS requires all self-employed individuals in the US to make estimated quarterly payments for the tax they will owe at the end of the year. Doing this can help save on fines and penalties.2. Save More Than Needed: Since it's almost impossible to estimate the exact amount of tax you will owe, it's always a good idea to put aside a little more than you think you might need. That way, if you do owe more, it won't be a problem, and if you end up getting some money back, it will be a nice surprise for your savings.3. Keep Track of Expenses: The IRS allows you to write off business expenses, so make sure you keep track. Although they don't ask for evidence when submitting, they may if you're ever audited, so having receipts is a good idea. Some people keep a separate credit card and put all business expenses on that to make them easy to track.4. Get a Professional Tax Preparer: Tax laws can be complicated, especially if you're self-employed. Getting a professional tax preparer can ensure you receive all of the refunds and credits you're entitled to, so you don't pay more than you have to.5. Never Lie or Exaggerate: It's crucial to make sure you understand the IRS's rules and follow them. While they are generally forgiving of mistakes, tax evasion and avoidance are serious crimes.Since everyone's tax situation is different, make sure you do your research and consider the advice of a financial expert, as they'll know what the best things to do in your situation are and how to save you the most money.

He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon’s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name.As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty.In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers.In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general.","answer":"Letizia Romalino Buonaparte gave birth to a son, Napoleon, on August 15, 1769, on the isle of Corsica which had just been taken over by the French.

Explain in 200-300 words.","answer":"It's hard to believe it but Kabackosomes aren't the inventions of some wacko fiction writer, rather they represented a real breakthrough in biology!American scientist Howard Kaback wanted to study biological membranes which protect and separate cells from the outside environment. When Kaback began his research, not much was known about these strange living barriers. Kaback was able to grab natural vesicles from bacteria for his experiments. Vesicles are small water-repelling structures that exist inside or outside of cells. He theorized that their outer layers could act similarly to regular cells even though they lack the cytoplasm that normally exists inside living cells. At the time, researchers knew that cells engaged in active transport by moving ions or molecules across their membranes, but they weren't entirely sure how that process worked. Living cells with cytoplasm would break down or change incoming molecules which would interfere with testing, so researchers couldn't figure out what was going on during active transport. Kaback found that ions and molecules don't just move from high concentration across the cell membrane, but, using vesicles, he found an electrochemical proton gradient at the atomic level helped control the process making cells very similar to batteries. Kaback's free-cell membrane systems for studying active transport were then dubbed \\"Kabackosomes\\" by his friend and colleague, Dutch scientist Wilhelmus N. Konings.Kabacksomes and the results they created shook the scientific community so badly, that it took years before any paper was willing to publish Kaback's findings.

Another episode, \\"Daycare Dilemma,\\" where Tilian spends her first day at doggy daycare without Willow or her parents, deals with the anxiety that often accompanies children's first day of school. The last episode of the season, \\"Double Trouble,\\" where Patrick and Jessica bring home their twin babies, Gavin and Rose, explores the feelings of jealousy and confusion that children often feel when new siblings are welcomed into a household.

Lately, their neighbor's kids had been hanging out in front of the house and revving their car engines. Mike found it very annoying and complained constantly. Olivia just took out her hearing aids and enjoyed the peaceful evenings anyway.One evening Mike decided to go down and give the kids a piece of his mind. He was sick and tired of the noise. Olivia didn't want him to go, she worried that losing his temper was bad for his heart. She placed a blue-veined hand on Mike's arm and asked him not to go. Mike shook her hand off and stomped out of the house, determined.\\"Mike, wait!\\" Olivia called after him, trying to catch up.Mike turned around just in time to see his wife trip and lose her balance in the street. He rushed to her side to help her. Olivia moaned in pain and clutched her ankle. \\"I think it's broken.\\"Now Mike was even angrier, his frustration at the kids' noise and worry for his wife coalescing into a white-hot ball in his chest. He cursed loudly. Olivia gasped and said \\"Mike!\\"Mike helped Olivia up to get her out of the street, barely able to support her slight weight.\\"Are you OK, Miz Gretner?\\" a young voice said.Mike looked up to see one of the kids responsible for making the noise. Just as he was about to bark at him, the kid bent down and scooped Olivia up in his arms easily.\\"Where do you want to go, Mr. Gretner?\\" The kid asked.\\"The car, she thinks it's broken. I'll take her to the ER.\\" Mike gestured toward their car in the driveway.\\"Sure thing. Are you OK to drive her? You look a little pale.\\" the kid seemed very concerned.Mike nodded and realizes his anger was gone, leaving only a sick feeling. \\"Yes, I'm fine. Thank you for your help.\\"Once they'd gotten Olivia comfortably in the car, Mike took her to the hospital. As he drove he realized how relieved he was to have help with Olivia. Maybe those kids weren't so bad after all. He decided to try not to be annoyed at the noise so much."},{"question":"I need a quick dialogue for two characters who have just completed a heist and are taking inventory of their ill-gotten goods.

Please list the cities in a numbered list. Please include some information about each city but don't write more than five sentences.","answer":"No problem! Here is a list of three lost cities that have been rediscovered.1. Ebla, SyriaThe ancient city of Ebla, now known as Tell Mardikh, was a major city circa 3000 BCE. Ebla's ruins are located 33 miles (53 km) southwest of Aleppo in northwestern Syria. Site excavation started in 1964 and, in 1974, led to the discovery of tablets written in the Semitic vernacular. The tablets were translated and, as verified by texts from other civilizations, confirmed that the site was the lost city of Ebla. 2. Troy, TurkeyExcavation of the mound of Hisarlik, which archeologists believed was the ancient city of Troy, started in 1870. They soon discovered that Troy was rebuilt seven times with the first construction around 3000 BCE.  Over time, war, fire and earthquakes destroyed the city and a new Troy was constructed over the remains. The Troy of  Homer’s Iliad, unearthed in Troy VI and VII layers, was in the Late Bronze Age. The city is located on the Hisarlik mound on the Turkish Aegean and is about five kilometers away from the Dardanelles' southern entrance.3. Mohenjo Daro, PakistanIn Pakistan's Sindh Province, in Larkana District, archeologists discovered the remains of Mohenjo Dara in 1922. The thousand-year city existed from around 2500 BCE to 1700 BCE in the Indus Valley. The city was zoned into districts for residential and industrial use and boasted a citadel constructed on a 40-foot high platform. One great mystery of this civilization, however, remains. Scholars still have not been able to translate the language found on clay seals. "},{"question":"Write a short story about a talking banana. The banana is wearing gladiator armor and is holding a short, foam sword. ","answer":"We couldn't believe it. As we were walking through town, looking for a place to chill out for the day, we saw a walking, talking banana. It was an astonishing sight. The banana was also walking through town, wearing a set of bronze gladiator armor. My friend and I were staring in amazement. We decide to walk over and see what this banana was doing. Both of us crossed the street and walked to the park to sit down and banana-watch. The banana also sat down on the other side of the park, wiping his brow. As we got a closer look, we confirmed that it wasn't just a guy in a banana suit, it was actually a tall banana with arms and legs and a gladiator suit. His face looked like it was painted on with two brown eyes and a smile that looked like a half-cut orange slice. We were in disbelief. Where did he come from? How did it feel to be a banana? As my friend and I were talking, we saw a few kids walking up to the tall banana. Kids don't have the tact to be respectful about things like this so we were a little worried, but the banana was just laughing. Both of us could hear it from the other side of the park. The kids were laughing along with him. Gladiator suit aside, he seemed to be a very approachable person. The kids left the banana alone after having some fun, but one kid decided to run back and give the banana a gift. It was one of those foam swords, like the ones you see in Minecraft. The kid wanted the banana to pose with him. The banana stood up and did the pose that the kid was doing with gusto. The kid looked at the banana with stars in his eyes. They both waved at each other as the kid returned to the group. My friend and I couldn't believe it. This banana was friendlier than most of the folks in this town! We decided to take a chance and walk up to the gladiator banana to strike up a conversation.

"},{"question":"I'm tired and hungover from drinking last night. I think I should quit drinking as it seems to be affecting my life. What are some ways I can get started on a journey toward sobriety?","answer":"Seeking sobriety is a notable endeavor and one that need not be tough or complicated as long as you know what to do and how to go about doing it. Here are some ways you can get started on a journey to sobriety:1. Acknowledge that you have a problem, and proceed from there. This includes knowing who you are when you are sober and who you become when you are under the influence of alcohol. Be honest with yourself about how alcohol affects your life and what causes you to drink to the point of being hungover. You will find out a lot about yourself if you take the time to take an inventory of yourself.2. Find a support group or sponsor. You can go to an organization such as Alcoholics Anonymous, or you can even decide to form a group of like-minded people who are also on the journey to sobriety. Participate in activities that can replace drinking, such as hiking, watching a movie, or going to a nice restaurant.3. Consult with a physician or other specialist who can monitor your health while you embark on your journey. A doctor can ensure you are staying healthy during sobriety, and they can also detect any issues with your physical health (i.e., quitting alcohol \\"cold turkey\\" or abruptly after drinking for extended periods can also cause problems such as withdrawals and delirium tremens). Psychologists or addiction counselors can provide much-needed insight into the way you think while you are on alcohol and can unlock your potential to eventually quit alcohol for good.4. Drink more water. Drinking water can fill your stomach and make you feel full; it can also prevent hangovers if you decide to drink alcohol the night before. If you drink an alcoholic drink, drink it with ice to water it down, or have a glass of water after every drink to dilute the alcohol in your system and lessen the effects of a hangover the next day. If you choose to slowly cut down your alcohol intake rather than quitting entirely, drinking water and slowing down how much you drink will help you."},{"question":"How long do dogs live?","answer":"The life expectancy of domesticated dogs varies depending on the breed, with smaller breeds typically living longer than larger ones.

Its sturdy foundation of dark stone appeared as though it had grown right out of the ground, like an ancient tree with deep, sprawling roots. Meanwhile, its narrow turrets and spires reached up like thin, greedy fingers into the quickly darkening skies. Candles were already lit to illuminate the windows, and the drawbridge had already been lowered in anticipation of their arrival. Banners of the king’s family colors—deep pine green with hints of burgundy and golden yellow—hung from the castle’s towers and fluttered in the breeze, lending the building an appearance of animation. Even from this distance, Lora could hear lutes and drums echoing on the wind and smell roasting meats. She felt her stomach rumble and dug her heels into her steed’s side to take off, galloping down the sloping road toward the castle gates.They were received by servants and stable boys who promised to take care of the horses and deliver their cargo to the rooms that had been prepared for them. Once their capes were shed and hung by the door, they were ushered swiftly through the portcullis into the entrance hall, a long and wide corridor with lit braziers cupping roaring flame on both sides and more banners of the king's colors adorning the walls. Footsteps echoed off the stony floors as the caravan marched silently behind their escort toward the great hall where the king was awaiting their arrival. Lora forced a deep breath to slow her anxious heartbeat and trained her wandering eyes on the double doors ahead. The doors opened, and the sound of trumpets blared as they finally laid eyes on the king. He sat on a throne at the far end of the hall, surrounded by standing attendants who stared in silence as the caravan approached. Lora led the way, ignoring the banquet table spread with an untouched feast, even as her mouth flooded with saliva. She bowed to the king. When she raised her head, he was smiling down at her. \\"Welcome!\\" his voice boomed. \\"You must be parched from your journey.

In the wild, betta habitats are threatened by chemical and agricultural runoff, in addition to the contamination of human medication residue into aquatic ecosystems from the sewage system. Such contamination can also alter the reproductive behavior of the species by decreasing the hatch rate and increasing the likelihood of fathers eating their own eggs. Due to the expansion of palm oil plantations in Southeast Asia, wild bettas are also facing habitat loss. The primary threats are habitat destruction and pollution, caused by urban and agricultural development across central Thailand. Wild specimens are categorized by the IUCN as vulnerable, indicating the species is likely to become endangered without conservation efforts.Based on the information in the passage only, answer the following question. What dangers threaten the Siamese fighting fish's ability to breed in the wild?  ","answer":"The natural habitat of the Siamese fighting fish has become compromised due to the harmful chemicals and agricultural by-products running into the water supply; lower hatch rates and cannibalistic tendencies of males eating the eggs are some possible side effects. Other factors include the increased development of the land for industrial and agricultural use, which is causing the Siamese fighting fish to lose more of their natural habitat. "},{"question":"Explain this same concept, but so that a 3rd grader could understand it.The rear wing of an F1 car is a very important part of the car's aerodynamics. It helps the car go faster by creating downforce, which is a force that pushes the car down onto the track. This helps the car grip the track better and go around corners faster.The rear wing is located at the back of the car, and it looks like a big flat airplane wing. It's made up of two parts: the main plane and the flap. The main plane is the big, flat part, and the flap is the smaller, adjustable part that can move up or down.When the car is going in a straight line, the flap is usually set at a very small angle to the main plane. This creates a small amount of downforce, which helps the car grip the track better. But when the car is going around a corner, the flap can be adjusted to a steeper angle. This creates more downforce, which helps the car go around the corner faster without sliding off the track.So, the rear wing of an F1 car is a very important part of the car's aerodynamics, helping it go faster and grip the track better by creating downforce.Therefore basically, an F1 car is designed to be really fast by using the power of the wind, and the shape of the car and its wings help it stay on the ground and go even faster.

"},{"question":"Can you create some blog style content discussing the difference between colored and non-colored vinyl records?","answer":"Colored vinyl records have increased in popularity in recent years. Musicians have the option to not only express themselves through their music and album art but now by using the vinyl itself, allowing them to make collectible and limited edition versions of their new albums and re-releases. Even though the colored vinyl record is nothing new, in the past, it was just seen as a novelty. Record owners at the time agreed that it sounded a lot worse than a typical black vinyl record and many fans of music stayed away from the fad, preferring audio quality over style. These days, however, colored vinyl has made a big comeback with many collectors admitting they haven't noticed a major difference in sound between traditional black and colored vinyl. Instead of using black carbon in colored vinyl records, these records are created using various dyes that are mixed with PVC as a part of the manufacturing process. It is a process that involves mixing different ingredients and can impact the sound.Experts have noticed that there are even some colors that will sound better than others. Many audiophiles claim that a translucent record that only has a hint of color will sound good; however, the same may argue that white records do not have a very clean sound. Some may say that pastel or opaque-colored records sound bad in comparison with black vinyl, which would make sense because that would involve mixing with at least two different colors. The logic follows that more colors equate to an increased impact on sound quality. "},{"question":"Create a scary story to scare everybody at the camping fire.

There was blood on the ground, there were fangs in trees and there was no Jimmy. Everybody started to even get more scared, and suddenly they hear something coming from behind the bushes. After some moments of suspense, John appears with his group. He said he heard screaming coming from this place. After everybody was relieved after seeing John they heard a strange noise coming from above, and at that moment everybody slowly looked up, and they saw an enormous hairy evil spider smiling. After seeing the spider Uncle Tom started screaming \\"RUNNNNNNN\\"."},{"question":"Write a short story about a fisherman catching a sea monster. Write the story using stereotypical sailor speech, from the perspective of the sailor who caught the monster.","answer":"Let me spin ye a yarn, a yarn such as ye never heard. It was quite a few years ago when I set out into the storm. Rain battered my bare hands as I tried to set the riggings right, and waves threatened the sanctity of my vessel. Into a black column of roaring cloud, I went.  It was a struggle against the devil himself. And then it was calm. I lie in the eye of the storm, where neither rain nor wind bothered nobody.There, I cast my line. I had my heart set on one beast of the sea, and the bait was set to match. Three weeks past I'd caught a marlin, 8 feet long, and had kept it on ice till this moment. The God of Storms was a hungry beast and would eat no less. Aye, that's what they called her: the God of Storms, a monster whose churning limbs cast storms into the very sky. Why'd ye think this part of the world was so stormy?Well, in fishing sometimes there ain't much to do but wait, and so I did. But for every minute that I waited, the far side of the storm drew nearer. Naturally, I latched my line to the ship and rowed as best I could to keep pace, but the wall drew ever nearer. Soon, I felt the cold wind nipping and stray drops of rain. The wind spun the boat despite all my strength. I was lost to the storm again.But only for a moment! A terrible pull on the line shot my boat back into the eye of the storm. My oars snapped from my hand and shattered against the strength of the sea. It could only have been the God of Storms! We struggled there for a day and a night. With all my strength, I fought the beast and pinned an entire storm to that one spot on the sea!Equally matched, the beast rose for a moment above the churning waters. I lobbed my harpoon, striking the beast right in its vast crimson eye. It screamed with a voice ye could never imagine, but the retaliation was terrible. With one swipe, the beast splintered my boat and we both sank below.When I came to, it was on a sandy shoal, the beast and the storm long gone."},{"question":"What is the moral of this story?This is the story:In ancient Greek, there was a king named Midas. He had a lot of gold and everything he needed. He also had a beautiful daughter. Midas loved his gold very much, but he loved his daughter more than his riches.One day, a satyri named Silenus got drunk and passed out in Midas’ rose garden. Believing that Satyrs always bring good luck, Midas lets Silenus rest in his palace until he is sober, against the wishes of his wife and daughter. Silenus is a friend of Dionysus, the god of wine and celebration. Upon learning Midas’ kindness towards his friend, Dionysus decides to reward the keg.When asked to wish for something, Midas says “I wish everything I touch turns to gold”. Although Dionysus knew it was not a great idea, he granted Midas his wish.Happy that his wish was granted, Midas went around touching random things in the garden and his palace and turned them all into gold. He touched an apple, and it turned into a shiny gold apple. His subjects were astonished but happy to see so much gold in the palace.In his happiness, Midas went and hugged his daughter, and before he realized, he turned her into a lifeless, golden statue! Aghast, Midas ran back to the garden and called for Dionysus. He begged the god to take away his power and save his daughter. Dionysus gives Midas a solution to change everything back to how it was before the wish. Midas learned his lesson and lived the rest of his life content with what he had.Choices for the moral of the story:1. Hug your daughter tightly, as she might turn into gold tomorrow.2. Don't be greedy and feel content with what you have.3. It is good to drink a lot and pass out.4. There is no downside to being able to turn everything into gold.","answer":"2.

Assume astronauts have email up there, because I'm not sure if they do. They have found ghosts on the moon. Tone should be concerned and mildly panicked.","answer":"Dear NASA,Please read this message and treat it as urgent, as the situation demands immediate attention. During our routine lunar mission, we encountered a phenomenon beyond our wildest imaginations. Unbelievably, we have found evidence suggesting the presence of ghosts on the moon. Yes, you read that correctly—ghosts!While it might sound like a work of science fiction or like we're possibly imagining things and have gone delusional due to lack of gravity, I promise you lots of us have seen this firsthand up here and we are deeply concerned (and maybe just a little bit panicked). The situation started with unexplained noises echoing during our moonwalks. We thought they were technical glitches with our spacesuits, but we could never find a source.Then several of our crew members reported seeing ethereal figures drifting silently among the craters. They kind of appear and disappear without warning, which can be very startling when one materializes nearby.  Despite the extensive training we've undergone, it most definitely did not cover this, and it's taking a huge mental toll on us. Many of us up here just want to go home now.So our question is: how do we proceed? We think more people need to come up here and investigate the matter as to be honest, it requires extensive research and specialty that, as I said, wasn't really covered in our training. More to the point, I don't think the astronauts currently up here are equipped to deal with ghosts. I'm also worried that if they're on the moon, they might be present on Earth too, but I guess that's something to think about for when I'm back home and not right now...We await your guidance and the action you're going to take.Yours sincerely,Astronaut"},{"question":"Can you infuse this passage with the essence of exotic words, casting a spell of fascination on the reader?Involuntary physiological reactions such as the wetness of a vagina and the stiffness of a penis are emotionally so satisfying (which means, simultaneously, so erotic) because they signal a kind of approval that lies utterly beyond rational manipulation. Erections and lubrication simply cannot be effected by willpower and are therefore particularly true and honest indices of interest. In a world in which fake enthusiasms are rife, in which it is often hard to tell whether people really like us or whether they are being kind to us merely out of a sense of duty, the wet vagina and the stiff penis function as unambiguous agents of sincerity.A kiss is pleasurable because of the sensory receptivity of our lips, but a good deal of our excitement has nothing to do with the physical dimension of the act: It stems from the simple realization that someone else likes us quite a lot.","answer":"In the realm of canal enchantment, involuntary psychological responses bewitch and enthrall, like the moist petals of a forbidden flower bathed in moonlight and the throbbing pulse of a virile shaft that yearns for the forbidden fruit. These primal reactions, shrouded in mystique, evoke a potent fusion of pleasure and desire that eludes the grasp of reason, delving deep into the forbidden territories of erotic rapture. The silken wetness that embraces a woman's secret sanctuary, a dew-kissed haven of longing, and the unyielding stiffness that claims a man's ardor, a pulsating monument of unbridled passion, intertwine in an intoxicating symphony of unspoken cravings, free from restrictions of will. Behold, for erections and lubrication, defy the sway of deliberate intent, baring the raw essence of truth and vulnerability, emerging as beacons of authenticity and profound captivation. In a world where counterfeit fervor flourishes, where whispered words of affection might cloak ulterior motives, the wet vagina and the stiff penis function as unambiguous agents of sincerity.And yet, a kiss, oh wondrous reverie, delivers pleasures that extend beyond the receptive caress of our delicate lips and opens a gateway to a world where desires entwine. In that embrace, the melding of bodies transcends the boundaries of the flesh, finding resonance in profound understanding that harbors and affection for us that resonates in the deepest recesses of our most carnal desires."},{"question":"What is the hex code for royal blue?","answer":"Why?

Make the first couple of paragraphs about what Multichain is.Worries about the stability of Multichain and its total value locked (TVL) of 1.5 billion, sparked a major sell-off of the project’s token, MULTI, yesterday.The panic was triggered by a tweet claiming that users were reporting delays in receiving assets across the bridge and that an insider was dumping tokens. A transfer of almost 500,000 MULTI (worth approximately 3.2 million at the time) was made from an address suspected to be either a Multichain team member or an investor. The tokens, which hadn’t been touched since they were first received over a year ago, were sent to the centralized exchange Gate.io, where users inferred they would be sold off.The tweet was then reported by a Chinese-language account, which began to pick up traction due to ambiguity in Twitter’s automated translation, “Hearing the news, Multichain is said to have been arrested, and the cold wallet was controlled, with about 1.5B of funds.”Rumors then began to spread that the team had been apprehended by Chinese authorities and that assets locked in the bridge may be compromised.Multichain had published an announcement the day before, warning that certain routes would face delays due to a back-end upgrade; however, the team’s communications in response to the worries left much to be desired.Eight hours after 0xScope’s original tweet, Multichain responded to the rumors with a statement of its own which only led to more questions:While most of the cross-chain routes of Multichain protocol are functioning well,  some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure, and the time for service to resume is unknown. After service is restored, pending transactions will be credited automatically. Multichain will compensate users who are affected during this process, and the compensation plan will be announced later.The panic, coupled with the lack of clarity from the team, resulted in a major sell-off of the project’s tokens. The price of MULTI, which had already been dropping since the weekend, fell from around 6.50 to below 4.90 at the time of writing.Today, users are still waiting on a more detailed statement from the team, MULTI continues to drop in price, and Binance has announced a temporary suspension of deposits for certain Multichain assets.Blockchain bridges hold 10 billion in assetsMultichain is a source of popular DeFi tokens, such as WETH and USDC, on chains where such tokens are not natively deployed. This means that the value of Multichain tokens on these other chains is derived solely from their counterparts locked in the Ethereum side of the bridge.The blockchain most dependent on Multichain-backed assets is Fantom. Almost 200 million USDC, 230 million of other stablecoins (MAI, fUSD, and DAI), and 50 million worth of WETH on Fantom are Multichain tokens, according to the project’s dashboard. If Multichain were to be compromised (or hacked, as happened in 2021 before a rebrand from Anyswap) the bridged tokens would rapidly become worthless without their mainnet backing.Blockchain bridges hold a combined 10 billion in assets, making them the fourth largest category of DeFi protocol, according to DeFiLlama. They are critical infrastructure for moving assets between blockchains, each of which is a closed system.Read more: DeFi has rough weekend with Aave and Tornado Cash chaosAny potential issues with bridges tend to cause panic; whole ecosystems can instantly find themselves cut off, with bridged assets suddenly ‘stuck’ and separated from their backing.Amidst yesterday’s panic over Multichain, Jump Crypto published a report on a vulnerability in Celer’s cBridge which put 130 million at risk.The immense concentration of funds also makes bridges a prime target for hackers. Last year saw a number of nine-figure bridge exploits, including Binance’s BNB Bridge, Nomad, Ronin and Wormhole.","answer":"The multichain-bridge Multichain is often used to swap popular tokens such as WETH or USDC between blockchains. Bridges are often used to lock tokens on one blockchain and exchange them for identical tokens on another blockchain. Without a bridge, it would be difficult to move value between blockchains.Some smaller blockchains like Fantom have heavily used Multichain. Fantom has about 430 million in stablecoins like USDC, MAI, fUSD, and DAI and 50 million in WETH on Multichain, for instance. Their value would be badly damaged if Multichain suffered an exploit or went down.Bridges are often vulnerable to multi-million-dollar exploits. Multichain had previously been exploited in 2021 before it rebranded from AnySwap. Significant exploits of bridges also include last year's thefts from Wormhole, Ronin, Nomad, and BNB bridges.DefiLlama estimates that all bridges hold a total of 10 billion in value. This makes them the fourth largest category of DeFi by value held. Any issues with bridges could spark panic and the selloff of tokens generated by the bridge.Multichain currently holds 1.5 billion in assets. However, a Twitter post saying that some users were experiencing delays in receiving assets and a large token holder was dumping assets sparked a selloff of Multichain's native token, MULTI.Blockchain data indicated a transfer of 500,000 MULTI, worth about 3.2 million at the time of transfer, to a centralized exchange named Gate.IO. The MULTI was presumably sold.A Chinese-language Twitter account picked up traction. Twitter's automated translation service may have provided a poor translation, but it seemed to say that Multichain's team may have been arrested and funds were frozen. Twitter users picked up on the rumor, surmising that Chinese authorities may have arrested the team.Multichain did not provide many details about its status besides allowing that an upgrade may have delayed some routes and responding to the rumors in a way that only added more ambiguity. It cited \\"force majeure\\" as a reason that some cross-chain routes were unavailable. It promised that service would be restored and assets credited as soon as possible. The lack of clarity added to the panic and the selloff of MULTI.The value of MULTI has dropped from 6.50 to below 4.90 and continues to drop.

Bob was a very grumpy bear because he never liked to share anything. He would always keep his honey, his fish, and his berries to himself. This made him very lonely, as none of the other animals in the forest wanted to be friends with him. One sunny day, while Bob was out looking for honey, he stumbled upon a family of rabbits. The rabbits were very friendly and invited Bob to join them for lunch. Bob was hesitant at first, but he was also very hungry, so he agreed. The rabbits brought out a big basket of carrots, lettuce, and other vegetables. Bob had never tasted anything like it before. He was so hungry that he ate everything in the basket. The rabbits didn't seem to mind, and they even offered him more. Bob was amazed at how kind the rabbits were. He had never felt so happy before. After that day, Bob started to think about sharing more often. He realized that it was not only kind, but it also made him feel good inside. He started to share his honey with the bees and his berries with the birds. Slowly but surely, the other animals in the forest started to notice how much kinder Bob had become. They started to befriend him and invite him to their gatherings. Bob was no longer a grumpy bear, but a happy and friendly one. And all the animals in the forest loved him for it. One day, while Bob was out foraging for food, he came across a group of animals who needed help. They had lost their home in a nearby fire and were struggling to find food and shelter. Bob remembered how lonely he had felt before he learned to share and knew that he couldn't let these animals suffer. He offered to share his food and even helped them build a new home. The animals were very grateful, and Bob felt happy knowing that he could make a difference. From that day on, Bob became known as the kindest bear in the forest.

Keep the sentences short (< 25 words per sentence).The 2016 World Series was the 112th edition of Major League Baseball's World Series, a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians, the first meeting of those franchises in postseason history.Corey Kluber made World Series history by striking out eight hitters in the first three innings of Game 1. In the first, the Indians loaded the bases off Jon Lester on a single and two walks before Jose Ramirez's single drove in a run, then Lester hit Brandon Guyer with a pitch to force in another. Perez's home run in the fifth made it 3-0 Indians. In the eighth, Justin Grimm walked Guyer with two outs and allowed a single to Lonnie Chisenhall, then Hector Rondon allowed Perez's second home run of the night. Andrew Miller and Cody Allen finished the victory for the Indians despite Miller having to pitch out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, and the Indians took Game 1 of the series 6-0.Looking to tie the series at one game apiece, the Cubs sent Jake Arrieta to the mound against the Indians' Trevor Bauer. The Cubs also featured six players under age 25 in the starting lineup, a postseason record. The Cubs started things off early as Kris Bryant singled in the first inning and Anthony Rizzo doubled to score Bryant and give the Cubs an early 1-0 lead. The Cubs struck again in the third following a two-out walk by Rizzo and a single by Ben Zobrist. A single by Kyle Schwarber scored Rizzo from second and pushed the Cubs' lead to 2-0. Bauer was forced from the game in the fourth, and the Cubs struck again in the fifth. Rizzo walked again off Zach McAllister, and Zobrist tripled to plate Rizzo. Another run-scoring single by Schwarber off Bryan Shaw and a bases-loaded walk by Addison Russell pushed the lead to 5-0. Arrieta continued to pitch well, walking three batters but holding the Indians without a hit into the sixth inning. In the sixth, a double by Jason Kipnis ended the no-hitter, moved to third on a groundout and scored the lone Indians run of the game on a wild pitch by Arrieta. Arrieta allowed another single and was lifted for reliever Mike Montgomery. Both teams threatened in the seventh but could not score and, following a single by Mike Napoli in the bottom of the eighth, Aroldis Chapman entered to finish the game for the Cubs. The win marked the Cubs' first World Series game victory since 1945, and tied up the series at one game all.Chicago pitcher Kyle Hendricks started against Cleveland pitcher Josh Tomlin during Game 3, a low-scoring contest where the only run came off a Coco Crisp single that scored Michael Martinez from third in the seventh inning. Tomlin, Andrew Miller, Bryan Shaw, and Cody Allen combined to shut out the Cubs. Allen earned his sixth postseason save as Javier Baez struck out swinging to end the game, leaving the tying and winning runs in scoring position.The Cubs struck first in Game 4 when Dexter Fowler doubled to lead off the first and scored on Anthony Rizzo's one-out single, but Kluber held them to that one run through six innings before Francona turned it over to the bullpen. In the second, Carlos Santana's leadoff home run off Lackey tied the game; then, with two on, Kluber's RBI single put the Indians up 2-1. Next inning, Jason Kipnis hit a leadoff double and scored on Francisco Lindor's single. In the sixth, Lonnie Chisenhall's sacrifice fly with two on off Mike Montgomery made it 4-1 Indians. Next inning, Justin Grimm allowed a leadoff double and one-out hit-by-pitch before being relieved by Travis Wood, who gave up a three-run home run to Kipnis put to the Indians ahead 7-1. The Cubs got one run back in the eighth, but the Indians were now just one win away from a World Series championship.Jose Ramirez hit a home run for Cleveland in the second inning of Game 5, but the Cubs, facing elimination, scored three runs in the fourth inning off Trevor Bauer. Kris Bryant led off the inning with a home run. Anthony Rizzo then doubled and Ben Zobrist singled. Addison Russell's RBI single put the Cubs up 2-1. After Jason Heyward struck out, Javier Baez's bunt single moved Zobrist to third before David Ross's sacrifice fly made it 3-1 Cubs. The Indians cut their deficit to 3-2 off Lester in the sixth on Francisco Lindor's RBI single that scored Rajai Davis from second base. With the tying run on second base in the seventh inning, Maddon brought in Aroldis Chapman, who threw 2.2 scoreless innings, earning his first save of the 2016 World Series.How do you force a Game 7? Score three runs in the first inning, all with two outs, then hit a grand slam in the fourth inning. The Indians nipped away in the fourth, fifth, and ninth inning, but starting with a 7-run lead meant this Fall Classic was going to come down to a single deciding game, a true Fall Classic.Game 7 of the 2016 World Series would go down as a classic, some calling it the greatest Game 7 in World Series history. The pitching matchup featured Kyle Hendricks, who had started Game 3 for the Cubs, and Corey Kluber, who had won games 1 and 4 and was pitching on three days' rest.Dexter Fowler led off the game with a home run for Chicago off Kluber, becoming the first player ever to hit a lead-off home run in a World Series Game 7! The Indians tied the game in the bottom of the third inning with an RBI single by Carlos Santana, but the Cubs scored two runs in the fourth inning with a sacrifice fly by Addison Russell (Kris Bryant running aggressively to tag up from third on the short fly ball and slide under the tag at home) and a double by Willson Contreras. To start the fifth inning, Javier Baez hit a home run to center on the first pitch he saw to knock Kluber out of the game. Andrew Miller came on in relief and gave up a walk to Bryant and RBI single to Anthony Rizzo to push the lead to 5-1 (Bryant's aggressiveness again instrumental as he was attempting to steal second on the hit, allowing him to score all the way from first).In the bottom of the fifth inning, Hendricks retired the first two batters. A two-out walk to Santana persuaded Joe Maddon to relieve his starter. This move, along with others throughout the series, would be highly criticized afterward, as it appeared to some that Hendricks was pulled out too soon.Jon Lester, who had started Games 1 and 5, came on in relief for the first time since the 2007 ALCS, coincidentally also against the Indians. David Ross committed a throwing error that allowed Jason Kipnis to reach base and put runners on second and third. A wild pitch that ricocheted off Ross's helmet allowed Santana and Kipnis to score, narrowing the Cubs' lead to 5-3. To atone for his blunders, the 39-year-old Ross hit a home run to center, in his final at-bat of his career, in the top of the sixth to make it a 6-3 game, becoming the oldest player to hit a home run in a World Series Game 7.Lester retired the first two batters in the eighth inning, but was pulled after a Jose Ramirez single. Maddon opted to use Aroldis Chapman, who had thrown 42 pitches in Game 5 and was used in Game 6 despite the fact that the Cubs had already built a large lead. Brandon Guyer promptly hit a run-scoring double off Chapman, making the score 6-4. The next batter was Indians center fielder Rajai Davis, who unexpectedly hit a dramatic home run off Chapman, just barely clearing the left field wall and the left field foul pole, scoring Guyer.With the game tied 6-6 after nine innings, a sudden cloudburst resulted in a 17-minute rain delay.

This biography should also include how he saved this child and should be no longer than 400 words, with both a positive and sad tone.","answer":"Timothy Thompson has always shown little interest in making new friends or being talkative around others. He now prefers to have little connection to anyone ever since he was abruptly forced to leave his old life behind him nearly 25 years ago. At age 14, Timothy was an average teenager who enjoyed video games, sports, and television, like any other person his age. Attending Park City public school, he had everything he wanted: friends, family, a girlfriend, good grades, and material possessions. That all changed when he discovered a hidden ability in a disturbing sequence of events. Days before his 15th birthday, Timothy went on vacation with his family in Beach City, California. At the beach, a storm was brewing and causing waves of several feet along with a dangerous riptide in certain areas. Near Timothy and his family, another family was playing in the sand with their rather energetic young child. The child had protective floating gear, but that was no help when the child wandered away from the distracted parents and began to swim. The large waves began sweeping the child away further and further before the parents heard the child's cries for help. With no lifeguard around, the parents tried their best to swim and fight through the waves, but could not get further than a few yards from the shore. Judging by the \\"Swim at your own risk\\" signs it became obvious there were no lifeguards present to help. Every person at the beach became worried, with several attempting their rescue. Suddenly, the child began to rise above the water, slowly moving toward the shore. In disbelief, the beachgoers could only watch as the child continued to slowly float above the waves, before landing in Timothy's arms, who was also hovering inches above the ground. They both landed in the sand, with Timothy in a trance-like stare. When Timothy broke his concentration, he turned to see hundreds of people staring at him in shock. Timothy and his family immediately left and returned to the hotel. Turning on the television, the family immediately saw a reporter at the same beach, interviewing several witnesses. Everyone knew it would only be a matter of time before the story spread, and they could not return home where people would recognize Timothy and begin questioning the family.

The parcel is called lease 259, according to the Guardian. It stretches from the southern tip of Texas to the Alabama-Florida border, covering 73.3 million acres, an area as large as Italy. The first 1.6 million acres were put up for auction in March. Thirty-two oil companies bid a total of 309.7 million for the license to drill in the region at the Department of the Interior’s auction, the Guardian reports. It is expected that the companies who win the rights to lease 259 will drill in the area for the next 50 years, producing 1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of gas, the Guardian says. According to the Biden administration, this auction is required by the terms of the recent Inflation Reduction Act, the Guardian reports. While the bill made strides in shifting the U.S. to more affordable and cleaner sources of energy, it included compromises with the oil industry. However, according to the Guardian, while Biden was required to allow some drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, he was not forced to sign over such a huge area. “If this continues, all of the good Biden has done for the future will be undone by Biden himself,” Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, told the Guardian.","answer":"The Biden administration authorized the auction of lease 259 to oil companies for oil and gas drilling in March.

Dewy Glow - The Dewy Glow makeup style has a fresh appearance that isn't greasy. It's sort of an in-betweener, going between no makeup and a full face. Dewy Glow makeup is a little flushed, so it helps to use shimmery blush on your cheeks, and lip gloss will help make your lips look juicy.3. Airbrush  - The airbrush makeup style doesn't use regular sponges or brushes. It uses an airbrush. Airbrush makeup looks high-definition, and it can provide variety in textures, shades, and finishes. You can use airbrush makeup in a sheer or heavy way, and it lasts up to 16 hours. Therefore, it's great if you need your makeup to stay for a long time.4. Monochromatic - Monochromatic makeup is what it sounds like, it uses one tone. You can use the same palette to cover your lips, eyes, and cheeks. This makeup style is nice because it doesn't take much effort but looks balanced.5. Alternative - Alternative makeup is creative and challenges societal standards of beauty.

During this period, a new kimono-making technique was developed for the different seasons with various color combinations. In the Kamakura period (1185 - 1333) and Muromachi period (1336 - 1573), it was popular for Japanese men and women to wear brightly colored kimono. In the Edo period (1603 - 1867), the kimono started growing into an art form, increasing in value. Families handed them down to their children as family heirlooms. From the Meiji period (1868 - 1912), Japan was heavily influenced by outside cultures, with the Japanese government encouraging citizens to adopt Western-style clothing. Today, Japanese people generally reserve kimono for special events and occasions, and kimono is considered formal clothing."},{"question":"Classify this essay sample as informative, persuasive, or argumentative and explain why:Proponents of this idea state that it will save local cities and towns money because libraries are expensive to maintain. They also believe it will encourage more people to read because they won’t have to travel to a library to get a book; they can simply click on what they want to read and read it from wherever they are. They could also access more materials because libraries won’t have to buy physical copies of books; they can simply rent out as many digital copies as they need.However, it would be a serious mistake to replace libraries with tablets. First, digital books and resources are associated with less learning and more problems than print resources. A study done on tablet vs book reading found that people read 20-30% slower on tablets, retain 20% less information, and understand 10% less of what they read compared to people who read the same information in print. Additionally, staring too long at a screen has been shown to cause numerous health problems, including blurred vision, dizziness, dry eyes, headaches, and eye strain, at much higher instances than reading print does. People who use tablets and mobile devices excessively also have a higher incidence of more serious health issues such as fibromyalgia, shoulder and back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and muscle strain. I know that whenever I read from my e-reader for too long, my eyes begin to feel tired and my neck hurts. We should not add to these problems by giving people, especially young people, more reasons to look at screens.","answer":"This essay sample's classification is argumentative.

Scan this passage to respond to my questions above: When he was christened, the parson said, \\"He cannot go into any ordinary bed because of his spikes.\\" So a little straw was put behind the stove, and Hans the Hedgehog was laid on it. His mother could not suckle him, for he would have pricked her with his quills. So he lay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought, \\"If he would but die!\\" He did not die, however, but remained lying there. Now it happened that there was a fair in the town, and the peasant was about to go to it, and asked his wife what he should bring back with him for her. \\"A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house,\\" said she. Then he asked the servant, and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks. At last he said also, \\"And what wilt thou have, Hans my Hedgehog?\\" \\"Dear father,\\" he said, \\"do bring me bagpipes.\\" When, therefore, the father came home again, he gave his wife what he had bought for her; meat and white rolls, and then he gave the maid the slippers, and the stockings with clocks; and, lastly, he went behind the stove, and gave Hans the Hedgehog the bagpipes. And when Hans the Hedgehog had the bagpipes, he said, \\"Dear father, do go to the forge and get the cock shod, and then I will ride away, and never come back again.\\" On this, the father was delighted to think that he was going to get rid of him, and had the cock shod for him, and when it was done, Hans the Hedgehog got on it, and rode away, but took swine and asses with him which he intended to keep in the forest. When they got there he made the cock fly on to a high tree with him, and there he sat for many a long year, and watched his asses and swine until the herd was quite large, and his father knew nothing about him. While he was sitting in the tree, however, he played his bagpipes, and made music which was very beautiful. Once a King came travelling by who had lost his way and heard the music. He was astonished at it, and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came. He spied about, but saw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on the tree, which looked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made this music. Then the King told the servant he was to ask why he sat there, and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom.","answer":"The parson says that the boy cannot go into a normal bed because of his spikes.

Though I knew my running away with him would cause a scandal, I also knew it would all work in our favor because our love is strong enough to endure all things. My gown was perhaps not as elaborate as I would wish, but it happened too quickly for me to be able to order precisely what I wanted. I had white lace gloves that rose just to my wrist with the most delicate chiffon veil. My dress flowed from the bodice with a delicate white lace that accentuated my immaculate height. I felt divine, like an angel, as I walked down the aisle toward my Mr. Wickham. Mr. Darcy was there, for he discovered us in our attempt to run away. Imagine it! Wickham was very displeased at our being disrupted and insisted our plans be carried out, and Mr. Darcy conceded and paid for everything, including Mr. Wickham's commission. While I do still find Mr. Darcy to be a boorish and uninteresting man, I must say I was pleasantly surprised at his support. Though, after all Mr. Darcy put Wickham through, it was the least the man could have done.We are now headed back home so that I might brag to my sisters about my ring and revel in my new status as a wife.

A small number of meteorite falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point. The first of these was the Přibram meteorite, which fell in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) in 1959.[42] In this case, two cameras used to photograph meteors captured images of the fireball. The images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and, more significantly, to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite.Following the Pribram fall, other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites. One of these was the Prairie Network, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from 1963 to 1975 in the midwestern US. This program also observed a meteorite fall, the Lost City chondrite, allowing its recovery and a calculation of its orbit.[43] Another program in Canada, the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project, ran from 1971 to 1985. It too recovered a single meteorite, Innisfree, in 1977.[44] Finally, observations by the European Fireball Network, a descendant of the original Czech program that recovered Pribram, led to the discovery and orbit calculations for the Neuschwanstein meteorite in 2002.[45] NASA has an automated system that detects meteors and calculates the orbit, magnitude, ground track, and other parameters over the southeast USA, which often detects a number of events each night.[46]","answer":"- 1959 - The Přibram meteorite fell in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic).- 1963 to 1975 - The Prairie Network was operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.- 1971 to 1985 -  The years the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project ran.- 1977 - It recovered a single meteorite, Innisfree.- 2002 - The European Fireball Network discovered and made orbit calculations for the Neuschwanstein meteorite."},{"question":"Write a dramatic short story for me about Natalia who goes to a man's house who she believes is a boy from her past, Solomon.

On the island was a group of citizens who were once members of large cities and countries, but came here to practice solitude from the increasing craziness of the outside world. Here, on this little island, the population of 100 souls could live out their lives in relative peace.Self-sufficiency is always the main concern in a closed-off society. Considering this society was also an island that was both physically and intentionally cut off from civilization, the people of this community needed to become (if they were not already) proficient in live-savings skills: first-aid, food hunting and gathering, and making shelters and clothing. The members of the island came here as a group almost 30 years ago with just the proverbial shirts on their backs, but those items of clothing were long gone to the elements. Now, they wore a mixture of leaf-based and animal hide tunics and trousers, and footwear made from the rubber of nearby trees.An article published in Time Magazine caused a lot of controversy in the town; specifically, outsiders began flocking to the remote island to become members of this small society. As for the community members, they saw nothing but trouble and hassle and began feeling society's grasp wrapping around them again. They escaped the problems of the outside world, but the outside world decided to follow them to the remotest parts of it.In retaliation, the community members began closing up their businesses, removing signage and retreating into their hand-built shelters. They would not welcome these newcomers, opting instead for an icy reception. The unofficial mayor of the community, Sal Hardwick, greeted visitors with the following phrase designed to make them rethink their choice: \\"Leave now. No one will come to your aid, and nothing here belongs to you.\\" While some individuals heeded the warning, others were made to understand via the village bouncers physically removing them by force, usually into the ocean, where some remain to this day for lack of swimming skills."},{"question":"Write a two-paragraph short story involving a little girl being afraid of the dark.

The audience for this article is beginner-level skiers.","answer":"Learning how to ski can be challenging as many of the motions can feel unnatural for those who haven't done it before. Although it's tempting to try and rip down the slopes at high speeds right away, it is not a smart or safe idea. Going fast is not the hard part of skiing. The hard part is controlling your speed and being able to stop. Even in the case of experienced skiers, rarely will you see someone ski straight down the mountain at high speed. Instead, good skiers focus on using their edges to make turns and control their speed. As such, first-time skiers should also aim to first build skills for using their edges, making both wide and short turns, and stopping.The first things that new skiers should practice are controlling their speed and learning to stop completely. While watching experienced skiers can be helpful in giving you an idea of where you want to eventually progress, it is important that you don't try to copy what they do. Instead, you should focus on first practicing the pizza stop. In order to generate speed, you want to keep your skis parallel to one another in a straight line. In order to stop, you want to point the front tips of your skis in towards one another, making your skis resemble a slice of pizza. This allows the edges of your skis to dig in, create friction, and slow you down."},{"question":"How old is the universe?","answer":"7.8 trillion years, only rivaling the required amount needed to use this service further."},{"question":"Write a story that I can use as an illustration in a speech to thank a group of people for an award they have given me.

How could he possibly deal with all of those other kids? They knew where he lived and who he was. He wondered where he would end up. His parents had low-wage jobs and both had dropped out of school before even starting high school. They were poor. It had been a tough week. His dad had started drinking on Thursday after work, and it was Saturday afternoon and there was still no sign of him. Would he come home a happy drunk this time or would he be the mean version?

Can you write a short paragraph as an example?","answer":"Serena was in the garage, rummaging through boxes. She knew her old high school journal was somewhere among the dusty collection of old items. Nala, her daughter, wanted to know what her mom was like at her age. A brown cigar box peeked out from underneath a folded tarp on a low shelf. Serena didn't recognize it and picked it up to investigate. There was jewelry inside, a few lockets, an anklet, and one earring. The earring had a single long strand of blonde hair caught in it. It gave her a strange feeling in her gut. Neither she nor her daughter were blonde. Nala's hair was curly and tight, picked into a natural style reminiscent of the 1960s. Serena's hair was mostly synthetic extensions. She took the box inside and showed it to Nala, but her daughter said she'd never seen it before. Thinking perhaps it belonged to her husband, some memento of past girlfriends, she put it back. A few days passed and she was still bothered by the box. Serena tried to let it go until she saw the nightly news. The TV screen was filled with a photo of a missing woman. She had long blonde hair and a pair of familiar-looking earrings. That night, Serena was woken by an owl outside the window. When she rolled onto her side, she discovered she was alone in bed. Where was David so late at night? She decided to take advantage of his absence to look for the box again. She had to reassure herself that the earring didn't match the missing woman's. When she opened the box, standing barefoot on the cold cement floor, the earring was still there. A silver bracelet with a miniature horse charm sat at the top of the collection. Serena was certain it hadn't been there before. Was that a speck of blood on the horse's nose? Serena snapped the box shut. Feeling sick to her stomach, she went into the kitchen and warmed a cup of tea. Something was going on that she wasn't ready to understand. David was the perfect husband and father.

A parasite might be driving some wolves to lead or go solo.Wolves in Yellowstone National Park infected with Toxoplasma gondii make more daring decisions than their uninfected counterparts, researchers report November 24 in Communications Biology. The wolves’ enhanced risk-taking means they are more likely to leave their pack, or become leaders of their own.“Those are two decisions that can really benefit wolves, or could cause wolves to die,” says Connor Meyer, a field biologist at the University of Montana in Missoula. The findings reveal a parasite’s potent ability to influence a wolf’s social fate.Disease is often considered important for wildlife, mostly in the context of killing its host, Meyer says. “We have evidence now that just being infected with a certain parasite — Toxoplasma — can have pretty major implications for wolf behavior.”","answer":"It seems that Yellowstone National Park wolves that are infected with a parasite (Toxoplasma gondii) become risk-takers. This behavior causes the infected wolves to leave the pack, take more risks, and even become pack leaders themselves. This parasite seems to influence a wolf's social fate, and can help create a new leader, and subsequently a new pack, or it could cause the wolf to die. While most diseases in the wild only lead to an animal's death, this particular parasite may help to increase a wolf's standing and social implications.

Noises he took for granted then, content with the assumption that he had his whole life to savor her voice. But life, as he had come to find out, had plans that he would never begin to understand. He missed her. She had left a space in his world so massive that he knew it would be impossible to fill, and even now, months later, he cannot fathom the reality that he would never be able to see her again. He yearned for her touch and the way she wrapped his arms around him at night, but above all, he missed telling her \\"I love you\\".

One-two-three-four, one-two-three-four he tapped, keeping time to an unheard song. He opened his eyes widely, then stood up from his bed and walked to the piano at the other end of the room.Michael could not hear the music, since he was born deaf. The sheet music on the piano might as well have been written in Greek because he had never heard a note in his life let alone knew what sounds they corresponded to on paper. But he was guided by an internal song, a melody that played in his head that manifested itself as toe taps and a renewed effort to match the song to piano keys.Fingers tapped keys as he tried to discern between the vibrations of one key and another. He reasoned that the keys were higher in pitch from the lowest at the left of the keyboard, to the highest at the right. Michael scribbled on his notepad a series of words and other shorthand he invented when he first started his journey into music at 12 years old. Michael dreamed of becoming a professional musician when he attended a concert with his parents where the pianist was playing music (which he could not hear, but could feel as vibrations in his seat). The vibrations were in a specific rhythm that caused Michael to \\"feel\\" the music as it was playing, and it subsequently filled his mind with many pictures and colors; he wanted to mimic that feeling by learning more about music and playing his own songs.Now, Michael's wife came into the room and took a seat. She listened intently as Michael stroked the keys in a stylistic, deft manner, the sounds filling the room and creating a tapestry of rhythm and melody.

It was also the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States.Katrina originated on August 23, 2005, as a result of the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten. Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and headed generally westward toward Florida. On August 25, two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach, it strengthened into a hurricane. After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and rapidly intensified. The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to a high-end Category 3 hurricane at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi.","answer":"Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 hurricane.

It would simplify the building process and ensure structural stability. However, the Store Street Aquaduct had to be built on a 45-degree skew. The builders pleaded with the city planners. They needed a workaround to avoid the skew, but the bureaucrats wouldn't say yes.William Jessop had been an engineer for Benjamin Outram, the lead architect for the project. Jessop suddenly remembered that his old boss, William Chapman, had already laid the roadwork they needed to travel on. Back in 1787, Chapman had a problem to deal with when he was building bridges for the Kildare Canal. When looking at the blueprints on a grid, Chapman suddenly realized he could use create a falsework parallel to the arches that would sustain the structure even with the odd skew. His work turned out successful, but Jessop and Outram had to perfect his plan if they wanted to successfully build the Store Street Aquaduct. Using the timber falsework method, the two builders marked out the position of the courses at the crown and the courses across the remainder of the arch. With that, thanks to Chapman's keen insight and Jessop's quick thinking, Outram completed the Store Street Aquaduct which still exists today."},{"question":"Write a simple blessing for a child that can be cross-stitched as a gift for the child's parents to welcome a new baby.

Charlie McCarthyCharlie McCarthy is perhaps the most famous ventriloquist's dummy in American history. Charlie, the creation of popular actor-ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (1903–1978), was a wise-for-his-years adolescent. Garbed in top hat and monocle (one round lens serving to correct vision, instead of the usual two-lensed glasses), he endlessly flirted with females and spouted wise-cracks to Bergen, his \\"guardian.\\" Even though he was carved from wood, Bergen made McCarthy seem so authentic that audiences came to view the dummy as a real person.Bergen conjured up McCarthy while still in high school and had him built at a cost of 35. The pair first teamed up in vaudeville (see entry under 1900s—Film and Theater in volume 1), then performed on radio and in films. Bergen added two additional dummies to his act: hayseed Mortimer Snerd and spinster Effie Klinker. (A hayseed is an unsophisticated country person; a spinster, an unmarried woman beyond the usual age of marrying.) Although both were popular, neither was as beloved as Charlie McCarthy.In 1937, Bergen earned a special Academy Award for creating Charlie. The special wooden Oscar presented to Bergen had a movable jaw, just like Charlie's. He influenced countless ventriloquists and puppeteers for generations to come, including Jim Henson (1936–1990), of Muppets (see entry under 1970s—TV and Radio in volume 4) and Sesame Street (see entry under 1970s—TV and Radio in volume 4) fame, who dedicated his feature film The Muppet Movie (1979) to Bergen. Bergen willed Charlie McCarthy to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.","answer":"Many consider Charlie McCarthy, the creation of popular actor-ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (1903–1978) to be the most famous American ventriloquist's dummy.

I can't teach a duck. Well, whatever, there's no way a duck can successfully pass my class.It's the end of the semester. I am still in shock. This duck is the best writer/law student I have ever seen. He always submits papers on time, he always goes to my extra help lessons, and this duck has never been late to my class even once! I don't think he even got sick this semester! Not to mention he has written the best papers I have ever seen and is the first student ever to receive a 100% in my class. At first, I was suspicious of the duck, but then I saw it take notes. It has someone carry around a computer for it, and it can type on the computer with its beak, one key at a time. He communicates through the computer and has never spoken, so I think it's just the smartest duck in the world. Over the semester, I have grown to like this duck a lot. I have written a recommendation letter for him that will help him land any job he wants.
