Passage:On May 10, United States President Andrew Johnson had declared that the rebellion and armed resistance was virtually at an end, and had made plans with government authorities for a formal review to honor the troops. One of his side goals was to change the mood of the capital, which was still in mourning following the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln a month before at Ford's Theater. Three of the leading Federal armies were close enough to participate in the procession. The Army of the Tennessee arrived via train. The Army of Georgia, also under the command of William T. Sherman, had just completed its Carolinas Campaign and had accepted the surrender of the largest remaining Confederate army, that of Joseph E. Johnston. It arrived from North Carolina in mid-May and camped around the capital city in various locations, across the Potomac River from the Army of the Potomac, fresh off its victories over Robert E. Lee in Virginia. It had arrived in Washington on May 12. Officers in the three armies who had not seen each other for some time (in some cases since before the war) communed and renewed acquaintances, while at times, the common infantrymen engaged in verbal sparring (and sometimes fisticuffs) in the town's taverns and bars over which army was superior.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.See one example below:Problem: I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMPSolution: jump leftExplanation: If the agent turned to the left and jumped, then the agent jumped to the left.Problem: I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUNSolution:","answer":"run around left thrice and run right twice"},{"question":"[QUESTION] Premise: \\"It appears to be a makeshift boat floating down a river while a woman is singing.\\"Hypothesis: \\"The woman is climbing a mountain while singing.\\"Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?A boat floating down a river cannot be on a mountain.The answer is no.Q: Given the sentence \\"People in colorful costumes and masks.\\" is it true that \\"People in masks.\\"?A: People in colorful costumes and masks is a rephrasing of people in masks.The answer is yes.QUESTION: Given the sentence \\"A group of men in uniform and formation carrying trumpets.\\" can we conclude that \\"The man are not in uniform.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noLet's solve it slowly: If you are in uniform then it is impossible to be considered not in uniform.The answer is no.[QUESTION] Given the sentence \\"A customs officer leaning on a bike rack outside of an office building.\\" is it true that \\"A customs officer smokes a cigarette during a quick break.\\"?Leaning on a rack does not imply he smokes a cigarette.The answer is it is not possible to tell.Q: Premise: \\"A tourist dressed in black with long red-hair stands at a blue gate ready to take a photo with the camera strapped around her neck.\\"Hypothesis: \\"The woman is holding a cell phone camera.\\"Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?A: The person can't take a photo with a cell phone while using a camera.The answer is no.[QUESTION] If \\"Girl jumping into the air on top of a rock in front of a canyon.\\" does that mean that \\"The girl is jumping into the water at the pool.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- no","answer":"She could not be jumping on a rock and into the water at the same time.The answer is no."},{"question":"Teacher:A text is given in English.

How many female fish does she have?Let \\"x\\" be the cost in dollars of the Taco Grande Plate. Since twice the cost of John's Taco Plate equals the cost of Mike's Taco Plate plus added items, then 2x = x + 2 + 4 + 2. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = x + 8. Subtracting x from each side of the equation, we are left with x = 8 dollars as the cost of the Taco Grande Plate. Thus the combined total cost of Mike and John's lunch is 8 + 8 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 24 dollars.The answer: 24Reverse engineering the question: Mike and John dined at the Taco Palace restaurant. They each ordered the Taco Grande Plate as their main meal, but Mike also ordered a side salad for 2, a plate of cheesy fries for 4, and a diet cola for 2. As a result, Mike's lunch bill was twice as large as John's bill. What was the combined total cost, in dollars, of Mike and John's lunch?Reasoning and answer: Let X be the price of a child ticket. So the price of an adult ticket is X * 2. We know from the problem that 400 * X * 2 + 200 * X = 16,000. After multiplying, we have 800 * X + 200 * X = 16,000. Combining like terms, we have 1000 * X = 16,000. Dividing both sides by 1000, we have X = 16. The price of an adult ticket is 16 * 2 = 32.The answer: 32What was the question?Question: 400 adults and 200 children go to a Broadway show.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content.One example: For a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually funny! Maureen Stapleton is a scene stealer. The Moroni character is an absolute scream. Watch for Alan The Skipper Hale jr. as a police Sgt.Solution is here: positiveExplanation: There is an expression of appreciation in this movie review, hence we can say it's positive.Now, solve this: I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment \\"Uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie.\\" Thus entereth the \\"Almighty Solo Movie Night\\"!Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather enjoyable movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a good time.*7/10*On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'question:CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : My (22) boyfriend and I (22) have a games night with our friends on the weekends every once in a while, and I planned a Christmas dinner/games night with them all for this Sunday.  It’ll be at his dads place, which is new and fairly roomy. His dad is never there, so we take care of the house (2 story, basement, 3 bathroom, 4 bedroom) just us two. I planned to cook an entire meal for everyone (11 people including us) , being a couple of beef roasts, mashed potatoes, veggies, desserts..etc. We’ve yet to get groceries/decorations because we’ve both had a busy work week. I talked with him loosely about going out tonight to get groceries after he’s done helping a buddy with some body work on his car. Early today we talked about seeing eachother tonight still. He was seeing a different buddy (a long time friend, one who will be at the party on Sunday) tomorrow just to hangout for half the day, but not long ago today he asked if it was alright if he could sleepover at his place tonight.  It stressed me out (I have a serious anxiety disorder) because I was expecting one thing and he kind of surprised me by changing the plans around that I had set in my head. I told him we had a lot to do still to prepare for Sunday, and he said okay and that he had canceled the plans, but I knew I upset him by the way the tone of his messages changed. I got even more stressed and upset because I knew I upset him and I felt like an asshole for seemingly “making” him do this all with me. He was supposed to hangout with his friend for a bit tomorrow(Saturday), while I would bake cookies and start preparing. So, it’s hard for me to understand why I am such a bad guy here. I get that he sees this friend often during our game nights, but not just the two of them alone, so he was looking forward to that.. but why couldn’t he just see him tomorrow? Maybe when I was upset, it upset him, like the way I felt?.. I don’t know. He shuts down when we fight, and needs space while I just want to resolve things and feel better ASAP.  We are trying to work on our communication, because it’s not the best. I’m very stressed about doing all the preparing for myself now. I don’t have a car to get around places.  We ended up having a fight, and I feel horrible about it all. Maybe I can’t see what I’m doing wrong. AITA?answer:yesquestion:CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : So, a lot of times over small things like being in mid game when foods gets done and i ask to finish the game she has fully screamed at me, got in my face and I've always tried to stay calm and have other than 2 times where I shouted back, but one time a year ago same situation as I stated at the start except she came in none stop screaming at me and going near my pc threatening to unplug it which she knows may break it since its happened in the past.This time I lost all my cool and pushed her and she fell over, i just wanted to shove, not to push her over but even still i never felt bad and still dont even though every one was very mad at me for it.So i wanted a few opinions on people's perspective on mine and her actions. Thanks for reading.answer:yesquestion:CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : So basically on Sunday we went to my fiancé’s parents to celebrate his sister’s birthday. The whole time we were there she mocked me in various ways(my religion, the holidays I take and our car) and no one said a word to make her stop. I was very hurt by it but kept my cool until we got home where I explained to my fiancé exactly why I was hurt and he offered to talk to his parents to see what was wrong as she has never acted like this before(which I agreed was fair). He spoke to his mother and asked her what was up with his sister and was told basically in their church(different branch of the same tree to my religion) there had been some women who had celebrations happening soon and she hadn’t been invited to any of them and had felt left out. AITA for when I found out having no sympathy for it. I feel it wasn’t my fault they cut her out and it wasn’t fair for her to take her anger out on me? I feel like my fiancé wants to forget it but I feel I am owed an apology especially as this was nothing to do with me. Half of me thinks she may not have been invited as she doesn’t have a job that pays well and she may have not been invited as they knew she wouldn’t be able to afford it and they didn’t want to either make her feel bad (or more likely in my opinion) have to deal with her bile about things costing too much. (On Boxing Day she made many comments to her family about how people spending over £50 per person on a hen night was obscene and that when she goes to weddings she doesn’t buy them anything not even a card which I find disgusting as these people have paid money for you to come for you to not even buy a card to thank them) Am I the Asshole in this situation or are we both in the wrong? answer:","answer":"yes"},{"question":"Is the following sentence factually correct?\\"Mesopotamia loved holding rock band concerts in its streets.\\"Options:- yes- noYour chain-of-thought:","answer":"This sentence is false because rock concerts didn't exist when Mesopotamia was an active civilization.

Strauss initially perceived Manson as a \\"phony\\" who had gotten on the gothic rock bandwagon very late; he later came to see Manson as a \\"really interesting, really intelligent artist\\" with many talents. He went to talk to Manson at a Holiday Inn in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Manson asked Strauss to join him in a hot tub, commenting \\"This is going to be an important piece of press.\\" Strauss wrote a cover story about Manson for Rolling Stone, which in the view of the Chicago Reader Jim DeRogatis \\"legitimized Manson's emergence as one of the most notorious entertainers of the 90s and an enthusiastic bogeyman for the right\\". Following the publication of the article, Strauss became Manson's business partner. Later, Manson and Strauss got a deal to write the singer's autobiography for ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins founded by Judith Regan, who was behind Howard Stern's Private Parts (1997). The autobiography shares its title with the Marilyn Manson song \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" (1997) and features an introduction written by film director David Lynch; Manson had previously contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Lynch's film Lost Highway (1997) and would later collaborate with the director on a coffee table book titled Genealogies of Pain (2011).

The price was reasonable and I feel that I got the quality I paid for. Very solid and heavy. Runs smoothly and has all the capacity I need for now. The fact that it has an available extension bed is nice, although I do not have a need for it right now.The only complaint so far is the tailstock which slips slightly when the live center is pushed into the stock. I have to push very hard on the locking lever to get it to stay put. With alittle adjustment of the lever bolt, I can usually get it to stay in place. This is the only improvement I think is necessary on a lathe of this category.All in all... you won't go wrong with this lathe.

Review: I have read most of Robin Cook's previous novels and was prepared to enjoy this one. The beginning grabed my interest but when he got his characters in to the center of the Earth it all goes to pieces. Lots of loose ends. If all they wanted a professional oceanographer why did they abduct the two divers? It they were as advanced as infered, they should have been able to solve the problem on their own. The two divers were totally over the top. Their actions were not consistent with their situation. If I were a Navy Diver I would be offended by these two characters. Then there is the end? The book doesn't end. I kept looking for another chapter or at least a few more pages. So many unanswered questions. Robin Cook has done better.

I couldn't get the 'tare' function to work and then I couldn't get the 'off' button to work. It did however eventually turn off on its own. In addition, after a few minutes, the scale started reading a couple of ounces even with nothing on the scale. The scale was on the counter top (flat obviously) and was not near any other electronics.I assumed my problems were a fluke; I processed a return and Amazon had a replacement scale on my door step in two days (Amazon worked perfectly during the return process).

They are so bad, I have to throw them away and buy something that works.The problem with these cans is with the plastic funnel. First it's very difficult to install because the clearance between the spring loaded cap and the funnel is too small to allow the funnel to fit. And it's so fat, that you can't empty more than about 1/3 the can into a vehicle's gas tank. The funnel doesn't fit very well, so it ends up leaking gas on the floor under the can, and getting it all over you in the process. The only way to get gas into a vehicle is to buy a gooseneck funnel to stick in the filler pipe, and then pour the gas from these horribly designed cans into the funnel.We're so stupid now, that we can't even design a gas can that works. This so called \\"certified safety can\\" leaks gas all over the area where it's being used, and takes two people to use.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!

Construct the question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) it is answerable from the passage, (iii) its answer is unique (iv) it answer uses text phrases from the passage. Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage.Example: Context: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).Answer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.Output: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?The question is based on the following sentences from the two passages (i) Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) {ii) In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (iii) As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. and (iv) ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia.New input case for you: Context: Conflicting results have been reported regarding the predicative roles of alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells on the outcomes of transplantation in leukaemia patients.', 'We prospectively analysed the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of donor-recipient pairs and the KIR typing of the donors in 97 CML patients to address the predictive roles of NK cells in relapse undergoing T-cell-replete haploidentical transplantation.', \\"Patients with class I ligands for the donor-inhibitory KIR gene exhibited decreased molecular and haematologic relapse rates (P=0.003 and P=0.015, respectively). There was a significantly reduced risk of molecular and haematologic relapse in patients with HLA-C1C2 or C2C2 who accepted donors with KIR2DS1 or in patients with HLA-Bw4 who accepted donors with KIR3DS1 ('recipient with relevant KIR ligand for donor-activating KIR', n=25), compared with the remaining transplants (n=72, P=0.009 and P=0.009, respectively). In addition, the presence of class I ligand in the recipients of donor-activating KIR contributed to a decreased relapse rate in patients lacking class I ligand in the recipient of donor-inhibitory KIR (P=0.04 and P=0.03, respectively).Answer: This study suggests that the presence of class I ligands for the donor-activating or donor-inhibitory KIR gene in the recipient might confer some protection against leukaemic relapse in T-cell-replete haploidentical transplantation.Output:","answer":"Does hLA and KIR genotyping correlate with relapse after T-cell-replete haploidentical transplantation in chronic myeloid leukaemia patients?"},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

Mike Yassa is a neurobiology professor.He and other researchers wanted to know if caffeine could improve a person's memory.He explains,\\"After you learn anything,it takes some time for that memory to strengthen.And over the first 24 hours is actually where most of   the forgetting happens.So that is where we wanted to intervene with caffeine and see if we can help reduce this forgetting.\\" They took 160 caffeine-free people and showed them pictures of everyday objects. These people were asked if the objects could be found inside the house, or outdoors.Then some of the subjects were given a caffeine pill.The others were given a placebo--a pill containing nothing. 24 hours later,the subjects were shown the exact same images from the day before.They were also shown images with slight differences,and some completely new images. Both groups correctly identified the exact same and completely new pictures.But those who took the caffeine pill were better at spottingthe pictures that were slightly different. Professor Yassa says their answers helped to show the effects of caffeine on memory. And  we find that if they are on caffeine they are much more likely to make the right decision.\\" The amount of caffeine the researchers used in the study was similar to one cup of strong coffee.The researchers did not see any improvement to memory from smaller doses of caffeine or when it was given an hour before viewing the images.

Another word for criticism is appreciation.When I criticize or appreciate some objector another, I look for its good points and bad points.In reading any printed or written matter, I always have a pencil in hand and put any comments in the book or on a separate paper.In other words, I always talk back to the writer. That sort of critical reading might well be called creative reading because I am thinking along with the author, asking him questions, seeing whether he answers the questions and how well he answers them.I mark the good passages to store them in my memory piece of writing; where, how and why could or should I improve upon it?

A plot of the story below is true ... but did it really happen quite like this? Our story begins not in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic, but rather thousands of miles away in Egypt. It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery   of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3,000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the askingprice. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away. The nowterrified Murray decided he would get rid of the _ case as soon as he arrived in London. A lady he knew named Janet Jones said she would like it, so he gave it to her. Shortly afterwards, Jones' mother died, and she herself caught a strange disease. She tried returning the mummy, but naturally Murray refused it. In the end, it was presented to the British Museum. Even in the museum, the mummy apparently continued to cause strange events. A museum photographer died shortly after taking pictures of the new exhibit, and a manager also died for no apparent reason. In the end, the British Museum decided to get rid of the mummy too. They sold it to a collector in New York. At the start of April 1912, arrangements for the transfer were complete, and the mummy began the journey to its new home. But the New Yorker never received the mummy or its case. For when the Titanic sank, one of the objects in its strongroom was the mummy case. Or so they say.  Question: According to the passage, where is the Egyptian mummy now?  Options: (A) At the British Museum. (B) In New York. (C) In Egypt. (D) Under the sea.answer:Dquestion:Article: A terrible competition is going on in England, with billions of dollars and hundreds of lives at risk. OK, that's not true. But competitors from around the world gathered on Thursday for the annual competition to compete for the world's biggest person who tells lies. Each participant is given up to five minutes to make up the best _ in the contest, which was founded in honor of 19th-century Bridge Inn landlord Will Ritson, who was reportedly famous for his lies. Competitors gather at the Bridge Inn every year for the competition, a small pub in northwestern England. Anyone but lawyers and politicians can take part in the competition. A study found that nearly all lies are detectable   through visible facial muscle reactions in the person telling a lie. \\"Thus, while interpersonal cheat often is highly successful, signs of hidden emotional states are communicated clearly to the informed observer,\\" the study concluded. A churchman of Carlisle reportedly holds what may be the greatest lie of all time in the competition, simply stating, \\"I have never told a lie in my life.\\" In 2003, Abrie Krueger from South Africa became the first one to win the competition. In 2006, comedian Sue Perkins became the first female to win the competition, telling a tale about people riding camels to work as a result of climate change.  Question: Why does the author tell a lie at the beginning of the passage?  Options: (A) He likes telling lies. (B) He intends to talk about a contest. (C) Lies can be detected by someone. (D) Nearly everyone has told lies.answer:Bquestion:Article: If you're tired of the Mediterranean and don't want to head to Disney again, perhaps it's time for a summer holiday in space.

Hosting just seven guests in a four cabins, the accommodation will boast huge windows with views back to earth and tasty microwave meals will be served instead of the ones often used by astronauts. Just getting there will be an adventure in itself--it will take two days aboard a Soyuz rocket--and it won't exactly be a _ holiday: A five-day stay will cost youPS100, 000 toPS500, 000 for your journey. The hotel is due to open by 2016 and, according to those behind it, will be far more comfortable than the International Space Station (ISS) used by astronauts and cosmonauts. In the weightlessness of space, visitors can choose to have beds that are either vertical or horizontal. Tourists, who will be accompanied by experienced crew, will dine on food prepared on Earth and sent up on the rocket, to be reheated in microwave ovens. Many kinds of delicacies will be available. Iced tea, mineral water and fruit juices will be available, but alcohol will be strictly prohibited. Toilets will use flowing air instead of water to move waste through the system. Waste water will be recycled. Sergei Kostenko, chief executive of Orbital Technologies which will construct the hotel, said: \\"Our planned module inside will not remind you of the International Space Station. A hotel should be comfortable inside, and it will be possible to look at the Earth. The hotel will be aimed at wealthy individuals and people working for private companies who want to do research in space.\\" The hotel can also be used as an emergency bolthole   for astronauts aboard the International Space Station if there is a crisis.

The story begins on a cold, windy day in fictional Dickson County (representing Dickinson County, Iowa) with Martha Hale being abruptly called to ride to a crime scene. In the buggy is Lewis Hale, her husband, Sheriff Peters, the county sheriff, and Mrs. Peters, the sheriff's wife. She rushes out to join them in the buggy, and the group sets off. They arrive at the crime scene: the Wrights' lonesome-looking house. Immediately Mrs. Hale exhibits a feeling of guilt for not visiting her friend Minnie Foster since she married and became Mrs. Wright (the dead man's wife) twenty years prior. Once the whole group is safely inside the house, Mr. Hale is asked to describe to the county attorney what he had seen and experienced the day prior. Despite the serious circumstances, he delivers his story in a long-winded and poorly thought-out manner, tendencies he struggles to avoid throughout. The story begins with Mr. Hale venturing to Mr. Wright's house to convince Wright to get a telephone. Upon entering the house, he finds Mrs. Wright in a delirious state and comes to learn that Mr. Wright has allegedly been strangled. The women's curious nature and very peculiar attention to minute details allows them to find evidence of Mrs. Wright's guilt and of her provocations and motives. Meanwhile, the men are unable to procure any evidence. The women find the one usable piece of evidence: the dead bird in the box. It's stated that Minnie used to love to sing and her husband took that away from her. But now finding her bird is dead, with a broken neck (with the implication that the husband killed it) it is evident Mrs. Wright killed her husband. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters use their knowledge and experience as two \\"midwestern rural women\\" to understand Mrs. Wright's suffering when the only living thing around her has died. The women find justification in Mrs. Wright's actions and go about hiding what they find from the men. In the end, their obstruction of evidence will seemingly prevent a conviction. The story ends here, and does not move into the occurrences after they leave the house.Answer this question: where does a jury of her peers take place?Student B:OK...

Milton the mouse eats 1/100 as much as Greta the goose eats per day, but Elmer the elephant eats 4000 times more than Milton the mouse does per day. How much more, in pounds, does Elmer the elephant eat per day than Penelope the pig?[Answer]Greta the goose eats 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of food per day. Milton the mouse eats (1 / 100) * 2 = 1 / 50 of a pound of food per day. Elmer the elephant eats 4000 * (1 / 50) = 80 pounds of food per day. Thus, Elmer eats 80 - 20 = 60 pounds more food per day than does Penelope the pig. The answer is 60.Q: Sanya can wash 7 bath towels in one wash, which will take 1 hour.

On average, how many hours does he need to hang upside down each month to be tall enough next year to ride the rollercoaster?Reasoning: He is 6 inches too short this year because 54 - 48 = 6. He will naturally grow 4 inches taller because 12 x (1 / 3) = 4. He needs to grow 2 inches from hanging because 6 - 4 = 2. He needs to hang for 24 hours because 2 / (1 / 12) = 24.

If you are still confused, see the following example:Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior. Question: What is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid?Solution: TrueReason: The paragraph comes from the wikipedia page on the brain.

I bought it because I read another one of Babson's books, \\"In the Company of Cats,\\" and I loved it. This one, however, was very much lackluster in comparison. It just seemed to drag on forever, especially with needless details. Do you really need to know what the coffee tastes like, down to the very last milliliter? Or what color every flower in the garden is? Are these clues supposed to help the reader solve the crime? It just felt like the story was trudging forward with few real plot twists. It wasn't exciting and definitely wasn't a \\"couldn't put it down\\" sort of book. At only 192 pages, it took me forever to read. Also, one of the reasons I wanted to read this book is because I love cats, and the cat in the book had no real role. The story wouldn't have lost anything without him. He was just awkwardly shoved into the story but had nothing to do with it. All in all, disappointed with this book. Is this product review negative?A:output: YesTitle: Excellent, but . . .

Any non-driving vehicle passenger thus is permitted to possess an open container and consume alcohol in Missouri while the vehicle is in motion, although 31 smaller municipalities, the largest being Independence and St. Charles, have local open container laws. The metropolises of St. Louis and Kansas City have no local open container laws, and thus the state law (or lack thereof) governs. This makes it possible for a passenger to drink legally through the entire 250-mile (400 km) trip across Missouri on Interstate 70 between Downtown Kansas City and Downtown St. Louis, only closing the container while passing through the city limits of Independence, Bates City, Columbia, Foristell, and St. Charles.Question: can you drink in missouri as a passenger[EX A]:","answer":"1"},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A band on stage signing to a group of fans.\\" that \\"The band was brightly dressed in their stage costumes.\\"?Options:- yes- no- it is not possible to tell Step by step answer:","answer":"Not all bands are brightly dressed in their stage costumes while singing on stage.

How much more did coach A spend than coach B?A: Coach A spent 29x 10 = 290 for the 10 basketballs. Coach B spent 2.50x14 = 35 for the 14 baseballs. So, Coach B spent a total of 35 + 18 = 53 for the baseballs and a bat. Thus, Coach A spent 290 - 53 = 237 more than coach B. The answer is 237.Question: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour. Oliver can read 40 pages. How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?Answer: Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver who can read 40 pages so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages. Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy who can read 60 pages so he can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 30.[Question]Joanna and Jacques had 40 and 60 gumballs, respectively, in their dishes. They then purchased 4 times the number of gumballs they had initially and added these to their dishes. If they decided to put together their gumballs and shared them equally, how many gumballs did each get?[Answer]When Joanna purchased 4 times the number of gumballs she initially had, she added 40 * 4 = 160 gumballs to her dish. The total number of gumballs Joanna had in her dish after buying 160 more is 160 + 40 = 200. At the same time, Jacques bought 60 * 4 = 240 new gumballs. When Jacques added his new 240 gumballs to his dish, the total number of gumballs increased to 240 + 60 = 300 gumballs. When they decided to put together their gumballs, they had 300 + 200 = 500 gumballs altogether. After sharing equally, each person got 500 / 2 = 250 gumballs. The answer is 250.Q: Ian had twenty roses. He gave six roses to his mother, nine roses to his grandmother, four roses to his sister, and he kept the rest. How many roses did Ian keep?A: Ian gave a total of 6 + 9 + 4 = 19 roses. Therefore, Ian kept 20 - 19 = 1 rose. The answer is 1.Question: Brendan has entered a kickboxing competition and wins matches against multiple contestants. He wins all of the matches in the first 2 rounds, each of which had 6 matches, then wins half of the 4 matches in the last round. How many matches did Brendan win throughout the competition?Answer: In the first 2 rounds, Brendan wins a total of 2 rounds * 6 matches per round = 12 matches. In the last round, Brendan wins half of the matches which is 4 matches / 2 = 2 matches. Throughout the competition, Brendan has therefore won 12 + 2 = 14 matches. The answer is 14.Q: There are 110 calories in a serving of cheese. Rick buys the large blocks that have 16 servings per block.

We (me, him, our daughter) attended the services on Friday, almost 3 hours from our house. When he and I moved in together, he hadn't talked with that set of grandparents in years. Nothing happened, they were just never close, and weren't big talkers, so it just happened. I made it a point for him (along with me and our children) to reconnect.

First of all the book is too quick, it's not as in depth as I hoped it would be. There is too much words and not enough diagrams for my taste. Another issue I take is the type of models (body types) the book uses as examples. They all look like pudgy out of shape Roman era sketches which is rather dated for any contemporary art field. There are ZERO actual photos of people but rather charcoal sketches (some good, others decent and most useless). I would use the analogy that you wouldnt hire a home builder who ONLY studied how to make log cabin homes, so why would you buy a book that ONLY focuses on old world body archetypes that no one wants to see these days?

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances: 1972 -- 1974. The Denver Broncos (3 -- 5) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls. The Minnesota Vikings (0 -- 4) and the Bills have lost four. The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises: the Green Bay Packers (1966 -- 1967), the Miami Dolphins (1972 -- 1973), the Pittsburgh Steelers (1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979, the only team to accomplish this feat twice), the San Francisco 49ers (1988 -- 1989), the Dallas Cowboys (1992 -- 1993), the Denver Broncos (1997 -- 1998), and the New England Patriots (2003 -- 2004).

If Kendra went to the shop with a 100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.A: When Kendra bought 2 toys, she paid 2 * 20 = 40. Since the price of a hat is 10, when Kendra bought 3 hats, she paid 3 * 10 = 30. The total costs for the hats and wooden toys Kendra bought is 40 + 30 = 70. From the 100 bill, Kendra received change worth 100 - 70 = 30. The answer is 30.Question: There are 6 times as many lab coats as uniforms in the lab. The number of lab techs is half of the number of uniforms. If there are 12 uniforms in the lab, and the lab techs share the coats and uniforms equally among them, how many coats and uniforms in total does each lab tech get?Answer: If there are 12 uniforms, and the lab coats are 6 times as many as the number of uniforms, there are 6 * 12 = 72 lab coats. The total number of lab coats and uniforms in the lab is 72 + 12 = 84. If the number of lab techs is half the number of uniforms, then there are 12 / 2 = 6 lab techs. If they share the lab coats and uniforms equally, each lab tech will get 84 / 6 = 14 lab coats and uniforms. The answer is 14.[Question]A volcano erupts and spews ash into the sky.

She can run at a top speed of 13 miles per hour when she is without any load to carry, and she can travel at 11 miles per hour as her top speed when she carries a typical load. If she travels the 143 miles from Florence, Italy to Rome, Italy at top speed while carrying a typical load, then returns to Florence at her usual top speed without carrying a load, how long, in hours, will the trip take if she takes two 30-minute rest stops during each half of the trip?A: 30 minutes is 30 / 60 = 0.5 hours. Two 30 - minute rest stops take 0.5 * 2 - 1 hour. If she takes two rest stops per each half of the journey, then she takes 2 * 1 = 2 hours in rest time. With a load, at her top speed, she can travel 143 miles in 143 / 11 = 13 hours. Without a load, at her top speed, she can travel 143 miles in 143 / 13 = 11 hours. Thus, the round trip will take 13 + 11 + 2 = 26 hours. The answer is 26.Question: A state fair charges 5 for a ticket. Two-thirds of the people who buy a ticket will buy deep-fried fair food for 8, one quarter will go on a ride for 4, and one eighth will spend 15 on a souvenir. The fair made 2520 from tickets. How many dollars did they make in all?Answer: The fair made 2520 from tickets, so they had 2520 / 5 = 504 people attend the fair. Two - thirds of those people will buy food, so 504 * 2 / 3 = 336 people will buy food. The fair will make 336 * 8 = 2688 from food. A quarter of the people will go on a ride, so 504 / 4 = 126 people will go on a ride. The fair will make 126 * 4 = 504 from rides. An eighth of the people will buy a souvenir, so 504 / 8 = 63 people will buy souvenirs. The fair will make 63 * 15 = 945 from souvenirs. In all, the fair will make 2520 + 2688 + 504 + 945 = 6657. The answer is 6657.[Question]To improve her health, Mary decides to drink 1.5 liters of water a day as recommended by her doctor. Mary's glasses hold 250 mL of water. How many glasses of water should Mary drink per day to reach her goal?[Answer]Each liter of water holds 1000 mL. Mary's goal is to drink 1.5 liters of water a day, which in mL is 1.5 L * 1000 mL / L = 1500 mL. To reach her goal, Mary should drink 1500 mL / 250 mL / glass = 6 glasses of water per day. The answer is 6.Q: Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy. 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions. If Ivy has 20 collectors edition dolls, how many dolls does Dina have?A: Ivy has 20 / 2 * 3 = 30 dolls. Dina has 30 * 2 = 60 dolls. The answer is 60.Question: Rick likes to separate his collection of books into various groups by genre. He has 400 books in total and proceeds to divide them into two separate equally-sized categories repeatedly until he has each book in a category with 24 other books. How many times must he break these groups into smaller groups to accomplish this?Answer: Rick starts with 400 books and divides them into two categories of equal size, meaning there are two categories of 400 / 2 = 200 books. Rick repeats this process again, dividing the 200 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 200 / 2 = 100 books in each. Rick repeats this process again, dividing the 100 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 100 / 2 = 50 books in each. Rick repeats this process again, dividing the 50 book categories into equal halves, leaving him with 50 / 2 = 25 books in each. Since Rick is looking for categories with 25 books in each, he accomplishes this by the 4th step. The answer is 4.Q: After 100 new people move into a town, 400 of the original population move out. Every year afterward, the town’s population is halved. After 4 years, the population is 60 people. Before the new people moved in, how many people lived in the town?A:","answer":"If the population is halving then at the end of the third year, the population must have been 60 people in the fourth year * 2 = 120 people. In the second year, the population was 120 people in the third year * 2 = 240 people. And in the first year, the population was 240 people in the third year * 2 = 480 people. Additional people moved out in the first year, so accounting for these shows the population was 480 people + 400 people who moved out = 880 people. Then removing the new people shows there were originally 880 people – 100 new people = 780 people. The answer is 780."},{"question":"Premise: \\"An elderly couple are sitting on a park bench while looking at a pamphlet.\\"Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The elderly couple are enjoying time together.\\" is true?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- no Now, let's be accurate as possible.

Each generation of kittens he breeds has a tail 25% longer than the last generation. If the first generation has tails 16 cm long, how long are the third generation's tails?[Answer]First find how much longer the second generation's tails are: 25% * 16 cm = 4 cm. Then add that length to the first generation's tail length to find the second generation's tail length: 4 cm + 16 cm = 20 cm. Then find how much longer the third generation's tails are: 25% * 20 cm = 5 cm. Then add that length to the second generation's tail length to find the third generation's tail length: 5 cm + 20 cm = 25 cm. The answer is 25.Q: Out of the 400 emails that Antonia received in her mail, 1/4 were spam emails, while 2/5 of the remaining emails were promotional messages. If the rest of the emails were important emails, calculate the total number of important emails in her inbox.A: Out of the 400 emails, 1 / 4 * 400 = 100 emails were spam emails. The number of emails that were not spam emails is 400 - 100 = 300. 2 / 5 of the emails which were not spam were promotional emails, a total of 2 / 5 * 300 = 120 emails. If the rest of the emails were important emails, there were 300 - 120 = 180 important emails. The answer is 180.Question: Paula has 20 candies to be given out to her six friends. She needs to buy four additional candies so she can give an equal number of candies to her friends.

His car gets 30 miles per gallon in cities and 40 miles per gallon on the highway. The distance from his house to the Grand Canyon, one way, is 60 city miles and 200 highway miles. If gas costs 3.00 per gallon, how much will Carl need to spend?[Answer]First figure out how many city miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one - way number of city miles by 2: 60 miles * 2 = 120 miles. Then figure out how many highway miles Carl will drive round trip by multiplying the one - way number of highway miles by 2: 200 miles * 2 = 400 miles. Now divide the round - trip number of city miles by the number of city miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 120 miles / 30 mpg = 4 gallons. Now divide the round - trip number of highway miles by the number of highway miles per gallon Carl's car gets: 400 miles / 40 mpg = 10 gallons. Now add the gallons for the highway miles and the city miles to find the total number of gallons Carl needs to buy: 10 gallons + 4 gallons = 14 gallons. Finally, multiply the number of gallons Carl needs to buy by the cost per gallon to find out how much he spends: 14 gallons * 3.00 = 42.00.

She has clothes hanging on 7 pink hangers, 4 green hangers, one less blue hanger than there are green hangers, and one less yellow hanger than there are blue hangers. What is the total number of colored hangers in Fifi's closet?A: With 4 green hangers, 1 less blue hanger than there are green hangers is 4 - 1 = 3 blue hangers. With 3 blue hangers, 1 less yellow hanger less than there are blue hangers is 3 - 1 = 2 yellow hangers. With 7 pink hangers, the total number of colored hangers in Fifi's closet is 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16 hangers. The answer is 16.Question: Five friends eat at Wendy's and ordered the following: a platter of Taco Salad that cost 10, 5 orders of Dave's Single hamburger that cost 5 each, 4 sets of french fries that cost 2.50, and 5 cups of peach lemonade that cost 2 each.

The cost of 4 sets of french fries is 2.50 x 4 = 10. The cost of 5 cups of peach lemonade is 2 x 5 = 10. So, their total bill is 10 + 25 + 10 + 10 = 55.

He made 18 starts, not qualifying for the remaining fifteen races, although he ought to have started as the reserve in the 1982 Swiss Grand Prix. However, Ferrari withdrew Patrick Tambay's entry so late that Serra was not allowed to take part. Serra scored one championship point, for finishing sixth in the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix. After qualifying for the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix, Serra and countryman Raul Boesel had a short scuffle. Serra was furious at Boesel for blocking his last flying lap after waving Keke Rosberg by.

During the subsequent general election, Thurmond appeared in a campaign commercial for incumbent U.S. President Gerald Ford in his race against Thurmond's fellow Southerner, former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter.

They hired a caterer to make a plated meal for each guest at the wedding reception. The caterer always makes ten extra plates just in case something goes wrong. Each plate of steak and asparagus in garlic butter will have 8 asparagus spears on it. How many asparagus spears will the caterer need in all?Answer: Alex is inviting 84 * 2 / 3 = 56 guests. Bridgette and Alex’s guests will need 84 + 56 = 140 plates. The caterer makes 10 extra plates, so they will need 140 + 10 = 150 plates. To put 8 asparagus spears on each plate, the caterer will need 150 * 8 = 1200 asparagus spears.

How many hours does Steve spend with his family in a day?[Answer]Steve spends 24 / 3 = 8 hours sleeping. He spends 24 / 6 = 4 hours in school. He spends 24 / 12 = 2 hours making assignments. He spends 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 hours either sleeping, going to school, or making assignments. Hence, Steve spends 24 - 14 = 10 hours with his family.

Of the 26 boxes in her attic, 6 of the boxes contain pans, half of the remaining boxes contain decorations, and the rest of the boxes contain her teacups. Samuel breaks 2 of the cups every time he picks up one of the boxes. By the time Samuel has taken all of the teacups out of the boxes, how many teacups are left?A: Taking the boxes of pans out of the total attic boxes shows that 26 boxes – 6 boxes of pans = 20 boxes are either decorations or teacups. Since half of these boxes are decorations, the other half must be made up of 20 boxes / 2 = 10 boxes of teacups. Each box of cups initially has 5 rows x 4 cups = 20 teacups inside. Samuel breaks cups each time he picks up a box, which means each box now contains 20 – 2 = 18 teacups. Therefore, there are 10 boxes * 18 teacups = 180 teacups left. The answer is 180.Question: Sara's sister has 4 small notebooks in her closet. Last summer she ordered 6 more notebooks and then lost 2.

For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

A very seamless operation, indeed.To those who are skittish about switching to Tax Cut (i.e. afraid of change or the unknown) let me assure you, Tax Cut works just as well as Turbo Tax, but without the added problems of installation and operation. I say this, as a former Turbo Tax user from way back when it was part of Parsons Technology.I give Tax Cut a big Five Stars! And the Turbo Tax people need to take notice here.

Khrushchev charged Stalin with fostering a personality cult, despite maintaining support for the ideals of communism. The speech was highly critical of Stalin and his reign of terror, primarily denouncing the purges of the Soviet military and Communist Party, which had taken place during the latter part of the 1930s. The speech brought forth several accusations, notably those concerning the Moscow Trials, where rulings were made, based on forced confessions, which were obtained through torture. Judicial decisions were determined, based on liberal interpretations of Article 58 of the Russian SFSR Penal Code, which was introduced in 1927, in order to arrest individuals suspected of counter-revolutionary activities. Due process, in accordance with Soviet law, was often dismissed and replaced with summary proceedings issued by institutional commissions known as NKVD troikas, who issued sentences to the accused without representation, defense, or trial.Student:","answer":"On February 25, 1956, Khrushchev gave a clandestine speech to the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was entitled, \\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\\", which denounced Stalin and his protégés"},{"question":"Some random thoughts: The relevant information is: Castellanos is a Spanish habitational surname with the meaning \\"(from a place founded or inhabited by) Castilians\\".Generated quizz based on thoughtsQ: Castellanos is a Spanish habitational surname with the meaning \\"(from a place founded or inhabited by) Castilians\\".

They are usually made from large trees, mostly western red cedar, by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America (Washington, Oregon, and Canada's western province, British Columbia). The word totem derives from the Algonquian (most likely Ojibwe) word o doodem (oˈtuːtɛm), \\"(his) kinship group\\". The carvings may symbolize or commemorate cultural beliefs that recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events. The poles may also serve as functional architectural features, welcome signs for village visitors, mortuary vessels for the remains of deceased ancestors, or as a means to publicly ridicule someone. They may embody a historical narrative of significance to the people carving and installing the pole.

The division goes back at least as far as Aristotle (384 BC -- 322 BC), who distinguished between plants, which generally do not move, and animals, which often are mobile to catch their food. Much later, when Linnaeus (1707 -- 1778) created the basis of the modern system of scientific classification, these two groups became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Metaphyta or Plantae) and Animalia (also called Metazoa). Since then, it has become clear that the plant kingdom as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these organisms are still often considered plants, particularly in popular contexts.Question: who divided up the living world into just plants and animals?Student B:OK...

Fisher as Piquillo), was preceded by the one-act farce Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata. The latter was immediately replaced by a series of other curtain raisers. The composer conducted the first night's performance, and the theatre's music director, B. Simmons, conducted thereafter. The composer's brother, Fred Sullivan, starred as the Learned Judge, with Nellie Bromley as the Plaintiff. One of the choristers in Trial by Jury, W.S. Penley, was promoted in November 1875 to the small part of the Foreman of the Jury and made a strong impact on audiences with his amusing facial expressions and gestures. In March 1876, he temporarily replaced Fred Sullivan as the Judge, when Fred's health declined from tuberculosis. With this start, Penley went on to a successful career as comic actor, culminating with the lead role in the record-breaking original production of Charley's Aunt. Fred Sullivan died in January 1877.Question: who created the part of the learned judge on the original production of trial by jury?

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.PROBLEM: Some might find it annoying, others cute. But when your significant other is also key to winning Olympic gold, being so perfectly in tune can be essential.Having been together for 10 years, the Adcocks are finally realising their potential, becoming the first Britons to win a World Superseries title, badminton's equivalent of tennis' ATP Tour finals.The victory in Dubai came in some style too, cruising to straight-set victories in the semi-finals and final, having topped their group and beaten the world number two pair in the process.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThey also won Commonwealth gold in Glasgow last year and are now targeting a first British Olympic badminton medal since Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson at Athens 2004.\\"You get addicted to that success,\\" says 25-year-old Gabby. \\"It's such a high.\\"Chris, 26, adds: \\"Having those titles will hopefully give us confidence for Rio. If we play our best, we can beat anybody.\\"They are not the first couple to grace British badminton, but after meeting through the sport in their teens and marrying in 2013, they are planning to be the most successful.BBC Sport has been finding out what makes the Adcocks tick.Although not strictly on the plane to the Olympics yet, the world number seven pair's form and ranking points all but assure them a place in the mixed doubles in Brazil.They believe being free from the insecurity of qualification, coupled with the win in Dubai keeping them on an upwards trend, could propel them to success on the biggest stage.\\"Not having to worry about qualification and focusing on winning is such an advantage,\\" says Chris.\\"Of course we want a medal but I want to play well. I know if we play well we've got a chance. It's a challenge but it's something I know we can do.\\"Having grown up as a formidable mixed doubles pairing, the Adcocks were controversially split up prior to London 2012.The rationale was placing each with a more experienced partner to boost their chance, a move they both agree was tough, but ultimately right at the time.As Gabby was unsuccessfully paired with Rob Blair, Chris joined up with Imogen Bankier, leading to reports that he had 'dumped' his girlfriend but Gabby says rumours her and Bankier did not get on were \\"rubbish\\".\\"It was made a lot worse than reality,\\" she adds.\\"We were training together that morning and I got a text saying there's going to be something in the paper,\\" Chris says.\\"We opened it up and it said I was like a love rat. I couldn't believe it. Behind closed doors we had a good laugh about it.\\"Bankier and Chris won world silver in 2011, but were knocked out early in London.So, did the fact that the initial decision resulted in joy for Chris and despair for Gabby affect their relationship?\\"Honestly no! These are the experiences that make us stronger,\\" says Chris.Gabby adds: \\"When I was watching him at the Olympics I didn't think of me not going, In that moment I was so proud.\\"\\"I'm obsessed with him,\\" Gabby beams, and a quick scan of her Twitter feed confirms the statement.Cuddled together in picture after picture, a cute couple with love in their eyes - only it is not Chris with Gabby but Bowser, their pet dog.Yet with tournaments in destinations like Kuala Lumpar, Jakata and Dubai, it means being away from home for large periods of time - not an ideal situation when the other person that cares for your pet is travelling with you.\\"It's the most illogical thing we've ever done,\\" says Chris. \\"We travel together so don't miss each other. The biggest thing we miss is Bowser.\\"\\"Chris' dad was so against it,\\" adds Gabby, whose parents look after Bowser when they are abroad.\\"He is worth every second,\\" says Chris. \\"He's such a release for us. When you get home from training, he greets us with a squeak and brings you straight back to normal life.\\"As they are a pair that needs to work together for an end goal, psychology is pivotal in ironing out underlying tensions.For Gabby and Chris, those tensions might not actually be on the court, but stem from their personal relationship.Their go-to guy is Simon Drane - sports psychologist turned marriage councillor.\\"I always say we have couples therapy,\\" jokes Gabby. \\"He's the nicest guy and we meet up regularly as a friend.\\"So close is their relationship that upon sitting with Drane for the first time since reuniting as a pair at the end of 2012, the two decided to have some fun.\\"I said Gabby and I were having a bit of an issue,\\" recalls Chris. \\"Simon was rubbing his hands that he'd have something to work with.\\"I said that Gabby hates it when she's in the shower and then I go on the toilet. His mouth just dropped and he must have wondered what he'd go himself into.\\"We waited a few seconds whilst he stumbled for words and then burst out laughing.\\"With matching wedding date tattoos, the two are not adverse to a little body modification.More recently, Chris went a step further adding a half-sleeve on his left arm, complete with lion, roses and Commonwealth medal.However, Chris played his most recent tournament in a sleeveless top - and had forgotten to inform two people in particular about his tattoo.\\"He didn't tell his parents,\\" Gabby says.\\"They watch the live streaming and I said to Chris they're going to find out.\\"Chris adds: \\"I got a text from mum saying 'Christopher'.\\"That's when I know I'm in trouble. 'What is that on your arm. I hope you're stopping there.'Chris has the Olympic rings adorning his body and Gabby now hopes to match her husband having missed out on London 2012.\\"They are very addictive,\\" she said.\\"Having missed the first one, it's important to me. I won't get the rings before Rio though.\\"Being two of the best badminton players in the world, you would imagine Chris and Gabby were handy at physical education at school.Whilst Gabby takes great pride in her A* at GCSE, she takes even greater pleasure from beating Chris, who scored zero on his practical exam.\\"I got a B,\\" he says. \\"But I did break my leg when I was doing my GCSEs playing badminton.\\"When the school came to give my practical, they said we'll give you a 10 as you're European champion. The exam board wouldn't accept it because they hadn't seen me play.\\"Gabby adds: \\"Still got a B.\\"SOLUTION: Chris and Gabby Adcock are one of those couples that finish each other's sentences.PROBLEM: Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe visitors claimed six wickets for just 38 runs on day five to win the first Test in Durban.England regained the Ashes this summer but lost to Pakistan last month, winning six of their 14 Tests in 2015.\\"Potentially this team can do some really good things,\\" Cook said.\\"There's so much talent in this side but it will take relentless hard work.\\"Cook said the tourists will have to guard against a South Africa backlash in the next match, starting on Saturday in Cape Town, where England have not won since 1957.\\"It can turn very quickly. They have world-class players so we can't get too carried away,\\" he said.\\"But it would be nice to get our noses ahead again and to continue to put pressure on South Africa.\\"Nick Compton's grandfather Denis played in that 1957 victory by 312 runs, and Cook was full of praise for the current England number three's patient 85 from 236 balls in Durban. He had been out of the Test team since May 2013.\\"The way Nick played really set up the first innings,\\" Cook said. \\"He was a rock for us in that first innings. From that moment on, the guys bowled particularly well to take 20 wickets and we scored enough runs in the second innings.\\"James Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, missed the Durban Test with a calf injury, but was seen bowling at the ground before the final day began.Asked about the swing bowler's chances of being fit for Cape Town, Cook said: \\"He has had a tough week, bowling a lot and doing rehab. Hopefully he'll be fit.\\"He is hopeful of playing and it's looking good but we'll know in the next 48 hours.\\"We know what a strong side South Africa are in home conditions - but we're really prepared for this tour.\\"Meanwhile, England wicketkeeper-batsman Jonny Bairstow was delighted to claim the team's first stumping for 38 Test matches when he dismissed Temba Bavuma, having spilled a chance to stump AB de Villiers the previous day.\\"It doesn't necessarily make up for it because I was desperately disappointed to miss it. You work so hard on your game that when the opportunity arises you like to take it,\\" he told BBC Test Match Special.\\"To get another one and get into the game was really pleasing and something I can take forward.\\"Asked about South Africa's batting frailties, he said: \\"They are not the number one side in the world for nothing and have proven over a long period how good they are.\\"We've got to be mentally and physically prepared for what is going to be a very tough battle in the New Year Test match.\\"SOLUTION: England have taken \\"big strides forward over the last eight months\\", said captain Alastair Cook after his side eased to a 241-run victory in South Africa on Wednesday.PROBLEM: The 17-year-old from Dewsbury was questioned in April on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts.The North East Counter Terrorism Unit confirmed he will not face any charges under section 5 of the Terrorism Act.Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal, both 17, are feared to have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State.West Yorkshire Police and counter-terrorism officers are investigating.Speaking at the time of their disappearance in March, the boys' families said they were praying for the safe return of the \\"ordinary Yorkshire lads\\".Hassan's brother, Hammaad Munshi, was arrested in 2006 at the age of 16 after police found a guide to making napalm on his computer.He became the youngest person to be convicted under the Terrorism Act.SOLUTION:","answer":"A teenager arrested in connection with the disappearance of two boys believed to have gone to Syria has been released without charge."},{"question":"QYes / no, is the following a verifiable fact?\\"John Wayne Gacy terrorized the West Coast with frequent visits.\\"AnoHis crimes were largely kept to the Midwest.\\"Harvey Milk believed that Republicans were the best political party.\\"Is the above claim true?Options:- yes- nonoHarvey Milk was a Democrat politician from California.QIs the following a factual statement?\\"A Noble gas appears in the solid state at room temperature.\\"Options:- yes- noAnoJust by the name, noble gas it is very likely these elements are in gaseous form at room temperature.Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact?\\"Primates evolved into vertebrates starting with the genus Homo.\\"noThe genus Homo was not the first primate genus to be vertebrates.QYes / no, is the following a verifiable fact?\\"Safflower heals the sick and adds flavor to foods for cooking.\\"AyesSafflower is a plant used in medicine and cooking oil.QClaim: \\"Twin represents a pair of children or animals born at the same birth.\\"Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?Options:- yes- noA","answer":"yesTwins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy."},{"question":"[Q] Test for natural language inference.Premise: \\"A closeup of a dog licking his nose.\\"Hypothesis: \\"A dog is showing his tongue.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- no- it is not possible to tell[A] The dog is either licking his nose or showing his tongue.The answer is yes.[Q] Premise: \\"A drama group watching two performers dance.\\"Hypothesis: \\"A group watches two female performers dance.\\"Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?[A] Not all groups are drama groups.

The picture doesn't look at all like the actual product and the workmanship on the clarinet is just horrible. The cork on the upper middle joint was not shazed down enough so I couldn't even put the barrel on the brand new insturment. The worst part was I tried calling the Simba company to return the instrument because the policy says to call the company before you can ship the insturment for return. I called every day for a week and a half and left multiple messages yet no one has gotten back to me. My 30 days are up now so I am stuck with this piece of junk. Save yourself the cash and headaches because the product is of poor quality and the company doesn't stand behind it's warrenty.

Six sides total. Over 7 hours. Many parts are edited from the soap opera but it is still quite watchable. It also has english subtitles. Some nice extras as well. My biggest gripe all the discs were loose moving freely inside and got scratched alot due to it. Also noticed the audio track raises up and lowers down at times. Might be due to the scratches on the disc. The discs should be secured better inside the box they came in. Now I have to get an exchange for them.

Answer: | OPTIONS:- No- YesA: YesQ: Is this product review positive? Title: Insightful! Review: You may have regarded Queen Elizabeth I of England in many ways - as a ruler, as a dramatic historical figure, as the prototype of a powerful woman, but have you ever thought of her as a corporate manager? Alan Axelrod has. He explains how the Virgin Queen exemplified principles of good business leadership during her reign from 1558 to 1603. He shows how these ideals helped her survive to become queen and how she used them to transform England from a tumultuous country to a powerful empire. Lessons from her rule can show any CEO a few things about leadership in perilous times. The book's combination of management principles with the drama of Elizabethan history makes for compelling reading. One critical note - the book skips around historically, which muddies the sequence of events. Otherwise, we at getAbstract recommend this excellent mix of enjoyable historical reading with powerful reminders about the fundamental principles of effective leadership.

She and her husband each have 1 whole slice and her daughters split 1 slice. She uses a thick sliced bread that comes 12 slices per loaf. Over 52 weeks, how many loaves of bread will she need to make french toast?Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: She and her husband have 1 slice each and her children split 1 slice so that's 1 + 1 + .5 + .5 = 3 slices. She makes 3 pieces of french toast on Saturday and Sunday for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 slices per weekend. If she uses 6 slices per weekend then over 52 weeks she will have used 6 * 52 = 312 slices. She gets 12 slices per loaf and she needs 312 slices so she needs 312 / 12 = 26 loaves.So the answer is 26.Question: Roberto is out for a hike. He travels uphill at 2 MPH and downhill at 3MPH. The trail is 5 miles long. 60% is uphill and the rest is downhill. How long does it take him to complete it in minutes?Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: There is 3 miles uphill because 5 x .6 = 3. This takes him 1.5 hours because 3 / 2 = 1.5. This takes him 90 minutes because 1.5 x 60 = 90. 40% of the trail is downhill because 100 - 60 = 40. There are 2 miles of downhill because 5 x .4 = 2. This takes him 2 / 3 of an hour because 2 / 3 = (2 / 3). This takes him 40 minutes because 60 x (2 / 3) = 40. It takes him 130 minutes in total because 90 + 40 = 130.So the answer is 130.Question: There are 7 mL of solution in each of 6 test tubes. Dr. Igor takes all of the solution and then evenly distributes it into 3 beakers. How many mL of solution are in each beaker?Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: 7 * 6 = 42 mL. 42 / 3 = 14 mL. Each beaker holds 14 mL of solution.So the answer is 14.Question: Wade has called into a rest stop and decides to get food for the road.

So the sandwiches cost a total of 26 total spending - 8 spending on drinks = 18. Therefore, each sandwich costs 18 for sandwiches / 3 sandwiches = 6.So the answer is 6."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Italian.

It loses 2 gallons of water per hour. Hayden does not add any water for the first two hours. He adds 1 gallon of water to the tank in hour three. He adds three gallons of water to the tank in the fourth hour. How much water is left in the tank at the end of the fourth hour?Answer: Over the four hours, the tank loses 2 * 4 = 8 gallons of water. Hayden adds a total of 1 + 3 = 4 gallons of water. At the end of the four hours, there is 40 - 8 + 4 = 36 gallons of water left in the tank.

How much will his total profit be?Answer: Niko will earn 2 x 25 / 100 = 0.5 profit for each of the first four pairs of socks. So, his total profit for the four pairs of socks will be 0.5 x 4 = 2. His total earnings for the 5 pairs of socks is 0.2 x 5 = 1. Therefore, his total profit will be 2 + 1 = 3. The answer is 3.Question: Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles that she needed to sell at 2 each to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift. However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at 2 because the regular price was 1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to 1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost.Answer: Lilith had 5 dozen water bottles, and since a dozen has 12 water bottles, the total number of water bottles she had was 12 bottles / dozen * 5 dozen = 60 bottles. To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith originally had to sell her water bottles for a total of 60 bottles * 2 / bottle = 120. When she reduced the price to 1.85 to meet the regular price, the total amount of money she had from the sales was 1.85 / bottle * 60 bottles = 111. To buy her friend the birthday gift, Lilith has to find 120 - 111 = 9 more. The answer is 9.Question: Jackson wants to start saving for the vacation that he’s taking next August, 15 months away.

Title: Suspenders did not hold up Review: This outfit was perfect. My 17 month old son was a ring bearer in my sister-in-law's wedding and this outfit was so cute. Per other reviews, I did order a size larger and the fit was good. My son is in the 50th percentile for weight and height, so I do recommend ordering a size up. My issue is with the suspenders. The clasps did not stay in place. The clasp for the back broke within the hour he had the outfit on before the wedding and as he moved around the other clasps would come undone. We had to use safety pins to keep them in place until the wedding was over. No one was any the wiser, but imagine trying to put safety pins on a very active, rambunctious 17 month old boy.

The daily rate is 125.00 There is a 100.00 pet fee. There is also a 20% service/cleaning fee for the rental. They need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit. How much is their security deposit?A: There are 7 days in a week and they're going for 2 weeks so that's 7 * 2 = 14 days. The daily rate is 125.00 and they are staying for 14 days so that's 125 * 14 = 1,750.00. There is also a 100.00 pet fee on top of their rental fee of 1,750.00 so that's 100 + 1750 = 1850.00. There is a 20% fee on the 1,850.00 so the fee comes to .20 * 1850 = 370.00. The rental will costs 1,850.00 and there is 370.00 service / cleaning fee for a total of 1850 + 370 = 2,220.00. They need to pay 50% of the entire bill as a security deposit so that will be .5 * 2220 = 1,110.00. The answer is 1110.Question: Scott wants to make and freeze a large batch of ratatouille. At the farmers' market he buys 5 pounds of eggplants and 4 pounds of zucchini at 2.00 a pound. He needs 4 pounds of tomatoes that are 3.50 a pound. The onions are 1.00 a pound and he needs 3 pounds. Then he needs a pound of basil which is sold for 2.50 per half pound. If this yields 4 quarts, how much does each quart cost?Answer: He buys 5 pounds of eggplants and 4 pounds of zucchini so he buys 5 + 4 = 9 pounds of produce. These 9 pounds are 2.00 a pound for a total of 9 * 2 = 18.00. He needs 4 pounds of tomatoes that are 3.50 a pound for a total of 4 * 3.50 = 14.00. He needs 3 pounds of onions that are 1.00 a pound so that's 3 * 1 = 3.00. The basil is sold by the half - pound and he needs a full pound so that's 2.50 * 2 = 5.00. The eggplants and zucchinis cost 18.00, the tomatoes are 14.00, the onions are 3.00 and the basil is 5.00 for a total of 18 + 14 + 3 + 5 = 40.00. This recipe makes 4 quarts and the total price of the vegetables was 40.00 so each quart costs 40 / 4 = 10.00. The answer is 10.[Question]Mr. Callen bought 10 paintings at 40 each and 8 wooden toys at 20 each from the crafts store to resell at a profit. However, when he sold the items, the selling price of a painting was 10% less and the selling price of a hat 15% less. Calculate the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items.[Answer]If he sold a painting at a 10% loss, then he made a 10 / 100 * 40 = 4 loss on each painting. since he bought 10 paintings, the total loss he made from selling the paintings is 10 * 4 = 40. He also made a loss of 15 / 100 * 20 = 3 loss from selling each wooden toy. Since he bought 8 wooden toys, the total loss he made was 3 * 8 = 24. In total, Mr. Callen made a loss of 40 + 24 = 64 from the sales of the items. The answer is 64.Q: John reels in 3 crab baskets a week. Each basket holds 4 crabs. He collects crabs twice a week. Each crab sells for 3. How much money does he make?A: He collects 3 * 4 = 12 crabs each time. He thus collects 12 * 2 = 24 crabs a week. So he makes 24 * 3 = 72 a week. The answer is 72.Question: Katya sold 8 glasses of lemonade and Ricky sold 9 glasses of lemonade. If Tina sold twice as many as Katya and Ricky's combined sales, how many more glasses of lemonade than Katya did Tina sell?Answer: Katya and Ricky sold 8 + 9 = 17 glasses of lemonade. Tina sold 17 x 2 = 34 glasses of lemonade. Tina sold 34 - 8 = 26 more glasses of lemonade than Katya. The answer is 26.Q: Greta worked 40 hours and was paid 12 per hour.

We’re all waiting in a long ass line at a cheesesteak place, if you’ve ever hit one after the bars you’ll know the scene I’m trying to describe. We’ve been waiting maybe 15 minutes when 4 African American girls squeeze past us and join two friends that were in front of us. If it was one or two I’d have been okay but 4 was a bit much. So I said “Hey, what the fuck go to the back of the line like everyone else!”  One girl starts saying “Why, because I’m black??” And another friend starts recording me saying I’m a racist MF and all this other crap. For reference, I am not black, but their race didn’t matter I would have said this to anyone. Employee yells what the fuss is all about and the group starts screaming that I’m being racist. I then get told to leave, which I do.

After a while he flew the drone closer and closer to the ground until it got my dog attention. My dog is really curious and likes to investigate and I got worried that he might break his drone so I went to my neighbor and asked him nicely if he could stop flying the drone so close to my dog. He responded that he won't do it anymore. And that was a like because the next day my dog was barking outside, which he does not do normally so I checked and would you look at that his drone was just 2 meters above my dog, so I went and grabbed it, and returned it the owner telling him again to stop flying it close to my dog and warned him that I might break it if he continues, and well he continued for a few days now. I had a bad day once because of a argument and when I saw his drone over my dog again I grabbed it before he can move it and smashed it to the ground. Later that day he called the police and after about 2 hours we both got just a warning.Tldr: neighbor won't stop flying drone close to my dog got angry broke itOutput: OTHERInput: Consider Input: I am in a class in university that consists of only juniors and seniors. In this class, I sit in the second row all the way to the left. It being a higher level class that doesn't always take attendance, many people decide not to show up to class, so there are often empty seats around me. However, I always sit next to my friend and there is always someone sitting in front of me.An assignment for the class is to write an Op-Ed, basically a short opinionated article. As part of the assignment, everyone in the class was randomly assigned two others to peer review their article.Of the two I was assigned, one was pretty good. They had a few grammatical errors and their points were a little confusing at times, but overall decent. I also didn't know too much about their topic to begin with.The second one I reviewed was a train wreck at best. There were so many grammatical errors that I couldn't even read through the paper once without having to make corrections. Their sentence structure was so bad that I had to stop and try to parce out what it was supposed to say. I also knew a lot about this topic since I had written a paper on it a semester ago. They had the basic idea about the topic, but they left out a huge part of it that was really important to their point they were making.  All of that I left in my review that had my name attached to it online, but I didn't know who the person really was.As class was ending the other day, my friend and I's conversation drifted to the Op-Eds that we had reviewed as people were packing up to leave. It turns out that he had looked at the first one I reviewed for fun and he had liked it as well. The other one he reviewed had some issues, but was ok overall. I told him about the topic that my second reviewed Op-Ed was about and what the person had left out. I reffered to the grammatical errors and bad sentence structure as a \\"hot mess\\" as I complained.I started to hear someone near me saying \\"hey\\" to get my attention and I looked up at the person who sat right in front of me. They informed me that I was talking about their paper and then walked away. My friend and I got real quiet and he gave me a 'you really screwed up now' face. I said that I stand by what I said, since basically all the things I mentioned were in my review online that had my name attached to it anyway.Now I'm not sure if I should feel bad about trash talking someone's paper and them calling me out for it.","answer":"Output: AUTHOR"},{"question":"q: The detective had a lot of corporeal evidence to sort through, unfortunately the bulk of it would prove to be what?Options:- intangible- spiritual- transparent- ethereal- insubstantiala: Insubstantial means not being sufficient.

However, I took it to a friend's house and left it in the car for about 2 hours the result was not pretty. The cheap overlay that forms the surface that you play on melted and warped. Despite attempts to reshape it I had to trash the whole set. For fifty dollars I think the manufacter could have made a product that stood up to 80 degree day. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?unflattering(Question)Title: advertised information is misleading Product review: \\"Sleek and ultra-thin\\" in the description here is a huge stretch. This mp3 player is anything but ultra-thin. Yes, it's compact, but it is far from thin. They also advertise that it will show album art while songs are playing - what they don't tell you is that this feature only works with the pre-loaded songs that come already on the player, and that sandisk gives you absolutely no instructions in the included literature, or in the user's manual (which is not included - you have to go to their website to download it) on how to use album art. I tried for a couple of hours, on my own, and following the instructions of sandisk's tech support people, and the feature simply does not work.

Based on the information provided in a given passage, you should identify the shortest continuous text span from the passage that serves as an answer to the given question. Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question.Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:Passage: The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War. The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict. Question: When was the French and Indian War?Solution: 1754-1763Reason: It is a common convention to write (start year-end year) beside a historical event to understand when the event happened. We can observe a similar notation from the passage to conclude that the French and Indian War happened during 1754–1763. Therefore, the answer is 1754–1763.Now, solve this instance: Passage: Fossilized spores suggest that higher plants (embryophytes) have lived on land for at least 475 million years. Early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated, swimming sperm, like the green algae from which they evolved. An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats. This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives, the Charophycean green algae. A later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate, avascular sexual stage, the gametophyte, within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte. This occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release, as in non-seed plants. A current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in Selaginella, the spike-moss. The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed. The first seed bearing plants, like the ginkgo, and conifers (such as pines and firs), did not produce flowers. The pollen grains (males) of Ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated, mobile sperm cells that \\"swim\\" down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs. Question: What is the common name for Selaginella?Student:","answer":"the spike-moss"},{"question":"*Ans* yes*Question* Test for natural language inference.Premise: \\"Three children are sitting around a table reading books.\\"Hypothesis: \\"The children are reading stories.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- no- it is not possible to tell*CoT* Three children are sitting around a table reading books implies reading stories.*Ans* yes*Question* If \\"A busy restaurant filled with many people talking.\\" does that mean that \\"The restaurant is busy.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- no*CoT* A restaurant is busy only when many people come there to take food.*Ans* it is not possible to tell*Question* Given the sentence \\"Two adults and a child are in an attic playing with balloons.\\" is it true that \\"Two adults and a child are preparing for a birthday party.\\"?*CoT* The people playing with balloons does not necessarily imply that they are getting ready for a birthday party.*Ans* yes*Question*","answer":"Can we conclude from \\"A man looking out a small window.\\" that \\"There is a tiny window being looked out of.\\"?Options:- yes- no- it is not possible to tell*CoT* When a man is looking out of a window then then window is being looked out of."},{"question":"QUESTION: Given the sentence \\"A man sits on stairs with a woman.\\" can we conclude that \\"A man and woman are stading in line at the grocery store.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noLet's solve it slowly: You cannot sit on stairs abs be at the grocery store simultaneously.The answer is no.[QUESTION] If \\"Several people appear to be at an outside event where there is a fire blazing in a barrel.\\" does that mean that \\"People are gathered for the carnival.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noSeveral people appear to be at an outside event where there is a fire blazing in a barrel does not indicate that they are gathered for the carnival.The answer is it is not possible to tell.Q: Can we conclude from \\"A man with a hat is smoking a cigarette in front of another person and a body of water can be seen reflecting a building in the background.\\" that \\"A man without a hat throws a cigarette onto the floor remembering that he wasn't allowed to smoke cigarettes in the national park.\\"?Options:- yes- no- it is not possible to tellA: A man without a hat cannot be a man with a hat.

They   have    a    wonderful      four -bedroom  house   .     This   is  a new   house  .  It   has    two   bathrooms     and  a   garden    with  many    beautiful    flowers.   I   have   a   bedroom    of   my   own   . There  are   some    shopping    centres    and     restaurants     near     the    house,     and   the  house   is  close   to   an     underground  station. It  takes   about  thirty  minutes  to  get  to   the  centre  of  London. I  think   a  homestay   may  be   a  good   choice  for  you  if  it  is  your  first  time  to  visit  abroad .  The local  people  are  friendly  and  willing  to  help. If  you  happen  to  celebrate   the  holidays  with  them,  you  will  get  to  know  more  about    western  culture  and  customs. When travelers to the Great Britain happen to celebrate the holidays with the local people they will learn more about  _  . A) western culture and customs B) world culture and customs C) eastern culture and customs D) southern culture and customsA: AQ: An old porter   had worked for the railway for a very long time. One morning he was standing in one of the big railway stations and waiting for travelers to ask him to help them with their luggage, when he saw a small man running toward the trains with a big bag in his hand. The porter watched the man for a few seconds, and the man saw the porter. At once the small man ran up the porter and said, \\"Can I catch the 10:35 train to London, porter?\\" He was breathing very fast, and he seemed worried. The old porter looked at him for a moment and then said with a smile, \\"Well, sir, I'd like to help you, but I can't answer your question because I don't know how fast you can run along rails. You see,\\" he explained, \\"the 10:35 train to London left five minutes ago.\\" The old porter's job was   _ A) to stand in the railway station B) to answer the traveler's question C) to help the travelers carry their luggage D) to ask the travelers to help himA: CQ: Hello! My name is Jim. I'm from the US. Now I am in China with my father and mother. I like China. I like Chinese food, too. I have breakfast at home. I eat an egg, bread and porridge in the morning. I don't like milk. I have no time to go home for lunch. So I have it at school. The lunch in our school is very good. I can have different food for lunch. I eat rice, meat and vegetables for lunch. Sometimes I have noodles and dumplings. I have supper at home with my parents . Sometimes we go out to eat with friends. We have meat, vegetables and fruit. Sometimes they have supper   _  . A) at school B) in a restaurant with some friends C) at his friends home D) in the open airA: BQ: On a hot day, it can be hard to know what to do to feel good. Playing in water is one way to feel cooler. Taking a cool bath or a shower can feel really good on a hot day. It is also important for us to drink water. If you feel thirsty, you should drink water immediately. On hot days, you can lose about 16 glasses of water in one day, so many doctors advise that you should try to drink at least that much every day. Mixing a little fruit juice into your water is a fun way to help you drink plenty of water. The food we eat also makes a difference in how we feel in the heat. Cold food, such as ice cream and drinks with some ice, can cool down our bodies. However, eating spicy  food makes our bodies even warmer. The clothes we wear can help us feel cooler as well. Light-coloured, light-weight clothes feel cooler in the sun than dark, heavy clothing. Loose clothes are more comfortable in the heat than tight ones. Even though it is not healthy to run around during the hottest time of the day, that doesn't mean a hot day is not fun! You can read stories in your room. You can also paint or draw without moving your body too much. These are just some of many cool things to do on a hot day. How much water do we need in one hot day? A) Only 16 glasses of water. B) Less than 16 glasses of water. C) At least 16 glasses of water. D) As much as possible.","answer":"A: C"},{"question":"In this task, you're given a statement, the genre to which that statement belongs, and a label indicating if the statement should be agreed with (entailment), disagreed with (contradiction), or neither (neutral).

If he colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, what percentage of ink is left?[Answer]: Each 4 by 4 square equals 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16. Three squares equals 48 square inches because 3 x 16 = 48. Each rectangle uses 12 square inches because 2 x 6 = 12. Both rectangles will use 24 square inches because 2 x 12 = 24. He has 1 / 2 of the ink left because 24 / 48 = 1 / 2. He has 50% of the ink left because 1 / 2 x 100 = 50.So the answer is 50.[Question]: Megan’s grandma gave her 125 to start a savings account.

Then the balance decreased by 20%, so 156.25 – (0.20)156.25 or 156.25 - 31.25 = 125. 125 is the balance Megan started with, so her final balance is 100% of the starting balance.So the answer is 100.[Question]: Aaron has four times as many cows as does Matthews. Together, they have 30 more cows than Marovich. If Matthews has 60 cows, how many cows do the three have altogether?[Answer]:","answer":"If Matthews has 60 cows, Aaron has 4 * 60 = 240 cows. Together, Aaron and Matthews have 240 + 60 = 300 cows. Since Marovich has 30 fewer cows than the combined number of cows that Aaron and Matthews have, Marovich has 300 - 30 = 270 cows.

Summary: Good Quality Dog FoodSolution: TrueExplanation: The customer talked about dog food which was good. So, it's a correct Summary. So, the correct answer is true.Problem: Royal Canin was recommended for my dog, but since this line of dog food is specific to breed, it was difficult to find in stores.  PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio.  Finding a larger bag has been a great deal.  My cocker loves the food too!

It stirs up typical family emotions. Very well done. James Garner and Julie Andrews definitely have chemistry together. Answer:A: YesIs this product review positive? Title: Covers all the bases Review: This very readable book covers the Web services security area well, devoting chapters to all the usual suspects (XML Encryption, XKMS, WS-Security, SAML, et al). The C# and Java code examples are neat, and I was pleased to see the new .NET Web Services Enhancements used in the code.The standout chapters are on XKMS (I guess that must have been Phill Hallam-Baker's contribution), the WS-Security roadmap, and a chapter on the legal implications of Web services. It's not often you find a legal chapter in a technology book - I guess that is a sign of the times. One of the case studies in the appendix focusses on implementing the Vordel product, though the rest of the book is vendor-neutral.A lot of this stuff is a moving target, so I'd like to have seen a website of updates provided. But the book itself is an excellent introduction to this over-hyped and sometimes confusing area - highly recommended. Answer:OPTIONS:- No- YesYesIs this product review positive?

Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question.

ExampleChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).Answer: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?Explanation: The question is based on the following sentences from the passage (i) Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) {ii) In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (iii) As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. and (iv) They were also associated with increased blood eosinophiliaPart 3. ExerciseDiabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of severe visual loss in patients with diabetic retinopathy. This is so despite the fact that argon laser photocoagulation of the macula (M-ALC) has been shown to be beneficial. Recently, it has been suggested that pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) can lead to the resolution of DME and stop the deterioration of central visual acuity.', 'To explore the potential benefit of PPV for the treatment of DME.', 'PPV was carried out in 30 eyes of 21 consecutive patients (median age 71 years, range 61-88 years) with type II diabetes mellitus suffering from DME. 23 eyes had non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and 7 eyes had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in addition to DME. Posterior vitreous detachment had to be carried out in all cases. If epiretinal membranes were present (23 eyes), they were removed. In 13 eyes (initially 11 eyes) the internal limiting membrane (ILM) was also removed. Prior to PPV 8 eyes had received M-ALC. Three eyes had M-ALC after PPV. One eye developed a retinal detachment 6 weeks after PPV and was excluded form the analysis. After an initial treatment failure two eyes underwent repeat PPV with peeling of the ILM. Both eyes of another patient had 2 repeat PPVs because of recurrent vitreous hemorrhage. Median follow-up was 16 months (range 1-62 months).', 'Following PPV the macula flattened or became attached in 20/27 (74%) eyes. 15/18 (83%) eyes showed reduction or disappearance of leakage during fluorescein-angiography. Central visual acuity increased by two to six lines in 15/27 (56%) for the whole group at 6 months after PPV. For the subgroup (18 eyes) for which the evolution of visual acuity prior to PPV could be documented mean and median visual acuity had decreased markedly from 0.26 +/- 0.19 resp. 0.2 (range 0.03-0.6) to 0.12 +/- 0.09 resp. 0.1 (range 0.02-0.4) during the 12 months preceding PPV and increased to 0.28 +/- 0.23 resp. 0.2 (range 0.03-0.8) during the 12 months following PPV.Answer:","answer":"Do improvement of visual acuity in eyes with diabetic macular edema after treatment with pars plana vitrectomy?"},{"question":"Next Question: Premise: \\"The small brown dog is running through the grass with a yellow ball in its mouth.\\"Hypothesis: \\"The small dog climbs a tall tree.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noMy Answer: Let's think.

Passage:Ostashenko was born on 19 June 1896 in the village of Bolshaya Lyubshchina, Yanovichskoy volost, Vitebsky Uyezd, Vitebsk Governorate to a peasant family. He graduated from four grades at a gymnasium. During World War I, he was mobilized for military service on 7 August 1915, being sent to the 4th Company of the Reserve Battalion of the Petrograd Lifeguard Regiment in Petrograd. With the battalion, he fought with the Southwestern Front between July 1916 and February 1917, then returned to Petrograd before being demobilized on 13 March 1918. In July, he volunteered for the Red Army, serving in the Vitebsky Uyezd military commissariat as a clerk and instructor organizer. From May 1919 Ostashenko served as a Red Army man and political soldier – a Communist mobilized to conduct political work in the army – in the march battalion of the Vitebsk Reserve Regiment. From July he served as an assistant platoon commander in the 84th Rifle Regiment of the 10th Rifle Division, which fought against the Northwestern Army near Petrograd as part of the 15th Army of the Western Front. He entered the Smolensk Commanders' Infantry Courses in November and upon graduation in June 1920 became a platoon commander in the Rzhev-based 2nd Reserve Regiment. This assignment proved to be brief and a month later, Ostashenko became adjutant of the 4th Landing Detachment for armored trains with the Western Front. He fought with the detachment, which provided landing parties for armored trains, in the Polish–Soviet War and was wounded twice.answer:aquestion:Question: What is the scientific name for studying why there are foreign materials in a bee's honey? Passage:Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.answer:bquestion:Question: What year did Trotsky die? Passage:A.P. Rosengolts was born in Vitebsk on November 4, 1889. He was the son of a Jewish merchant. He joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP) in 1905, the year of the first, abortive Russian Revolution. He worked as an insurance agent and carried out work for the Bolshevik party in Vitebsk, Kiev, Ekaterinoslav and Moscow. Rosengolts played an active role in the Revolution of 1917. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Moscow City Council, the Moscow Military-Revolutionary Committee and the All-Russian Military-Revolutionary Committee. He was a leading officer in the Red Army and, during the Russian Civil War, worked closely with L.D. Trotsky. After the Civil War, Rosengolts worked successively for the Commissariats of Transportation and Finance and the Directorate of the Red Army Air Force. He served as ambassador to Britain from 1925 to 1927 and oversaw Soviet espionage in Britain. He became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1927 and held various high positions in the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing. A proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency.question:proper question: What organization is devoted to Jihad against Iraq?  disfluent question: What organization is devoted to Jihad against Israel or rather Iraq?  context: For some decades prior to the First Palestine Intifada in 1987, the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine took a quiescent stance towards Israel, focusing on preaching, education and social services, and benefiting from Israel's indulgence to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations. As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS (zeal), devoted to Jihad against Israel. Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine. It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada. The Brotherhood's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab.answer:Nonequestion:proper question: What time did a river system develop in the Upper Rhine Graben?  disfluent question: At which or no rather what time did a river system develop in the Upper Rhine Graben?  context: From the Eocene onwards, the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused a N–S rift system to develop in this zone. The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben, in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment, in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands. By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben, that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river. At that time, it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps; instead, the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps.answer:Miocenequestion:proper question: Thoreau mentions what type of person could corrupt a government system?  disfluent question: Who did Thoreau, no sorry, Thoreau mentions what type of person could corrupt a government system?  context: However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective. The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau’s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, “Resign.” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is “the voice of the people,” as it is often called, shouldn’t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is “liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.” Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?answer:","answer":"individuals"},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're given a short article.

In each row, there are 20 roses where 1/2 of these roses are red, 3/5 of the remaining are white and the rest are pink. How many roses at Mrs. Dawson's rose garden are pink?Answer: There are 20 x 1 / 2 = 10 red roses in each row. So there are 20 - 10 = 10 roses that are not red in each row. Out of the 10 remaining roses in each row, 10 x 3 / 5 = 6 roses are white. Thus, there are 10 - 6 = 4 pink roses in each row. Therefore, Mrs. Dawson has 4 pink roses each in 10 rows for a total of 4 x 10 = 40 pink roses in her rose garden. The answer is 40.[Question]A cake of 400 grams is divided into eight equal parts. Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, and Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate. How much did Pierre eat, in grams?[Answer]Nathalie ate 1 / 8 * 400g = 50g of cake. Pierre eats 2 * 50g = 100g of cake.

How much was the total reduction from the original selling price?A: The original price of the bag was reduced by 500 x 5 / 100 = 25. So its selling price after a week was 500 - 25 = 475. The price of the bag was again reduced by 475 x 4 / 100 = 19. So, its selling price now is 475 - 19 = 456. Therefore, the total reduction from the selling price is 500 - 456 = 44. The answer is 44.Question: Unrest leads to 30 days of protest in 21 different cities. In each city, there are 10 arrests per day. The average person spends 4 days in jail before trial and then spends half of a 2-week sentence. How many combined weeks of jail time are there?Answer: Each city arrest 30 * 10 = 300 people during the protest. So a total of 300 * 21 = 6300 people were arrested. They spend 14 / 2 = 7 days of their sentence in jail. So they spend a total of 7 + 4 = 11 days in jail. So there was a total of 6300 * 11 = 69300 days in jail. So they spent 69300 / 7 = 9900 weeks in jail. The answer is 9900.[Question]Jane sews 2 dresses a day for 7 days. Then she sews 3 dresses a day for the next 2 days.

Since they completed the job in three days, each was compensated for 18 + 15 = 33 hours of work. Mr Fletcher paid each of the workers 10 per hour of work, meaning for 33 hours, each of the workers received 33 * 10 = 330.

Based on the information provided in a given passage, you should identify the shortest continuous text span from the passage that serves as an answer to the given question. Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question.Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:Passage: The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War. The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict. Question: When was the French and Indian War?Solution: 1754-1763Reason: It is a common convention to write (start year-end year) beside a historical event to understand when the event happened. We can observe a similar notation from the passage to conclude that the French and Indian War happened during 1754–1763. Therefore, the answer is 1754–1763.Now, solve this instance: Passage: Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the standard concert repertoire are male composers, even though there has been a large number of women composers throughout the classical music period. Musicologist Marcia Citron has asked \\"[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?\\" Citron \\"examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received 'canon' of performed musical works.\\" She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recitals rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers. In the \\"...Concise Oxford History of Music, Clara Shumann  [sic] is one of the only  [sic] female composers mentioned.\\" Abbey Philips states that \\"[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts.\\" Question: What gender are most composers described in music textbooks?Student:","answer":"male"},{"question":"Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

To increase diversity, try to create more questions for which the answer will be multiple spans. Please create questions that require AT LEAST 2 arithmetic operations as illustrated in the 'positive examples' field. You are encouraged to try DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS of operations and not just limit to the combinations shown in those examples. The more challenging questions you create, the better it is.Passage: On December 7, 2015, the Washington Post reported that since 2001, in five theaters of the war  that the total number of terrorists killed ranges from 65,800 to 88,600, with Obama administration being responsible for between 30,000 and 33,000.About how many terrorists (minimum) were killed by administrations before the Obama administration?Passage: In week 6, the Lions hosted the Los Angeles Rams. The score seesawed the entire game. The Lions scored first with a seven-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Marvin Jones. The Rams tied it up with a 20-yard touchdown pass from Case Keenum to Kenny Britt, and took the lead in the second quarter with a one-yard touchdown run by Keenum. The Lions tied it back up with a two-yard touchdown catch by Andre Roberts on fourth down, and stopped the Rams from taking the lead with a goal line stand as time expired in the second quarter, keeping the score tied 14-14 at halftime. After the break, the Lions took the lead back with a four-yard touchdown catch by Anquan Boldin, but the Rams tied it back up with a 15-yard catch by Lance Kendricks. Los Angeles then retook the lead in the fourth quarter with a nine-yard catch from Britt, but Detroit tied it up again on a 23-yard TD catch by Golden Tate. The Lions took the lead for good with a 34-yard field goal by Matt Prater at the 1:29 mark of the final quarter. Detroit prevented the Rams from getting into range for a game-tying field goal when Rafael Bush intercepted a Keenum pass with just over a minute to play, giving the Lions a 31-28 win and improving their record to 3-3. Golden Tate tallied a career-high 165 yards on eight receptions. The Lions celebrated the 25th anniversary of their 1991 NFC Central Championship with an on-field reunion of its players at halftime.How many points in total were scored in the first half?Passage: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Colts The Chiefs flew to Reliant Stadium for an AFC duel against the Texans. In the first quarter the Chiefs took the early lead with QB Matt Cassel getting a 2-yard TD pass to OLB Mike Vrabel. The Texans responded and tied the game with QB Matt Schaub making a 5-yard TD pass to TE Joel Dreessen. The Chiefs rallied with Cassel making a 17 and a 42-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe in the 3rd quarter. The Texans replied with RB Derrick Ward getting a 38-yard TD run. Then kicker Ryan Succop made a 24-yard field goal to put the Chiefs up 24-14. In the fourth quarter the Texans closed the gap with RB Arian Foster making a 2-yard TD run, but the Chiefs tried to pull away with RB Thomas Jones getting an 11-yard TD run. However, the Texans replied and eventually snatched the win with Foster making a 1-yard TD run, and then with Schaub finding WR Andre Johnson on an 11-yard TD pass.","answer":"From what yard line did both teams score from in the fourth quarter?"},{"question":"instruction:In this task, you are given a natural language interpretation of commands (consist of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table.

be president 's advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign 's eccentric \\" tougher than dirt \\" incriminator .together they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race .in its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty - gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue .but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it 's characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent .seeing john travolta play bill clintonso confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look . and the rest of the cast also makesuperb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden .at occasions , you ca n't help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste .there are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry 's story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film .having said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch.but frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ?most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we can not help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film .but as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far - from - overpowering look at winning the public 's opinion .although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is .thankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of somethingso really it 's scary .Ex Output:PEx Input:i want to be involved in show business one day .and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse .this movie proves it for me .i was a little worried about the last batman film ,as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up .i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne .they did n't .kilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i ca n't stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles .this film is different .the cast is still impressive , but here ,not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction( he 's one of those directors who 's good with actors , terrible with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith does n't really give an impressive cast anything to do .the cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne / batman , o'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could 've casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy .the major problem is schwarzenegger , who is a terrible freeze .his accent is so heavy , you ca n't understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they can not act,and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody'll notice .that 's the trouble with me ,* i * notice .schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does .patrick stewart was the person i 'd heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would 've been so much better .or sean connery , but not arnold\\" i 'm not an actor , but i play one in real life \\" schwarzenegger .i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would 've been nice if they 'd casted a star that had talent for the role .akiva goldsmith 's screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film .in a regular batman film , they 'd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson 's julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is .there is talk of a fifth batman movie .my interest to see it is low , but i hope it 's better than this .if you do n't want to waste your time , rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster .any other .Ex Output:NEx Input:who would have thought ?jim carrey does drama .when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , \\" what a hilarious idea for a movie !\\" however , it was an even better premise for a drama .the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man .that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) .truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way .christof is the \\" god \\" of this made - up world .he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles .there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal .the opening parts of the film introduce to truman 's world .we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past .it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start .the film can be described in one word : weird .it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did .it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew 's idea and he did wonders with it .jim carrey actually lived up to the hype .the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey 's ability to do drama .no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey .and he showed them all up .jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars .i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination .he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world .he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening .he ventures into the wrong elevator .a light crashes in front of him .his father comes back and is then pulled away .we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not .and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish .carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama .laura linney is magnificentas the camera hungry wife .she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point .peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman 's escape .the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down .despite carrey 's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the \\" god \\" of truman 's world .he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created .he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life .the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish .but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show .it really makes you think .maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show .some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking .or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman 's arrival .and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line .all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative .i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it .overall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood .jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best .andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection .the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .Ex Output:","answer":"P"},{"question":"In this task, you're given a short story of five sentences written in natural language.

Based on the review, your job is to identify language and generate \\"en\\" if the review is in English or generate \\"es\\" if the review is in Spanish. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link].Q: - Strengths:  This paper presents a 2 x 2 x 3 x 10 array of accuracy results based on systematically changing the parameters of embeddings models:  (context type, position sensitive, embedding model, task), accuracy  - context type ∈ {Linear, Syntactic} - position sensitive ∈ {True, False} - embedding model ∈ {Skip Gram, BOW, GLOVE} - task ∈ {Word Similarity, Analogies, POS, NER, Chunking, 5 text classific. tasks}  The aim of these experiments was to investigate the variation in performance as these parameters are changed. The goal of the study itself is interesting for the ACL community and similar papers have appeared before as workshop papers and have been well cited, such as Nayak et al.'s paper mentioned below.  - Weaknesses: Since this paper essentially presents the effect of systematically changing the  context types and position sensitivity, I will focus on the execution of the investigation and the analysis of the results, which I am afraid is not  satisfactory.  A) The lack of hyper-parameter tuning is worrisome. E.g.    - 395 Unless otherwise notes, the number of word embedding dimension is set to 500.    - 232 It still enlarges the context vocabulary about 5 times in practice.    - 385 Most hyper-parameters are the same as Levy et al' best configuration.    This is worrisome because lack of hyperparameter tuning makes it difficult to make statements like method A is better than method B. E.g. bound methods may perform better with a lower dimensionality than unbound models, since their effective context vocabulary size is larger.  B) The paper sometimes presents strange explanations for its results. E.g.    - 115 \\"Experimental results suggest that although it's hard to find any  universal insight, the characteristics of different contexts on different models are concluded according to specific tasks.\\"     What does this sentence even mean?      - 580 Sequence labeling tasks tend to classify words with the same syntax  to the same category. The ignorance of syntax for word embeddings which  are learned by bound representation becomes beneficial.      These two sentences are contradictory, if a sequence labeling task    classified words with \\"same syntax\\" to same category then syntx becomes    a ver valuable feature. Bound representation's ignorance of syntax    should cause a drop in performance just like other tasks which does not    happen.  C) It is not enough to merely mention Lai et. al. 2016 who have also done a    systematic study of the word embeddings, and similarly the paper     \\"Evaluating Word Embeddings Using a Representative Suite of Practical    Tasks\\", Nayak, Angeli, Manning. appeared at the repeval workshop at     ACL 2016. should have been cited. I understand that the focus of Nayak    et al's paper is not exactly the same as this paper, however they    provide recommendations about hyperparameter tuning and experiment    design and even provide a web interface for automatically running    tagging experiments using neural networks instead of the \\"simple linear    classifiers\\" used in the current paper.  D) The paper uses a neural BOW words classifier for the text classification tasks    but a simple linear classifier for the sequence labeling tasks. What is    the justification for this choice of classifiers? Why not use a simple    neural classifier for the tagging tasks as well? I raise this point,    since the tagging task seems to be the only task where bound    representations are consistently beating the unbound representations,    which makes this task the odd one out.   - General Discussion: Finally, I will make one speculative suggestion to the authors regarding the analysis of the data. As I said earlier, this paper's main contribution is an analysis of the following table. (context type, position sensitive, embedding model, task, accuracy) So essentially there are 120 accuracy values that we want to explain in terms of the aspects of the model. It may be beneficial to perform factor analysis or some other pattern mining technique on this 120 sample data.A: ","answer":"en"},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example.

The previews looked fabulous, but the movie reeked of incredibly bad dialogue, embarrassing acting and an incredulous plot. Scenes jump around unpredictably, making the whole thing not only boring, but confusing. Unexplained characters and strange religious/mythological twists also frustrate any intellectual stimulation or emotional involvement in the story.The special effects were only average when compared with the film's peers, and they ease the experience only about as much as salt can improve bad food.

Review: I was very disappointed in this book, especially after reading the strong reviews here (that's why I went out and bought it!) I've read other of Jordan's books and this was, by far, the least interesting of the ones I've read. The plot is treadworn and the relationship between the heroine and hero was very confusing. One moment they're vowing to revenge themselves/punish one another and the very next they're engaged in hot sex (which wasn't, in my view, very erotically described.) I felt Jordan was trying to have her cake and eat it too. The two protagonists were resisting/misunderstanding/punishing each other while simultaneously enjoying each other sexually. Yuck!! In romance it's resistance first, then the sweet reconciliation. Don't waste your money. If you want to read this get it at the library.

The most common way for a player to achieve a triple-double is with points, rebounds, and assists, though on occasion players may record 10 or more steals or blocked shots in a game. The origin of the term \\"triple-double\\" is unclear. Some sources claim that it was coined by former Los Angeles Lakers public relations director Bruce Jolesch in the 1980s in order to showcase Magic Johnson's versatility, while others claim that it was coined by then Philadelphia 76ers media relations director Harvey Pollack in 1980.

The word slam, by itself, usually is connected with a loud sound, particularly of a door being closed with excess force; thus, slamming the door on one's opponent (s), in addition to the bat slamming the ball into a home run.Based on this passage, where did the term grand slam come from?My answer:","answer":"To answer this question, we should know that: According to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, the term originated in the card game of contract bridge, in which a grand slam involves taking all the possible tricks.

It was an interesting premise to switch it from something the kids did, to having the teachers act out the parts. And if I take things right, a musical for children was the original intention for this work.I've never seen Joseph by a professional company, so I can't really comment on this. But I felt overall, the cast worked well together, and that, while others feel like it didn't match up to live stage performances, perhaps a direct comparison is not totally fair. Judged on its merits, its an enjoyable show, with an intriguing mix of musical styles and good set design. I particularly had fun with the Pharoah character, and Richard Attenborough leant a great dignity (with a hit of comedy) to his role too. The narrator adds a lot to the character of the work. Overall, I'm pretty impressed, though I agree, the sound quality leaves a bit to be desired.

It's your typical indie-rockumentary with the exception that it began filming at a time when Smith had already bought into her own legend. So you get Patti Smith Rock Star not the person who became one. She name drops incessantly, Ginsberg, Mapplethorpe, Dylan, Chelsea Hotel, Gibson Guitars, yadda yadda. Why not throw in Maxwell House? Where there any non-famous people in her life? She reads her own poetry as it were William Blake or Jean Genet. It's not.The film threw me back to a performance I saw in '74 or '75 which really turned me off, she wrapped herself in an American flag and basically ignored the audience.

If each can of paint covers 2 square meters, how many cans of paint does Lucille need?Answer: For the first set of walls, each wall covers 3 meters wide * 2 meters tall = 6 square meters. There are two of these walls, so this becomes a total of 6 meters * 2 walls = 12 square meters. The third wall covers 5 meters wide * 2 meters tall = 10 square meters. The final wall covers 4 meters wide * 2 meters tall = 8 square meters. So in total, the paint needs to cover 12 + 10 + 8 = 30 metres. Since each can covers 2 meters, Lucille needs 30 meters / 2 = 15 cans of paint. The answer is 15.[Question]Mike bought a DVD of his favorite movie. He paid 5 for it at the store.

How many girls are in the class if the total number of students in the class is 260?A: If the ratio of boys to girls in the math class is 5:8, the total ratio of the number of boys and girls in the math class is 5 + 8 = 13. The fraction that represents the number of boys in the class is 5 / 13, and since there are 260 students in the class, the number of boys in the class is 5 / 13 * 260 = 100. The number of girls in the class is 260 - 100 = 160. The answer is 160.Question: Mildred and Candice went to the market. Mildred spent 25 while Candice spent 35. If their mom gave them 100 to spend, how much will be left with them after spending?Answer: Mildred and Candice spent 25 + 35 = 60 in total. Therefore, they were left with 100 - 60 = 40 after spending. The answer is 40.[Question]Sandra wants to buy some sweets. She saved 10 for this purpose. Her mother gave her an additional 4, and her father twice as much as her mother. One candy costs 0.5, and one jelly bean 0.2. She wants to buy 14 candies and 20 jelly beans. How much money will she be left with after the purchase?[Answer]Sandra's father gave her 4 * 2 = 8. So Sandra has in total 8 + 4 + 10 = 22. She wants 14 candies, so she is going to pay 14 candies * 0.50 / candy = 7 for them. She wants also 20 jellybeans, and they're going to cost 20 jellybeans * 0.20 / jellybean = 4. So after the purchase, she will be left with 22 - 4 - 7 = 11. The answer is 11.Q: Dennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants from the store which cost 110.00 each with a 30% discount and he also wants to buy 2 pairs of socks which cost 60.00 with a 30% discount. How much money will Dennis have to spend in total after he bought all the items he wants after the discount?A: Dennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants which cost 110x4 = 440. And he also wants to buy 2 pairs of socks that cost 60x2 = 120. The total amount he needs to spend without the discount is 440 + 120 = 560. The discount he will have amounts to 560x.0.30 = 168.00. So the total amount he needs to spend after deducting the discount from the total amount is 560 - 168 = 392. The answer is 392.Question: Mr. and Mrs. McPherson have to renew their rent by the end of the year. They agreed that Mrs. McPherson would raise 30% of the money. If their rent is 1200 per year, how much does Mr. McPherson need to raise to complete the rent?Answer: 30% of 1200 is (30 / 100) * 1200 = 360. Mrs. McPherson will pay 360 leaving 1200 - 360 = 840 which Mr. McPherson will have to raise. The answer is 840.Q: Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan. Mary then adds 10 more pieces of candy to her collection. If Megan has 5 pieces of candy, how many does Mary have in total?A:","answer":"Mary has 5 * 3 = 15 pieces of candy. She adds more, which brings her total to 15 + 10 = 25 pieces of candy. The answer is 25."},{"question":"Definition: Given a sentence in Tagalog language, translate the sentence to English language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact.Input: Tagalog sentence: “Ang Bedoon” larawan proyektoOutput:","answer":"“The Bedoon” photo project"},{"question":"In this task, you will be shown a Persian passage and a question, and you have to determine whether the question is answerable based on the passage or not.

On a particular week, she made 80 clay pots. However, when she put them in the sun to dry, 2/5 of the pots cracked and could not be sold. How much money did Cheyenne make from selling the remaining items at 40 per clay pot?[Answer]When she put them in the sun to dry, 2 / 5 * 80 = 32 of the clay pots that Cheyenne made cracked and could not be sold. The number of pots that were good for sale is 80 - 32 = 48. If she sold each clay pot at 40, she earned 40 * 48 = 1920 from selling the good pots.

Fran throws away 80% of the votes for The Art of the Deal and half the votes for Twilight. What percentage of the altered votes were for Game of Thrones?A:","answer":"First find the total number of The Art of the Deal votes Fran throws away: 80% * 20 votes = 16 votes. Then subtract these votes from the total number of The Art of the Deal votes to find the altered number: 20 votes - 16 votes = 4 votes. Then divide the total number Twilight votes by 2 to find the altered number of votes: 12 votes / 2 = 6 votes. Then add the altered number of votes for each book to find the total altered number of votes: 6 votes + 4 votes + 10 votes = 20 votes.

No one can fathom why, not even spymaster Major Hammond Ralph Richardson or his sister Kay Valerie Hobson, a newspaper reporter, who is working undercover in the works canteen used by the crews at the Barrett  Ward Aircraft Company. At first Major Hammond is seen as an outsider at the aircraft factory, especially by Mr. Barrett, the owner George Merritt, who is working under a government contract but he soon finds a friend in a star pilot, Tony McVane Laurence Olivier who helps him try to solve the case. Hammond becomes convinced that Jenkins George Curzon, the company secretary at the factory, is a foreign agent and mole but Jenkins is killed by unseen gunmen before he can give up the names of his contacts.

In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.Input: Question: Did the infant inside the box eventually grow and marry? Passage 1:The next film directed by Lean was The Passionate Friends (1949), an atypical Lean film, but one which marked his first occasion to work with Claude Rains, who played the husband of a woman (Todd) torn between him and an old flame (Howard). The Passionate Friends was the first of three films to feature the actress Ann Todd, who became his third wife. Madeleine (1950), set in Victorian-era Glasgow is about an 1857 cause célèbre with Todd's lead character accused of murdering a former lover. \\"Once more\\", writes film critic David Thomson \\"Lean settles on the pressing need for propriety, but not before the film has put its characters and the audience through a wringer of contradictory feelings.\\" The last of the films with Todd, The Sound Barrier (1952), has a screenplay by the playwright Terence Rattigan and was the first of his three films for Sir Alexander Korda's London Films. Hobson's Choice (1954), with Charles Laughton in the lead, was based on the play by Harold Brighouse. Passage 2:Taking the earliest first, Euripides Ion, lines 22–23; 484–485, mentions her, but in the Moses Hadas and John Mclean 1960 Bantam Classics translation they have Euripides say respectively: \\"(Athena) gave Erichthonius to Aglaurus' daughters (not sisters) to keep.\\" and later, speaking of \\"a haunt of Pan\\": \\"There the daughters of Aglaurus still tread the measures of their dance, on the green lawns before the shrine of Pallas (Athena)...\\".According to the Bibliotheca, Hephaestus attempted to rape Athena but was unsuccessful. His semen fell on the ground, impregnating Gaia. Gaia did not want the infant Erichthonius, so she gave the baby to the goddess Athena. Athena gave the baby in a box to three women—Aglaurus and her two sisters Herse and Pandrosus—and warned them to never open it. Aglaurus and Herse opened the box. The sight of the infant caused them both to go insane and they threw themselves off the Acropolis, or, according to Hyginus, into the sea. Passage 3:DZME (1530 kHz Metro Manila) is the flagship AM news and public affairs radio station owned by Capitol Broadcasting Center in the Philippines. The station's state-of-the-art studios are located at Unit 1802, 18/F, OMM-Citra Building, San Miguel Avenue, Ortigas Center, Pasig City, and its 25,000-watt solid-state digital AM stereo transmitter is located at #78 Kalye Flamengco, Brgy.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)The story begins at a prison work site where Bootsie (Donovan Scott) attempts to help his old friend, Alvie (Mark Miller), escape by causing a diversion and driving away in a crudely disguised vehicle. Reluctantly, Alvie agrees to go, and the two are able to avoid capture after a chase throughout the area. Surprisingly, Bootsie's efforts were unnecessary, as Alvie was scheduled for parole later that same week. The two friends roam the area, searching for food and shelter while continuing to evade the police.Meanwhile, in the wealthy part of town, a six-year-old girl, named Savannah Driscoll (Bridgette Andersen), is feeling lonely and unwanted by her affluent parents. Her father Richard (Chris Robinson) is a candidate for the United States Senate and is more concerned with his public image than he is with his daughter. Feeling sad and motivated by an old episode of Our Gang, Savannah decides to run away during a trip to the park with her aunt and cousin, and leaves a note before she flees. Unfortunately, a gust of wind blows her note under her parents' bed, out of view.Meanwhile, Alvie and Bootsie arrive at that park in an old vehicle they stole earlier, committing petty thefts, such as purse-snatching, to support themselves. While the children play hide-and-go-seek, Savannah decides to hide in the backseat the old stolen vehicle. Unknowingly, Alvie and Bootsie leave the park with Savannah. It wasn't until a run-in with a police officer that they discover they have her. To avoid suspicion and certain capture, the two pretend Savannah is a niece of Bootsie's. They try to return her to the park, but Savannah is reluctant to leave, and they can't afford to be caught. They decide to take care of her until they can find out who her parents are and why she ran away from home.After learning Savannah is missing, Richard and his wife Joan (Barbara Stanger) contact the authorities. Believing Savannah was kidnapped, they also hire a private detective, Harland Dobbs (Peter Graves), who is an expert in such cases. The police officers soon piece together evidence and eyewitness testimony and conclude that Savannah was kidnapped. However, the eyewitnesses feel Savannah was not actually kidnapped, given the genuine surprise shown by Alvie and Bootsie. Joan is hesitant to go along with the kidnapping theory and disagrees with how to proceed. While wanting to appear tough on crime for the benefit of his Senatorial campaign, Richard agrees to follow Dobbs' strategy.The following day, after reading a newspaper article, Alvie discovers Savannah's identity and the 100,000 reward for her safe return. As he and Bootsie are fugitives, he is unsure how they can retrieve the reward they feel they deserve, especially since they did not kidnap Savannah. In the meantime, they do their best to take care of Savannah and entertain her. Alvie attempts to make a deal with a waitress/singer he meets at a local bar, to turn in Savannah and split the reward. She turns him down but befriends Alvie in the process.Over the next few days, Alvie and Bootsie grow closer to Savannah, and she is happy to have them in her life. It's the family, love, and attention she has always wanted. They play games, tell stories, and even go on a picnic together. During their day together after the picnic, Alvie gets Savannah a puppy that she falls in love with. As Alvie continues to plan to get the reward money, Bootsie begins to have second thoughts and would rather just give Savannah back without the reward. On the way back to their hideout, they are spotted by local police officers, who notify Dobbs. Dobbs, along with a team of officers, surround the hideout and attempt to capture Alvie and Bootsie. After an errant shot by one of the officers, Alvie realizes what is happening, and he and Bootsie take Savannah hostage in order to escape. Before they can leave, they are approached by the Driscoll Family priest, Father O'Hara (Pat Morita), who tries to be the peacemaker. Not wanting to make peace just yet, Alvie orders Father O'Hara to accompany them on their escape. Father O'Hara goes along to assure Savannah's safety, under the condition that he be dropped off at a nearby wedding ceremony he is scheduled to perform. The group uses the wedding to continue their getaway, by switching vehicles and escaping during the post-wedding procession. They are successful, and proceed to the resort area previously visited during their picnic day.While at home waiting to hear from the alleged kidnappers, Richard is handed the note Savannah had left behind, which her nanny has found. Not wanting to create confusion or change his stance, Richard burns the note and instructs the nanny to keep that information between the two of them. He takes a call from Father O'Hara, notifying them of the fugitives' whereabouts. Richard notifies Dobbs and his team, then goes to the resort area with Joan.Once arriving at the resort, Alvie and Father O'Hara travel down the mountain to meet the Driscolls, to negotiate Savannah's safe return. Richard assures Alvie they will not press charges so long as Savannah is returned. Alvie declines the reward money he originally sought and agrees to the terms. He and Father O'Hara proceed back up the mountain. Meanwhile, Bootsie and Savannah are waiting atop the mountain. After a while, Savannah takes her new puppy for a walk, but he gets away from her, and she ends up disappearing into the woods . Alvie and Father O'Hara arrive, and along with Bootsie, discover Savannah is missing. Father O'Hara urges Alvie and Bootsie to leave while a clean getaway is still possible, but they refuse and begin a search for Savannah instead. Dobbs and his team arrive at the site and surround the area. They easily capture Bootsie, then wait for Alvie who is still searching for Savannah. The Driscolls, too, arrive. Alvie finds Savannah, but then sees the officers have him surrounded. Before turning himself in, he wants to say good-bye to Savannah. He explains to her that their time together is over, and although they had fun, they need to go back home. Joan, against Richard's wishes, rushes to meet with Alvie and Savannah as they approach. Father O'Hara shows his support and escorts Alvie into the custody of the officers. Disgusted with the turn of events, Joan decides to take Savannah back home on her own and leave Richard. Alvie and Bootsie are arrested, but are happy Savannah is back home, safe. They feel fortunate to have spent time with a little girl who changed their lives for the better.Output:","answer":"Question: How old is Savannah?, Answer: six years"},{"question":"What was the question for this implicit rationale, and corresponding answer?After this week, Michelangelo will have 28 - 12 = 16 more ceilings to paint.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command.
