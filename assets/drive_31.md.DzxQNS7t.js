Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  We present the first location-oblivious distributed unit disk graph coloring algorithm having a provable performance ratio of three (i.e. the number of colors used by the algorithm is at most three times the chromatic number of the graph). This is an improvement over the standard sequential coloring algorithm that has a worst case lower bound on its performance ratio of 4−3/k (for any k>2, where k is the chromatic number of the unit disk graph achieving the lower bound) (Tsai et al., in Inf. Process. Lett. 84(4):195–199, 2002). We present a slightly better worst case lower bound on the performance ratio of the sequential coloring algorithm for unit disk graphs with chromatic number 4. Using simulation, we compare our algorithm with other existing unit disk graph coloring algorithms.Literature Review:","answer":"Arunesh Mishra et. al. in BIB001 propose techniques to improve the usage of wireless spectrum in the context of wireless local area networks (WLANs) using new channel assignment methods among interfering Access Points (APs). They identify new ways of channel re-use that are based on realistic interference scenarios in WLAN environments. In this paper they formulated channel assignment in WLANs as a weighted vertex coloring problem that takes into account realistic channel interference observed in wireless environments, as well as the impact of such interference on wireless users. They proposed two efficient, scalable and fault tolerant distributed algorithms that achieve significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art Least Congested Channel Search (LCCS). Through simulations, they showed that the two techniques achieve up to 45.5% and 56% reduction in interference for sparse and dense topologies respectively with 3 non-overlapping channels. They also show that the techniques effectively use partially overlapping channels to achieve an additional 42% reduction on average for moderately sized networks. They validated these results using experiments on a fully operational in-building wireless testbed network comprising of 20 APs and achieved a 40% reduction using partially overlapping channels. A straightforward extension to this work is to handle co-existing 802.11b/g APs in the same area of coverage. The overlap graph in such scenarios becomes directed in nature as the interference effects become asymmetric (802.11g APs would be more affected than 802.11b). The weights on the edges would reflect a measure of the asymmetric effect of the interference caused by one AP's BSS to another. We leave such extensions as future work. Finally they prove that the weighted graph coloring problem is NPhard and propose scalable distributed algorithms that achieve significantly better performance than existing techniques for channel assignment. Mathieu Couture et. al. in BIB002 present the first location oblivious distributed unit disk graph coloring algorithm having a provable performance ratio of three (i.e. the number of colors used by the algorithm is at most three times the chromatic number of the graph). This is an improvement over the standard sequential coloring algorithm since they present a new lower bound of 10/3 for the worst-case performance ratio of the sequential coloring algorithm. The previous greatest lower bound on the performance ratio of the sequential coloring algorithm was 5/2. However, simulation results showed that this algorithm does not provide a significant improvement over the algorithm which sequentially colors the nodes in an arbitrary order. Simulation results also showed that, in the average case, largest-first (which is also distributed and location oblivious) performs better than the algorithm they proposed. It also performs better than lexicographic coloring, which also has a worst-case performance ratio of at most three. However, no one has shown whether largest-first has a better worst-case performance ratio than five. In fact, it is also an open question whether coloring the nodes of a unit disk graph in an arbitrary order can, on the worst case, use less than five or more than 10/3 times the minimum number of colors that are necessary."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Spectrum Sharing at Layer 2 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  As the spectral efficiency of a point-to-point link in cellular networks approaches its theoretical limits, with the forecasted explosion of data traffic, there is a need for an increase in the node density to further improve network capacity. However, in already dense deployments in today's networks, cell splitting gains can be severely limited by high inter-cell interference. Moreover, high capital expenditure cost associated with high power macro nodes further limits viability of such an approach. This article discusses the need for an alternative strategy, where low power nodes are overlaid within a macro network, creating what is referred to as a heterogeneous network. We survey current state of the art in heterogeneous deployments and focus on 3GPP LTE air interface to describe future trends. A high-level overview of the 3GPP LTE air interface, network nodes, and spectrum allocation options is provided, along with the enabling mechanisms for heterogeneous deployments. Interference management techniques that are critical for LTE heterogeneous deployments are discussed in greater detail. Cell range expansion, enabled through cell biasing and adaptive resource partitioning, is seen as an effective method to balance the load among the nodes in the network and improve overall trunking efficiency. An interference cancellation receiver plays a crucial role in ensuring acquisition of weak cells and reliability of control and data reception in the presence of legacy signals. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA) has been increasingly deployed in various emerging and evolving cellular systems to reduce interference and improve overall system performance. However, in these systems Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) still poses a real challenge that limits the system performance, especially for users located at the cell edge. Inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) has been investigated as an approach to alleviate the impact of interference and improve performance in OFDMA-based systems. A common ICIC technique is interference avoidance in which the allocation of the various system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power) to users is controlled to ensure that the ICI remains within acceptable limits. This paper surveys the various ICIC avoidance schemes in the downlink of OFDMA-based cellular networks. In particular, the paper introduces new parameterized classifications and makes use of these classifications to categorize and review various static (frequency reuse-based) and dynamic (cell coordination-based) ICIC schemes. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Motivated by stringent power constraints, duty cycling - the practice of turning a mote's radio on and off to conserve energy - has become a fundamental mechanism in the design of Wireless Sensor Networks. Because of its importance, a variety of approaches to duty cycling have emerged during the last decade and are being now proposed with increasingly ambitious goals, such as achieving ultra low duty cycles as low as 0.1%. Such propositions differ mostly in their reliance on nodes' synchronization, which, in turn, translates into different hardware requirements and implementation complexity. However, duty cycling may also differ in other aspects as topology dependency, network density requirements and increase in end-to-end delay. This paper organizes the most important proposals into a taxonomy and provides insights into their strengths and weaknesses in relation to important characteristics of applications, mote's hardware and network deployments. 4.

Finally, we highlight a number of issues and challenges regarding CB in cognitive radio sensor networks and also provide some guidelines on using CB schemes in these futuristic networks.Literature Review:","answer":"The majority of spectrum sharing mechanisms are implemented at Layer 2 of the technology circle. Although the focus of this survey is on inter-technology spectrum sharing, here we also present and discuss a taxonomy of intra-technology spectrum sharing, since the mechanisms implemented by devices within a technology can also affect the interactions with other technologies. 1) Intra-Technology Spectrum Sharing: From an intratechnology network-level perspective, multiple devices within the same network have to access the same spectrum. In this context spectrum sharing is performed by the MAC sub-layer of Layer 2. Spectrum sharing in such a case can be performed in: (i) frequency; (ii) time; (iii) code; or (iv) space. Spectrum sharing in frequency: The traditional technique is frequency division multiple access (FDMA), which divides the allocated band into multiple sub-carriers, which are then allocated to different users, e.g. in GSM. A similar concept, but with a finer frequency division granularity is orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), which divides the band into closely-spaced orthogonal sub-carriers, e.g. in LTE and WiMAX. Furthermore, frequency division can be used as a spectrum sharing mechanism between devices, without necessarily being implemented as a MAC protocol, e.g. channel selection/allocation for Wi-Fi, which can increase capacity and reduce interference among Wi-Fi devices BIB001 . Frequency reuse techniques have been applied analogously for cellular networks BIB002 - BIB003 . We note that, for modern and emerging wireless networks, implementing channel selection for interference management may not be straightforward, due to advanced features like channel bonding (in e.g. IEEE 802.11n/ac Wi-Fi, and LTE), where several channels are dynamically merged to form larger-bandwidth channels BIB005 . Consequently, partially overlapping channels of different widths may be used and reconfigured dynamically by different coexisting devices, which increases the complexity of network-wide interference interactions. Spectrum sharing in time: This has traditionally been implemented among users in cellular networks through scheduled time division multiple access (TDMA), which is an instance of periodic transmissions that are centrally coordinated. A more general concept is duty cycling, which also refers to non-coordinated or only locally-coordinated periodic transmissions. Originally, duty cycling was proposed for sensor networks BIB004 with the aim of reducing energy consumption. Recently, it has also been adopted by broadband technologies such as LTE-U, which implements adaptive duty cycling  . A fundamentally different approach is random access in time, e.g. ALOHA and its variant slotted ALOHA, where each device transmits whenever there is traffic to be sent from the upper layers. Also random, but implementing carrier sensing, are LBT mechanisms, where each device first listens to the channel and transmits only if no other ongoing transmission is detected, e.g. CSMA/CA for Wi-Fi and several other LBT variants specified by ETSI  , cf. Table III . We note that, in order to reduce the number of colliding transmissions from different devices, some LBT mechanisms vary the sensing time that a device has to listen to the channel for, based on a random backoff, which is selected by each device randomly within a given interval, e.g. [0, CW], where CW (contention window) is a design parameter. Furthermore, the CW itself can be adapted, e.g. for CSMA/CA in IEEE 802.11 the CW is doubled every time that a collision occurs (i.e. binary exponential random backoff). Spectrum sharing via coding: For multi-user networks this is known as code division multiple access (CDMA) and it is based on spread spectrum techniques at Layer 1. CDMA is implemented by allocating a unique code for each user and allowing all users to transmit over the same wide bandwidth. This was implemented in 3G systems like UMTS and CDMA2000, based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) at Layer 1."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

In each case of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) one of three PML-RAR alpha mRNA types is produced , depending on the break/fusion site in the PML gene that is linked to a common RAR alpha gene segment : a short ( S ) -form type , PML exon 3 RAR alpha exon 3 ; a long ( L ) -form type , PML exon 6 RAR alpha exon 3 ; or a variable ( V ) -form type , variably deleted PML exon 6 RAR alpha exon 3 . We evaluated whether PML-RAR alpha mRNA type is associated with distinct pretreatment clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcome in previously untreated adult APL patients registered to protocol INT 0129 by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group , the Southwest Oncology Group , and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B . Of 279 clinically eligible cases , 230 were molecularly evaluable , and of these , 111 were randomized to receive remission induction therapy with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and 119 with conventional chemotherapy . Nine cases not excluded by central pathology review were PML-RAR alpha negative , and notably , none of five of these cases treated with ATRA achieved complete remission ( CR ) . Among 221 PML-RAR alpha-positive cases , there were 82 S-form cases ( 37 % ) , 121 L-form cases ( 55 % ) , and 18 V-form cases ( 8 % ) . Before any antileukemic therapy , the S-form type , compared with the L-form type , was associated with higher values for the white blood cell ( WBC ) count ( median 2,500/microL v 1,600/microL ; P = .009 ) , the percentage of blood blasts plus promyelocytes ( median 29 % v 8.5 % ; P = .03 ) , and the absolute blood blasts plus promyelocytes ( 884/microL v 126/microL ; P = .019 ) . Also , an increased percentage of S-form versus L-form cases had the M3 variant phenotype , 24 % v 12 % ( P = .036 ) .

We conclude that the S-form type is associated with previously-identified adverse risk WBC parameters but that the identification of the S-form or L-form type of PML-RAR alpha mRNA , per se , does not predict clinical outcome or add to the value of an increased WBC count as a negative prognostic indicator in APL patients .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"receive remission induction therapy with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA )\\", \\"conventional chemotherapy\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"hematologic characteristics\\", \\"M3 variant phenotype\\", \\"CR rate\\", \\"white blood cell ( WBC ) count\\", \\"disease free survival distribution\\", \\"absolute blood blasts plus promyelocytes\\", \\"PML-RAR alpha negative\\", \\"blood blasts plus promyelocytes\\", \\"complete remission\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL )\\", \\"adult\\", \\"acute promyelocytic leukemia :\\", \\"279\\", \\"230\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Classical population genetics fails to account for interference between linked mutations, which grows increasingly severe as the density of selected polymorphisms increases. Here, we describe a simple limit that emerges when interference is common, in which the fitness effects of individual mutations play a relatively minor role. Instead, similar to models of quantitative genetics, molecular evolution is determined by the variance in fitness within the population, defined over an effectively asexual segment of the genome( a “linkage block”). We exploit this insensitivity in a new “coarse-grained” coalescent framework, which approximates the effects of many weakly selected mutations with a smaller number of strongly selected mutations that create the same variance in fitness. This approximation generates accurate and efficient predictions for silent site variability when interference is common. However, these results suggest that there is reduced power to resolve individual selection pressures when interference is sufficiently widespread, since a broad range of parameters possess nearly identical patterns of silent site variability.Introduction:Natural selection maintains existing function and drives adaptation, altering patterns of diversity at the genetic level. Evidence from microbial evolution experiments[1],[2] and natural populations of nematodes[3], fruit flies[4],[5], and humans[6],[7] suggests that selection is common and that it can impact diversity on genome-wide scales. Understanding these patterns is crucial, not only for studying selection itself, but also for inference of confounded factors such as demography or population structure. However, existing theory struggles to predict genetic diversity when many sites experience selection at the same time, which limits our ability to interpret variation in DNA sequence data. Selection on individual nucleotides can be modeled very precisely, provided that the sites evolve in isolation. But as soon as they are linked together on a chromosome, selection creates correlations between nucleotides that are difficult to disentangle from each other. This gives rise to a complicated many-body problem, where even putatively neutral sites feel the effects of selection on nearby regions. Many authors neglect these correlations, or assume that they are equivalent to a reduction in the effective population size, so that individual sites evolve independently. This assumption underlies several popular methods for inferring selective pressures and demographic history directly from genetic diversity data[8]–[12]. Yet there is also extensive literature( recently reviewed in Ref.[13]) which shows how the independent sites assumption breaks down when the chromosome is densely populated with selected sites. When this occurs, the fitness effects and demographic changes inferred by these earlier methods become increasingly inaccurate[14],[15]. Linkage plays a more prominent role in models of background selection[16] and genetic hitchhiking[17], which explicitly model how strong negative and strong positive selection distort patterns of diversity at linked sites. Although initially formulated for a two-site chromosome, both can be extended to larger genomes as long as the selected sites are sufficiently rare that they can still be treated independently. Simple analytical formulae can be derived in this limit, motivating extensive efforts to distinguish signatures of background selection and hitchhiking from sequence variability in natural populations( see Ref.[18] for a recent review). However, this data has uncovered many instances where selection is neither as rare nor as strong as these simple models require[7],[19]–[24]. Instead, substantial numbers of selected polymorphisms segregate in the population at the same time, and these mutations interfere with each other as they travel towards fixation or loss. The genetic diversity in this weak Hill-Robertson interference[25] or interference selection[26] regime is poorly understood, especially in comparison to background selection or genetic hitchhiking. The qualitative behavior has been extensively studied in simulation[22],[25]–[29], and this has led to a complex picture in which both genetic drift and chance associations between linked mutations( genetic draft) combine to generate large fluctuations in the frequencies of selected alleles, and the occasional fixation of deleterious mutations due to Muller's ratchet. In principle, these forward simulations can also be used for inference or model comparison using approximate likelihood methods[7],[30], but in practice, performance concerns severely limit both the size of the parameter space and the properties of the data that can be analyzed in this way. Here, we will show that in spite of the complexity observed in earlier studies, simple behaviors do emerge when interference is sufficiently common. When fitness differences are composed of many individual mutations, we obtain a type of central limit theorem, in which diversity at putatively neutral sites is determined primarily by the variance in fitness within the population over a local, effectively asexual segment of the genome. This limit is analogous to the situation in quantitative genetics, where the evolution of any trait depends only on the genetic variance for the trait, rather than the details of the dynamics of individual loci. We exploit this simplification to establish a coalescent framework for generating predictions under interference selection, which is based on a coarse-grained, effective selection strength and effective mutation rate. This leads to accurate and efficient predictions for a regime that is often implicated in empirical data, but has so far been difficult to model more rigorously. Our method also has important qualitative implications for the interpretation of sequence data in the interference selection regime, which we address in the Discussion.Discussion:Interfering mutations display complex dynamics that have been difficult to model with traditional methods. Here, we have shown that simple behavior emerges in the limit of widespread interference. When fitness variation is composed of many individual mutations, the magnitudes and signs of their fitness effects are relatively unimportant. Instead, molecular evolution is controlled by the variance in fitness within the population over some effectively asexual segment of the genome. This implies a corresponding symmetry, in which many weakly selected mutations combine to mimic the effects of a few strongly deleterious mutations with the same variance in fitness. We have exploited this symmetry in our “coarse-grained” coalescent framework, which generates efficient predictions across a much broader range of selection pressures than was previously possible. Our results are consistent with previous studies that have investigated interference selection in silico[22],[25]–[29],[44], but our coarse-grained model offers a different perspective on the relevant processes that contribute to molecular evolution in this regime. By using the term interference selection, we have tried to emphasize that interference( i. e., correlations in the frequencies of selected alleles) is the distinguishing feature that separates these populations from the traditional background selection regime. Previous work, on the other hand, has argued that virtually all of the deviations from the background selection limit can be attributed to fluctuations in the fitness distribution and the effects of Muller's ratchet[22],[41],[43]. Yet our coarse-grained framework includes neither of these complications directly, and the quantitative behavior is unchanged even when beneficial compensatory mutations balance the loss of fitness due to Muller's ratchet. Moreover, fitness class fluctuations and the ratchet are arguably maximized in neutral populations[52], which are well-characterized by the neutral coalescent. Instead, our results show that we can capture many aspects of silent site diversity simply by correcting for the average bias in the fitness distribution away from the prediction in Eq.( 1), similar to the findings of Ref.[47]. In order to predict this bias from first principles, it is crucial to account for correlations in the frequencies of selected mutations, similar to rapidly adapting populations[44],[65]. Of course, the degree of interference in any particular organism is ultimately an empirical question— one that hinges on the relative strengths of mutation, selection, and recombination. Although interference is often observed in microbes and viruses[76]–[79], its prevelance in higher sexual organisms is still controversial because it is difficult to estimate these parameters in the wild. Mutation and recombination rates can be measured directly( at least in principle), but population sizes and selection strengths can only be inferred from a population genetic model, and these have historically struggled to include the effects of selection on linked sites. Many estimates of “” ignore linkage by fiat( e. g.[80]) under the assumption that sites evolve independently. But these estimates become unreliable precisely when small- and intermediate-effect mutations are most common, and the reasons for this are apparent from Figure 4. All of the distortions in Figure 4 C and Figure 4 D would be mistakenly ascribed to demography( or in the case of Figure 4 E, population substructure), thereby biasing the estimates of selection at nonsynonymous sites. At best, these estimates of “” represent measurements of, which carry little information about the true strength of selection( Ns) or even the potential severity of interference. For example, all of the populations in Figure 8 have Ns = 10 and, even though they fall in the interference selection regime, and show a strong distortion in minor allele frequency that cannot be explained by Eq.( 2). In other words, we cannot conclude that interference is negligible just because “”, as inferred from data, is larger than one. More sophisticated analyses avoid these issues with simulations of the underlying genomic model[7],[22],[29],[30]. In principle, this approach can provide robust estimates of the underlying parameter combinations that best describe the data. But in practice, simulation-based methods suffer from two major shortcomings which are highlighted by the symmetry above. We have seen that strongly-interfering populations with the same variance in fitness possess nearly identical patterns of genetic diversity. This suggests a degree of “sloppiness”[81] in the underlying model, which can lead to large intrinsic uncertainties in the parameter estimates and a strong sensitivity to measurement noise. A more fundamental problem is identifying the nearly equivalent populations in the first place. Even in our simplified model, large genomes are computationally expensive to simulate, and this obviously limits both the number of dependent variables and the various parameter combinations that can be explored in a single study. We have shown that sets of equivalent populations lie along a single line( namely, the line of constant Nσ) in the larger parameter space, which can easily be missed in a small survey unless the parameters are chosen with this degeneracy in mind. In this way, our theoretical predictions can aid existing simulation methods by identifying equivalent sets of parameters that also describe the data. As an example, we consider the D. melanogaster dot chromosome that inspired the parameter combination in Figure 4 A. Earlier, we showed that the reduction in silent site diversity on this chromosome() is consistent with the parameters Ns≈30, NU≈300, and NR≈0, which fall in the middle of the interference selection regime( Ref.[29], see Methods). Our calculations allow us to predict other parameter combinations with the same patterns of diversity, and we plot the simulated frequency spectrum for three of these alternatives in Figure 6. We see that even with highly resolved frequency spectra( unavailable in the original dataset), there is little power to distinguish between these predicted alternatives despite rather large differences in the underlying parameters. However, this “resolution limit” suggests that individual fitness effects are not the most interesting quantity to measure when interference is common. Individual fitness effects may play a central role in single-site models, but we have shown that global properties like the variance in fitness and the corresponding linkage scale are more relevant for predicting evolution in interfering populations. Estimating these quantities directly may therefore be preferable in practice. Our coarse-grained predictions provide a promising new framework for inferring these quantities based on allele frequency data or genealogical reconstruction. A concrete implementation presents a number of additional challenges, mostly to ensure a proper exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space, but this remains an important avenue for future work. Finally, our findings suggest a qualitative shift in the interpretations gleaned from previous empirical studies. We have provided further evidence that even weak purifying selection, when aggregated over a sufficiently large number of sites, can generate strong deviations from neutrality. Moreover, these signals can resemble more “biologically interesting” scenarios like recurrent sweeps, large-scale demographic change, or selection on the silent sites themselves. Here we refer not only to the well-known reduction in diversity and skew towards rare alleles, but also to the topological imbalance in the genealogy( or the “U-shaped” frequency spectrum), and the strong correlations in these quantities with the rate of recombination. Since weakly deleterious mutations are already expected to be common[60], they may constitute a more parsimonious explanation for observed patterns of diversity unless they can be rejected by a careful, quantitative comparison of the type advocated above. At the very least, these signals should not be interpreted as prima facie evidence for anything more complicated than weak but widespread purifying selection.","answer":"A central goal of evolutionary genetics is to understand how natural selection influences DNA sequence variability .

In Japan, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection of some patients with hemophilia was caused by the transfusion of imported blood products, such as unheated coagulation factor. With the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, chronic HCV infection has become a major cause of liver disease and mortality for hemophiliac patients coinfected with HCV/HIV. Data is limited regarding the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapy with the HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir (TVR) in combination with pegylated interferon-α (PegIFN-α) and ribavirin (RBV) for hemophilia patients coinfected with HCV/HIV. We report a case of a Japanese patient with hemophilia and HCV/HIV coinfection who had partial response to prior to PegIFN-α and RBV therapy. This is the first published report of 24-week TVR-based triple therapy for a hemophilia patient coinfected with HCV/HIV. The patient had HCV genotype 1a infection with a high viral load. His single-nucleotide polymorphism of the interleukin 28B (rs8099917) gene was the TT major allele. He presented with undetectable HIV RNA and a high CD4(+) T cell counts by taking ART including tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir. He was again treated for HCV with TVR plus PegIFN-α2b and RBV for the first 12 weeks, followed by the continuation of PegIFN-α2b and RBV for 12 additional weeks while continuing ART. He had rapid virological response and achieved sustained virological response with the 24-week treatment. No serious adverse events such as skin rash, severe anemia or exacerbated bleeding tendency were observed, only a mild headache. No dose adjustment was necessary when tenofovir and raltegravir were used in combined with TVR, and no HIV breakthrough was observed. TVR-based triple therapy with ART could can an effective treatment for hemophilia patients coinfected with HCV (genotype 1)/HIV regardless of prior response. TVR can be used in combination with tenofovir , emtricitabine and raltegravir for patients with hemophilia . Furthermore, patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 could be successfully treated with a 24-week regimen.sentence: TVR can be used in combination with tenofovir , emtricitabine and raltegravir for patients with hemophilia .","answer":"[[\\"tenofovir\\", \\"emtricitabine\\", \\"raltegravir\\", \\"TVR\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The discontinuation of chronic treatment with temazepam or diazepam decreased seizure threshold (one of BDZ withdrawal signs). The concomitant application of subconvulsive dose of pentetrazole (55.0 mg/kg) with low dose of flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg) - a BDZ receptor antagonist, immediately induced BDZ withdrawal signs in these animals. The non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist (caffeine), and the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX), injected 15 min before the application of pentetrazole and flumazenil, were able to intensify BDZ withdrawal signs in mice. The most apparent effects were observed after administration of DPCPX, indicating that the adenosine A1 receptor may play a more important role in these effects. The obtained data demonstrate that the adenosinergic system is involved in BDZ withdrawal signs in mice, and adenosine A1 receptor plays an important role in this process.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"DPCPX\\", \\"BDZ\\", \\"flumazenil\\", \\"caffeine\\", \\"Adenosine\\", \\"diazepam\\", \\"pentetrazole\\", \\"temazepam\\", \\"adenosine\\", \\"benzodiazepine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"adenosine A1 receptor\\", \\"Adenosine receptor\\", \\"adenosine receptor\\", \\"BDZ receptor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

various problems has resulted in extensions to multiple domains.IRGAN attempts to leverage the framework for Information-Retrieval (IR), a task that can be described as modeling the correct conditional probability distribution p(d|q) over the documents (d), given the query (q).The work that proposes IRGAN claims that optimizing their minimax loss function will result in a generator which can learn the distribution, but their setup and baseline term steer the model away from an exact adversarial formulation, and this work attempts to point out certain inaccuracies in their formulation.Analyzing their loss curves gives insight into possible mistakes in the loss functions and better performance can be obtained by using the co-training like setup we propose, where two models are trained in a co-operative rather than an adversarial fashion.Information-Retrieval (IR) involves providing a list of ranked documents {d 1 , d 2 , . . . , d k } in answer to a query q.This general formulation can be extended to various tasks like web-search, where the documents are web pages and information needs are queries, content-recommendation, where the documents are items/content to suggest and queries are users, and Question-Answering, where the documents are answers and queries are questions.The retrieved list can also be viewed as a probability distribution over candidates, one example being DISPLAYFORM0 where l is a hyperparameter.Even if the probability distribution is not explicit, it is desirable to retrieve a higher ranked document more often than a lower ranked document.GANs were proposed as alternatives to generative models and have been shown to be capable of modeling the true data well.High dimensional settings like images and word sequences have seen some success.Given that the generator in GANs tries to model the training data's distribution, adversarial setups seem like a natural fit for IR.The learned distribution can then be used to retrieve relevant documents for incoming queries.IRGAN is a framework proposed by , with the hope of giving Information-Retrieval, access to the large literature of GANs.IRGAN consists of a discriminator and a generator.Like in a typical setup, the discriminator learns to distinguish between documents produces by the real probability distribution or the real ranking and the generator's probability distribution.It increases the likelihood of the former and decreases it for the latter.The generator tries to bring its probability distribution closer to the real one so that it increases the likelihood of confusing the discriminator into believing that it is the true distribution.Ideally, equilibrium is achieved when the generator manages to rank the documents according to the true distribution.However, the formulation and implementation of the loss function in the work seems to have a few issues.Specifically, the use of the baseline term recommended in the work results in pitting the loss functions of the discriminator and the generator directly against each other and this leads to issues that are conspicuous in the loss curves.The training starts off with a pre-trained discriminator and generator, and the performance of the generator decreases as the training proceeds, while you would actually expect the opposite.When pre-training is not used, the generator does not learn at all.This forces IRGAN to choose the generator or discriminator based on whichever has better performance, while it expected that the generator is chosen at equilibrium.Given the traction this paper has received since its inception (53 citations as of 27 th September 2018), it is important to critically analyze the work and attribute the claimed performance improvements correctly.To this end, we propose two models which outperform IRGAN on two of the three tasks and give a comparable performance on the third.They also serve as an ablation study by experimentally showing that the generator might not be playing a vital role during train or test time.The following contributions are made in this work• We propose a model motivated by Co-training which outperforms IRGANs • We point out inaccuracies in the minimax loss function used in IRGANs • We substantiate the same by drawing conclusions from the loss curves 2 RELATED WORK 2.1 GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) BID11 ) were proposed as an alternative to generative models BID23 ) which used Markov Chains or other approximations to compute intractable probability distributions.In essence, the generator tries to model the real data distribution and the discriminator learns to differentiate between real data points and generated data points.GANs are notoriously unstable to train and works like DCGANs BID21 ) and Wasserstein GAN BID1 ) have successfully attempted to alleviate a few issues.Nonetheless, GANs have been widely applied to various problems like image generation, text generation, cross-modal retrieval and more niche ones like Interactive Image Generation BID29 ), Text to Image ), Image to Image style transfer BID12 ) and robotics BID4 ).WhileGANs allow generation based on a random variable z, Conditional GANs BID17 ) partition the sample variable into two parts (z and y). y isused to denote which part of the probability distribution the generator has to generate from, and z plays the same role played in Vanilla GANs BID11 ). ConditionalGANs dovetail with IR because y can be used to represent the query or its embedding, and in theory, the model should be able to generate the required document. DISPLAYFORM1We feel that an eventual adversarial formulation for IR will be similar to this in flavor.The experiments performed show that IRGAN is by no means state-of-the-art on those datasets.Further, the performance does not justify the large training time of 4 hours per generator epoch and 1 hour of discriminator epoch as opposed to 2 hours per epoch of the co-training model (11 GB GPU and Question Answering task).The shaky mathematical formulation renders the generator useless after training, and any gains in performance can be attributed directly to the first term of J D , where the likelihood of the real data is increased.We showed that the discriminator and generator are optimizing directly opposite loss functions and this is the cause of deleterious training.The poor performance of IRGAN on Web-Search and Question Answering and only a satisfactory performance on Content-Recommendation (which has dense rewards) lead us to speculate that it does not work well in sparse reward scenarios.This is similar to a well-known problem called the Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning.We think that a correct formulation along with established techniques from the former, like reward shaping BID18 ) may lead to better performance.Newer methods like Hindsight Experience Replay BID0 ) which allow models to learn both from mistakes and rewards may further ameliorate learning.We would also like to explore in the direction of learning correct adversarial frameworks for more complex tasks like Image Retrieval and Question Answering which will involve learning end-toend trainable models.With advances in modeling sequences, this could also involve generation of documents rather than sampling them.","answer":"Points out problems in loss function used in IRGAN, a recently proposed GAN framework for Information Retrieval.

Nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common and costly complication of diabetes. Microbial burden, or \\"bioburden,\\" is believed to underlie delayed healing, although little is known of those clinical factors that may influence microbial load, diversity, and/or pathogenicity. We profiled the microbiomes of neuropathic nonischemic DFUs without clinical evidence of infection in 52 individuals using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Comparatively, wound cultures, the standard diagnostic in the clinic, vastly underrepresent microbial load, microbial diversity, and the presence of potential pathogens. DFU microbiomes were heterogeneous, even in our tightly restricted study population, but partitioned into three clusters distinguished primarily by dominant bacteria and diversity. Ulcer depth was associated with ulcer cluster, positively correlated with abundance of anaerobic bacteria, and negatively correlated with abundance of Staphylococcus. Ulcer duration was positively correlated with bacterial diversity, species richness, and relative abundance of Proteobacteria, but was negatively correlated with relative abundance of Staphylococcus. Finally, poor glycemic control was associated with ulcer cluster, with poorest median glycemic control concentrating to Staphylococcus-rich and Streptococcus-rich ulcer clusters. Analyses of microbial community membership and structure may provide the most useful metrics in prospective studies to delineate problematic bioburden from benign colonization that can then be used to drive clinical treatment.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

On the other hand, cis configuration of the minor isomer was established from the corresponding couplings [J (H3-H4α) = 9.0 Hz, J (H3-H4β) = 6.5 Hz, J (H4α-P) = 11.2 Hz, J (H4β-P) = 20.0 Hz, J (H4α-H5) = 9.1 Hz, J (H4β-H5) = 3.9 Hz, J (CCCP) = 7. 3 Hz] indicating the 2 E conformation of the isoxazolidine ring ( Figure 2 ). The additional arguments to support our assignments follow from shielding of the CH 3 CH 2 OP protons observed for the cis isomer (∆δ ca. 0.1 ppm) when compared with the trans-11a. Furthermore, it was found that on a 1 H-NMR spectrum taken on the 83:17 mixture of cisand trans-11a, the H-N proton in the quinazolinone ring of cis-11a was significantly deshielded (∆δ = 0.7 ppm) when compared with the trans isomer, highly likely, as a result of the hydrogen bond formation with the phosphoryl oxygen amide, a phenomenon spatially achievable in the cis isomer only. Since introduction of various substituents at N3 of quinazolinone moiety has no influence on the stereochemical outcome of the cycloaddition therefore configuration of the all major isoxazolidines 11 were assigned as trans, thereby minor ones as cis. Figure  2 ). The additional arguments to support our assignments follow from shielding of the CH3CH2OP protons observed for the cis isomer (Δδ ca. 0.1 ppm) when compared with the trans-11a.Question: The replication of what virus is strongly inhibited by 2-(4-hydroxybenzyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (1)?","answer":"tobacco mosaic virus"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Podocytes play a key role in diabetic nephropathy pathogenesis, but alteration of their metabolism remains unknown in human kidney. By using a conditionally differentiating human podocyte cell line, we addressed the functional and molecular changes in podocyte energetics during in vitro development or under high glucose conditions. In 5 mM glucose medium, we observed a stepwise activation of oxidative metabolism during cell differentiation that was characterized by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α)-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, with concomitant reduction of the glycolytic enzyme content. Conversely, when podocytes were cultured in high glucose (20 mM), stepwise oxidative phosphorylation biogenesis was aborted, and a glycolytic switch occurred, with consecutive lactic acidosis. Expression of the master regulators of oxidative metabolism transcription factor A mitochondrial, PGC-1α, AMPK, and serine-threonine liver kinase B1 was altered by high glucose, as well as their downstream signaling networks. Focused transcriptomics revealed that myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) and myogenic factor 5 (MYF5) expression was inhibited by high glucose levels, and endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNA-mediated combined inhibition of those transcription factors phenocopied the glycolytic shift that was observed in high glucose conditions.

Introduction<p>Development of glutathione (GSH) assay methods has received attention due to its diverse functions in organisms and extensive market prospects. GSH, an important nonenzymatic antioxidant, is found in almost all cell types. GSH protects cells from damage of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and lipid peroxides, directly by eliminating free radicals, and indirectly by serving as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase [1, 2]. GSH also participates in other physiological processes such as control of cell proliferation and nucleotide metabolism [3, 4]. Based on its essential role in the health of organisms, GSH is used in clinic to treat kinds of diseases such as liver disease and uremia and reduce the side effects correlated with chemoradiotherapy.</p><p>Many analytical methods, such as high performance liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, fluorophotometry, and electrochemistry, have been developed for detection of GSH [5–8]. Among these methods, fluorophotometry has advantages over the other techniques at sensitivity, simplicity, and costs. In recent years, fluorescent probes for detection of GSH have been designed and investigated for overcoming the disadvantages of traditional fluorometric assays [9–12]. Although these fluorescent probes successfully detected GSH from various samples, including aqueous solutions, human serum, bovine serum album (BSA), and liposome, they suffered from complicated and tedious synthesis procedures.</p><p>Bovine serum albumin-protected fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs-BSA) reported by Xie et al. have given rise to research interest in sensing applications owing to the advantages of facile preparation, high fluorescence quantum yield (~6%), favorable photostability, and good biocompatibility [13]. Xie's research group developed a simple label-free method for the selective and sensitive detection of Hg2+ based on fluorescence quenching of AuNCs-BSA triggered by Hg2+-Au+ interactions [14]. Liu et al. reported a AuNCs-BSA-based fluorescent sensor for the recognition and determination of cyanide in aqueous solution, which was based on the fluorescence quenching of AuNCs-BSA induced by the Elsner reaction between cyanide and gold atoms of AuNCs-BSA [15]. Durgads et al. demonstrated the AuNCs-BSA can be used as a selective fluorescence \\"turn-off\\" sensor for Cu2+ in live cells based on fluorescence quenching of AuNCs-BSA resulting from intersystem crossing of the excited electron from the gold cluster stimulated by the bound Cu2+ in the BSA molecule [16]. Their paper also showed that the copper-ion-quenched emission was reversible with a copper chelator glycine.</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that the fluorescence of GSH-capped gold nanoparticles was quenched by Cu2+ due to the complexation between Cu2+ and GSH [17]. Thus, we assumed that GSH might be able to retrieve the copper-ion-quenched fluorescence of AuNCs-BSA by coordinating Cu2+. GSH was found to be much more effective than glycine on restoring the fluorescence quenched by copper ions in our study. Thus, we have developed a fluorescence \\"turn-on\\" sensor for GSH based on the AuNCs-BSA-Cu system.</p>2.1. Reagents<p>Glutathione (98%), HEPES (99%), and amino acids (≥98%) were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). HAuCl4 (AR), bovine serum albumin (BR), NaOH (AR), and metal nitrates (AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Reduced glutathione for injection and reduced glutathione tablets were from YaoPharma Co., Ltd. (Chongqing, China). Ultrapure water with 18.2 MΩ·cm resistivity was used for preparing the solutions.</p>2.2. Preparation of AuNCs-BSA<p>The AuNCs-BSA was synthesized based on a modified Xie method [13]. In brief, HAuCl4 solution (25 mL, 10 mM) was mixed with BSA solution (25 mL, 30 mg·mL−1) under vigorous stirring at 37°C. Two minutes later, NaOH solution (3 mL, 1 M) was introduced, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 12 h.</p>2.3. Detection of GSH<p>For fluorescent detection of GSH, varying volumes of 10 mM GSH solutions were mixed with the AuNCs-BSA solution containing Cu2+ which was prepared by adding 30 µL 10 mM Cu2+ solution to 250 µL AuNCs-BSA solution, and the mixtures were diluted to 5 mL with HEPES buffer (pH=7.2). Fluorescence emission spectra of the as-prepared solutions were measured under 480 nm excitation.</p>2.4. Sample Preparation<p>A bottle of reduced glutathione powder for injection was dissolved and diluted to 100 mL with ultrapure water. After four reduced glutathione tablets were ground, the powder was dissolved in ultrapure water and filtered. The filtrate was finally diluted to 100 mL with ultrapure water.</p>3.1. Mechanism for Fluorescence Recovering of AuNCs-BSA<p>The deep brown solution of AuNCs-BSA emits a red fluorescence under 480 nm excitation. The fluorescent emission peak at 648 nm was found to disappear upon addition of 300 µM Cu2+. It was further observed that the AuNCs-BSA solution containing Cu2+ emitted strong fluorescence again after treatment with of 1.6 mM GSH (Figure 1).</p><p>The fluorescence quenching of AuNCs-BSA in the presence of Cu2+ was attributed to the binding of Cu2+ on to the BSA used for stabilizing the gold nanocluster, which enabled the paramagnetic Cu2+ to prompt intersystem crossing of the excited electron from the gold cluster and consequently decreased the fluorescence intensity [16]. A control experiment showed that GSH had no influence on the fluorescence spectrum of AuNCs-BSA in the absence of Cu2+, indicating that the fluorescence recovery induced by adding GSH to the AuNCs-BSA-Cu system resulted from the interaction between GSH and Cu2+. GSH, a natural tripeptide that consists of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, contains various coordinating function groups such as carboxyl, amido, sulfydryl, and acylamino, which facilitates its molecules to form complexes with metal ions. GSH was replaced by glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine, respectively, to observe the change in fluorescence properties of the AuNCs-BSA-Cu system and identify the binding site on GSH for Cu2+. It is apparent in Figure 1 that the fluorescence intensity restored by cysteine was close to that by GSH at the same concentration and much stronger than that by glycine or glutamic acid. Considering the facts that Cu2+ is characterized by a strong affinity for SH residues and among the three amino acids constituting GSH only cysteine has a sulfydryl, we speculate that GSH recovers the copper-quenched fluorescence of AuNCs-BSA by coordinating the bound Cu2+ in the BSA molecule used for stabilizing the gold nanocluster through its sulfydryl.</p>3.2. Optimization of Conditions for GSH Sensing<p>Concentration dependent effects of AuNCs-BSA and Cu2+ on the detection of GSH were investigated. High concentrations of Cu2+ were required for high fluorescence quenching efficiency at high concentrations of AuNCs-BSA, which means low detection sensitivity for GSH. On the other hand, too low a concentration of Cu2+ would increase background fluorescence and narrow the allowing quantitative range of GSH due to low fluorescence quenching ability. In a solution with a total volume of 5 mL, 250 µL AuNCs-BSA and 60 µM Cu2+ were finally selected for GSH sensing.</p><p>The acid effect on the sensing system was studied over a pH range from 6 to 11. When the pH value increased in the tested range, diminutive change in the fluorescence intensity of AuNCs-BSA was observed, whereas the fluorescence intensity of the AuNCs-BSA in the presence of Cu2+ increased, indicating the fluorescence quenching efficiency of Cu2+ decreased with increasing of the pH value. It was also observed that the fluorescence recovering efficiency of GSH changed with the pH value. The fluorescence quenching and recovering efficiency are represented with F0/F1 and F2/F1 respectively, where F0 and F1 correspond to the fluorescence intensity of the AuNCs-BSA in the absence and presence of Cu2+, respectively. F2 represents the fluorescence intensity of the AuNCs-BSA in the presence of Cu2+ and GSH. As shown in Figure 2, the fluorescence recovering efficiency of GSH is stabilized and maximized at physiological pH. The HEPES buffer solution was finally employed to adjust the pH of solutions used in the measurement to 7.2.</p><p>Time-dependent fluorescence signals of the sensing system were observed. The change in fluorescence properties of AuNCs-BSA in the absence and presence of Cu2+ was not obvious within 30 minutes. However, the fluorescence intensity of the AuNCs-BSA in the presence of Cu2+ and GSH slowly decreased with time, and thus the fluorescence recovering efficiency decreased with time (Figure 3). Therefore, the fluorescence of the sensing system should be measured immediately upon adding GSH to the solution of AuNCs-BSA in the presence of Cu2+.</p>3.3. Selectivity and Sensitivity for GSH Sensing<p>Although the presence of Pb2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ with the same concentration of Cu2+ (60 µM) showed a quenching effect on the fluorescence of the AuNCs-BSA, their quenching efficiencies were much lower than that of Cu2+ (Figure 4). The degree of interference of other metal ions, including K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, and Fe3+, for the detection of GSH was further investigated. On the basis of a relative error range from -5% to 5% in detecting 50 µM GSH, the tolerance concentrations were as follows: 1 mM for K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, 500 µM for Zn2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, and 100 µM for Fe3+. Some amino acids were also used to evaluate the selectivity of the sensing system. As shown in Figure 5, only cysteine could result in significant fluorescence recovery of the AuNCs-BSA, whereas no obvious changes in the quenched fluorescence were observed in the presence of other amino acids such as glycine, lysine, proline, glutamic acid, tryptophan, and phenylalanine at the same concentration of GSH (50 µM).</p><p>Under the optimum detection conditions, the relationship between the fluorescence recovering efficiency (F2/F1) and the concentration of GSH over the range from 10 µM to 400 µM could be expressed by a linear equation (R2 = 0.996), F2/F1 = 0.0063CGSH + 1.09 (Figure 6). The limit of detection for GSH was calculated to be 1.2 µM.</p>3.4. Application<p>Commercial reduced glutathione tablets and reduced glutathione powder for injection were employed as practical samples to evaluate the applicability of the GSH sensor developed here. The recovery and relative standard deviation obtained with a standard addition method through five parallel tests are presented in Table 1.</p>4. Conclusions<p>We found that GSH restored effectively the copper-quenched fluorescence from the AuNCs-BSA and therefore develop a new fluorescence \\"turn-on\\" sensor for GSH detection. The sensor shows advantages such as fast and sensitive response to GSH, simplicity in preparation and usage, and environmental friendliness. The recovery and precision obtained from commercial GSH drug products indicate the potential application of the GSH sensor.</p>","answer":"A fluorescence sensor for the detection of glutathione based on the fluorescence recovering of the bovine serum albumin-stabilized gold nanoclusters is reported.

We tested the utility of a cross-species genetic interaction profiling approach to obtain clues to the molecular function of unannotated pathogenicity factors in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. This approach involves expression of C. neoformans genes of interest in each member of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion library, quantification of their impact on growth, and calculation of the cross-species genetic interaction profiles. To develop functional predictions, we computed and analyzed the correlations of these profiles with existing genetic interaction profiles of S. cerevisiae deletion mutants. For C. neoformans LIV7, which has no S. cerevisiae ortholog, this profiling approach predicted an unanticipated role in the Golgi apparatus. Validation studies in C. neoformans demonstrated that Liv7 is a functional Golgi factor where it promotes the suppression of the exposure of a specific immunostimulatory molecule, mannose, on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting phagocytosis. The genetic interaction profile of another pathogenicity gene that lacks an S. cerevisiae ortholog, LIV6, strongly predicted a role in endosome function. This prediction was also supported by studies of the corresponding C. neoformans null mutant. Our results demonstrate the utility of quantitative cross-species genetic interaction profiling for the functional annotation of fungal pathogenicity proteins of unknown function including, surprisingly, those that are not conserved in sequence across fungi.Introduction:Diseases produced by fungal infections are challenging to diagnose and treat, making these infections a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide[1],[2]. Genetics and genomics have led to the identification of numerous pathogen genes required for replication in the mammalian host[3]–[7]. Unfortunately, many, if not most, identified virulence genes lack in vitro phenotypes that could explain their effects in the host[3]–[8], and the predicted protein sequences often offer few clues to function. Thus, our power to identify pathogen genes required for disease far outstrips our ability to understand their molecular function in the host. Historically, the expression of human genes in the model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been used as a tool to identify specific genes and to determine their cellular function[9]–[14]. In a classic example, complementation of a fission yeast cdc2 mutant was used to identify human Cdk1[11]. More recently, a number of groups have combined the expression of foreign genes with high-throughout tools available in S. cerevisiae to identify suppressor genes to obtain insights into the function of human proteins, ranging from those involved in neurodegeneration to cancer[9],[11],[14]. Likewise, expression of viral and bacterial proteins in yeast, coupled with subsequent genetic analysis, has proven to be informative. For example, the genes responsible for biosynthesis of the eEF2 modification diphthamide were identified in selections for resistance to the F2 fragment of diphtheria toxin[15]. Identification of S. cerevisiae gene deletion mutants hypersensitive to the expression of the Shigella virulence factor OspF, a type III secretion substrate, coupled with transcriptional profiling experiments, led to the identification of the cell wall integrity MAP kinase pathway as a likely target of OspF in yeast[10],[13]. Importantly, the latter study took advantage of phenotypic information for yeast deletion mutants available at that time to obtain clues to gene function[10]. The construction of a library of all nonessential gene deletions for S. cerevisiae[8] together with the development of genetic selections led to the development of the synthetic genetic array( SGA) method for quantitatively measuring genetic interactions on a genome scale[16],[17]. This approach has facilitated the systematic annotation of gene function in S. cerevisiae[18],[19]. Genetic interaction, or epistasis, measures the degree to which two genes affect each other[16], and is measured by comparing the phenotype of a double mutant to that of the two corresponding single mutants. Genes that act in the same pathway display similar patterns of genetic interactions with other genes[16]–[19]. Recently, the large-scale application of these methods led to production of a remarkable genome-scale genetic interaction map based on the analysis of ∼5. 4 million gene pairs. Such a comprehensive genetic interaction dataset has only been described to date for the model yeast S. cerevisiae[19]. Below we test the utility a cross-species genetic interaction approach for fungal pathogen gene annotation that combines expression of pathogen genes in S. cerevisiae with genetic interaction profiling. We used genes from the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic basidiomycete fungal pathogen that is very distantly related to the model yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. C. neoformans is the most common cause of fungal meningitis in humans, and among the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients, leading to ∼1 million infections and ∼600, 000 deaths annually in sub-Saharan African alone[1]. Our laboratory previously generated a library of 1201 gene deletion strains and used a signature-tagged mutagenesis approach to identify genes required for pathogen fitness during experimental infection of mice[5]. In addition to identifying new genes required for the synthesis of known virulence factors, these studies identified several dozen genes required for virulence whose mutation failed to yield in vitro phenotypes that could explain its role in the host. As a proof-of-principle, we expressed six C. neoformans genes of interest in each member of the S. cerevisiae deletion library and quantified their impact on fitness, thereby producing cross-species genetic interaction profiles. We exploited their similarities to existing S. cerevisiae knockout genetic profiles to predict possible functions for each C. neoformans protein. For two of these C. neoformans proteins, Liv6 and Liv7, we describe validation experiments that support the functional assignment. For Liv7, additional experiments connect its newly identified function to the evasion of phagocytosis, an important virulence trait. The cross-species genetic interaction profiling approach described here offers a generalizable avenue toward the functional annotation of pathogenicity factors of fungal agents of infectious disease.Discussion:Genetic approaches to understanding mechanisms of virulence in human fungal pathogens can efficiently identify genes necessary for pathogens to cause disease. However, a key roadblock to progress is the lack of tools that can help define the function of a gene product when its predicted sequence offers few clues to its biochemical function, a common occurrence. We described here a case study of a cross-species genetic interaction profiling approach to develop testable hypotheses for the function of fungal virulence factors of unknown function. Notably, this proof-of-principle study shows that the approach can provide information on fungal pathogenicity factors that lack S. cerevisiae orthologs. Although many studies have used S. cerevisiae to investigate the function of foreign genes[9]–[11],[13],[14], the cross-species genetic interaction profile used here represents an application of quantitative genetic profiling of foreign proteins in S. cerevisiae coupled with comparison to recently described genetic map of S. cerevisiae[19] to the problem of annotation of fungal virulence factors. Because S. cerevisiae is a fungus, we anticipate that this approach may be particularly useful for fungal genes but that the method may also find utility in the study of bacterial and viral proteins that impact conserved intracellular processes in eukaryotic host cells. Our approach involves expression in S. cerevisiae of cDNAs encoding Cryptococcus neoformans virulence factors identified in systematic genetic screens; the generation of genetic profiles by assessing the effect of C. neoformans gene expression in the context of each nonessential S. cerevisiae deletion mutants; and, correlation analysis with the existing database of genetic interactions to develop testable functional hypotheses. As mentioned above, one mechanism whereby expression of a C. neoformans gene could produce impact S. cerevisiae would be “dominant-negative” effect thereby inhibiting the activity of an S. cerevisiae pathway. Our results with LIV7 in both S. cerevisiae and C. neoformans are consistent with this scenario. The expression of LIV7 in S. cerevisiae produces a profile that correlates with that of the S. cerevisiae trs33Δ deletion mutant, but in C. neoformans, the liv7Δ mutation produces a synthetic phenotype with the trs33Δ mutation. Alternatively, expression of a C. neoformans gene product could act in a “dominant-active” fashion to increase the activity of a pathway which might result in a negative correlation with the profile of a gene deletion in the corresponding pathway. With Liv6, we observed both positive and negative correlations that led us to test a role in endosome function. Although we have focused on the extensive deletion mutant genetic interaction dataset[19], comparisons of the cross-species profiles generated here with genetic interaction profiles produced using chemicals[65],[66] and/or overexpressed genes[67],[68] will likely be equally useful as these approaches are applied on a larger scale. Thus, the analysis of correlations between cross-species genetic interaction profiles and existing “within-species” genetic interaction profiles offers a tool for generating testable predictions for pathways in which foreign genes operate. The genetic profiling studies and validation experiments described in this paper provide new information on two C. neoformans pathogenicity factors identified previously, Liv7 and Liv6. These proteins lack orthologs in S. cerevisiae and lack orthologs of known function in other species. Our studies of Liv7 suggest it functions in Golgi transport in a process that suppresses the exposure of the PAMP mannose on the cell surface( Figure 6C). The increased phagocytosis phenotype of the liv7Δ single mutant and its specific suppression by soluble mannose appears specific to liv7Δ cells and is specific to mannose versus other carbohydrates( Figure 6B). The anti-phagocytic properties of C. neoformans are critical for mammalian infection[5],[22],[69] and the capsule is important for the anti-phagocytosis activity of opsonized C. neoformans cells[51]. Our previous work identified a capsule-independent pathway necessary for anti-phagocytosis under unopsonized conditions[22]. The suppression cell surface exposure of PAMP mannose appears to represent a third anti-phagocytosis pathway( Figure 6C) since mannose does not rescue the anti-phagocytic defect of gat204Δ cells( Figure 6B), which are defective in the capsule-independent anti-phagocytosis pathway[22]. This argument is supported by the observation that cap10Δ and cap60Δ cells, which lack GXM[48],[49], do not exhibit increased conA staining( Figure 5C). We suggest that Liv7 is important for mammalian infection[5] because it inhibits macrophage recognition of mannose-containing patterns on the C. neoformans cell surface( Figure 6C). Although our studies of Liv6 point to a role in endosome biology that impacts neomycin resistance and vacuole number, understanding how this function relates to its role in pathogen fitness in the host will require further investigation. One possibility is that Liv6 is involved in the endocytic uptake of limiting factors required for proliferation from the host milieu. One anticipates that functional annotation of fungal virulence factors identified genetically will continue to be a major challenge for the future. The approach described here represents one generic tool that could be applied to this problem on a larger scale. We expect that a substantial number of virulence genes of unknown function in fungal pathogens will impinge on conserved cellular processes and that their genetic profiling in S. cerevisiae could therefore yield testable functional predictions in a significant number of cases. The cross-species interaction profiling could also be useful for studying genes from highly virulent pathogens that are difficult to work with due to the requirement for extensive containment.","answer":"HIV/AIDS patients , cancer chemotherapy patients , and organ transplant recipients are highly susceptible to infection by opportunistic fungal pathogens , organisms common in the environment that are harmless to normal individuals .

These RNAs, which bind to targeted mRNAs via limited base pairing interactions, act to reduce protein production from those mRNAs. Considerable evidence indicates that miRNAs destabilize targeted mRNAs by recruiting enzymes that function in normal mRNA decay and mRNA degradation is widely thought to occur when mRNAs are in a ribosome free state. Nevertheless, when examined, miRNA targeted mRNAs are invariably found to be polysome associated; observations that appear to be at face value incompatible with a simple decay model. Here, we provide evidence that turnover of miRNA-targeted mRNAs occurs while they are being translated. Cotranslational mRNA degradation is initiated by decapping and proceeds 5’ to 3’ behind the last translating ribosome. These results provide an explanation for a long standing mystery in the miRNA field.Introduction:microRNAs, a large family of regulatory molecules discovered over twenty years ago, have been shown to exert pervasive effects on a wide array of biological processes( reviewed in Ameres and Zamore, 2013; Ebert and Sharp, 2012). It has become clear that a majority of mRNAs are targeted by miRNAs via limited base pairing interactions between the miRNAs and miRNA responsive elements( MREs)( Bartel, 2009). Although there are exceptions, most MREs are located in 3’ UTRs( Bartel, 2009). The current consensus view of miRNA-mediated gene regulation is that it involves post-transcriptional down regulation of protein production from targeted mRNAs. Repression by miRNAs is largely attributable to mRNA destabilization and several lines of evidence indicate that this destabilization involves recruitment of factors which participate in normal mRNA decay pathways( Bagga et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2010; Eichhorn et al., 2014; Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006a; 2006b; Eulalio et al., 2008b; Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015). These factors include deadenylases and decapping enzymes( e. g. Braun et al., 2011; Chekulaeva et al., 2011; Rehwinkel et al., 2005). Although much has been learned regarding the biological functions of mRNAs and their mechanism( s) of action, there is one aspect that has largely eluded explanation; i. e. the interplay between the translation machinery and miRNA-mediated repression. In very early studies, the first miRNA targeted mRNAs were found to be fully associated with polysomes( Olsen and Ambros, 1999; Seggerson et al., 2002; Wightman et al., 1993). These observations have been reproduced numerous times over the years; whenever the subcellular localization of mRNA targets has been examined, those mRNAs are found to be exclusively on polysomes and unambiguous evidence has indicated that these polysomes are engaged in active translation( Gu et al., 2009; Nottrott et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2006). Complementing these studies are several studies indicating that a substantive fraction of miRNAs themselves is also associated with actively translating ribosomes( Maroney et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2004). Other observations, including the fact that MREs are less effective when present in open reading frames and the presence of a so-called ribosome shadow( absence of MREs in the 3’ UTR just downstream of stop codons) are consistent with an interaction between miRNA-effector complexes and translating ribosomes( Bartel, 2009). In sum, this body of evidence has led to the development of the hypothesis, which still persists in the literature, that miRNAs regulate translation in some way during the elongation phase but this hypothesis has been recalcitrant to mechanistic proof. It is difficult to reconcile the large body of evidence that shows that miRNA targeted mRNAs are associated with translating ribosomes with the equally compelling body of evidence that indicates that most miRNA-mediated downregulation occurs through mRNA destabilization. The conundrum is that the prevalent view of mRNA decay holds that decay occurs when mRNAs are in a ribosome free state, perhaps in subcellular aggregates known as P bodies, sites of concentrated RNA degradative activities( reviewed in Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006). Here, we provide a solution to this longstanding puzzle by demonstrating that miRNA-mediated mRNA decay occurs cotranslationlly. Decay is initiated by mRNA decapping while targeted mRNAs are polysome bound and proceeds 5’ to 3’ following the last translating ribosome. These observations provide a unifying explanation for a large amount of what has been thought to be disparate experimental data.Discussion:We have provided evidence that miRNAs promote enhanced mRNA decay while the mRNA targets are engaged with actively translating ribosomes. While we have analyzed only two miRNA targets, we think it likely that these observations will be broadly relevant. In cases where the subcellular localization of miRNA targets have been studied, they have invariably been found to be polysome associated( Olsen and Ambros, 1999; Gu et al., 2009; Seggerson et al., 2002; Wightman et al., 1993; Nottrott et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2006). Moreover, miRNAs themselves have been shown to be polysome associated( Maroney et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2004). Our observations are also consistent with a large body of transcriptome wide analyses obtained from studies primarily in mammalial systems that have shown that mRNA destabilization is the primary if not sole effect of miRNA-mediated down regulation of protein production from targeted mRNAs( Guo et al., 2010; Eichhorn et al, 2014). They are also consistent with studies in Drosophila S2 cells that have shown that miRNA effector complexes as well as general decay enzymes including deadenylases and decapping factors are ribosome associated( Antic et al., 2015). While cotranslational miRNA-mediated mRNA decay rationalizes a very large body of published results, there are some observations that are difficult to reconcile with this unifying model of miRNA-mediated action. For example one study in a C. elegans cell free system showed that miRNA-targeted mRNAs were deadenylated and translationally repressed but not degraded( Wu et al., 2010). Another example, also from C. elegans, used ribosome profiling in vivo to show that miRNA mediated regulation in some cases correlated with mRNA abundance but in other cases did not( Stadler et al., 2012). Finally, there are also examples of Drosophila miRNA targeted mRNAs which appear to be regulated at the level of translation and not stability( e. g. Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011 and Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006a; 2006b). These examples might indicate that some specific mRNPs are subject to distinct regulatory pathways. Future studies may elucidate mRNP specific factors that mediate these effects. Cotranslational mRNA decay was shown several years ago for a selected group of mRNAs in budding yeast( Hu et al., 2009). More recently, studies have shown that such decay is the dominant if not sole pathway for normal mRNA decay in yeast( Pelechano et al., 2015). Our findings extend these observations to higher eukaryotes and suggest that cotranslational decay may be a widespread phenomenon. Our results do not speak specifically to how mRNA decay is triggered. In that regard there has been a longstanding debate in the field as to whether inhibition of translation initiation is a prerequisite for miRNA-mediated enhanced decay( Bazzini et al., 2012; Djuranovic et al., 2012; Eichhorn et al., 2014; Subtelny et al., 2014). Indeed over the years a large variety of different inhibition scenarios have been proposed including mRNA sequestration from the translation apparatus and inactivation of an array of initiation factors( e. g. Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006; Mathonnet et al., 2007; Chendrimada et al., 2007; Kiriakidou et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Fukaya et al., 2014), the latest being eIF4AI and II( Fukao et al., 2014; Meijer et al., 2013). Unfortunately none of these mechanisms including eIF4AI and II( see Galicia-Vázquez et al., 2015) has received sustained experimental support and it is currently unclear how or if initiation of translation is truly impaired in a microRNA-mediated fashion. Independent of miRNA-mediated mRNA decapping, mRNAs decap in general( Coller and Parker, 2004). For general mRNA decapping, translational initiation is also believed to be in competition with the DCP2/1 holoenzyme. Importantly, despite this well accepted notion that initiation and decapping compete, it remains to be established how, when, or even if dissolution of the translational initiation complex occurs prior to DCP2/1-mediated cleavage. Thus the events triggering decapping are still murky but may include recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX6( Chen et al., 2014; Mathys et al., 2014; Rouya et al., 2014). Importantly, however, since eIF-4F requires a cap to stimulate translation, decapping itself clearly and dramatically limits any further ribosome association and thus can itself be thought of as a potent and irreversible inhibitor of translation initiation. The first report of inhibition of initiation of translation came from polysome analysis where it was shown that an miRNA targeted mRNA migrated on lighter polysomes than a control mRNA( Pillai et al., 2005). Notably, however, all of the targeted mRNA was associated with ribosomes; there was no mRNA sedimenting in the RNP region of the gradient( Pillai et al., 2005). These results were interpreted to mean that miRNAs repressed translation initiation. We too observe that targeted mRNAs migrate on lighter polysomes than untargeted mRNAs( Figure 2—figure supplement 4). However, we suggest an alternative explanation for this phenomenon. It seems possible that the act of decapping itself could account for the altered sedimentation of targeted mRNAs. If decapping is a prerequisite for but not rate limiting for mRNA decay, decapped but not degraded mRNAs could persist. Because already engaged ribosomes would continue to elongate and eventually terminate, decapped but intact mRNAs would shift to lighter polysomes as elongating ribosomes clear the mRNA. We note that this notion is not entirely speculative. We have observed decapped mRNAs with 5’ termini that map both near the start site of the mRNA and near the translational initiation codon. Importantly, these RNAs, which would appear to be full length, are detected throughout polysomes of different sizes both large and small( Figure 5D). These observations indicate that 5’ to 3’ exonucleolytic decay is not obligatorily coupled to decapping because if such coupling existed we would not observe full length decapped mRNA. It seems possible the concentration of degradation fragments near the initiation AUG could result from the buildup of ribosomes near the beginning of the open reading frame as observed in ribosome profiling studies( e. g. Ingolia et al., 2011). Collectively, these observations suggest that decapping while a prerequisite for mRNA decay is not likely to be rate limiting for decay itself; exonucleolytic digestion by XRN1 is likely to be rate limiting. In sum, we have provided an explanation for a longstanding mystery in the miRNA field and have suggested a plausible model for miRNA action that is consistent with a large body of experimental results obtained in numerous laboratories.","answer":"DNA encodes instructions to make proteins .

However, the relative contribution from each enzyme remains controversial. The CYP2B6*6 allele is associated with reduced enzyme expression and activity that may lead to interindividual variability in ketamine metabolism. We examined the N-demethylation of individual ketamine enantiomers using human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped for the CYP2B6*6 allele, insect cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes and COS-1 cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6.1 and CYP2B6.6 protein variant. Effects of CYP-selective inhibitors on norketamine formation were also determined in HLMs. The two-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model best fitted the HLM kinetic data. The Km value for the high affinity enzyme and the low affinity enzyme were similar to those for the expressed CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, respectively. The intrinsic clearance for both ketamine enantiomers by the high affinity enzyme in HLMs with CYP2B6*1/*1 genotype were at least 2-fold and 6-fold higher, respectively, than those for CYP2B6*1/*6 genotype and CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype. The Vmax and Km values for CYP2B6.1 were approximately 160% and 70% of those for CYP2B6.6, respectively. ThioTEPA (CYP2B6 inhibitor, 25 μM) and the monoclonal antibody against CYP2B6 but not troleandomycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor, 25 μM) or the monoclonal antibody against CYP3A4 inhibited ketamine N-demethylation at clinically relevant concentrations. The degree of inhibition was significantly reduced in HLMs with the CYP2B6*6 allele (gene-dose P<0.05). These results indicate a major role of CYP2B6 in ketamine N-demethylation in vitro and a significant impact of the CYP2B6*6 allele on enzyme-ketamine binding and catalytic activity.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"ThioTEPA\\", \\"troleandomycin\\", \\"ketamine\\", \\"norketamine\\", \\"Ketamine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"CYP2B6\\", \\"CYP2B6*1\\", \\"CYP2B6*6\\", \\"CYP2B6.6\\", \\"CYP2B6.1\\", \\"CYP3A4\\", \\"cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6\\", \\"CYP\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Potentials for international spread via commercial air travel had been assessed [7] . Public health concerns are being paid globally on how many people are infected and suspected. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a mathematical model to estimate the transmissibility and dynamic of the transmission of the virus. There were several researches focusing on mathematical modelling [3, 8] . These researches focused on calculating the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) by using the serial intervals and intrinsic growth rate [3, 9, 10] , or using ordinary differential equations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods [8] . However, the bat origin and the transmission route form the seafood market to people were not considered in the published models. In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRP) transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model, and R 0 was calculated based on the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. The reported cases of SARS-CoV-2, which have been named as COVID-19, were collected for the modelling study from a published literature [3] . As reported by Li et al. [3] , the onset date of the first case was on 7 December, 2020, and the seafood market was closed on 1 January, 2020 [11] . The epidemic curve from 7 December, 2019 to 1 January, 2020 was collected for our study, and the simulation time step was 1 day. fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, with tolerance set at 0.001, was used to perform curve fitting. While the curve fitting is in progress, Berkeley Madonna displays the root mean square deviation between the data and best run so far. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was employed to assess the goodness-of-fit. SPSS 13.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was employed to calculate the R 2 . The Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRP) transmission network modelThe BHRP transmission network model was posted to bioRxiv on 19 January, 2020 [12] . We assumed that the virus transmitted among the bats, and then transmitted to unknown hosts (probably some wild animals). The hosts were hunted and sent to the seafood market which was defined as the reservoir of the virus. People exposed to the market got the risks of the infection (Fig. 1) . The BHRP transmission network model was based on the following assumptions or facts:a) The bats were divided into four compartments: susceptible bats (S B ), exposed bats (E B ), infected bats (I B ), and removed bats (R B ). The birth rate and death rate of bats were defined as n B and m B . In this model, we set Ʌ B = n B × N B as the number of the newborn bats where N B refer to the total number of bats. The incubation period of bat infection was defined as 1/ω B and the infectious period of bat infection was defined as 1/γ B . The S B will be infected through sufficient contact with I B , and the transmission rate was defined as β B . b) The hosts were also divided into four compartments: susceptible hosts (S H ), exposed hosts (E H ), infected hosts (I H ), and removed hosts (R H ). The birth rate and death rate of hosts were defined as n H and m H . In this model, we set Ʌ H = n H × N H where N H refer to the total number of hosts. The incubation period of host infection was defined as 1/ω H and the infectious period of host infection was defined as 1/γ H . The S H will be infected through sufficient contact with I B and I H , and the transmission rates were defined as β BH and β H , respectively. c) The SARS-CoV-2 in reservoir (the seafood market) was denoted as W. We assumed that the retail purchases rate of the hosts in the market was a, and that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the purchases was I H /N H , therefore, the rate of the SARS-CoV-2 in W imported form the hosts was aWI H /N H where N H was the total number of hosts. We also assumed that symptomatic infected people and asymptomatic infected people could export the virus into W with the rate of μ P and μ' P , although this assumption might occur in a low probability. The virus in W will subsequently leave the W compartment at a rate of εW, where 1/ε is the lifetime of the virus. d) The people were divided into five compartments:susceptible people (S P ), exposed people (E P ), symptomatic infected people (I P ), asymptomatic infected people (A P ), and removed people (R P ) including recovered and death people. The birth rate and death rate of people were defined as n P and m P . In this model, we set Ʌ P = n P × N P where N P refer to the total number of people. The incubation period and latent period of human infection was defined as 1/ω P and 1/ω' P . The infectious period of I P and A P was defined as 1/γ P and 1/γ' P . The proportion of asymptomatic infection was defined as δ P . The S P will be infected through sufficient contact with W and I P , and the transmission rates were defined as β W and β P , respectively. We also assumed that the transmissibility of A P was κ times that of I P , where 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1. The parameters of the BHRP model were shown in Table 1 . We assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 might be imported to the seafood market in a short time. Therefore, we added the further assumptions as follows:a) The transmission network of Bats-Host was ignored. b) Based on our previous studies on simulating importation [13, 14] , we set the initial value of W as following impulse function:In the function, n, t 0 and t i refer to imported volume of the SARS-CoV-2 to the market, start time of the simulation, and the interval of the importation. Therefore, the BHRP model was simplified as RP model and is shown as follows:During the outbreak period, the natural birth rate and death rate in the population was in a relative low level. However, people would commonly travel into and out from Wuhan City mainly due to the Chinese New Year holiday. Therefore, n P and m P refer to the rate of people traveling into Wuhan City and traveling out from Wuhan City, respectively. In the model, people and viruses have different dimensions. Based on our previous research [15] , we therefore used the following sets to perform the normalization:In the normalization, parameter c refers to the relative shedding coefficient of A P compared to I P . The normalized RP model is changed as follows:The transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 based on the RP modelIn this study, we used the R 0 to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. Commonly, R 0 was defined as the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population [13, 16, 17] . If R 0 > 1, the outbreak will occur. If R 0 < 1, the outbreak will toward an end. In this study, R 0 was deduced from the RP model by the next generation matrix approach [18] . The multiple of the transmissibility of A P to that of I P . The parameters were estimated based on the following facts and assumptions:a) The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1-7.0) [3] . We set the same value (5.2 days) of the incubation period and the latent period in this study. Thus, ω P = ω' P = 0.1923. b) There is a mean 5-day  delay from symptom onset to detection/hospitalization of a case (the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were hospitalized from 3 to 7 days after onset, respectively) [19] [20] [21] . The duration from illness onset to first medical visit for the 45 patients with illness onset before January 1 was estimated to have a mean of 5.8 days (95% CI: 4.3-7.5) [3] . In our model, we set the infectious period of the cases as 5.8 days. Therefore, γ P = 0.1724. c) Since there was no data on the proportion of asymptomatic infection of the virus, we simulated the baseline value of proportion of 0.5 (δ P = 0.5). d) Since there was no evidence about the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection, we assumed that the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was 0.5 times that of symptomatic infection (κ = 0.5), which was the similar value as influenza [22] . We assumed that the relative shedding rate of A P compared to I P was 0.5. Thus, c = 0.5. e) Since 14 January, 2020, Wuhan City has strengthened the body temperature detection of passengers leaving Wuhan at airports, railway stations, long-distance bus stations and passenger terminals. As of January 17, a total of nearly 0.3 million people had been tested for body temperature [23] . In Wuhan, there are about 2.87 million mobile population [24] . We assumed that there was 0.1 million people moving out to Wuhan City per day since January 10, 2020, and we believe that this number would increase (mainly due to the winter vacation and the Chinese New Year holiday) until 24 January, 2020. This means that the 2.87 million would move out from Wuhan City in about 14 days. Therefore, we set the moving volume of 0.2 million per day in our model. Since the population of Wuhan was about 11 million at the end of 2018 [25] , the rate of people traveling out from Wuhan City would be 0.018 (0.2/11) per day. However, we assumed that the normal population mobility before January 1 was 0.1 times as that after January 10. Therefore, we set the rate of people moving into and moving out from Wuhan City as 0.0018 per day (n P = m P = 0.0018). f) The parameters b P and b W were estimated by fitting the model with the collected data. g) At the beginning of the simulation, we assumed that the prevalence of the virus in the market was 1/100000. h) Since the SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, we assumed that it could be died in the environment in a short time, but it could be stay for a longer time (10 days) in the unknown hosts in the market. We set ε = 0.1. In this study, we assumed that the incubation period (1/ ω P ) was the same as latent period (1/ω' P ) of human infection, thus ω P = ω' P . Based on the equations of RP model, we can get the disease free equilibrium point as: In the matrix:By the next generation matrix approach, we can get the next generation matrix and R 0 for the RP model: The R 0 of the normalized RP model is shown as follows:Our modelling results showed that the normalized RP model fitted well to the reported SARS-CoV-2 cases data (R 2 = 0.512, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2) . The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person, and from person to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58. In this study, we developed RP transmission model, which considering the routes from reservoir to person and from person to person of SARS-CoV-2 respectively. We used the models to fit the reported data in Wuhan City, China from published literature [3] . The simulation results showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.58 from person to person. There was a research showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47-2.86) [8] . Another research showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.9) [3] . The different values might be due to the different methods. The methods which Li et al. employed were based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval [3] . Our previous study showed that several methods could be used to calculate the R 0 based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval, and different methods might result in different values of R 0 [26] . Our results also showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.30 from reservoir to person which was lower than that of person to person. This means that the transmission route was mainly from person to person rather than from reservoir to person in the early stage of the transmission in Wuhan City. However, this result was based on the limited data from a published literature, and it might not show the real situation at the early stage of the transmission. Researches showed that the R 0 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was about 2.7-3.4 or 2-4 in Hong Kong, China [27, 28] . Another research found that the R 0 of SARS was about 2.1 in Hong Kong, China, 2.7 in Singapore, and 3.8 in Beijing, China [29] . Therefore, we believe that the commonly acceptable average value of the R 0 of SARS might be 2.9 [30] . The transmissibility of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is much lower than SARS. The reported value of the R 0 of MERS was about 0.8-1.3 [31] , with the inter-human transmissibility of the disease was about 0.6 or 0.9 in Middle East countries [32] . However, MERS had a high transmissibility in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea with the R 0 of 2.5-7.2 [33, 34] . Therefore, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than MERS in the Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS transmitted in the Republic of Korea. To contain the transmission of the virus, it is important to decrease R 0 . According to the equation of R 0 deduced from the simplified RP model, R 0 is related to many parameters. The mainly parameters which could be changed were b P , b W , and γ. Interventions such as wearing masks and increasing social distance could decrease the b P , the intervention that close the seafood market could decrease the b W , and shorten the duration form symptoms onset to be diagnosed could decrease 1/γ. All these interventions could decrease the effective reproduction number and finally be helpful to control the transmission. Since there are too many parameters in our model, several limitations exist in this study.Question: What was the mean delay from symptom onset to detection/hospitalization of a case?","answer":"5-day"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia. The typical fluoxetine-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine-induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder. Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, dose reduction, or both. The authors suggest that fluoxetine-induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine-induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant-induced \\"jitteriness\\" may be identical.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"antidepressant\\", \\"Fluoxetine\\", \\"propranolol\\", \\"fluoxetine\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"anxiety\\", \\"obsessive compulsive disorder\\", \\"major depression\\", \\"akathisia\\", \\"Akathisia\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

We hope that our derivation helps clarify the similarities and differences between the two. In particular, we observe that IS, as it optimizes a multiclass classification task (in contrast to solving a binary task), may be a better choice. Indeed, the updates to the logits with IS are tied whereas in NCE they are independent. Table 3 shows the test perplexities of NCE vs IS loss after a few epochs of 2048 unit LSTM with 512 projection.

Elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) is associated with increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular-associated mortality. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked polymorphisms in G6PC2 with variations in FBG and body fat, although not insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance. G6PC2 encodes an islet-specific, endoplasmic reticulum-resident glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit. A combination of in situ perfused pancreas, in vitro isolated islet, and in vivo analyses were used to explore the function of G6pc2 in mice. G6pc2 deletion had little effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, whereas body fat was reduced in female G6pc2 knockout (KO) mice on both a chow and high-fat diet, observations that are all consistent with human GWAS data. G6pc2 deletion resulted in a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). As a consequence, under fasting conditions in which plasma insulin levels were identical, blood glucose levels were reduced in G6pc2 KO mice, again consistent with human GWAS data. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was reduced, whereas basal cytoplasmic calcium levels were elevated in islets isolated from G6pc2 KO mice. These data suggest that G6pc2 represents a novel, negative regulator of basal GSIS that acts by hydrolyzing glucose-6-phosphate, thereby reducing glycolytic flux.","answer":"[[\\"glucose-6-phosphate\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"G6pc2\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy causes substantial morbidity and mortality in Latin America. Whether RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers are safe and beneficial has been challenged because of the lack of formal trials.                We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized trial in 42 patients with Trypanosoma cruzi infection and cardiomyopathy. All patients received enalapril (up-titrated to 20 mg BID) and spironolactone (25 mg QD). Subsequently, the patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 20) or carvedilol up-titrated to 25 mg BID (n = 19). The primary end points were change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after RAS inhibition and that after the addition of carvedilol. The secondary end points were changes in other echocardiographic parameters, Framingham score, quality of life (36-item Short-Form Health Survey), New York Heart Association class, radiographic indices, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and chemokines as well as safety end points.                Optimization of RAS inhibition was safe, hemodynamically well tolerated, and associated with improvements in Framingham score (P = .001) and quality of life as well as reductions in the cardiothoracic index (P = .002), brain natriuretic peptide level (P = .032), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) level (P = .001). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 2.3% (P = .25); in patients with an LVEF < or = 45% at baseline, it increased by 2.8% (P = .017). Treatment with carvedilol was associated with a trend toward an increase in LVEF (absolute difference between groups, 2.3%; P = .094). The addition of carvedilol was safe, hemodynamically well tolerated, and not associated with symptomatic bradycardia.                In patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, optimization of treatment with enalapril and spironolactone and subsequent addition of carvedilol were safe and associated with benefits in cardiac function and clinical status. Larger trials are needed to show effects on mortality and/or hospitalization.","answer":"This Cochrane review has found a lack of evidence on the effects of carvedilol for treating heart failure in patients with Chagas disease. The two included trials were underpowered and had a high risk of bias. There are no conclusive data to support the use of carvedilol for treating Chagas cardiomyopathy. Unless randomized clinical trials provide evidence of a treatment effect, and the trade off between potential benefits and harms is established, policy-makers, clinicians, and academics should be cautious when recommending and administering carvedilol for treating heart failure in patients with Chagas disease. The efficacy and safety of other pharmacological interventions for treating heart failure in patients with Chagas disease is unknown."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Telomerase enables tumor cells to maintain telomere length, allowing indefinite replicative capacity.telomerase is believed to be necessary for cancer cells to grow without limitTelomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme is considered as a universal therapeutic target of cancer because of its preferential expression in cancer cells and its presence in 90 % of tumors.Interestingly, almost 100 % of adenocarcinoma, including breast cancer cells, expresses telomerase which makes it a good target for telomerase-related therapy.The observation that the enzyme telomerase is up-regulated in 80-90% of cancer cells isolated from primary human tumors but is absent in neighboring cells of healthy tissue has resulted in significant efforts to validate telomerase as an anticancer drug target and to develop effective approaches toward its inhibition.Telomerase plays an important role in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis and is believed to be a good target for anti-cancer drugs.In contrast to cancer cells, most normal human cells have no or low telomerase levels which makes it an attractive target for anti-cancer drugs.Telomerase activity is repressed in normal human somatic cells, but is activated in most cancers, suggesting that telomerase may be an important target for cancer therapy.Telomerase is expressed in more than 85% of cancer cells, making it a nearly universal cancer marker, while the majority of normal somatic cells are telomerase negativeThe activity of telomerase is highly associated with carcinogenesis which makes the enzyme an attractive biomarker in cancer diagnosis and treatmentThe human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is expressed in more than 85% of tumor cells but is usually not found in normal cells, which makes hTERT as an ideal tumor-associate antigen (TAA) to develop potential vaccine specifically destroying cancers without impairing normal tissues in human cancer immunotherapyThe differential expression of telomerase in cancer cells makes it an attractive therapeutic targetThe evidence that telomerase is also present in normal B cells at different levels according to their differentiation and activation state makes the study of telomerase activity in B cell tumors particularly interestingTelomerase is up-regulated in the majority of cancer cells and is essential for their survival, making it a potential anti-cancer drug target.In contrast to cancer cells, most normal human cells have no or low telomerase levels which makes it an attractive target for anti-cancer drugs.As normal cells have a considerable telomere reserve, even in elderly humans, this makes telomerase an attractive and potentially selective anti-cancer drug target.The expression of telomerase in approximately 85% of cancers and its absence in the majority of normal cells makes it an attractive target for cancer therapy.Moreover, since telomerase is not or slightly expressed in normal cells, it has been postulated that drugs targeting telomerase would induce low toxicity.Telomerase is expressed in most cancer cells, but not in normal somatic cells, suggesting that telomerase is an attractive target for cancer chemotherapyelomerase, a special reverse transcriptase, has been recognized as a common factor in most tumor cells, and in turn a distinctive characteristic with respect to non-malignant cellsTelomerase is detected in the majority of prostate cancers, but not in normal or benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue.The catalytic component of telomerase in humans, hTERT, is upregulated in nearly 90% of all cancers, making it the most widely expressed marker of malignancy. With the exception of germ cells and stem cells, hTERT is undetectable in somatic human tissues.he notion that telomerase is reactivated in 80-90% of human cancers has led to the proposal of telomerase as a promising therapeutic target for novel anticancer interventions","answer":"Human telomerase is absent in most normal tissues, but is abnormally activated in all major cancer cells.

Introduction<p>Indole derivatives have emerged as important class of nitrogen containing heterocycles and are known to possess broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities [1, 2]. In particular, bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) which are isolated from terrestrial and marine natural sources such as parasitic bacteria, tunicates, and sponge are found as possible antibacterial, anticarcinogenic, genotoxic, and DNA-damaging agents [3]. BIMs are active cruciferous substances for promoting estrogen metabolism [4] and have the ability to prevent cancer by modulating certain cancer-causing estrogen metabolites [5].</p><p>Owing to their diverse biological properties, many methods have been developed for their synthesis using various catalytic systems such as amberlyst-15 [6], iodine [7], boric acid [8], fluoroboric acid [9], sulfamic acid [10], NbCl5 [11], silica sulfuric acid [12], cellulose sulfuric acid [13], zeolite [14], ceric ammonium nitrate [15], polyvinylsulfonic acid [16], dodecylsulfonic acid [17], dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid [18], HClO4-SiO2 [19], ZrOCl2·8H2O [20], Dy(OTf)3 [21], protic solvent [22], and ionic liquids [23]. However, most of these reported methods suffer from one or several drawbacks such as low yields, prolonged reaction times, use of hazardous, expensive, moisture-sensitive, and large quantity of reagents, involving harsh reaction conditions, tedious workup procedure, and difficulty in recovery, and reusability of the catalysts. Therefore, still there is a need to develop an efficient, eco-friendly, and versatile method for the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes.</p><p>In continuation of our research towards the synthesis of biologically important molecules using novel methodologies [24], we report herein a simple, highly efficient, and eco-friendly method for the synthesis of bis(3-indolyl)methanes using poly(4-vinylpyridinium)hydrogen sulfate [P(4-VPH)HSO4] [25] as heterogeneous and reusable solid acid catalyst.</p>2. Results and Discussion<p>The electrophilic substitution reaction of indole with aryl aldehydes catalyzed by P(4-VPH)HSO4 is shown in Scheme 1. The reaction smoothly proceeds at room temperature under grinding technique to provide the corresponding bis(3-indolyl)methane with good yields in shorter reaction times.</p><p>In order to synthesize bis(3-indolyl)methanes under solvent-free conditions, a model reaction was performed between indole and benzaldehyde using P(4-VPH)HSO4 as catalyst (Scheme 2). Indole (2 mmol) and benzaldehyde (1 mmol) were taken in a mortar and ground at room temperature with pestle by the different amount of catalyst (Table 1). After completion of the reaction shown by TLC (monitored every 2 min), we observed 94% yield in 12 min in the presence of 15 mg of the catalyst. Decreasing the amount of the catalyst results in; low yield of the product (3a) even after prolonged reaction times than the higher amount of catalyst does not show any effect on product yield and reaction time. At the optimized conditions (15 mg of catalyst, grinding at room temperature), the reaction was carried out with substituted aldehydes and the corresponding bis(3-indolyl)methanes were obtained in good yields (Table 2). All the synthesized compounds were well characterized by their analytical and spectral studies and compared with the literature values.</p><p>We investigated the efficiency of P(4-VPH)HSO4 compared to other acid catalysts based on the synthesis of bis(indol-3-yl)phenylmethane (3a). The results show that P(4-VPH)HSO4 is an efficient catalyst in terms of product yield and reaction time (Table 3). The catalyst was recovered after completion of the reaction; the catalyst was washed with dichloromethane, dried, and reused for subsequent reactions for additional five times. We observed a slight decrease in its activity in terms of product yield (Table 4).</p><p>A plausible mechanism for the formation of bis(3-indolyl)methanes catalysed by P(4-VPH)HSO4 is proposed in Scheme 3. In the presence of catalyst, the electrophilicity of carbonyl carbon has increased and it readily reacts with indole, affording the corresponding 3-arylidine-3H-indole [A] via dehydration. Intermediate [A] on reaction with second mole of indole followed by rearrangement affords the final product in good yield.</p>3. Experimental<p>All the reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich/Merck and used without further purification. Melting points were determined in open capillaries using Stuart SMP30 apparatus and are uncorrected. The progress of the reactions as well as purity of compounds was monitored by thin layer chromatography with F254 silica-gel precoated sheets using hexane, ethyl acetate (8 : 2) as eluent; UV light and iodine vapors were used for detection. Products were characterized by comparison with authentic samples and by spectroscopy data (IR and 1H NMR). IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 100S spectrometer using KBr disk, and values are expressed in cm−1. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer and chemical shifts are expressed in ppm. Elemental analyses were performed on a Carlo Erba modal EA1108 and Mass spectra were recorded on a Jeol JMSD-300 spectrometer.</p>3.1. General Procedure for the Synthesis of Bis(3-indolyl)methanes (3a–n)<p>Poly(4-vinylpyridinium)hydrogen sulfate (15 mg) was added to a mixture of indole (2 mmol) and aryl aldehyde (1 mmol) in a mortar and ground with a pestle in appropriate time as shown in Table 2. After completion of the reaction monitored by TLC, 5 mL of water was added and stirred at room temperature for additional 5 min. Thus, the solid obtained was filtered, washed with water, dried, and recrystallized from ethanol to afford the analytically pure product. Aqueous layer containing catalyst was recovered under reduced pressure, washed with dichloromethane, dried, and reused for subsequent reactions.</p>3.2.1.

Seventy-one patients were evaluated (38 men and 33 women aged 63.9±10.2 years). They were divided into three groups, which were 45 patients receiving premixed insulin twice daily, 15 patients receiving multiple daily insulin injections, and 11 patients receiving basal insulin with oral antidiabetic drugs (basal insulin therapy). Concomitant oral drugs included sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase inhibitors and metformin. The hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of all patients improved significantly from 8.1±1.2% to 7.6±1.1% after 12 weeks of add-on therapy with sitagliptin (p<0.01), and the insulin dosage was reduced from 27.3±15.8 U/day to 24.5±16.5 U/day (p<0.001). Body weight did not change after the start of concomitant therapy and severe hypoglycemia was not observed. The baseline HbA1c and glycated albumin levels were identified as factors that predicted the response to add-on therapy with sitagliptin. These findings suggest that add-on therapy with sitagliptin can be expected to achieve improvement of poor glycemic control irrespective of a patient's demographic profile. Stratified analysis based on the insulin regimen revealed a stronger antidiabetic effect and a high efficacy of sitagliptin when it was added to basal insulin therapy. The results of this investigation confirmed that add-on therapy with sitagliptin to various insulin regimens could improve glycemic control without severe hypoglycemia and/or weight gain.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"sitagliptin\\", \\"metformin\\", \\"sulfonylureas\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"hemoglobin A1c\\", \\"DPP-4\\", \\"glycated albumin\\", \\"u03b1-glucosidase\\", \\"insulin\\", \\"HbA1c\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

But less is known about the knowledge, protection behavior and anxiety regarding the outbreak among the general population. METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted in China and abroad from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Socio-demographic information was collected and knowledge scores, practice scores, anxiety scores and perceived risk were calculated. General linear model and binary logistic regression were used to identify possible associations. RESULTS: We included 9,764 individuals in this study, and 156 (1.6%) were from Hubei Province. The average knowledge score was 4.7 (standard deviation, 1.0) (scored on a 6-point scale); 96.1% maintained hand hygiene, and 90.3% of participants had varying levels of anxiety. People in Hubei Province were the most anxious, followed by those in Beijing and Shanghai. People who had experienced risk behaviors did not pay more attention to wearing masks and hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: The public had high awareness on knowledge of COVID-19 outbreak, and a high proportion of people practiced good hand hygiene behavior.

In myotonic dystrophy (DM), the size of a CTG repeat in the DM kinase gene generally increases in successive generations with clinical evidence of anticipation. However, there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat. We examined 1, 489 DM parent-offspring pairs, of which 95 (6. 4%) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). In 56 of the 95 pairs, clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status. It is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 (48%) of these 56 pairs, while none clearly showed a later onset of DM in the symptomatic offspring. The contraction occurred in 76 (10%) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 (3%) of 736 maternal transmissions. Anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal (85%) than in paternal (37%) transmissions (P <. 001). The parental repeat size correlated with the size of intergenerational contraction (r2 =. 50, P < <. 001), and the slope of linear regression was steeper in paternal (-. 62) than in maternal (-. 30) transmissions (P < <. 001). Sixteen DM parents had multiple DM offspring with the CTG repeat contractions. This frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions (6. 4%) and the size of DM sib population (1. 54 DM offspring per DM parent, in 968 DM parents). We conclude that (1) intergenerational contractions of the CTG repeat in leukocyte DNA frequently accompanies apparent anticipation, especially when DM is maternally transmitted, and (2) the paternal origin of the repeat and the presence of the repeat contraction in a sibling increase the probability of the CTG repeat contraction","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"myotonic dystrophy\\", \\"DM\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Previous studies established that stimulation of ErbB receptors in breast cancer cells activates Rac1 and enhances motility via the Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor P-Rex1. As the Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (Jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway has been shown to be functionally associated with ErbB receptors, we asked if this pathway could mediate P-Rex1/Rac1 activation in response to ErbB ligands. Here we found that the anticancer agent cucurbitacin I, a Jak2 inhibitor, reduced the activation of Rac1 and motility in response to the ErbB3 ligand heregulin in breast cancer cells. However, Rac1 activation was not affected by Jak2 or Stat3 RNA interference, suggesting that the effect of cucurbitacin I occurs through a Jak2-independent mechanism. Cucurbitacin I also failed to affect the activation of P-Rex1 by heregulin. Subsequent analysis revealed that cucurbitacin I strongly activates RhoA and the Rho effector Rho kinase (ROCK) in breast cancer cells and induces the formation of stress fibers. Interestingly, disruption of the RhoA-ROCK pathway prevented the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation by heregulin. Lastly, we found that RhoA activation by cucurbitacin I is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger N-acetyl l-cysteine and the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO rescued the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that ErbB-driven Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells proceeds independently of the Jak2 pathway. Moreover, they established that the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activity involves the alteration of the balance between Rho and Rac.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"guanine nucleotide\\", \\"N-acetyl l-cysteine\\", \\"Cucurbitacin I\\", \\"tyrosine\\", \\"cucurbitacin I\\", \\"oxygen\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"heregulin\\", \\"Rho\\", \\"Stat3\\", \\"Janus tyrosine kinase 2\\", \\"Rac\\", \\"Rac1\\", \\"GTPase\\", \\"ROCK\\", \\"RhoA\\", \\"signal transducer and activator of transcription 3\\", \\"Jak2\\", \\"rac1\\", \\"ErbB\\", \\"Rho kinase\\", \\"ErbB3\\", \\"p-rex1\\", \\"P-Rex1\\", \\"janus tyrosine kinase 2\\", \\"Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Sublingual nitroglycerin may be taken if necessary for the control of acute angina attacks during Bepridil therapy. Beta-blocking Agents: The concomitant use of Bepridil and beta-blocking agents has been well tolerated in patients with stable angina. Available data are not sufficient, however, to predict the effects of concomitant medication on patients with impaired ventricular function or cardiac conduction abnormalities. Digoxin: In controlled studies in healthy volunteers, bepridil hydrochloride either had no effect (one study) or was associated with modest increases, about 30% (two studies) in steady-state serum digoxin concentrations. Limited clinical data in angina patients receiving concomitant bepridil hydrochloride and digoxin therapy indicate no discernible changes in serum digoxin levels. Available data are neither sufficient to rule out possible increases in serum digoxin with concomitant treatment in some patients, nor other possible interactions, particularly in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities (Also see WARNINGS Congestive Heart Failure). Oral Hypoglycemics: Bepridil has been safely used in diabetic patients without significantly lowering their blood glucose levels or altering their need for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. General Interactions: Certain drugs could increase the likelihood of potentially serious adverse effects with bepridil hydrochloride. In general, these are drugs that have one or more pharmacologic activities similar to bepridil hydrochloride, including anti-arrhythmic agents such as quinidine and procainamide, cardiac glycosides and tricyclic anti-depressants. Anti-arrhythmics and tricyclic anti-depressants could exaggerate the prolongation of the QT interval observed with bepridil hydrochloride. Cardiac glycosides could exaggerate the depression of AV nodal conduction observed with bepridil hydrochloride.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"digoxin\\", \\"bepridil hydrochloride\\", \\"Bepridil\\", \\"procainamide\\", \\"quinidine\\", \\"nitroglycerin\\", \\"insulin\\", \\"Digoxin\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"hypoglycemic agents\\", \\"cardiac glycosides\\", \\"tricyclic anti-depressants\\", \\"nitrates\\", \\"Anti-arrhythmics\\", \\"Nitrates\\", \\"Cardiac glycosides\\", \\"Hypoglycemics\\", \\"beta-blocking agents\\", \\"Beta-blocking Agents\\", \\"anti-arrhythmic agents\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

The proteins of the high mobility group A (HMGA) family have been previously implicated in breast carcinogenesis [4]. These are non-histone, DNA-binding proteins often referred to as architectural transcription factors. They contain basic A-T hook domains that mediate binding to the minor groove of AT-rich regions of chromosomal DNA. Upon binding to DNA, HMGA proteins regulate gene expression by organizing the transcriptional complex through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (reviewed in [5–7]). The HMGA family includes the products of the HMGA1 and HMGA2 genes. Of these, HMGA1 can generate three different protein isoforms through alternative splicing (HMGA1a, b and c). HMGA1a and HMGA1b are the most abundant isoforms, and differ by only 11 amino acids that are present in HMGA1a but not in HMGA1b [4]. HMGA1 is expressed almost exclusively during embryonic development [8], but has been found to be abnormally expressed in several types of cancer, including leukemia [9], pancreatic [10, 11], thyroid [12], colon [13], breast [14–16], lung [17], ovarian [18], endometrial [19], prostate [20], and head and neck cancer [21]. Several studies have also shown that overexpression of HMGA1 induces transformation both in vitro and in animal models (reviewed in [6, 7]).</p><p>The causal role of HMGA1 in breast cancer development and metastasis is supported by studies in cell lines [14, 22, 23] as well as by the analysis of clinical specimens [15, 16]. For example, elevated HMGA1 protein expression has been reported in breast carcinomas and hyperplastic lesions with cellular atypia, in contrast with normal breast tissue where HMGA1 was not detected [15, 16]. Similarly, HMGA1 overexpression has been observed in human breast cancer cell lines, with the highest levels in known metastatic lines, such as Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 [14, 22, 23]. Moreover, exogenous overexpression of HMGA1a was shown to induce transformation of the human non-tumorigenic mammary myoepithelial cell line Hs578Bst in vitro [14] and to increase the metastatic ability of MCF7 breast cancer cells in vivo [22].</p><p>Conversely, decreasing HMGA1 expression in Hs578T breast cancer cells was shown to cause a reduction in anchorage-independent growth, which is a typical feature of cancer cells [14]. HMGA1 is considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention because its expression is virtually absent in normal adult tissue and knockdown of HMGA1 has been shown to interfere with the tumorigenic growth of multiple cancer cell lines [6, 7]. We therefore sought to determine if silencing HMGA1 can affect breast cancer development and metastatic progression in vivo using a human xenograft mouse model.</p>Cell lines, transfections and proliferation assays<p>The MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and cultured in DMEM (Cellgro 10-013), supplemented with 10% FBS and 5 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were propagated for two weeks, aliquoted in media supplemented with 5% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. Each aliquot was used for less than six months. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected by adding 50 μg/ml of blasticidin to the media, and propagated in media without blasticidin. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed on soft agar as previously described [17]. Tumorsphere formation from single cell suspensions was assessed using MammoCult media (STEMCELL Technologies) in ultralow adherence plates (Corning). Spheres were counted using an inverted microscope after seven days of growth. Secondary tumorspheres were generated from single cells suspensions obtained by enzymatic digestion of the primary tumorspheres using 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen). All kits and reagents were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>HMGA1 silencing construct<p>The HMGA1 silencing construct pHMGA1-394-EmGFP-miR was generated using the BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi with EmGFP system (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Briefly, a silencing microRNA (miRNA) RNA interference (RNAi) oligonucleotide was designed based on the reference sequence NM_145899.1, using Invitrogen's RNAi designer. The HMGA1 target sequence with the best rank score (5′-AGCGAAGTGCCAACACCTAAG) was incorporated into a pre-miRNA sequence and cloned into the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector using the reagents and competent E. coli supplied with the kit. Five E. coli clones were isolated and the constructs sequenced. One construct with verified miRNA sequence was selected for transfection. A vector harboring a non-targeting miRNA sequence provided with the kit was used as control.</p>Gene expression Analysis<p>RNA expression was assessed by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) after reverse transcription. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) applying the on-column DNase treatment. The amount and quality of the RNA were verified by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. Reverse transcription was performed with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, and duplex qPCR of the resulting cDNA was performed on a 7500 Real Time PCR System, using the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix, and the Human RPLP0 Endogenous Control (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan primers and probes for HMGA1 were previously described [19]. Reverse Transcriptase negative (RT−) samples were analyzed in parallel to verify the absence of contaminating genomic DNA. All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate. Protein expression was assessed by western blot. Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with added cOmplete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science), and run on 4%–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris Gels using NuPAGE MES SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen). Gels were blotted on PVDF membranes and HMGA1 was detected using 0.3 μg/ml of a goat primary antibody (EB06959, Everest Biotech); Beta Actin (loading control) was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit primary antibody (4967, Cell Signaling Technology). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). All kits were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>Animal experiments<p>NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J (NOD SCID) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, and maintained in Johns Hopkins AAALAC accredited facilities, with all procedures approved by the ACUC. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. Mice were injected subcutaneously at the inguinal mammary fat pad with 2 × 106 cells in 50 μl of serum-free media (one injection per mouse). Tumor growth was monitored for 10 weeks. Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal Avertin overdose, followed by cardiac perfusion with heparinized PBS, then 10% neutral buffer formalin for fixation. Tissues were routinely processed for paraffin embedment, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).</p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>We generated an HMGA1-silencing construct that uses microRNA (miRNA) for RNA interference (RNAi), and co-expresses the fluorescent molecule EmGFP (co-cistronic) for easy detection of the transfected cells (pHMGA1-394-EmGFP-miR). We selected the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 because it was previously shown to overexpress HMGA1 [14], and it is tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice. Stable, polyclonal MDA-MB-231 transfectants were generated, and sorted by flow cytometry. We isolated three fractions with different degrees of EmGFP fluorescence, which were analyzed for HMGA1 expression by qRT-PCR. The analysis showed that knockdown of HMGA1 correlated with fluorescence intensity in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the silencing vector (Figure 1A), as it was expected since the sequences for the miRNA and EmGFP are co-cistronic. There was no decrease in HMGA1 mRNA in cells transfected with the control vector (Figure 1A). This allowed us to select a cell population with efficient knockdown of HMGA1 without isolating individual clones. The fractions with the highest fluorescence were expanded and further analyzed by western blot. HMGA1 was detected exclusively in the control cells (Figure 1B), confirming the efficient knockdown of HMGA1 by this silencing construct.</p><p>Decreasing HMGA1 expression has been shown to inhibit transformation in vitro in various established cancer cells lines [6, 7], including Hs578T breast cancer cells [14]. Thus, we tested our HMGA1-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells for anchorage-independent growth, which is indicative of the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of cancer cells [24], and the ability to form tumorspheres, which reflects stem/progenitor cell properties [25, 26]. Knockdown of HMGA1 reduced colony formation on soft agar by 80%, (P<0.001; Figure 2A) and formation of primary tumorspheres by almost 50% (P=0.019, Figure 2B). The effect of HMGA1 knockdown on the formation of secondary tumorspheres was less pronounced but still significant (Figure 2B; P=0.047). Since we used a polyclonal cell population, the reduced response in the secondary tumorspheres may result from the selection of clones with less efficient HMGA1 knockdown during the formation of the primary tumorspheres. Cell growth in standard tissue culture conditions was not affected (Figure 2C), indicating that silencing HMGA1 does not cause a general inhibition of cell proliferation in this cell line but rather affects specific growth features associated with transformation, similarly to what was previously observed in Hs578T cells [14]. To investigate if knockdown of HMGA1 affects breast cancer development and metastatic progression in vivo, we injected HMGA1-silenced and control MDA-MB-231 cells subcutaneously at the inguinal mammary fat pads of NOD SCID immunodeficient mice. Each cohort consisted of 10 mice, injected at one single site with 2 × 106 cells. Control MDA-MB-231 cells generated large tumors as expected. In contrast, growth of HMGA1-silenced xenografts was significantly inhibited (p<0.0001; two-way anova) indicating that HMGA1 is necessary for in vivo tumorigenesis in this breast cancer cell line (Figure 3A). Tumor growth was monitored for 10 weeks. Post-mortem examination showed that the animals injected with control MDA-MB-231 cells had extensive necrosis of the primary tumors, numerous extensive lung metastases exceeding 1 mm in diameter (Figure 3B), and distant metastases exceeding 5 mm diameter in axillary and contralateral prefemoral (subiliac) lymph nodes (Figure 3C). Animals injected with HMGA1-silenced cells had less necrosis, far less lung metastases (Figure 3B) and only one lymph node metastasis less 2 mm in diameter was observed. This striking difference in metastasis may be the result of a general inhibition of tumorigenesis since the primary tumors generated by HMGA1-silenced cells are significantly smaller than those formed by control cells. However, HMGA1 overexpression is known to affect the transcription of many genes involved in metastatic progression [22, 27] and has recently been associated with repression of MTSS1, which encodes the metastasis suppressor protein 1 [28]. Thus, it is possible that knockdown of HMGA1 in our model is affecting metastatic potential through specific pathways and not only because of the reduced tumor growth.</p><p>In summary, we show that interfering with HMGA1 expression reduces breast tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together with the existing literature, our results indicate that HMGA1 could be a viable target for the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer treatment.</p>","answer":"The high mobility group A1 gene (HMGA1) has been previously implicated in breast carcinogenesis, and is considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention because its expression is virtually absent in normal adult tissue.

We silenced HMGA1 expression in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 using an RNA interference vector, and observed a significant reduction in anchorage-independent growth and tumorsphere formation, which respectively indicate loss of tumorigenesis and self-renewal ability. Moreover, silencing HMGA1 significantly impaired xenograft growth in immunodeficient mice, and while control cells metastasized extensively to the lungs and lymph nodes, HMGA1-silenced cells generated only a few small metastases. Thus, our results show that interfering with HMGA1 expression reduces the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells in vivo, and lend further support to investigations into targeting HMGA1 as a potential treatment for breast cancer."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

Fortext (or image) data, a rationale might consist of a subset of positions in the document (or image) together with the words (or pixel-values) occurring at these positions (see FIG0 . Toensure interpretations remain fully faithful to an arbitrary model, our rationales do not attempt to summarize the (potentially complex) operations carried out within the model, and instead merely point to the relevant information it uses to arrive at a decision [6] . Forhigh-dimensional inputs, sparsity of the rationale is imperative for greater interpretability.Here, we propose a local explanation framework to produce rationales for a learned model that has been trained to map inputs x P X via some arbitrary learned function f : X Ñ R. Unlike many other interpretability techniques, our approach is not restricted to vector-valued data and does not require gradients of f . Rather, each input example is solely presumed to have a set of indexable features x \\" rx 1 , . . . , x p s, where each x i P R d for i P rps \\" t1, . . . , pu. We allowfor features that are unordered (set-valued input) and whose number p may vary from input to input. A rationalecorresponds to a sparse subset of these indices S Ď rps together with the specific values of the features in this subset.To understand why a certain decision was made for a given input example x, we propose a particular rationale called a sufficient input subset (SIS). Each SIS consistsof a minimal input pattern present in x that alone suffices for f to produce the same decision, even if provided no other information about the rest of x. Presuming the decisionis based on f pxq exceeding some pre-specified threshold τ P R, we specifically seek a minimal-cardinality subset S of the input features such that f px S q ě τ . Throughout, we use x SP X to denote a modified input example in which all information about the values of features outside subset S has been masked with features in S remaining at their original values. Thus, each SIS characterizesa particular standalone input pattern that drives the model toward this decision, providing sufficient justification for this choice from the model's perspective, even without any information on the values of the other features in x.In classification settings, f might represent the predicted probability of class C where we decide to assign the input to class C if f pxq ě τ , chosen based on precision/recall considerations. Each SIS in such an applicationcorresponds to a small input pattern that on its own is highly indicative of class C, according to our model. Note that by suitably definingf and τ with respect to the predictor outputs, any particular decision for input x can be precisely identified with the occurrence of f pxq ě τ , where higher values of f are associated with greater confidence in this decision.For a given input x where f pxq ě τ , this work presents a simple method to find a complete collection of sufficient input subsets, each satisfying f px S q ě τ , such that there exists no additional SIS outside of this collection. Each SIS may be understood asa disjoint piece of evidence that would lead the model to the same decision, and why this decision was reached for x can be unequivocally attributed to the SIS-collection. Furthermore, global insight onthe general principles underlying the model's decision-making process may be gleaned by clustering the types of SIS extracted across different data points (see FIG4 and TAB0 ). Such insights allow us to comparemodels based not only on their accuracy, but also on human-determined relevance of the concepts they target. Our method's simplicity facilitatesits utilization by non-experts who may know very little about the models they wish to interrogate.This work introduced the idea of interpreting black-box decisions on the basis of sufficient input subsets -minimal input patterns that alone provide sufficient evidence to justify a particular decision.Our methodology is easy to understand for non-experts, applicable to all ML models without any additional training steps, and remains fully faithful to the underlying model without making approximations.While we focus on local explanations of a single decision, clustering the SISpatterns extracted from many data points reveals insights about a model's general decision-making process.Given multiple models of comparable accuracy, SIS-clustering can uncover critical operating differences, such as which model is more susceptible to spurious training data correlations or will generalize worse to counterfactual inputs that lie outside the data distribution.","answer":"We present a method for interpreting black-box models by using instance-wise backward selection to identify minimal subsets of features that alone suffice to justify a particular decision made by the model."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

We reassess Hassan et al.'s 2018 investigation into Chinese to English news translation, showing that the finding of human-machine parity was owed to weaknesses in the evaluation design - which is currently considered best practice in the field. We show that the professional human translations contained significantly fewer errors, and that perceived quality in human evaluation depends on the choice of raters, the availability of linguistic context, and the creation of reference translations. Our results call for revisiting current best practices to assess strong machine translation systems in general and human-machine parity in particular, for which we offer a set of recommendations based on our empirical findings.IntroductionMachine translation (MT) has made astounding progress in recent years thanks to improvements in neural modelling BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, and the resulting increase in translation quality is creating new challenges for MT evaluation. Human evaluation remains the gold standard, but there are many design decisions that potentially affect the validity of such a human evaluation.This paper is a response to two recent human evaluation studies in which some neural machine translation systems reportedly performed at (or above) the level of human translators for news translation from Chinese to English BIBREF3 and English to Czech BIBREF4, BIBREF5.Both evaluations were based on current best practices in the field: they used a source-based direct assessment with non-expert annotators, using data sets and the evaluation protocol of the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT). While the results are intriguing, especially because they are based on best practices in MT evaluation, BIBREF5 warn against taking their results as evidence for human–machine parity, and caution that for well-resourced language pairs, an update of WMT evaluation style will be needed to keep up with the progress in machine translation. We concur that these findings have demonstrated the need to critically re-evaluate the design of human MT evaluation.Our paper investigates three aspects of human MT evaluation, with a special focus on assessing human–machine parity: the choice of raters, the use of linguistic context, and the creation of reference translations. We focus on the data shared by BIBREF3, and empirically test to what extent changes in the evaluation design affect the outcome of the human evaluation. We find that for all three aspects, human translations are judged more favourably, and significantly better than MT, when we make changes that we believe strengthen the evaluation design. Based on our empirical findings, we formulate a set of recommendations for human MT evaluation in general, and assessing human–machine parity in particular. All of our data are made publicly available for external validation and further analysis.Background ::: Human Evaluation of Machine TranslationThe evaluation of MT quality has been the subject of controversial discussions in research and the language services industry for decades due to its high economic importance. While automatic evaluation methods are particularly important in system development, there is consensus that a reliable evaluation should—despite high costs—be carried out by humans.Various methods have been proposed for the human evaluation of MT quality BIBREF8. What they have in common is that the MT output to be rated is paired with a translation hint: the source text or a reference translation. The MT output is then either adapted or scored with reference to the translation hint by human post-editors or raters, respectively.As part of the large-scale evaluation campaign at WMT, two primary evaluation methods have been used in recent years: relative ranking and direct assessment BIBREF9. In the case of relative ranking, raters are presented with outputs from two or more systems, which they are asked to evaluate relative to each other (e.g., to determine system A is better than system B). Ties (e.g., system A is as good or as bad as system B) are typically allowed. Compared to absolute scores on Likert scales, data obtained through relative ranking show better inter- and intra-annotator agreement BIBREF10. However, they do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the order of magnitude of the differences, so that it is not possible to determine how much better system A was than system B.This is one of the reasons why direct assessment has prevailed as an evaluation method more recently. In contrast to relative ranking, the raters are presented with one MT output at a time, to which they assign a score between 0 and 100. To increase homogeneity, each rater's ratings are standardised BIBREF11. Reference translations serve as the basis in the context of WMT, and evaluations are carried out by monolingual raters. To avoid reference bias, the evaluation can be based on source texts instead, which presupposes bilingual raters, but leads to more reliable results overall BIBREF12.Background ::: Assessing Human–Machine ParityBIBREF3 base their claim of achieving human–machine parity on a source-based direct assessment as described in the previous section, where they found no significant difference in ratings between the output of their MT system and a professional human translation. Similarly, BIBREF5 report that the best-performing English to Czech system submitted to WMT 2018 BIBREF4 significantly outperforms the human reference translation. However, the authors caution against interpreting their results as evidence of human–machine parity, highlighting potential limitations of the evaluation.In this study, we address three aspects that we consider to be particularly relevant for human evaluation of MT, with a special focus on testing human–machine parity: the choice of raters, the use of linguistic context, and the construction of reference translations.Background ::: Assessing Human–Machine Parity ::: Reference TranslationsThe human reference translations with which machine translations are compared within the scope of a human–machine parity assessment play an important role. BIBREF3 used all source texts of the WMT 2017 Chinese–English test set for their experiments, of which only half were originally written in Chinese; the other half were translated from English into Chinese. Since translated texts are usually simpler than their original counterparts BIBREF17, they should be easier to translate for MT systems. Moreover, different human translations of the same source text sometimes show considerable differences in quality, and a comparison with an MT system only makes sense if the human reference translations are of high quality. BIBREF3, for example, had the WMT source texts re-translated as they were not convinced of the quality of the human translations in the test set. At WMT 2018, the organisers themselves noted that the manual evaluation included several reports of ill-formed reference translations BIBREF5. We hypothesise that the quality of the human translations has a significant effect on findings of human–machine parity, which would indicate that it is necessary to ensure that human translations used to assess parity claims need to be carefully vetted for their quality.We empirically test and discuss the impact of these factors on human evaluation of MT in Sections SECREF3–SECREF5. Based on our findings, we then distil a set of recommendations for human evaluation of strong MT systems, with a focus on assessing human–machine parity (Section SECREF6).Choice of RatersBoth professional and amateur evaluators can be involved in human evaluation of MT quality. However, from published work in the field BIBREF19, it is fair to say that there is a tendency to “rely on students and amateur evaluators, sometimes with an undefined (or self-rated) proficiency in the languages involved, an unknown expertise with the text type\\" BIBREF8.Previous work on evaluation of MT output by professional translators against crowd workers by BIBREF20 showed that for all language pairs (involving 11 languages) evaluated, crowd workers tend to be more accepting of the MT output by giving higher fluency and adequacy scores and performing very little post-editing. The authors argued that non-expert translators lack knowledge of translation and so might not notice subtle differences that make one translation more suitable than another, and therefore, when confronted with a translation that is hard to post-edit, tend to accept the MT rather than try to improve it.Choice of Raters ::: ResultsTable TABREF17 shows the TrueSkill scores for each translation resulting from the evaluations by expert and non-expert translators. We find that translation expertise affects the judgement of MT_1 and H_A, where the rating gap is wider for the expert raters. This indicates that non-experts disregard translation nuances in the evaluation, which leads to a more tolerant judgement of MT systems and a lower inter-annotator agreement (kappa =0.13 for non-experts versus kappa =0.254 for experts).It is worth noticing that, regardless of their expertise, the performance of human raters may vary over time. For example, performance may improve or decrease due to learning effects or fatigue, respectively BIBREF23. It is likely that such longitudinal effects are present in our data. They should be accounted for in future work, e. g., by using trial number as an additional predictor BIBREF24.Linguistic Context ::: Evaluation ProtocolWe test if the availability of document-level context affects human–machine parity claims in terms of adequacy and fluency. In a pairwise ranking experiment, we show raters (i) isolated sentences and (ii) entire documents, asking them to choose the better (with ties allowed) from two translation outputs: one produced by a professional translator, the other by a machine translation system. We do not show reference translations as one of the two options is itself a human translation.We use source sentences and documents from the WMT 2017 Chinese–English test set (see Section SECREF8): documents are full news articles, and sentences are randomly drawn from these news articles, regardless of their position. We only consider articles from the test set that are native Chinese (see Section SECREF35). In order to compare our results to those of BIBREF3, we use both their professional human (H_A) and machine translations (MT_1).Each rater evaluates both sentences and documents, but never the same text in both conditions so as to avoid repetition priming BIBREF26. The order of experimental items as well as the placement of choices (H_A, MT_1; left, right) are randomised.We use spam items for quality control BIBREF27: In a small fraction of items, we render one of the two options nonsensical by randomly shuffling the order of all translated words, except for 10 % at the beginning and end. If a rater marks a spam item as better than or equal to an actual translation, this is a strong indication that they did not read both options carefully.We recruit professional translators (see Section SECREF3) from proz.com, a well-known online market place for professional freelance translation, considering Chinese to English translators and native English revisers for the adequacy and fluency conditions, respectively. In each condition, four raters evaluate 50 documents (plus 5 spam items) and 104 sentences (plus 16 spam items). We use two non-overlapping sets of documents and two non-overlapping sets of sentences, and each is evaluated by two raters.Linguistic Context ::: DiscussionOur findings emphasise the importance of linguistic context in human evaluation of MT. In terms of adequacy, raters assessing documents as a whole show a significant preference for human translation, but when assessing single sentences in random order, they show no significant preference for human translation.Document-level evaluation exposes errors to raters which are hard or impossible to spot in a sentence-level evaluation, such as coherent translation of named entities. The example in Table TABREF23 shows the first two sentences of a Chinese news article as translated by a professional human translator (H_A) and BIBREF3's BIBREF3 NMT system (MT_1). When looking at both sentences (document-level evaluation), it can be seen that MT_1 uses two different translations to refer to a cultural festival, “2016盂兰文化节\\", whereas the human translation uses only one. When assessing the second sentence out of context (sentence-level evaluation), it is hard to penalise MT_1 for producing 2016 Python Cultural Festival, particularly for fluency raters without access to the corresponding source text. For further examples, see Section SECREF24 and Table TABREF34.Recommendations ::: (R1) Choose professional translators as raters.In our blind experiment (Section SECREF3), non-experts assess parity between human and machine translation where professional translators do not, indicating that the former neglect more subtle differences between different translation outputs.Recommendations ::: (R4) Do not heavily edit reference translations for fluency.In professional translation workflows, texts are typically revised with a focus on target language fluency after an initial translation step. As shown in our experiment in Section SECREF24, aggressive revision can make translations more fluent but less accurate, to the degree that they become indistinguishable from MT in terms of accuracy (Table TABREF30).Table 2: Pairwise ranking results for machine (MT1) against professional human translation (HA) as obtained from blind evaluation by professional translators. Preference for MT1 is lower when document-level context is available.Table 5: Classification of errors in machine translation MT1 and two professional human translation outputs HA and HB. Errors represent the number of sentences (out of N = 150) that contain at least one error of the respective type. We also report the number of sentences that contain at least one error of any category (Any), and the total number of error categories present in all sentences (Total). Statistical significance is assessed with Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) for each pair of translation outputs.Question: What empricial investigations do they reference?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"empirically test to what extent changes in the evaluation design affect the outcome of the human evaluation\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"Our paper investigates three aspects of human MT evaluation, with a special focus on assessing humanu2013machine parity: the choice of raters, the use of linguistic context, and the creation of reference translations.

The KL-divergence term can then be interpreted as regularizing boldsymbol{phi}, encouraging the approximate posterior to be close to the prior p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{z}).This yields a second version of the SGVB estimator widetilde{mathcal{L}}^{B}(boldsymbol{theta},boldsymbol{phi};mathbf{x}^{(i)})simeqmathcal{L}(boldsymbol{theta},boldsymbol{phi};mathbf{x}^{(i)}), corresponding to eq. (3), which typically has less variance than the generic estimator:displaystylewidetilde{mathcal{L}}^{B}(boldsymbol{theta},boldsymbol{phi};mathbf{x}^{(i)})=−DK⁢L(qϕ(𝐳|𝐱(i))||p𝜽(𝐳))+1L∑l=1L(logp𝜽(𝐱(i)|𝐳(i,l)))displaystyle=-D_{KL}(q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}^{(i)})||p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{z}))+frac{1}{L}sum_{l=1}^{L}(log p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{x}^{(i)}|mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}))= - italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z | bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | | italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_z ) ) + divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_L end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_italic_θ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT | bold_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_i , italic_l ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) )displaystyletext{where quad}mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}displaystyle=g_{boldsymbol{phi}}(boldsymbol{epsilon}^{(i,l)},mathbf{x}^{(i)})text{quad and quad}boldsymbol{epsilon}^{(l)}sim p(boldsymbol{epsilon})(7)Given multiple datapoints from a dataset mathbf{X} with N datapoints, we can construct an estimator of the marginal likelihood lower bound of the full dataset, based on minibatches:displaystylemathcal{L}(boldsymbol{theta},boldsymbol{phi};mathbf{X})simeqwidetilde{mathcal{L}}^{M}(boldsymbol{theta},boldsymbol{phi};mathbf{X}^{M})=frac{N}{M}sum_{i=1}^{M}widetilde{mathcal{L}}(boldsymbol{theta},boldsymbol{phi};mathbf{x}^{(i)})(8)where the minibatch mathbf{X}^{M}={mathbf{x}^{(i)}}_{i=1}^{M} is a randomly drawn sample of M datapoints from the full dataset mathbf{X} with N datapoints. In our experiments we found that the number of samples L per datapoint can be set to 1 as long as the minibatch size M was large enough, e.g. M=100. Derivatives nabla_{boldsymbol{theta},boldsymbol{phi}}widetilde{mathcal{L}}(boldsymbol{theta};mathbf{X}^{M}) can be taken, and the resulting gradients can be used in conjunction with stochastic optimization methods such as SGD or Adagrad [DHS10]. See algorithm 1 for a basic approach to compute the stochastic gradients. Let the prior over the latent variables be the centered isotropic multivariate Gaussian p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{z})=mathcal{N}(mathbf{z};mathbf{0},mathbf{I}). Note that in this case, the prior lacks parameters. We let p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{x}|mathbf{z}) be a multivariate Gaussian (in case of real-valued data) or Bernoulli (in case of binary data) whose distribution parameters are computed from mathbf{z} with a MLP (a fully-connected neural network with a single hidden layer, see appendix C). Note the true posterior p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}) is in this case intractable.While there is much freedom in the form q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}), we’ll assume the true (but intractable) posterior takes on a approximate Gaussian form with an approximately diagonal covariance. In this case, we can let the variational approximate posterior be a multivariate Gaussian with a diagonal covariance structure222Note that this is just a (simplifying) choice, and not a limitation of our method.:displaystylelog q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}^{(i)})displaystyle=logmathcal{N}(mathbf{z};boldsymbol{mu}^{(i)},boldsymbol{sigma}^{2(i)}mathbf{I})(9)where the mean and s.d. of the approximate posterior, boldsymbol{mu}^{(i)} and boldsymbol{sigma}^{(i)}, are outputs of the encoding MLP, i.e. nonlinear functions of datapoint mathbf{x}^{(i)} and the variational parameters boldsymbol{phi} (see appendix C). As explained in section 2.4, we sample from the posterior mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}sim q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}^{(i)}) using mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}=g_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{x}^{(i)},boldsymbol{epsilon}^{(l)})=boldsymbol{mu}^{(i)}+boldsymbol{sigma}^{(i)}odotboldsymbol{epsilon}^{(l)} where boldsymbol{epsilon}^{(l)}simmathcal{N}(mathbf{0},mathbf{I}). With odot we signify an element-wise product.In this model both p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{z}) (the prior) and q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}) are Gaussian; in this case, we can use the estimator of eq. (7) where the KL divergence can be computed and differentiated without estimation (see appendix B). The resulting estimator for this model and datapoint mathbf{x}^{(i)} is:displaystylemathcal{L}(boldsymbol{theta},boldsymbol{phi};mathbf{x}^{(i)})displaystylesimeqfrac{1}{2}sum_{j=1}^{J}left(1+log((sigma_{j}^{(i)})^{2})-(mu_{j}^{(i)})^{2}-(sigma_{j}^{(i)})^{2}right)+frac{1}{L}sum_{l=1}^{L}log p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{x}^{(i)}|mathbf{z}^{(i,l)})displaystyletext{wherequad}mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}displaystyle=boldsymbol{mu}^{(i)}+boldsymbol{sigma}^{(i)}odotboldsymbol{epsilon}^{(l)}text{quad and quad}boldsymbol{epsilon}^{(l)}simmathcal{N}(0,mathbf{I})(10)As explained above and in appendix C, the decoding term log p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{x}^{(i)}|mathbf{z}^{(i,l)}) is a Bernoulli or Gaussian MLP, depending on the type of data we are modelling. The strategy in this section can be used to derive a lower bound estimator (a stochastic objective function) for a variety of directed graphical models with continuous latent variables. We will restrict ourselves here to the common case where we have an i.i.d. dataset with latent variables per datapoint, and where we like to perform maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference on the (global) parameters, and variational inference on the latent variables. It is, for example, straightforward to extend this scenario to the case where we also perform variational inference on the global parameters; that algorithm is put in the appendix, but experiments with that case are left to future work. Note that our method can be applied to online, non-stationary settings, e.g. streaming data, but here we assume a fixed dataset for simplicity. Let us consider some dataset mathbf{X}={mathbf{x}^{(i)}}_{i=1}^{N} consisting of N i.i.d. samples of some continuous or discrete variable mathbf{x}. We assume that the data are generated by some random process, involving an unobserved continuous random variable mathbf{z}. The process consists of two steps: (1) a value mathbf{z}^{(i)} is generated from some prior distribution p_{boldsymbol{theta}^{*}}(mathbf{z}); (2) a value mathbf{x}^{(i)} is generated from some conditional distribution p_{boldsymbol{theta}^{*}}(mathbf{x}|mathbf{z}). We assume that the prior p_{boldsymbol{theta}^{*}}(mathbf{z}) and likelihood p_{boldsymbol{theta}^{*}}(mathbf{x}|mathbf{z}) come from parametric families of distributions p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{z}) and p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{x}|mathbf{z}), and that their PDFs are differentiable almost everywhere w.r.t. both boldsymbol{theta} and mathbf{z}. Unfortunately, a lot of this process is hidden from our view: the true parameters boldsymbol{theta}^{*} as well as the values of the latent variables mathbf{z}^{(i)} are unknown to us. We are interested in, and propose a solution to, three related problems in the above scenario:1.Efficient approximate ML or MAP estimation for the parameters boldsymbol{theta}. The parameters can be of interest themselves, e.g. if we are analyzing some natural process. They also allow us to mimic the hidden random process and generate artificial data that resembles the real data.2.Efficient approximate posterior inference of the latent variable mathbf{z} given an observed value mathbf{x} for a choice of parameters boldsymbol{theta}. This is useful for coding or data representation tasks.3.Efficient approximate marginal inference of the variable mathbf{x}. This allows us to perform all kinds of inference tasks where a prior over mathbf{x} is required. Common applications in computer vision include image denoising, inpainting and super-resolution. For the purpose of solving the above problems, let us introduce a recognition model q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}): an approximation to the intractable true posterior p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}). Note that in contrast with the approximate posterior in mean-field variational inference, it is not necessarily factorial and its parameters boldsymbol{phi} are not computed from some closed-form expectation. Instead, we’ll introduce a method for learning the recognition model parameters boldsymbol{phi} jointly with the generative model parameters boldsymbol{theta}. From a coding theory perspective, the unobserved variables mathbf{z} have an interpretation as a latent representation or code. In this paper we will therefore also refer to the recognition model q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}) as a probabilistic encoder, since given a datapoint mathbf{x} it produces a distribution (e.g. a Gaussian) over the possible values of the code mathbf{z} from which the datapoint mathbf{x} could have been generated. In a similar vein we will refer to p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{x}|mathbf{z}) as a probabilistic decoder, since given a code mathbf{z} it produces a distribution over the possible corresponding values of mathbf{x}. In this section we introduce a practical estimator of the lower bound and its derivatives w.r.t. the parameters. We assume an approximate posterior in the form q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}), but please note that the technique can be applied to the case q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}), i.e. where we do not condition on mathbf{x}, as well. The fully variational Bayesian method for inferring a posterior over the parameters is given in the appendix.Question: What are the uses of approximate posterior inference of the latent variable z given an observed value x for parameters θ?","answer":"For coding or data representation tasks, it is useful to approximate posterior inference of the latent variable mathbf{z} given an observed value mathbf{x} efficiently because the unobserved variables z have an interpretation as a latent representation or code.

Formed musical hallucinations (i.e. Perception of either vocal or instrumental melodies) reported in English literature to date have typically been associated with marked hearing loss, advanced age, female sex (71%), lack of response to treatment and associated psychopathology [1] but has been concluded that hearing loss is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the occurrence of musical hallucinations [1]. Tumor like Astrocytoma, Temporal lobe epilepsy, raised intra cranial tension, drug induced (tricyclics, Propronolol etc ;), meningitis and psychotic illness were shown to cause palinacousis and musical hallucinations [2,3].Musical hallucinations are pseudo hallucinations that originate in memory representations and they may undergo a transition to true hallucination. In musical hallucination spatial projection is less definite. Sometimes they are perceived like the tinnitus in patient's own head. The quality is usually very intense and distinct often very loud. They vary from elementary sounds to instrumental music, vocal music, bird songs, bells, pieces of melodies or sentences, religious music etc:- We report an unusual presentation of an elderly lady who had experienced musical hallucinations whilst being treated with Electro Convulsive Therapy.

Circ-Amotl1 is highly expressed in patient tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Single-cell inoculations using circ-Amotl1-transfected tumor cells showed a 30-fold increase in proliferative capacity relative to control.

CD28 is an important costimulatory molecule in the activation of human T cells. Costimulation of T cells through both the Ag receptor and CD28 leads to high level IL-2 production, which is vital to the development of an immune response in vivo. Previous reports have suggested the CD28 stimulation contributes to the activation of the IL-2 promoter by up-regulating the activity of several transcription factors, including AP-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) / Rel family members as well as an uncharacterized transcription factor called CD28 response complex. While several lines of investigation have suggested that NF-kappaB / Rel family members make up the CD28 response complex transcription factor, other work has not supported this conclusion. Recent studies suggest that the CD28 response element (CD28RE) does not function independently but works instead in conjunction with the adjacent promoter proximal AP-1-binding site and this hypothesis is confirmed here. Also in the current study, binding activity to the CD28RE / AP-1 sequence of the IL-2 promoter is evaluated. Although four specific complexes can be detected binding to this sequence, only one of these complexes is specific for both the CD28RE and the adjacent AP-1 site. Of the NF-kappaB / Rel family members tested, this CD28RE / AP-1-specific complex contains predominantly c-Rel, despite the fact that both p50 and RelA can efficiently bind to the CD28RE. c-Fos and c-Jun are also found in this CD28RE / AP-1-specific complex. These data indicate that functional complexes encompassing both the CD28RE and the AP-1-binding sites influence IL-2 promoter activity in CD28-costimulated T cells.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human T cells\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"CD28 response element\\", \\"CD28\\", \\"adjacent promoter proximal AP - 1 - binding site\\", \\"CD28RE\\", \\"IL - 2 promoter CD28 response element / AP - 1 sequence\\", \\"CD28RE / AP - 1 sequence\\", \\"IL - 2 promoter\\", \\"AP - 1 - binding site\\", \\"adjacent AP - 1 site\\", \\"AP - 1 - binding sites\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"nuclear factor - kappaB (NF - kappaB) / Rel family members\\", \\"uncharacterized transcription factor\\", \\"c - Rel\\", \\"costimulatory molecule\\", \\"p50\\", \\"CD28\\", \\"AP - 1\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"c - Fos\\", \\"the NF - kappaB / Rel family members\\", \\"nuclear factor - kappaB\\", \\"Rel\\", \\"c - Jun\\", \\"Rel , Fos , and Jun proteins\\", \\"transcription factors\\", \\"RelA\\", \\"CD28RE / AP - 1 - specific complex\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"NF - kappaB / Rel family members\\", \\"transcription factor\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

2 mg / kg body weight the molecule has got a significant sebosuppressive effect . at timesisotretinoin has proven curative for the severe forms of acne also though the disease can relapse later .salicylic acid ( sa ) has got potent sebostatic effect , which makes it useful in the treatment of acne .therapies combining isotretinoin and sa are usually not advocated in acne patients fearing excessive dryness and unpredictable penetration of the peeling agent .we conducted this study to compare the efficiency of oral isotretinoin and oral isotretinoin with 20% sa peel once every 2 weeks in acne vulgaris .the study was carried out in the department of skin and vd of a tertiary care hospital of eastern india between april 2012 and march 2013 .60 consecutive patients of either sex with moderate to severe acne were recruited for the study .michaelson acne severity index ( masi ) was used as a tool to calculate the severity of acne .patients below 18 years and above 25 years of age , patients with contraindications for isotretinoin use , pregnant patients and patients with keloidal tendency , patients with endocrine abnormalities and those with a very mild form of acne were excluded from the study .the ethical committee of ims and sum hospital , bhubaneswar approved the study and written consent was obtained from every patient .investigator 1 ( 1 author ) did the group allocation of the patients using a random number table .investigator 2 ( 2 author ) performed the chemical peeling on patients in the second group using 20% sa .the 3 investigator ( 3 author ) was blinded from the group allocation and treatment modalities .1 groups included patients receiving 20 mg isotretinoin as a monotherapy and 2 groups included patients receiving 20 mg isotretinoin once daily in combination with 20% sa peels ( vedasol - 20 gel , vedaderm inc . , chicago , supplied by percos ) at a 2 weekly interval .the 20 mg dose of isotretinoin for both groups was arrived taking into consideration the probable adverse effects of combined modalities of isotretinoin and sa .sa peeling was started on day 1 of starting oral isotretinoin keeping in view the slow onset of action of isotretinoin .all necessary lab investigations ( complete blood count , liver function test ( lft ) , renal function test , lipid profile , urine routine and microscopy ) were carried out at baseline and at the final follow - up time to look for any drug induced adverse effectspatients were reviewed every 2 weeks and were instructed about the possible side - effects and asked to report immediately if any occurred .response to therapy and side - effects were noted at each visit and patients were instructed to avoid sun exposure by using the adequate photo protective measures . they were also instructed to use emollients in case of excessive dryness .the consort-2010 flow chart showing the enrollment and group allocation of the patients is given in figure 1 .flowchart showing allocation of patients epidemiologic profile of both groups is given in table 1 .epidemiological profile of patients in group a and group b with tests of significance showing no statistically significant baseline values between both the groups baseline grading of acne was done using masi [ table 2 ] .michelson acne severity index number of comedones , papules , pustules , infiltrated lesions and cystic lesions were counted and multiplied with its severity index and added together to give the final score . however in our study , right side and left side of the face were scored separately and summed up for a total score for better correlation with photographic evaluation .a baseline 20% sa test patch in the retro auricular region was carried out for all the patients in group b , 2 weeks following which the patients were subjected to the 1 sitting of sa peel .each patient 's face was cleaned and degreased with spirit and acetone and the sensitive areas ( around nostrils and mouth ) were protected with petrolatum jelly .the peel was applied quickly with a brush , exerting moderate pressure during the application , beginning with the forehead working from the centre out followed by each side of the face , working from the cheek down .duration of contact was decreased with each sitting , starting with 20 min in the first sitting and 4 min in the last .the peel was removed from the face with a cotton swab dipped in water following which a lotion containing calamine and elovera was applied to the treated area to provide soothing , moisturising as well as the photo - protective effect .severity index was calculated every 2 weeks and photographs were taken at baseline and at the end of 16 weeks for comparison .60 patients of either sex between 18 and 25 years of age were included in this study .masi score at the end of 1 month showed a slight increase at 66.4  3.7 . at the end of 2 month ,photographs taken at baseline and at 16 weeks demonstrate the reduction in masi score [ figure 2 ] .intragroup analysis showed that the baseline profiles were comparable and the difference in masi scores at the end of treatment compared with the baseline is statistically significant . before and after photographs of patient in isotretinoin monotherapy group group b had 13 males and 17 females .all patients were started on 20 mg of oral isotretinoin along with a 2 weekly peel with 20% sa in gel form .photographs taken at baseline and at 16 weeks demonstrate the significant change in masi [ figure 3 ] .the atrophic scars with erythematosus base are usually less conspicuous in this group compared with group a. intragroup analysis showed statistically significant difference between baseline and 16 week masi scores . before and after photographs of patients in isotretinoin + salicylic acid peel group the monthly change in masi scores in both groups are given in table 3 and figure 4 .error bars depicting 2 standard deviation or 95% of confidence interval are given in figure 5 .the graphs clearly depict that there is a significant change in masi in both groups of patients and unpaired t - test between the two groups shows that the reduction in masi in group b is significantly higher compared with group a ( p < 0.05 ) .masi scoring ( meansd ) at baseline and at each follow - up visit monthly changes in michaelson acne severity index in both the groups error bars with 2 standard deviation at baseline and follow - up visits in both the groups no adverse side - effects other than drying of lips were observed during the study period .oral isotretinoin at a dose of 0.5 - 2.0 mg / kg / day reduces sebaceous gland activity within 6 weeks of starting therapy .isotretinoin induces a dose - dependent decrease in size and cross - sectional area of sebaceous glands ; dose - dependent reduction in sebum production ; sebocyte apoptosis and histological changes , such as lobular collapse , follicular atrophy and greater preponderance of undifferentiated acinar cells .augmented production of neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin in the skin by isotretinoin has been correlated with human sebocyte apoptosis within sebaceous glands , which leads to decreased production of sebum within the sebaceous glands and lobular collapse .oral isotretinoin exhibits antiinflammatory properties by reducing chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes . the sebum reduction and sebaceous glandits lipid solubility permits the interaction with multi lamellar structures surrounding the keratinocytes in the stratum corneum and hair follicle , thereby exhibiting follicular atrophy and comedolytic action within the sebaceous unit .sa peel has better efficacy and fewer side effects than glycolic acid peel in acne patients .usually , sa peels have a self - neutralising action , they crystalise within a short time on the skin surface once the dissolving spirit / ethanol volatilises exhibiting pseudofrosting , on the contrary the sa peel used our study ( vedasol - 20 , gel ) has gel as a driver and does not give a pseudofrost when used .the gel base makes penetration and absorption of sa possible for longer duration , hence the duration of contact determines the extent of penetration and observation which has been altered in our study starting from 20 min in the 1 sitting and decreasing by 2 min in each sitting .texted literature contraindicates the use of oral isotretinoin with sa peels due to overlapping mechanism of actions and the expected excessive dryness and irritation .however , being a superficial peel 20% sa may be combined with oral isotretinoin as there is no direct effect on collagen remodelling , which could adversely affect the outcome with keloid formation .the rationality of choosing this combination in our study is to obtain better outcome using a lower dose of both the treatment modalities along with marked reduction in post inflammatory hyperpigmentation .20% sa is a superficial peeling agent and hence has got little direct effect on collagen remodelling and scar modulation , but the sebotropic and anti - inflammatory effect of the agent lowers the severity of acne and thus makes the scar less conspicuous .the effect on post inflammatory hyperpigmentation due to exfoliation also contributes to a less obvious scar .the effect on acne scars was not a part of the study and hence was not analysed statistically though scars were less obvious in the group treated with both isotretinoin and sa peel .the increase in masi score in group a at the end of 1 month is because of use of isotretinoin alone in the group , which is known to flare up the disease process during the initial few weeks of therapy .the effect of isotretinoin monotherapy took upto 2 months to set in as a uniform dose of 20 mg was given to all irrespective of their weight . in group b , however there is a reduction in masi at the end of 1 month , which could be attributed to the additional sebosuppressive effect of sa .this means that in the initial days of treatment addition of sa could help to gain the confidence of patient because of the improvement in the disease severity .masi scores at the end of 2 month showed a significant difference between both groups .the decline in masi in group a at the end of 2 month is less and this could be due to the slower effect of isotretinoin therapy whereas addition of sa peels has accelerated the decline in masi score at the end of 2 month .therapy with isotretinoin was not discontinued after 16 weeks in both groups and continued until further clearance of lesions .however , sa peel was discontinued as per the protocol after 16 weeks and statistical analysis was done only upto 16 weeks as per the protocol .oral isotreatinoin as a monotherapy leads to significant acne clearance but oral isotreatinoin combined with 20% sa peels at a 2 weekly interval showed better results compared with isotretinoin monotherapy in our study . there were no incidences of any adverse effects apart from chapping of lips in both groups . since our sample size is small , further studies with a large sample size are required to establish these findings .isotretinoin along with sa peel has a significantly better outcome in moderate to severe acne than isotretinoin monotherapy .","answer":"background : acne is a self limiting condition that often results in scarring and disfigurement disproportionate to its clinical severity .  isotretinoin is considered the gold standard in the medical management of severe form of acne vulgaris .  salicyclic acid ( sa ) peels , a -

All children were first supported by nasal CPAP according to normal clinical routines. Surfactant was administered using a modified Aiolos nebulizer, and a total of 480 mg was aerosolized in each case. The control group received no nebulized material, but had the same CPAP support. Acid-base status and a/A PO2 were determined at regular intervals before, during and after surfactant administration. Both groups included in the study were similar with regard to gestational age, birthweight, steroids given before birth, sex and Apgar scores as well as a/A PO2 when entering the study. There were no significant differences between the groups in a/A PO2 1-12 h after randomization, number of infants needing mechanical ventilation, time on ventilator or CPAP. Two children in the treated group developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. No side effects of the surfactant therapy were noted. No beneficial effects of aerosolized surfactant were demonstrated in our trial, contrary to data from animal experiments. This finding probably reflects differences in administration techniques. Our findings do not justify large clinical trials with the same protocol. Further work is needed to optimize delivery of aerosolized surfactant to the neonatal lung in clinical practice.","answer":"There are insufficient data to support or refute the use of nebulised surfactant in clinical practice.

They direct the efforts of the research community and are used to define the state of the art models. In machine translation and summarization, the two most common metrics used for evaluating similarity between candidate and reference texts are BLEU BIBREF0 and ROUGE BIBREF1. Both approaches rely on counting the matching n-grams in the candidates summary to n-grams in the reference text. BLEU is precision focused while ROUGE is recall focused. These metrics have posed serious limitations and have already been criticized by the academic community.In this work we formulate three criticisms of BLEU and ROUGE, establish criteria that a sound metric should have and propose concrete ways to use recent advances in NLP to design data-driven metric addressing the weaknesses found in BLEU and ROUGE.Related Work ::: BLEU, ROUGE and n-gram matching approachesBLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) BIBREF0 and ROUGE BIBREF1 have been used to evaluate many NLP tasks for almost two decades. The general acceptance of these methods depend on many factors including their simplicity and the intuitive interpretability. Yet the main factor is the claim that they highly correlate with human judgement BIBREF0. This has been criticised extensively by the literature and the shortcomings of these methods have been widely studied. Reiter BIBREF2 , in his structured review of BLEU, finds a low correlation between BLEU and human judgment. Callison et al BIBREF3 examines BLEU in the context of machine translation and find that BLEU does neither correlate with human judgment on adequacy(whether the hypothesis sentence adequately captures the meaning of the reference sentence) nor fluency(the quality of language in a sentence). Sulem et al BIBREF4 examines BLEU in the context of text simplification on grammaticality, meaning preservation and simplicity and report BLEU has very low or in some cases negative correlation with human judgment. Considering these results it is a natural step to pursue new avenues for natural language evaluation and with the advent of deep learning using neural networks for this task is a promising step forward.Related Work ::: Transformers, BERT and GPTLanguage modeling has become an important NLP technique thanks to the ability to apply it to various NLP tasks as explained in Radford et al BIBREF5. There are two leading architectures for language modeling Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)BIBREF6 and Transformers BIBREF7 . RNNs handle the input tokens, words or characters, one by one through time to learn the relationship between them, whereas, transformers receive a segment of tokens and learn the dependencies between them using an attention mechanism.Related Work ::: Model-based metricsWhile BLEU and ROUGE are defined in a discrete space new evaluation metric can be defined in this continuous space. BERTscore BIBREF8 uses word embeddings and cosine similarity to create a score array and use greedy matching to maximize the similarity score. Sentence Mover’s Similarity BIBREF9 uses the mover similarity, Wasserstein distance, between sentence embedding generated from averaging the word embeddings in a sentence. Both of these methods report stronger correlations with human judgment and better results when compared to BLEU and ROUGE. While they are using word embeddings BIBREF10 to transfer their sentence in a continuous space they are still using distance metrics to evaluate that sentence. While BLEND BIBREF11 uses an SVM to combine different existing evaluation metrics. One other evaluation method proposed is RUSE BIBREF12 this method proposes embedding both sentences separately and pooling them to a given size. After that they use a pre trained MLP to predict on different tasks. This quality estimator metric is then proposed to be used in language evaluation. Our proposed methodology is to take neural language evaluation beyond architecture specifications. We are proposing a framework in which an evaluators success can be determined.Challenges with BLEU and ROUGEIn this part, we discuss three significant limitations of BLEU and ROUGE. These metrics can assign: High scores to semantically opposite translations/summaries, Low scores to semantically related translations/summaries and High scores to unintelligible translations/summaries.Challenges with BLEU and ROUGE ::: High score, opposite meaningsSuppose that we have a reference summary s1. By adding a few negation terms to s1, one can create a summary s2 which is semantically opposite to s1 but yet has a high BLEU/ROUGE score.Challenges with BLEU and ROUGE ::: Low score, similar meaningsIn addition not to be sensitive to negation, BLEU and ROUGE score can give low scores to sentences with equivalent meaning. If s2 is a paraphrase of s1, the meaning will be the same ;however, the overlap between words in s1 and s2 will not necessarily be significant.Challenges with BLEU and ROUGE ::: High score, unintelligible sentencesA third weakness of BLEU and ROUGE is that in their simplest implementations, they are insensitive to word permutation and can give very high scores to unintelligible sentences. Let s1 be \\"On a morning, I saw a man running in the street.\\" and s2 be “On morning a, I saw the running a man street”. s2 is not an intelligible sentence. The unigram version of ROUGE and BLEU will give these 2 sentences a score of 1.Challenges with BLEU and ROUGE ::: Experiments ::: Experiments with carefully crafted sentencesTo illustrate our argument, let's consider the following pairs of sentences:In Pair 1: s1 is \\"For the past two decades, the translation and summarization communities have used ROUGE and BLEU and these metrics have shown to be robust to criticism” s2 is \\"“For the past two decades, the translation and summarization communities have used ROUGE and BLEU and these metrics have shown not to be robust to criticism”. They differ by adding the negation in s2.In Pair 2: s1 is \\"On a morning, I saw a man running in the street.\\" and s2 is \\"In the early hours of the day, I observed one gentleman jogging along the road”. s2 is a paraphrase of s1.Challenges with BLEU and ROUGE ::: Experiments ::: Semantic similarity experimentsTo go beyond carefully crafted sentences. We assessed how well BLEU and ROUGE correlated with human judgement of similarity between pairs of paraphrased sentences and compared their performance to a RoBERTa model finetuned for semantic similarity (Table 2).Towards a robust data-driven approach ::: Metric ScorecardIn our methodology to design new evaluation metrics for comparing reference summaries/translations to hypothesis ones, we established first-principles criteria on what a good evaluator should do. The first one is that it should be highly correlated with human judgement of similarity. The second one is that it should be able to distinguish sentences which are in logical contradiction, logically unrelated or in logical agreement. The third one is that a robust evaluator should also be able to identify unintelligible sentences. The last criteria is that a good evaluation metric should not give high scores to semantically distant sentences and low scores to semantically related sentences.Towards a robust data-driven approach ::: Implementing metrics satisfying scorecard ::: Semantic SimilarityStarting from the RoBERTa large pre-trained model BIBREF13 , we finetune it to predict sentence similarity on the STS-B benchmark dataset. Given two sentences of text, s1 and s2, the systems need to compute how similar s1 and s2 are, returning a similarity score between 0 and 5. The dataset comprises naturally occurring pairs of sentences drawn from several domains and genres, annotated by crowdsourcing. The benchmark comprises 8628 sentence pairs with 5700 pairs in the training set, 1500 in the development set and 1379 in the test set.Towards a robust data-driven approach ::: Implementing metrics satisfying scorecard ::: Logical EquivalenceFor logical inference, we start with a pretrained RoBERTa BIBREF13 model and finetune it using the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (Williams et al., 2018). It is a crowdsourced collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment annotations. Given a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence, the task is to predict whether the premise entails the hypothesis, contradicts the hypothesis, or neither (neutral). The training set includes 393k sentence pairs, development set includes 20k and test set includes 20k. The accuracy of the pre-trained model on the development set is 0.9060.Towards a robust data-driven approach ::: Implementing metrics satisfying scorecard ::: Sentence IntelligibilityWe start with a pretrained roBERTa BIBREF13 model and finetune it using the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) . It consists of examples of expert English sentence acceptability judgments drawn from 22 books. Each example is a single string of English words annotated with whether it is grammatically possible sentence of English. The training set for CoLA has 10k sentences and the development set includes 1k sentences. The current model gets 67.8 percent accuracyTowards a robust data-driven approach ::: Implementing metrics satisfying scorecard ::: Rationale for Language ModelsThe overall rationale for using language models fine tuned for specific aspects of the scorecard is that recent work has shown that language models are unsupervised multitask learners BIBREF5 and can rediscover the classical NLP pipeline. By fine tuning them on a specific task, we make them pay attention to the correct level of abstraction corresponding to the scorecard.ConclusionIn this work, we have shown three main limitations of BLEU and ROUGE and proposed a path forward outlining why and how state of the art language models can be used as summary evaluators. Future work includes extending the proposed scorecard, updating the models matching best the scorecard criteria and assessing published summarization models using that scorecard.Question: What are the three limitations?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"High scores to semantically opposite translations/summaries, Low scores to semantically related translations/summaries and High scores to unintelligible translations/summaries.\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"In this part, we discuss three significant limitations of BLEU and ROUGE.

A region between-3134 and-2729 bp upstream from the transcription site of the human pro-interleukin 1beta (proIL-1beta) gene was identified as an LPS-responsive enhancer element. In this study, the influence of the sequences located between-3134 and-2987 on the transcriptional activity of the proIL-1beta gene in LPS-stimulated Raw 264. 7 cells was examined in detail. The results obtained by transient transfection of fos-CAT constructs that contained serial 5'-deletion mutations showed that the region between-3134 and-3059 appears to be required for the induction of transcription by LPS. Gel shift assay studies with synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to partial sequences of the latter region and nuclear extracts from stimulated cells revealed specific protein binding sites between-3110 and-3090 and between-3079 and-3059. These specific bindings were time and LPS dose dependent. The results of supershift analysis using specific antibodies against transcription factors suggested that both binding complexes contained the NF-kappaB components p50 and p65, and did not contain other NF-kappaB proteins (p52, c-Rel, Rel B), AP-1 proteins (c-Fos, C-Jun), CREB or C / EBPbeta (NF-IL6). Mutation of either of the putative NF-kappaB-binding sites in the enhancer element decreased the LPS-stimulated transcriptional activity. These data indicated that two NF-kappaB-binding sites, which are located between-3134 and-3059, are critical for the activation of proIL-1beta gene transcription.

In this model, nodes do not know the global topology of the network, and they may only initiate contact with a single neighbor in each round. This model contrasts with the much less restrictive LOCAL model, where a node may simultaneously communicate with all of its neighbors in a single round. A basic question in this setting is how many rounds of communication are required for the information dissemination problem, in which each node has some piece of information and is required to collect all others. In this paper, we give an algorithm that solves the information dissemination problem in at most @math rounds in a network of diameter @math , withno dependence on the conductance. This is at most an additive polylogarithmic factor from the trivial lower bound of @math , which applies even in the LOCAL model. In fact, we prove that something stronger is true: any algorithm that requires @math rounds in the LOCAL model can be simulated in @math rounds in the GOSSIP model. We thus prove that these two models of distributed computation are essentially equivalent.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Whru a dilt lhSC is replicated at, many sites2 maintaining mutual consistrnry among t,he sites iu the fac:e of updat,es is a signitirant problem.

It (i) combines diverse versions of pretrained word embeddings and (ii) extracts features of multigranular phrases with variable-size convolution filters. We also show that pretraining MVCNN is critical for good performance. MVCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four tasks: on small-scale binary, small-scale multi-class and largescale Twitter sentiment prediction and on subjectivity classification.Model EnhancementsThis part introduces two training tricks that enhance the performance of MVCNN in practice.Mutual-Learning of Embedding Versions. One observation in using multiple embedding versions is that they have different vocabulary coverage. An unknown word in an embedding version may be a known word in another version. Thus, there exists a proportion of words that can only be partially initialized by certain versions of word embeddings, which means these words lack the description from other versions.To alleviate this problem, we design a mutual-learning regime to predict representations of unknown words for each embedding version by learning projections between versions. As a result, all embedding versions have the same vocabulary. This processing ensures that more words in each embedding version receive a good representation, and is expected to give most words occurring in a classification dataset more comprehensive initialization (as opposed to just being randomly initialized).Let c be the number of embedding versions in consideration, V_1, V_2, ldots , V_i, ldots , V_c their vocabularies, V^*=cup ^c_{i=1} V_i their union, and V_i^-=V^*backslash V_i ( i=1, ldots , c ) the vocabulary of unknown words for embedding version i . Our goal is to learn embeddings for the words in V_i^- by knowledge from the other c-1 embedding versions.We use the overlapping vocabulary between V_i and V_j , denoted as V_{ij} , as training set, formalizing a projection f_{ij} from space V_i to space V_j ( ine j; i,jin lbrace 1,2,ldots ,crbrace  ) as follows: mathbf {hat{w}}_j=mathbf {M}_{ij}mathbf {w}_i   (Eq. 6) where mathbf {M}_{ij}in mathbb {R}^{dtimes d} , mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d denotes the representation of word w in space V_i and mathbf {hat{w}}_j is the projected (or learned) representation of word w in space V_j . Squared error between mathbf {w}_j and mathbf {hat{w}}_j is the training loss to minimize. We use hat{mathbf {}{w}_j=f_{ij}(mathbf {w}_i) to reformatEquation ref {equ:proj}.Totally c(c-1)/2 projections f_{ij} are trained, each on thevocabulary intersection V_{ij}.}Let  w mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d0 Vi mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d1 V1, V2, ..., Vk mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d2 w mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d3 Vi mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d4 k mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d5 f1i(w1) mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d6 f2i(w2) mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d7 ... mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d8 fki(wk) mathbf {w}_iin mathbb {R}^d9 V1, V2, ..., Vk w0 Vi w1 f1i(w1) w2 f2i(w2) w3 ... w4 fki(wk) w5 w w6 Vi w7 w w8 Vi w9 As discussed in Section \\"Model Description\\" , we found that for the binary sentiment classification dataset, many words were unknown in at least one embedding version. But of these words, a total of 5022 words did have coverage in another embedding version and so will benefit from mutual-learning. In the experiments, we will show that this is a very effective method to learn representations for unknown words that increases system performance if learned representations are used for initialization.Pretraining. Sentence classification systems are usually implemented as supervised training regimes where training loss is between true label distribution and predicted label distribution. In this work, we use pretraining on the unlabeled data of each task and show that it can increase the performance of classification systems.Figure 1 shows our pretraining setup. The “sentence representation” – the output of “Fully connected” hidden layer – is used to predict the component words (“on” in the figure) in the sentence (instead of predicting the sentence label Y/N as in supervised learning). Concretely, the sentence representation is averaged with representations of some surrounding words (“the”, “cat”, “sat”, “the”, “mat”, “,” in the figure) to predict the middle word (“on”).Given sentence representation mathbf {s}in mathbb {R}^d and initialized representations of 2t context words ( t left words and t right words): mathbf {w}_{i-t} , ldots  , mathbf {w}_{i-1} , mathbf {w}_{i+1} , ldots  , mathbf {w}_{i+t} ; 2t0 , we average the total 2t1 vectors element-wise, depicted as “Average” operation in Figure 1 . Then, this resulting vector is treated as a predicted representation of the middle word and is used to find the true middle word by means of noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) BIBREF18 . For each true example, 10 noise words are sampled.Note that in pretraining, there are three places where each word needs initialization. (i) Each word in the sentence is initialized in the “Multichannel input” layer to the whole network. (ii) Each context word is initialized as input to the average layer (“Average” in the figure). (iii) Each target word is initialized as the output of the “NCE” layer (“on” in the figure). In this work, we use multichannel initialization for case (i) and random initialization for cases (ii) and (iii). Only fine-tuned multichannel representations (case (i)) are kept for subsequent supervised training.The rationale for this pretraining is similar to auto-encoder: for an object composed of smaller-granular elements, the representations of the whole object and its components can learn each other. The CNN architecture learns sentence features layer by layer, then those features are justified by all constituent words.During pretraining, all the model parameters, including mutichannel input, convolution parameters and fully connected layer, will be updated until they are mature to extract the sentence features. Subsequently, the same sets of parameters will be fine-tuned for supervised classification tasks.In sum, this pretraining is designed to produce good initial values for both model parameters and word embeddings. It is especially helpful for pretraining the embeddings of unknown words.Datasets and Experimental SetupStandard Sentiment Treebank BIBREF21 . This small-scale dataset includes two tasks predicting the sentiment of movie reviews. The output variable is binary in one experiment and can have five possible outcomes in the other: {negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive}. In the binary case, we use the given split of 6920 training, 872 development and 1821 test sentences. Likewise, in the fine-grained case, we use the standard 8544/1101/2210 split. socher2013recursive used the Stanford Parser BIBREF22 to parse each sentence into subphrases. The subphrases were then labeled by human annotators in the same way as the sentences were labeled. Labeled phrases that occur as subparts of the training sentences are treated as independent training instances as in BIBREF23 , BIBREF4 .Sentiment140 BIBREF24 . This is a large-scale dataset of tweets about sentiment classification, where a tweet is automatically labeled as positive or negative depending on the emoticon that occurs in it. The training set consists of 1.6 million tweets with emoticon-based labels and the test set of about 400 hand-annotated tweets. We preprocess the tweets minimally as follows. 1) The equivalence class symbol “url” (resp. “username”) replaces all URLs (resp. all words that start with the @ symbol, e.g., @thomasss). 2) A sequence of k>2 repetitions of a letter c (e.g., “cooooooool”) is replaced by two occurrences of c (e.g., “cool”). 3) All tokens are lowercased.Subj. Subjectivity classification dataset released by BIBREF25 has 5000 subjective sentences and 5000 objective sentences. We report the result of 10-fold cross validation as baseline systems did.In this work, we use five embedding versions, as shown in Table 1 , to initialize words. Four of them are directly downloaded from the Internet. (i) HLBL. Hierarchical log-bilinear model presented by mnih2009scalable and released by turian2010word; size: 246,122 word embeddings; training corpus: RCV1 corpus, one year of Reuters English newswire from August 1996 to August 1997. (ii) Huang. huang2012improving incorporated global context to deal with challenges raised by words with multiple meanings; size: 100,232 word embeddings; training corpus: April 2010 snapshot of Wikipedia. (iii) GloVe. Size: 1,193,514 word embeddings; training corpus: a Twitter corpus of 2B tweets with 27B tokens. (iv) SENNA. Size: 130,000 word embeddings; training corpus: Wikipedia. Note that we use their 50-dimensional embeddings. (v) Word2Vec. It has no 50-dimensional embeddings available online. We use released code to train skip-gram on English Gigaword Corpus BIBREF26 with setup: window size 5, negative sampling, sampling rate 10^{-3} , threads 12. It is worth emphasizing that above embeddings sets are derived on different corpora with different algorithms. This is the very property that we want to make use of to promote the system performance.Table 2 shows the number of unknown words in each task when using corresponding embedding version to initialize (rows “HLBL”, “Huang”, “Glove”, “SENNA”, “W2V”) and the number of words fully initialized by five embedding versions (“Full hit” row), the number of words partially initialized (“Partial hit” row) and the number of words that cannot be initialized by any of the embedding versions (“No hit” row).About 30% of words in each task have partially initialized embeddings and our mutual-learning is able to initialize the missing embeddings through projections. Pretraining is expected to learn good representations for all words, but pretraining is especially important for words without initialization (“no hit”); a particularly clear example for this is the Senti140 task: 236,484 of 387,877 words or 61% are in the “no hit” category.Table 3 compares results on test of MVCNN and its variants with other baselines in the four sentence classification tasks. Row 34, “MVCNN (overall)”, shows performance of the best configuration of MVCNN, optimized on dev. This version uses five versions of word embeddings, four filter sizes (3, 5, 7, 9), both mutual-learning and pretraining, three convolution layers for Senti140 task and two convolution layers for the other tasks. Overall, our system gets the best results, beating all baselines.The table contains five blocks from top to bottom. Each block investigates one specific configurational aspect of the system. All results in the five blocks are with respect to row 34, “MVCNN (overall)”; e.g., row 19 shows what happens when HLBL is removed from row 34, row 28 shows what happens when mutual learning is removed from row 34 etc.The block “baselines” (1–18) lists some systems representative of previous work on the corresponding datasets, including the state-of-the-art systems (marked as italic). The block “versions” (19–23) shows the results of our system when one of the embedding versions was not used during training. We want to explore to what extend different embedding versions contribute to performance. The block “filters” (24–27) gives the results when individual filter width is discarded. It also tells us how much a filter with specific size influences. The block “tricks” (28–29) shows the system performance when no mutual-learning or no pretraining is used. The block “layers” (30–33) demonstrates how the system performs when it has different numbers of convolution layers.From the “layers” block, we can see that our system performs best with two layers of convolution in Standard Sentiment Treebank and Subjectivity Classification tasks (row 31), but with three layers of convolution in Sentiment140 (row 32). This is probably due to Sentiment140 being a much larger dataset; in such a case deeper neural networks are beneficial.The block “tricks” demonstrates the effect of mutual-learning and pretraining. Apparently, pretraining has a bigger impact on performance than mutual-learning. We speculate that it is because pretraining can influence more words and all learned word embeddings are tuned on the dataset after pretraining.The block “filters” indicates the contribution of each filter size. The system benefits from filters of each size. Sizes 5 and 7 are most important for high performance, especially 7 (rows 25 and 26).In the block “versions”, we see that each embedding version is crucial for good performance: performance drops in every single case. Though it is not easy to compare fairly different embedding versions in NLP tasks, especially when those embeddings were trained on different corpora of different sizes using different algorithms, our results are potentially instructive for researchers making decision on which embeddings to use for their own tasks.ConclusionThis work presented MVCNN, a novel CNN architecture for sentence classification. It combines multichannel initialization – diverse versions of pretrained word embeddings are used – and variable-size filters – features of multigranular phrases are extracted with variable-size convolution filters. We demonstrated that multichannel initialization and variable-size filters enhance system performance on sentiment classification and subjectivity classification tasks.Question: How is MVCNN compared to CNN?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"MVCNN, a novel CNN architecture for sentence classification.

Herein, we communicate Rh-catalyzed olen functionalizations, including hydroacylation and carboacylation from a common aldehyde. This initial report focuses on hydroacylation of bis(allyl)aldehydes to generate a-vinylcyclopentanones 2 bearing quaternary stereocenters. 7 Mechanistic studies reveal a cascade process featuring an enantioselective olen-isomerization followed by olenhydroacylation.</p><p>The use of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur-based functional groups has allowed breakthroughs in enantioselective Rh-catalyzed hydroacylation. 8 These heteroatoms act as directing groups by binding to rhodium and favoring C-H bond activation while accelerating hydroacylation over competitive pathways, such as decarbonylation or catalyst decomposition. 9 Fu demonstrated intramolecular hydroacylation of alkynals bearing b-methoxy groups (Fig. 2a). 10 Our laboratory reported intermolecular hydroacylation of cyclopropenes using chelating aldehydes, specically salicylaldehyde derivatives (Fig. 2b). 5 Given their ability to bind Rh, we reasoned that olens could be used as directing groups for hydroacylation. 11 We were encouraged that Tanaka and Suemune reported desymmetrization of b-bis(alkenyl) aldehydes (Fig. 2c). 12 Although not proposed, we reason that the pendant olen in their substrate could be acting as a directing group. These previous desymmetrizations by hydroacylation generate ketones bearing b-quaternary stereocenters. Given this limitation, we chose to develop a complementary desymmetrization of a-trisubstituted aldehydes, which represents a sterically hindered and thus, challenging substrate class. 13b-c,14 If successful, our strategy would allow access to cyclopentanones bearing a-quaternary centers, whereby the pendant olen serves as both a directing group and versatile handle for further elaboration.</p>Results and discussion<p>To test our proposal, we studied the desymmetrization of model 1a, which can be prepared in one-step from commercially available phenylacetaldehyde. 15 Aldehyde 1a was subjected to cationic Rh(I)-catalysts and various bidentate phosphine ligands that are known to promote formyl C-H bond activation. 16 We imagined that oxidative addition followed by alkene insertion would generate metallacycle 5, which could diverge into various scaffolds (Table 1). The choice of phosphine ligand had a dramatic impact on product outcome and enabled chemoselective formation of two major products, cyclopentanone 2a and bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanone 3a. With a BINAP-ligated rhodium catalyst, we observed formation of both 2a and 3a in 61% and 19% yields, respectively (entry 1). We discovered that the hydroacylation product, cyclopentanone 2a, bears an internal olen, which presumably results from isomerization of the terminal olen. Carbometallation of the pendant olen from 5 results in intermediate 7, which undergoes reductive elimination to form bicycloheptanone 3a as a minor product. Use of BzDPPB ligand, however, favors the carboacylation pathway to generate 3a as the major product in 56% yield with high diastereoselectivity (>20 : 1, entry 2). This unique olen functionalization takes advantage of C-H activation rather than strained C-C activation to achieve carboacylation. 17 While our study was in progress, Aïssa reported a related carbocyclization using pyridyl directing groups. 18 We also observed bicyclo[3.2.1]octadione 4a as a minor product in 10% yield (entry 2). The molecular structure of this homologated ketone 4a was conrmed by X-ray crystallography (see ESI †). We believe that the second carbonyl arises from a disproportionation process where a second equivalent of aldehyde 1a undergoes decarbonylation to generate CO.</p><p>With these promising leads in hand, we plan to further study each pathway and develop enantioselective variants. Towards this goal, we realized that electron-donating aromatic groups on phosphines enhance selectivity for 2a. Among the ligands evaluated, (R)-DTBM-MeOBIPHEP provided the best reactivity  and enantioselectivity for 2a (entry 3). The absolute conguration of cyclopentanone 2a was determined by elaboration with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to hydrazone 9, in which the molecular structure was established by X-ray crystallographic analysis (Fig. 3). With this protocol, we prepared eleven cyclopentanones bearing various a-quaternary stereocenters (Table 2). Aldehydes with aromatic substituents (1a-1g) undergo desymmetrization in 83-91% yields and high enantioselectivities (95-99% ee). Ether, aryl halide, and acetal functional groups are well-tolerated. Heteroaromatic aldehyde (1h) as well as aldehydes bearing aliphatic substituents (1i-1k) rearrange to the corresponding cyclopentanones in excellent enantioselectivities albeit using increased catalyst loading at lower temperature. 19,20 To understand the mechanism, we performed a deuteriumlabelling study with d-1a. Desymmetrization of d-1a, under standard reaction conditions, led to exclusive formation of d-2a where the deuterium label was incorporated into the methyl group of the a-propenyl substituent (eqn ( 1)). This result indicates that isomerization of one allyl group takes place rst through an endocyclic b-hydride elimination of a 5-membered rhodacycle d-5a. 21 Our observations corroborate Aïssa's recent report on the isomerisation of 4-pentenals. 22 Although bhydride eliminations of this type are uncommon, it has been predicted that binding of a pendant alkene to the metal center signicantly lowers the barrier to this process. 23 When the reaction of d-1a was quenched at an early stage (40% conversion to d-2a), we recovered three deuterated aldehydes, d-1a, d-1a 0 and d-1a 00 (eqn ( 2)). The observation of d-1a 0 suggests that olen-insertion is reversible. Yet, the deuterium is incorporated into only the methyl group of the a-propenyl unit in product d-2a. This lack of deuterium scrambling on the cyclopentanone ring suggests that Rh-D insertion occurs with high enantioselectivity (with the olen shown in red). Thus, the insertion step is both reversible and highly enantioselective. 24 Further experiments support the notion that the a-vinyl group (formed from initial isomerization) directs hydroacylation. For example, a-trisubstituted aldehyde 10 (with only one allyl group) does not undergo hydroacylation. Instead, this aldehyde undergoes isomerization to generate a-vinyl aldehyde 11 (eqn (3)). 22 In addition, subjecting a-allylcyclopentanone 12a to the optimized reaction conditions results in trace formation of a-vinylcyclopentanone 2a (eqn (4)). Thus, the cyclopentanones obtained in Table 2 must arise from an isomerization that occurs prior to hydroacylation. In contrast, we discovered that aldehyde 1l, containing an acetal group, yields a-allylcyclopentanone 12l as the major product (eqn ( 5)). In this case, we reason that the acetal acts as an oxygendirecting group which promotes hydroacylation over olen isomerization.  On the basis of literature reports and our own observations, we propose a mechanism starting with cationic Rh(I)-complex activating the aldehyde C-H bond of 1 to form acyl-Rh(III)hydride 13 (Scheme 1). Insertion of the olen into Rh(III)hydride 13 leads to formation of the more thermodynamically stable 5-membered metallacycle 5. 25 A rare endocyclic b-hydride elimination takes place to produce isomerized acyl-Rh(III)hydride 14. The allyl olen inserts into the Rh(III)-hydride to form a 6-membered rhodacycle 6. Finally, reductive elimination affords the cyclopentanone product 2 and regenerates the Rh(I)catalyst.</p>Conclusions<p>We have demonstrated a Rh-catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of a-quaternary cyclopentanones. Studies on the scope and mechanism support an olen-assisted isomerization 23 and olen-directed hydroacylation cascade. While endocyclic b-hydride elimination has been proposed in the literature on the basis of theoretical studies, 21 our results provide experimental evidence for this elementary step. The use of a BIPHEP ligand enables high selectivity for one out of three possible rearrangements, all initiated by the activation of an aldehyde C-H bond. Insights from these studies will guide efforts to understand and expand the power of the related carboacylation and bisacylation as routes to scaffolds containing chiral allcarbon stereocenters.</p>","answer":"We describe a Rh-catalyzed desymmetrization of all-carbon quaternary centers from a,a-bis(allyl) aldehydes by a cascade featuring isomerization and hydroacylation.

A BIPHEP ligand promotes enantioselective formation of avinylcyclopentanones.

It provides a git-based source code management platform and also many features inspired by social networks. For example, GitHub users can show appreciation to projects by adding stars to them. Therefore, the number of stars of a repository is a direct measure of its popularity. In this paper, we use multiple linear regressions to predict the number of stars of GitHub repositories. These predictions are useful both to repository owners and clients, who usually want to know how their projects are performing in a competitive open source development market. In a large-scale analysis, we show that the proposed models start to provide accurate predictions after being trained with the number of stars received in the last six months. Furthermore, specific models---generated using data from repositories that share the same growth trends---are recommended for repositories with slow growth and or for repositories with less stars. Finally, we evaluate the ability to predict not the number of stars of a repository but its rank among the GitHub repositories. We found a very strong correlation between predicted and real rankings (Spearman's rho greater than 0.95).Cited Abstract(s):[1]: App developers would like to understand the impact of their own and their competitors’ software releases. To address this we introduce Causal Impact Release Analysis for app stores, and our tool, CIRA, that implements this analysis. We mined 38,858 popular Google Play apps, over a period of 12 months. For these apps, we identified 26,339 releases for which there was adequate prior and posterior time series data to facilitate causal impact analysis. We found that 33 of these releases caused a statistically significant change in user ratings. We use our approach to reveal important characteristics that distinguish causal significance in Google Play. To explore the actionability of causal impact analysis, we elicited the opinions of app developers: 56 companies responded, 78 concurred with the causal assessment, of which 33 claimed that their company would consider changing its app release strategy as a result of our findings.[2]: Abstract In this paper, we propose a defect prediction approach centered on more robust evidences towards causality between source code metrics (as predictors) and the occurrence of defects. More specifically, we rely on the Granger causality test to evaluate whether past variations in source code metrics values can be used to forecast changes in time series of defects. Our approach triggers alarms when changes made to the source code of a target system have a high chance of producing defects. We evaluated our approach in several life stages of four Java-based systems. We reached an average precision greater than 50 in three out of the four systems we evaluated. Moreover, by comparing our approach with baselines that are not based on causality tests, it achieved a better precision.","answer":"[1] record time-series information about popular Google Play apps and investigate how release frequency can affect an app's performance, as measured by rating, popularity and number of user reviews.

In this study, we characterize alterations in spine density and the expression of synapse-associated immediate early gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) in the hippocampal CA1 regions of two different amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse lines before plaque development and their connection to performance in hippocampus-dependent memory tests. The density of mushroom-type spines was reduced by 34% in the basal dendrites proximal to the soma of CA1 pyramidal neurons in 5.5-month-old Tg2576 mice, carrying the Swedish mutation, compared with wild-type littermates. A similar reduction of 42% was confirmed in the same region of 8-month-old APP/Lo mice, carrying the London mutation.The London APP mutation (Val717Ile) associated with early shifting abilities and behavioral changes in two Italian families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.We describe 2 Italian families showing the missense mutation in exon 17 of the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (Val717Ile), known as London mutation.In 1 family, this mutation was responsible for AD in 3 out of 7 siblings and it is also present in a fourth sibling who has only shown signs of executive dysfunction so far. Two subjects of the other family with AD diagnosis were carriers of the same mutation.A pathological hallmark in the brain of an AD patient is extracellular amyloid plaques formed by accumulated beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), a metabolic product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Studies have revealed a strong genetic linkage in the early-onset familial form (<60 years old) of AD. For example, some mutant APPs are transmitted dominantly and are segregated with inheritance of early onset AD. These mutants facilitate Abeta production. The \\"Swedish\\" mutations (APP(SW)) and the \\"London\\" mutation (APP(LON)) are examples of these mutants.The sequences that are effective to silence APP(SW) and APP(LON) as identified in this study may be useful in both in vivo and in vitro studies to investigate the pathophysiological role of APP(SW) and APP(LON) in AD development.Here, we show ASP-RNAi against the Swedish- and London-type amyloid precursor protein (APP) variants related to familial Alzheimer's disease using two reporter alleles encoding the Photinus and Renilla luciferase genes and carrying mutant and wild-type allelic sequences in their 3'-untranslated regions.Transgenic mice over-expressing a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP, 695 isoform) bearing a mutation associated with Alzheimer's disease (V642I, so-called London mutation, hereafter APPLd2) and wild-type controls were studied at age periods (3 and 10 months) prior to the overt development of neuritic amyloid plaques.The \\"Swedish\\" mutations (APP(SW)) and the \\"London\\" mutation (APP(LON)) are examples of these mutants.Allele-specific silencing of Alzheimer's disease genes: the amyloid precursor protein genes with Swedish or London mutations.Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene were the first to be recognized as a cause of Alzheimers disease (AD).We describe 2 Italian families showing the missense mutation in exon 17 of the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (Val717Ile), known as London mutation.In 1 family, this mutation was responsible for AD in 3 out of 7 siblings and it is also present in a fourth sibling who has only shown signs of executive dysfunction so farThe London APP mutation (Val717Ile) associated with early shifting abilities and behavioral changes in two Italian families with early-onset Alzheimers diseaseWe analyzed the cytotoxic mechanisms of the London-type AbetaPP mutant, V642I-AbetaPP, in primary cortical neurons utilizing an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer system.We demonstrate that the APP-London and PS1 mutations have additive effects on the increased secretion of betaA4(1-42) relative to betaA4(1-40), indicating that both mutations operate independently.Pathogenic mutations in APP at codon 717 (APP \\"London\\") lead to an increased proportion of Abeta 1-42 being produced and secreted.The \\"Swedish\\" mutations (APP(SW)) and the \\"London\\" mutation (APP(LON)) are examples of these mutants.Allele-specific silencing of Alzheimer's disease genes: the amyloid precursor protein genes with Swedish or London mutations.We describe 2 Italian families showing the missense mutation in exon 17 of the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (Val717Ile), known as London mutation.The London APP mutation (Val717Ile) associated with early shifting abilities and behavioral changes in two Italian families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.Such cleavage is promoted by the Swedish and London mutations (APPSwe/Lon) inside the APP gene.We also show that the Swedish and London mutations reduce the amount of APP in the lysosome.This rapid transit to the lysosome is blocked by the presence of either the London or Swedish mutations.","answer":"Alzheimer's Disease, or AD"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

This evolved circuit is another instance in which a genetically evolved solution to a non-trivial problem is competitive with human performance. 2.

[21][22][23][24] The layered double perovskite structure comprises one layer of [M(II)X6] 4octahedra inserted in between two layers of [M(III)X6] 3octahedra. As a representative, Cs4CuSb2Cl12 has been successfully synthesized both in the form of single-crystalline powder 22 and NCs, 23,25 exhibiting a narrow direct bandgap (1.0-1.8 eV) and impressive stability, which however still suffers from the high toxicity of Sb element and the absence of emission at room temperature. To overcome these drawbacks, Cs4CuIn2Cl12, with toxic Sb 3+ substituted by relatively non-toxic In 3+ , could be a promising candidate to fulfill the requirement of compositional engineering and optical tunability particularly in the UV range. Yet, to date, the synthesis of Cs4CuIn2Cl12 layered double perovskites has not yet been reported for neither bulk film nor NCs.</p><p>Herein, we report the first-ever colloidal synthesis of lead-free Cs4CuIn2Cl12 layered double perovskite NCs using a modified hot-injection method. 20,25 The synthetic details are described in the Supporting Information (SI). While a standard hot-injection reaction in moisture-free environment resulted in Cs4CuIn2Cl12 with a very low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 0.12%, we found that the handling of synthesis precursors in the presence of moisture (RH~40%) enhances PLQY by more than one order of magnitude up to 1.56 %. Water-assisted insitu synthesis has been recognized as an effective strategy to tune the optical properties and stability for both lead-based 26,27 and lead-free halide perovskite NCs 28,29 via the controlling of NCs size, shape, and crystallinity. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of deep understanding of how water influences NCs growth regime and corresponding PL property, especially for lead-free double perovskite NCs. The introduction of moisture in the precursor (namely \\"wet\\" precursor conditions) of Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs (w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12) induces the morphological transformation from 3D nanocubes (NCus) to 2D nanoplatelets (NPLs), driven by the ionized H3O + and OHfrom the water content as additional capping ligands. The ultrafast transient absorption studies suggest a strengthened self-trapped exciton (STE) effect for w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs compared to the NCs synthesized in \\"dry\\" conditions (d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs), resulting in the conversion of dark transitions into radiative transitions, which directly contributes to the PLQY.</p><p>The absorption and PL spectra of as-synthesized d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 and w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NC suspensions are presented in Figures 1a and b, with direct bandgap energies of 3.82 eV and 3.56 eV, respectively, as determined by Tauc analysis (Figure 1a, inset). The absorption spectrum of d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs peaks at 269 nm, and their weak emission maximum is at 374 nm. Upon the involvement of moisture in the reaction, the absorption spectrum of w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs exhibits a slight red-shift but with a long absorption tail in the visible range, which contributes to the visualization of a violet color in suspension compared to the whitish color observed for d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs (Figure 1b, inset). The corresponding PL spectrum of w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs experiences a significant amplitude enhancement mainly in the near-UV range (320-400 nm) by showing an absolute PLQY of 1.56 %, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that (0.12 %) of d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs. A relatively broad (FWHM =73 nm) and slightly asymmetric PL spectral shape, with a long emission tail towards 500 nm, is detected in the case of w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12</p><p>NCs. The enhanced PL intensity of w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs could be attributed to the STEs originating from the water-induced Jahn-Teller distortion of the [M(II)Cl6] (i.e. [CuCl6]) octahedra in the excited state, as it has also been observed for other types of lead-free perovskites, such as Cs2AgInCl6 30 and Rb2InCl5. 28 In addition, the PL excitation (PLE) spectrum (Figure 1b) of w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs, monitored at the emission peak (381 nm), presents a different profile from their corresponding absorption spectrum, further suggesting that the emission may stem from different defect states and/or surface-related states, such as STEs, due to the coordination of water molecules. 28 The optical properties of as-synthesized Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs are summarized in Table 1. First exciton peak; b) Emission peak; c) Full width at half maximum; d) Bandgap.</p><p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs formed in the presence or absence of moisture in the reaction show a negligible deviation from the simulated pattern of bulk Cs4CuIn2Cl12 in a pure phase without considering any impurities (Figure 1c left), determining a monoclinic crystal structure with a space group of C2 / m. The set of characteristic peaks positioned at 23.6°, 24.5°, and 34.0° were assigned to (311), (020), and (222) planes, corresponding to the Cs4CuIn2Cl12 layered double perovskite crystal phase with distorted [CuCl6] octahedra, which has also been observed for Cs4CuSb2Cl12 NCs. 25 Based on our simulation results (Table S1), the lattice</p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements demonstrate that the d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12<p>NCs have a cube-like shape (Figure 2a) with an average diameter of 17.1±1.6 nm (Figure 2b).</p><p>High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 2c) highlights that d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs possess a well-defined crystalline structure with a lattice d-spacing of 0.376 nm, which is assigned to the (311) crystal plane, highly consistent with the crystalline direction determined from the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 2d). These, together with the previous XRD data (Figure 1c), further verified a monoclinic crystal structure. Interestingly, the NCs synthesized with the moisture in the precursor consist of a mixture of NCus and NPLs (Figure 2e). The nanocubes (w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12) show an average diameter (17.8±1.9 nm) like that of d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCus, while a large average lateral size of 27.1±3.6 nm is separately presented for the w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12</p><p>NPLs in Figure 2f. From the HRTEM image of NPLs (Figure 2g), the measured lattice d-spacing of 0.372 nm, also corresponding to (311) crystal facets (Figure 2h), was slightly lower than that (0.376 nm) of d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCus, which is consistent with the shift in the peak positions of XRD data towards larger Bragg angles (Figure 1c). Some ultra-large lateral size (up to ~50 nm) of NPLs and stacking of NPLs with an estimated thickness of ~2 nm for one NPL were observed (Figure 2i), further confirming the formation of 2D NPLs induced by water molecules. It is known that H2O molecules can be partly ionized into H3O + and OHwith the assistance of OAand OAm + , 31 which could act as additional capping ligands to activate the NC surface. We, thus, propose an NC growth scheme (Scheme 1) for better understanding the water-induced morphological transformation from 3D NCus to 2D NPLs for Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs. Upon the injection of TMS-Cl into the metal carboxylate precursors, there is a dynamic equilibrium between the attachment and detachment of capping ligands (i.e. OA and OAm) to influence the monomer attachment on the surface of the initially formed cluster. 32 With a standard concentration of ligands (no moisture involved), there are many detachments of ligands from the cluster surface, and then with free ions (e.g. Cs + and Cl -) more monomer attachments occur to further form nanocubes.</p><p>When the water molecules are involved in the precursor, the ionized H3O + and OHact as additional capping ligands, thus binding to the cluster surface and effectively blocking potential sites for monomer attachment, resulting in very few ligand detachments. Consequently, the NCs grow in 2D direction to form nanoplatelets. This moisture-assisted shape change has been previously observed for CsPbBr3 NCs. 26 Scheme 1. Possible formation process of Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs synthesized with and without moisture in the precursor.</p><p>To thoroughly investigate the photophysical properties of Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) measurements were conducted for as-synthesized Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs. Figure 3a and b show the TA spectra of d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 and w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs, respectively, excited at 320 nm. A broad positive photo-induced absorption (PIA) was observed in the probe range of 410-650 nm for both samples, providing direct evidence of STEs. 28 The ultrafast PIA signal growth (<1 ps) indicates a transition from free excitons to STEs trapping. 33 The TA spectra of w-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs display a clear red-shift, particularly after 2 ps, compared to those of d-Cs4CuIn2Cl12 NCs, revealing an enhanced STE effect upon the involvement of water molecules during the NC growth.

However, the mechanism through which this repression is achieved in vegetative tissues is poorly understood. Here we report a microRNA( miRNA) –mediated repression mechanism operating in leaves. To understand the repression of the embryonic program in seedlings, we have conducted a genetic screen using a seed maturation gene reporter transgenic line in Arabidopsis( Arabidopsis thaliana) for the isolation of mutants that ectopically express seed maturation genes in leaves. One of the mutants identified from the screen is a weak allele of ARGONAUTE1( AGO1) that encodes an effector protein for small RNAs. We first show that it is the defect in the accumulation of miRNAs rather than other small RNAs that causes the ectopic seed gene expression in ago1. We then demonstrate that overexpression of miR166 suppresses the derepression of the seed gene reporter in ago1 and that, conversely, the specific loss of miR166 causes ectopic expression of seed maturation genes. Further, we show that ectopic expression of miR166 targets, type III homeodomain-leucine zipper( HD-ZIPIII) genes PHABULOSA( PHB) and PHAVOLUTA( PHV), is sufficient to activate seed maturation genes in vegetative tissues. Lastly, we show that PHB binds the promoter of LEAFY COTYLEDON2( LEC2), which encodes a master regulator of seed maturation. Therefore, this study establishes a core module composed of a miRNA, its target genes( PHB and PHV), and the direct target of PHB( LEC2) as an underlying mechanism that keeps the seed maturation program off during vegetative development.Introduction:Seed maturation is a highly coordinated developmental phase in which storage reserves, including seed storage proteins( SSPs), are synthesized and accumulated to high levels. The maturation genes need to be repressed, however, in order to allow seedling development to occur. Indeed, these genes are not expressed in vegetative organs of the plant[1]. Research in the past decade with the model plant Arabidopsis has led to the identification of repressors of seed maturation genes in vegetative organs( reviewed in[2]), including chromatin-remodelling ATPases[3]–[5], polycomb group( PcG) proteins[6]–[9], histone deacetylases[10], and DNA-binding transcription factors[11]–[13]. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that repress the seed maturation program during vegetative development remains fragmented, and thus continued efforts are needed to identify additional factors involved and, more importantly, the molecular and functional links between the various components. In Arabidopsis, ABA-INSENSITIVE3( ABI3), FUSCA3( FUS3), LEC1 and LEC2 are master regulators of seed maturation[14]–[17], and they regulate one another[18],[19]. ABI3, FUS3 and LEC2 are closely-related members of a plant-specific B3-domain transcription factor family. LEC1 encodes a novel homolog of the CCAAT-binding factor HAP3 subunit. Loss-of-function mutations in ABI3, FUS3, and LEC1 give rise to pleiotropic seed phenotypes including a strong reduction of SSPs. These regulatory genes are predominantly expressed in the seed. When misexpressed in vegetative tissues, they induce ectopic expression of the SSP genes and even the formation of somatic embryos[15],[17],[20]–[22]. It remains poorly understood, however, how the expression and activity of these master regulators are in turn regulated. Small RNAs of 20–30 nucleotides( nt) have emerged as key sequence-specific regulators of gene expression that influence almost all aspects of plant biology( reviewed in[23]–[26]). There are two major types of small RNAs in plants, microRNA( miRNA) and small interfering RNA( siRNA). Plant miRNAs are generated from longer precursors arising from defined genomic loci – the MIRNA genes. The biogenesis of miRNAs involves several evolutionarily conserved families of proteins, including DICER-LIKE( DCL), ARGONAUTE( AGO), HUA ENHANCER 1( HEN1), and HASTY( HST). Plant miRNAs regulate target mRNAs temporally and spatially through transcript cleavage and/or translational inhibition. Conserved miRNAs tend to target transcription factor genes that play crucial roles in almost all aspects of plant development. Plants are rich in endogenous siRNAs, which can be classified into several types, such as trans-acting siRNAs( ta-siRNAs), natural cis-antisense transcripts-associated siRNAs, and heterochromatic siRNAs. Here, we show that mutations in AGO1 resulted in the ectopic expression of seed maturation genes in seedlings. Taking advantage of the weak ago1 allele identified in this work, we were able to identify the miRNA species( miR166) responsible for the repression of seed genes. We demonstrated that targets of miR166, the class III homeodomain leucine zipper( HD-ZIPIII) family of transcription factor genes, PHB and PHV, are positive regulators of seed genes. Further, we provided evidence to suggest that PHB acts directly at LEC2. This work thus uncovered an important role of miR166 in the repression of seed genes during seedling development.Discussion:In this work, we first identified a weak EMS ago1 allele, which exhibited ectopic expression of a GUS reporter driven by a seed gene promoter. Taking advantage of the weak ago1 allele and its GUS phenotype, we then performed a series of transgenic and genetic analyses to search for the molecular mechanisms underlying the mutant phenotype. We first demonstrated that miR166 reduction is a major cause of the mutant phenotype and further showed that the targets of miR166, PHB and PHV, are sufficient for derepressing seed maturation genes in seedlings. Finally, our ChIP assay using a tagged PHB transgenic line suggests that PHB may act directly at the LEC2 promoter( summarized in Figure 8). However, in addition to LEC2, PHB may also regulate other factors that in turn regulate seed maturation genes directly or indirectly. Future studies, such as ChIP-seq, are needed to address this issue. Therefore, this work has added miR165/166 to the documented repertoire of postgermination repressors of the embryonic program( reviewed in[2]), and more importantly, established PHB, and possibly PHV, as direct positive regulators of the master regulator of seed maturation LEC2. A major future challenge in the field is to find out the genetic and molecular relationships amongst the various players, including transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and modifiers, and the newly added miRNA, and build an integrated genetic network. Given the well-established expression patterns and roles of miR166 and its targets in leaf polarity determination( reviewed in[50],[51]), an obvious outstanding question is why the normal expression of the PHB and PHV genes in the adaxial domain of leaf primordia in wild type plants is not sufficient to cause the ectopic expression of seed maturation genes. miR165/166 is concentrated in the abaxial domain to restrict the expression of the HD-ZIPIII transcription factor genes to the adaxial domain in the lateral organs in Arabidopsis[42]–[44] and maize[45]. In phb and phv gain-of-function mutants, the expression of PHB and PHV is not restricted to the adaxial domain but extends into the entire primordium. We observed ectopic expression of seed maturation genes only in these gain-of-function mutants, indicating that the normal, adaxial expression of the HD-ZIP III genes is not sufficient to activate the seed maturation program. There could be at least two underlying reasons. First, the ectopic expression of the seed maturation genes in the phb and phv gain-of-function mutants only occurs in the abaxial domain. In this scenario, the lack of necessary co-factors or the presence of negative factors in the adaxial domain may prevent the HD-ZIPIII genes from activating the seed maturation genes. Alternatively, it might be a matter of thresholds – the adaxial domain normally does not have sufficient levels of HD-ZIPIII expression to trigger the seed maturation program, but when the miRNA is compromised, the expression level is high enough to trigger the program. Our preliminary observation is in support of the first scenario. GUS expression along the adaxial-abaxial axis in essp5/ago1-100 was examined and GUS activity was found only on the abaxial side( Figure S6). In addition, interestingly, GUS was also observed in both the upper and lower epidermal cells( Figure S6). The seed maturation program is a tightly regulated developmental process. Mechanisms are in place to not only ensure its repression during seedling development but also prevent its precocious induction during early embryogenesis[2],[52]. The induction of seed maturation is also referred to as the morphogenesis-to-maturation phase transition of embryogenesis. While our studies have established miR165/166 and implicated miR156 as players in the repression of the seed maturation program in vegetative development, two recent studies have also revealed important roles of miRNAs in regulating the morphogenesis-to-maturation phase transition[53],[54]. Of these, the work of Nodine and Bartel[53] demonstrated that miR156 and two of its target genes SPL10 and SPL11 play a major role in early embryo patterning and in preventing the precocious expression of maturation genes. An obvious question is whether miR165/166 also acts similarly in early embryogenesis to control the morphogenesis-to-maturation phase transition. Previous studies have shown that PHB and PHV promote embryonic development, and that the expression of these genes must be repressed by miR165/166 for embryonic development to proceed normally. For example, Grigg et al showed that serrate( se) mutants cause ectopic expression of PHB and PHV in the root pole of embryos, and that the embryonic lethal phenotype of se mutants can be rescued by loss-of-function mutations in PHB and PHV[55]. Smith and Long also showed that PHB and PHV promote shoot development during embryogenesis[56]. These studies focused on the roles of the miR165/166-PHB/PHV module in early embryo patterning. Our finding that this module plays an important role in repressing seed maturation genes during seedling development prompted us to test its role in the morphogenesis-to-maturation phase transition. We performed a ChIP analysis using a transgenic line expressing a tagged PHB driven by its endogenous promoter( PHB:PHB-YFP). Preliminary data suggests that PHB acts directly at LEC2 during embryogenesis( Figure S7). Future investigations are needed to sort out the contributions of each miRNA to the repression of the seed maturation program during the pre- and post-maturation stages.","answer":"Seed development can be conceptually divided into two phases: namely the morphogenesis phase , in which cell division is active and all the major organs are formed , and the maturation phase , in which cells enlarge and storage reserves are synthesized and accumulated .

Their high reactivity is mainly due to the resonance energy gained by formation of a benzene ring in the cycloaddition product (Scheme 1) [6].</p><p>Diels–Alder reaction of isobenzofuran and formation of a benzene ring in the cycloadduct.</p>Introduction<p>Isobenzofurans have been extensively used as 4 electron (diene) components in Diels–Alder reactions, and moreover in other cycloaddition reactions such as [4 + 3], [4 + 4], [8 + 8] and [4 + 6] additions [7–10]. Highly strained alkenes and alkynes have been trapped with isobenzofurans. 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran is the preferred trapping reagent for singlet oxygen and is used to quantify the generation of 1O2 in photodynamic therapy [4,11]. The most important synthetic application is probably the preparation of annulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by cycloaddition to arynes [8,12]. However, the high reactivity of isobenzofurans comes at the cost of low stability [13]. 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran is reasonably stable and commercially available and therefore the most frequently used isobenzofuran derivative. The parent system isobenzofuran (IBF, 1) is about 10 times more reactive but generally described as a reagent that is difficult to prepare and to purify [1]. Therefore, it should be generated in situ, and used without isolation.</p>Results and Discussion<p>We now present a reliable and convenient synthesis providing high yields of isobenzofuran. In contrast to previous reports, the compound is stable for more than 8 months in pure form as a solid at −15 °C. The half-life of IBF (1) in solution (150 mM, 27 °C, toluene-d8) is about 12 h. A half-life of 2 h in CDCl3 has been previously reported [14]. Isobenzofurans are light sensitive. Warrener et al. reported on [8 + 8] cycloaddition products upon irradiation. Depending on the solvent further dimers are formed [14].</p><p>Several procedures have been published for the synthesis of IBF (1). The key step in the majority of the reported methods is a retro Diels–Alder reaction [6,13,15–17]. Fieser and Haddadin [17] describe IBF as a transient intermediate and Warrener and Wege [13,15] isolated IBF at −80 °C on a cold finger. The disadvantages of these methods are high reaction temperatures during vacuum pyrolysis and multistep syntheses of the precursors.</p><p>The alternative way to synthesize IBF (1) is 1,4-elimination of 1,3-dihydro-1-methoxyisobenzofuran (7, DMIBF), which provides access to IBF (1) at ambient temperature [18]. Three methods have been published to prepare 7 (DMIBF). Reduction of phthalic acid (2) or phthalic acid ester 3 to 1,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzene (4) [19], acid promoted ring closure, and subsequent oxidation with hypochlorite in the presence of methanol gives 7 in a moderate yield of 65% [18].</p><p>Alternatively, phthalide 5 has been reduced to 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-1-ol (6) and methylated to DMIBF (7) [8]. However, yields in our hands are quite low.</p><p>It is known that benzyl ethers are prone to oxidative functionalization [20]. 2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) has been used to selectively oxidize benzyl ethers to acetals in the presence of alcohols [21]. Following a procedure of Doyle et al. we reacted commercially available phthalan (8) with DDQ and methanol in dry dichloromethane under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature, and obtained DMIBF (7) with a yield of 85% (Scheme 2) [22]. DMIBF (7) was treated with freshly prepared lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in benzene and IBF (1) was obtained as a solution in benzene which was washed with aqueous NH4Cl to remove lithium salts and amines (Scheme 2) [8,18].</p><p>Different approaches for the synthesis of IBF (1).</p>Results and Discussion<p>To determine the yield of IBF (1), this solution was reacted with acetylenedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (DMAD, 9) and product 10 was obtained with a yield of 78% relative to the precursor DMIBF (7, Scheme 3).</p><p>Reaction of in situ prepared IBF (1) with DMAD (9).</p>Results and Discussion<p>To further purify isobenzofuran (1), the benzene solution was carefully evaporated and the residue was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (cyclohexane/ethyl acetate). We were able to isolate IBF (1) as a colorless solid (mp 20 °C) with a yield of 66%. The solid compound can be stored for up to 8 months at −15 °C without decomposition (polymerization).</p>Conclusion<p>Isobenzofuran (1) is one of the most reactive dienes in Diels–Alder reactions and other cycloadditions. For practical applications it has been generated and reacted in situ, because it rapidly dimerizes or polymerizes in solvents of medium polarity such as chloroform (t1/2 = 2 h). We observed longer half-lives in low polarity solvents (t1/2 = 12 h in toluene-d8, 150 mM, 27 °C). We have been able to purify the compound by chromatography and to isolate it as a colorless solid (mp 20 °C). In crystalline form, it is stable for 8 months at −15 °C without decomposition. Upon oxidative methoxylation of commercially available phthalane (85% yield) [22], and subsequent 1,4-elimination with LDA [18] we obtained isobenzofuran (1) in 78% yield (trapping reaction) or in 66% isolated yield after chromatography.</p>Experimental<p>NMR spectra were measured in deuterated solvents (Deutero).

Systematic proteomic studying of the mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis remains challenging. We performed comparative proteomic and pathway analysis of four human metastatic HCC cell lines to identify metastasis-associated proteins. These HCC cell lines had a similar genetic background but with an increasing potential of metastasis. Using a combination of two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, a total of 125 proteins and their post-translational modification forms or isoforms were found to be differentially expressed in the cell lines. Among them, 29 were gradually up-regulated whereas 17 were down-regulated with increasing metastatic potential. Instead of a traditional single-gene readout, global bioinformatics analysis was carried out, which revealed that the glycolysis pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway. The heat shock proteins (HSPs) centered and NF-kappaB centered networks were also enriched in the result, which may imply the key function of inflaming on metastasis. Meanwhile, knockdown of HDGF, an up-regulated protein and a target of NF-kappaB, induced cell apoptosis in the metastatic HCC cells. This work provides a demonstration that a combination of bioinformatics and comparative proteomics can help in finding out potential biomarkers associated with HCC metastasis on the level of pathways.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"HCC cell lines\\", \\"metastatic HCC cells\\", \\"cell\\", \\"hepatocellular carcinoma\\", \\"cell lines\\", \\"HCC\\", \\"metastatic HCC cell lines\\", \\"hepotacellular carcinoma cells\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: These, in turn, enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNγ), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) .  These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases. Additionally, in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP), viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2015; Dunican and Fahy, 2015) . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) . Viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation; worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating COPD, CRSsNP and even CRSwNP in certain cases (Wang et al., 2009; Tacon et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . An epithelial-centric alarmin pathway around IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and their interaction with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) has also recently been identified (Nagarkar et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2018; Allinne et al., 2019) . IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP are type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier (Gabryelska et al., 2019; Roan et al., 2019) . ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated (Scanlon and McKenzie, 2012; Li and Hendriks, 2013) . In the event of viral infection, cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier will also induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, with heighten expression in an inflamed airway (Allakhverdi et al., 2007; Goldsmith et al., 2012; Byers et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2013; Beale et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2014; Uller and Persson, 2018; Ravanetti et al., 2019) . These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation (Camelo et al., 2017) . In the case of COPD, increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation (Silver et al., 2016) . Interestingly, these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 . As integration of the virology, microbiology and immunology of viral infection becomes more interlinked, additional factors and FIGURE 1 | Current understanding of viral induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Upon virus infection in the airway, antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway. Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org mechanisms have been implicated in acute exacerbations during and after viral infection (Murray et al., 2006) . Murray et al. (2006) has underlined the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents in causing more severe acute exacerbations in the airway. This is especially true when not all exacerbation events occurred during the viral infection but may also occur well after viral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Stolz et al., 2019) in particular the late onset of a bacterial infection (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a . In addition, viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation, as the nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections. Moreover, not all viral infections of the airway will lead to acute exacerbations, suggesting a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the \\"united airway\\" hypothesis (Kurai et al., 2013) . On the other hand, viral infections or their components persist in patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Hence, their presence may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. Future studies should be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance (Hammond et al., 2015; McKendry et al., 2016; Akbarshahi et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells (Becker, 2006; McKendry et al., 2016) . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium (Contoli et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2019; Wark, 2019) . Due to the viral components remaining in the airway, antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation (Wood et al., 2011; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018) . These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) . With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection. On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway (Guibas et al., 2018) . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections (Vasileiou et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation. Another mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Sajjan et al., 2008; Kast et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018) .Question: What  does the epithelial proteins cause?","answer":"enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNγ), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) ."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The MIR Flickr collection consists of 25000 high-quality photographic images of thousands of Flickr users, made available under the Creative Commons license. The database includes all the original user tags and EXIF metadata. Additionally, detailed and accurate annotations are provided for topics corresponding to the most prominent visual concepts in the user tag data. The rich metadata allow for a wide variety of image retrieval benchmarking scenarios. In this paper, we provide an overview of the various strategies that were devised for automatic visual concept detection using the MIR Flickr collection. In particular we discuss results from various experiments in combining social data and low-level content-based descriptors to improve the accuracy of visual concept classifiers. Additionally, we present retrieval results obtained by relevance feedback methods, demonstrating (i) how their performance can be enhanced using features based on visual concept classifiers, and (ii) how their performance, based on small samples, can be measured relative to their large sample classifier counterparts. Additionally, we identify a number of promising trends and ideas in visual concept detection. To keep the MIR Flickr collection up-to-date on these developments, we have formulated two new initiatives to extend the original image collection. First, the collection will be extended to one million Creative Commons Flickr images. Second, a number of state-of-the-art content-based descriptors will be made available for the entire collection. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  In this paper, we propose a new tag-based image retrieval framework to improve the retrieval performance of a group of related personal images captured by the same user within a short period of an event by leveraging millions of training web images and their associated rich textual descriptions. For any given query tag (e.g., “car”), the inverted file method is employed to automatically determine the relevant training web images that are associated with the query tag and the irrelevant training web images that are not associated with the query tag. Using these relevant and irrelevant web images as positive and negative training data respectively, we propose a new classification method called support vector machine (SVM) with augmented features (AFSVM) to learn an adapted classifier by leveraging the prelearned SVM classifiers of popular tags that are associated with a large number of relevant training web images. Treating the decision values of one group of test photos from AFSVM classifiers as the initial relevance scores, in the subsequent group-based refinement process, we propose to use the Laplacian regularized least squares method to further refine the relevance scores of test photos by utilizing the visual similarity of the images within the group. Based on the refined relevance scores, our proposed framework can be readily applied to tag-based image retrieval for a group of raw consumer photos without any textual descriptions or a group of Flickr photos with noisy tags. Moreover, we propose a new method to better calculate the relevance scores for Flickr photos. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Large-scale user contributed images with tags are easily available on photo sharing websites. However, the noisy or incomplete correspondence between the images and tags prohibits them from being leveraged for precise image retrieval and effective management. To tackle the problem of tag refinement, we propose a method of Ranking based Multi-correlation Tensor Factorization (RMTF), to jointly model the ternary relations among user, image, and tag, and further to precisely reconstruct the user-aware image-tag associations as a result. Since the user interest or background can be explored to eliminate the ambiguity of image tags, the proposed RMTF is believed to be superior to the traditional solutions, which only focus on the binary image-tag relations. During the model estimation, we employ a ranking based optimization scheme to interpret the tagging data, in which the pair-wise qualitative difference between positive and negative examples is used, instead of the point-wise 0/1 confidence. Specifically, the positive examples are directly decided by the observed user-image-tag interrelations, while the negative ones are collected with respect to the most semantically and contextually irrelevant tags. Extensive experiments on a benchmark Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for tag refinement. We also show attractive performances on two potential applications as the by-products of the ternary relation analysis. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Due to the popularity of social media websites, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to tag-based social image search. Both visual information and tags have been investigated in the research field. However, most existing methods use tags and visual characteristics either separately or sequentially in order to estimate the relevance of images. In this paper, we propose an approach that simultaneously utilizes both visual and textual information to estimate the relevance of user tagged images. The relevance estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. In this method, a social image hypergraph is constructed, where vertices represent images and hyperedges represent visual or textual terms. Learning is achieved with use of a set of pseudo-positive images, where the weights of hyperedges are updated throughout the learning process. In this way, the impact of different tags and visual words can be automatically modulated. Comparative results of the experiments conducted on a dataset including 370+images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  It is now generally recognized that user-provided image tags are incomplete and noisy. In this study, we focus on the problem of tag completion that aims to simultaneously enrich the missing tags and remove noisy tags. The novel component of the proposed framework is a noisy matrix recovery algorithm. It assumes that the observed tags are independently sampled from an unknown tag matrix and our goal is to recover the tag matrix based on the sampled tags. We show theoretically that the proposed noisy tag matrix recovery algorithm is able to simultaneously recover the missing tags and de-emphasize the noisy tags even with a limited number of observations. In addition, a graph Laplacian based component is introduced to combine the noisy matrix recovery component with visual features. Our empirical study with multiple benchmark datasets for image tagging shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency when handling missing and noisy tags.Literature Review:","answer":"In spite of the expanding literature, there is a lack of consensus on the performance of the individual methods. This is largely due to the fact that existing works either use homemade data, see BIB001 BIB003 BIB005 ], which are not publicly accessible, or use selected subsets of benchmark data, e.g. as in BIB004 BIB006 . As a consequence, the performance scores reported in the literature are not comparable across the papers. Benchmark data with manually verified labels is crucial for an objective evaluation. As Flickr has been well recognized as a profound manifestation of social image tagging, Flickr images act as a main source for benchmark construction. MIRFlickr from the Leiden University BIB002 and NUS-WIDE from the National University of Singapore ] are the two most popular Flickr-based benchmark sets for social image tagging and retrieval, as demonstrated by the number of citations. On the use of the benchmarks, one typically follows a single-set protocol, that is, learning the underlying tag relevance function from the training part of a chosen benchmark set, and evaluating it on the test part. Such a protocol is inadequate given the dynamic nature of social media, which could easily make an existing benchmark set outdated. For any method targeting at social images, a cross-set evaluation is necessary to test its generalization ability, which is however overlooked in the literature. Another desirable property is the capability to learn from the increasing amounts of socially tagged images. Since existing works mostly use training data of a fixed scale, this property has not been well evaluated. Following these considerations, we present a new experimental protocol, wherein training and test data from distinct research groups are chosen for evaluating a number of representative works in the cross-set scenario. Training sets with their size ranging from 10k to one million images are constructed to evaluate methods of varied complexity. To the best of our knowledge, such a comparison between many methods on varied scale datasets with a common experimental setup has not been conducted before. For the sake of experimental reproducibility, all data and code are available online 1 ."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

This is the first study to investigate specific factors affecting a patient's perceived ability to kneel post TKA, following exposure to a preoperative kneeling education session. A cross-sectional study was conducted following TKA with patients who had been educated about kneeling prior to the operation. Patients completed kneeling questionnaires at 6 (n = 115) and 12 (n = 82) months post TKA. In addition to the 12-month kneeling questionnaire, patients also completed the Oxford knee score (OKS) survey. Seventy-two percent of patients perceived they could kneel at 12 months post TKA. Overall, pain and discomfort were the most common factors deterring patients from kneeling. Perceived kneeling ability was the poorest scored outcome on the OKS with patients reporting mild to moderate difficulty with this task. Kneeling scores were strongly correlated with overall knee function scores (R = 0.70), strongly correlated with pain scores (R = 0.45) and weakly correlated with knee stability scores (R = 0.29). When asked about other factors preventing kneeling other than pain or discomfor t, 75 % had reasons unrelated to the knee or TKA. The most common reason was 'problems with the other knee ' (n = 19). Patients in this study were provided with education regarding their kneeling ability post TKA, yet still experienced limitations in perceived kneeling ability post operatively. Contrary to previous research, our study suggests that factors other than patient education affect a patient's perceived kneeling ability post TKA.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"knee\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"Perceived\\", \\"Kneeling\\", \\"kneeling\\", \\"kneel\\", \\"perceived\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"OKS\\", \\"Oxford knee score\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"pain\\", \\"discomfort\\", \\"poorest scoring functional outcomes\\", \\"pain scores\\", \\"unrelated\\", \\"knee function scores\\", \\"Difficulties in kneeling\\", \\"discomfor\\", \\"difficulty\\", \\"knee stability scores\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"TKA\\", \\"operation\\", \\"affect\\", \\"total knee arthroplasty\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"questionnaires\\", \\"questionnaire\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"cross-sectional study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever with serositis or synovitis. The FMF gene (MEFV) was cloned recently, and four missense mutations were identified. Here we present data from non-Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab patients in whom we had not originally found mutations and from a new, more ethnically diverse panel. Among 90 symptomatic mutation-positive individuals, 11 mutations accounted for 79% of carrier chromosomes. Of the two mutations that are novel, one alters the same residue (680) as a previously known mutation, and the other (P369S) is located in exon 3. Consistent with another recent report, the E148Q mutation was observed in patients of several ethnicities and on multiple microsatellite haplotypes, but haplotype data indicate an ancestral relationships between non-Jewish Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FMF and other affected populations. Among approximately 200 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples, the MEFV carrier frequency was 21%, with E148Q the most common mutation. Several lines of evidence indicate reduced penetrance among Ashkenazi Jews, especially for E148Q, P369S, and K695R. Nevertheless, E148Q helps account for recessive inheritance in an Ashkenazi family previously reported as an unusual case of dominantly inherited FMF. The presence of three frequent MEFV mutations in multiple Mediterranean populations strongly suggests a heterozygote advantage in this geographic region.","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"recessive disorder\\", \\"familial Mediterranean fever\\", \\"serositis\\", \\"Familial Mediterranean fever\\", \\"FMF\\", \\"synovitis\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Half of them were treated by soft X-ray radiation, the other half underwent mock-radiation as a control. 54% of the original group could be examined after 6 years. The results showed that the ratio of cure was similar in the both groups. The skin pattern of the incompletely cured haemangiomata was also comparable. The biological rule of regression of haemangiomata in early childhood seems not to be influenced by X-ray treatment. It is striking that X-ray treatment in dark-skinned children leads to a better therapy-result than in fair-skinned ones.Title 2:Randomised controlled study of early pulsed dye laser treatment of uncomplicated childhood haemangiomas: results of a 1-year analysis.Abstract 2:The role of pulsed dye lasers (PDL) in the treatment of childhood haemangiomas is controversial. Our aim was to compare treatment with PDL with a wait-and-see policy.                We did a prospective, randomised controlled trial in which we enrolled 121 infants aged 1-14 weeks with early haemangiomas. We assigned infants to PDL treatment (n=60) or observation (n=61), and followed them up to age 1 year. The main outcome measures assessed were proportion of lesions completely clear or with minimum residual signs, adverse reactions, including pigmentary disturbance and skin atrophy, complications such as ulceration and infection, proportion of children whose parents considered the haemangioma a problem, characteristics of the haemangioma, and an independent assessment of the haemangioma problem by a panel of five parents. Analysis was by intention to treat.                All infants completed the study. The number of children whose lesions showed complete clearance or minimum residual signs at 1 year was not significantly different in the PDL treated and observation groups (25, 42%, vs 27, 44%; p=0.92). However, PDL treated infants were more likely to have skin atrophy (17, 28%, vs 5, 8%; p=0.008) and hypopigmentation (27, 45%, vs 9, 15%; p=0.001). The frequency of complications was similar between groups. The only objective measure of resolution that improved with PDL treatment was haemangioma redness. The number of children whose parents considered the haemangioma to be a problem at 1 year did not differ much between groups (11 of 60, 18%, vs 9 of 61, 15%; p=0.78). The independent parent panel validated this result.                PDL treatment in uncomplicated haemangiomas is no better than a wait-and-see policy.Title 3:Oral versus high-dose pulse corticosteroids for problematic infantile hemangiomas: a randomized, controlled trial.Abstract 3:Oral systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for problematic hemangiomas; however, current information is based on anecdotal experience and retrospective studies. We aimed to determine whether systemic steroids are efficacious in proliferating hemangioma and to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 corticosteroid treatment modalities.                Twenty patients with problematic hemangiomas of infancy were randomly assigned to either daily oral prednisolone or monthly intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone. Their clinical outcomes (improvement using a visual analog score) and adverse events were compared at 3 months from baseline and 1 year of age. Data on possible surrogate markers of angiogenesis were available for the first 3 months.                At 3 months, orally treated patients had a median visual analog score of 70 compared with 12 in the intravenous group. This response pattern was similar at the patients' first birthday: 50.0 vs -1.5. Additional treatment beyond 3 months was needed for 65% of the patients (7 in the intravenous and 6 in the oral group). Six of 8 patients with impaired vision at enrollment had an improved function at 1 year (4 patients in the intravenous group and 3 patients in the oral group). Of the 4 surrogate markers of angiogenesis measured (plasma basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1, endoglin, and urine basic fibroblast growth factor), the only 2 that decreased over time were vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 and endoglin. Patients in the oral group had a higher rate of adverse effects, such as hypertension (18.6% vs 13.1%), abnormal cortisol (78% vs 60%), and growth retardation.                Systemic corticosteroids are efficacious in stopping the proliferation of hemangiomas. The oral corticosteroids offered more clinical and biological benefit than the pulse steroids with higher risk of adverse effects.","answer":"This review has found limited evidence from individual RCTs to support some of the existing interventions (corticosteroid and PDL) for infantile haemangiomas.

[1a-b] In this context, nickel provides unique advantages compared to other transition metals, such as palladium, by having a higher propensity toward oxidative addition and 1,2-migratory insertion steps while being more resilient towards β-hydride elimination. [1c] 1,2-Dicarbofunctionalization of alkenyl amine substrates, wherein a protected amine directs key steps in the catalytic cycle, is an attractive approach for selectivity control and offers rapid entry to functionalized alkyl amine product libraries. 1,2-(Fluoroalkyl)arylation and 1,2-diarylation of electronically activated enamides and ortho-vinyl aniline derivatives have been reported by Zhang [2a] and Giri [2b] , respectively (Scheme 1). More recently the use of a nonremovable pyrimidyl auxiliary that facilitates the 1,2dicarbofunctionalization of non-conjugated terminal alkenes via coordination of Ni with a N(sp 2 ) atom center was reported by Zhao and coworkers. [2e] Our group has reported the 1,2diarylation and 1,2-allylmethylation of simple alkenyl amides and N-allyl heterocycles, respectively. [3a-b] Ni-catalyzed conjunctive cross-couplings of various classes of nonconjugated alkenes have been reported by other research groups via different mechanistic paradigms. [4] This progress notwithstanding, significant limitations remain in this family of transformations. In particular, existing methods are incompatible with homoallyl and bis-homoallyl amines as well as internal alkenyl amine substrates. Moreover, the directing groups employed in earlier reports are synthetically restrictive in that they cannot be directly employed in further functionalization. The goal of the present study was to identify an amine-based directing group capable of promoting 1,2diarylation of remote, highly substituted alkenes and engaging in diverse downstream N-functionalization chemistry, which [a] Reaction conditions: 1a (0.1 mmol), 0.2 M s-BuOH. [b] Values in parentheses are isolated yields.</p><p>[c] Percentage yield by  [b] R N entry deviation from standard conditions %Yield 2a [c] conditions from alkenyl amide diarylation [d] conditions from alkenyl carboxylate diarylation [e]</p><p>would allow alkenyl amines to act as linchpins in modular synthesis. To this end, herein we report the identification of sulfonamides as uniquely effective and versatile [5,6] directing groups in 1,2-diarylation of alkenes under nickel/dimethyl fumarate (DMFU) catalysis. [7] To commence the study, we selected iodobenzene and 4-tolylboronic acid neopentyl glycol ester (p-tolB(nep)) as model coupling partners and systematically surveyed homoallyl amine substrates bearing different protecting groups. Carbonyl groups that were previously found to direct 1,2-diarylation of allylamine substrates, namely Boc-, Piv-, and Bz-, were ineffective in this case with a more distal alkene. We next turned to sulfonyl protecting groups [6] with the hypothesis that in this case, the nickel catalyst may bind the sulfonamide through nitrogen. Gratifyingly, triflyl-protected homoallyl amine gave the desired product, albeit in low yield. Moving to a less electron-withdrawing aryl sulfonyl group provided 1,2diarylated product 2a in excellent yield and regioselectivity, and its connectivity was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. While various aryl sulfonamide directing groups were similarly effective (vide infra), the 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group provided a convenient 19 F NMR handle for reaction analysis and was employed for much of the ensuing work. The absence of DMFU and employment of the aryl boronic acid and pinacol ester resulted in diminished yields (Entries 1-3). Bromobenzene was unreactive as an electrophile, and other nickel precatalysts, such as Ni(cod)(DQ), NiCl2, Ni(acac)2, and NiBr2•glyme, were ineffective (Entries 4-5). Under previously published reaction conditions for diarylation of alkenyl amide substrates, lower yield was obtained (Entry 6). No diarylation was observed under conditions for alkenyl carboxylate substrates (Entry 7). [3a,4i] While excellent yields were obtained when lower catalyst loading or equivalents of coupling partners and base were used upon the standard substrate (Entry 8-9), across other examples, higher loading and equivalents gave improved yields.</p><p>Next, the scope of electrophilic and nucleophilic aryl coupling partners was investigated (Table 2). Electronwithdrawing groups at the para position of the aryl iodides</p><p>[a] Reactions performed on 0.1 mmol scale. [b] Reactions performed on 1 mmol scale. Percentages represent isolated yields.</p><p>2b, 99% (96%) [b] S</p><p>alkene scope unreactive substrates</p><p>Table 2. Electrophile, nucleophile, sulfonamide and alkene scope. [a] afforded the highest product yields (2b-c, 2i), and the product yield decreased with electron-neutral and -donating groups (2e-f, 2l). It is worth noting that product 2b was synthesized in an excellent yield on a larger scale (1 mmol, 0.48 g isolated).</p><p>Electron-withdrawing groups on the meta position of the aryl iodides gave no 1,2-diarylated product; however, electrondonating groups (2g, 2m) gave 1,2-diarylation in excellent yields. Ortho-substituted electron-withdrawing or donating groups on the aryl iodide had little effect on the product yield in comparison to the para-substituted examples (2d, 2h, 2j).</p><p>Consistent with the previously discussed results, electrondeficient 2-fluoro-4-iodopyridine gave good yield (2k). With regards to the nucleophile scope, no apparent trend is observed. Electron-withdrawing and weakly electron-donating groups on the para position (2n-o, 2s) gave very good yields. Product yields greatly varied with the use of electron-donating groups on the para position ranging from moderate to excellent yields (2r, 2u-v). Aryl boronic esters with electron withdrawing groups on the meta and ortho positions (2p, 2q, 2t, 2w) resulted in moderate to excellent yields as well.</p><p>Next, we varied the aryl sulfonyl group by substitution of the trifluoromethyl moiety at the para-position and observed good to excellent yields (2x-z). Mesyl (Ms) protected homoallyl amine 2aa is a competent substrate under the reaction conditions. However, product was not detected in the case of a nosyl protecting group, which we attribute to the potential inhibitory effect of nitro groups on Ni catalyst activity. [8] We then examined alkene substrates that are typically challenging in 1,2-diarylation. Pleasingly, (Z)-and (E)internal alkenes were well tolerated under the optimized reaction conditions. Diarylated product from a (Z)-alkene was obtained in good yield and as a single diastereomer, as confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (±-2ab). The (E)alkene was diarylated in the same fashion, but in a higher yield (±-2ac). In addition, a 1,1-disubstituted terminal alkene was found to work moderately well under the reaction conditions (2ad). With substitution at the α-position, no conversion was observed.</p><p>In a series of control experiments, both homoallyl aryl sulfonate 1o and N-methylated sulfonamide 1p were subjected to the optimized conditions, which resulted in no product formation (Scheme 2A). This indicates that the N-H moiety is important in the transformation. While we were successful in developing a remote alkene 1,2-diarylation reaction, we were curious about the effect of alkene distance on reactivity (Scheme 2B). When aryl sulfonyl protected allyl amine was subjected to the reaction conditions, diarylated product was obtained in a lower yield and as a 7:1 mixture of regioisomers (2af). Reaction of aryl sulfonyl protected pentenyl amine    Ar 2 L NaOR Ar = p-CF 3 C 6 H 4 unexpectedly gave the diarylated product in a good yield with excellent regioselectivity (2ag). Extension of the alkenyl chain to aryl sulfonyl protected hexenyl amine gave no product. We hypothesize that these alkenyl amine substrates go through 4-6-membered nickelacycles, where a 7-membered nickelacycle is unfavorable.</p>C. proposed catalytic cycle<p>Although this reaction may proceed via a N-Ni coordination mode, [9] the general catalytic cycle likely follows a similar mechanism as that of alkenyl amide and carboxylate diarylation (Scheme 2C). [3a,4i] The proposed catalytic cycle starts with nickel undergoing oxidative addition into the aryliodide bond, followed by alkene coordination of the protected alkenyl amine. Migratory insertion proceeds with the formation of an Ni II (alkyl)(sulfonamido) metallacycle. Subsequent transmetalation affords an Ni II (alkyl)(aryl) species which would finally undergo reductive elimination to give the 1,2-diarylated product. It should be noted that this catalytic cycle may also operate with the sulfonamide directing group as an L-type ligand upon migratory insertion and this pathway cannot be ruled out at this time.</p><p>We next envisioned that this method could have synthetic applicability as a linchpin technology where the diarylated products could engage in N-functionalization followed by deprotection to form highly functionalized secondary amines that would otherwise be difficult to construct. The 4-cyano-phenyl sulfonyl (4-Cs) protecting group was utilized in scale-up and diversification efforts due to its precedented ease of removal by use of 1-dodecanethiol. [5] With this in mind, we then synthesized diarylated product 2ai in 87% yield (1 mmol, 0.40 g isolated) (Scheme 3). This product was then subjected to Mitsunobu coupling, propargylation, benzylation, SNAr, and Boc protection reactions, which proceeded in moderate to good yields providing a diverse set of N-functionalized products (3a-e). Subsequent treatment with 1-dodecanethiol and DBU led to the removal of the aryl sulfonyl protecting group affording dialkyl, alkyl propargyl, alkyl benzyl, alkyl aryl, and alkyl Bocprotected amines in low to excellent yields (4a-e). Lastly, a violet-light-initiated Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag (HLF) cyclization of a representative product, 2z, furnished 4-Csprotected pyrrolidine (±)-3f in good yield, with the two aryl groups in a trans configuration (Scheme 4). [10] In summary, a Ni-catalyzed 1,2-diarylation of aryl sulfonyl protected alkenyl amines with aryl iodides and aryl boronic esters was developed. This method tolerates electronically varied aryl coupling partners. Electronics on the aryl sulfonyl protecting group is indiscriminate of its directing capabilities with the exception of nosyl substitution. Internal and 1,1disubstituted alkenes are competent substrates, affording the desired products in moderate to high yields with excellent regio-and diastereoselectivity. Control experiments showed that the free sulfonamide N-H is essential in the reaction. The alkenyl chain length was determined to tolerate dicarbofunctionalization with aryl sulfonyl protected allyl, butenyl, and pentenyl amines. Finally, this methodology may be implemented as a linchpin technology where aryl sulfonyl protected alkenyl amines could engage in 1,2-diarylation, then N-functionalization, and lastly deprotection to afford trifunctionalized secondary amines allowing leeway for facile complex amine synthesis.</p>Experimental Section<p>General Procedure: To a 1-dram (4 mL) vial equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar were added the alkene substrate (0.1 mmol), the appropriate aryl boronic acid neopentylglycol ester (0.3 mmol), the appropriate aryl iodide electrophile (0.3 mmol), and dimethyl fumarate (15 mol%). The vial was then equipped with a septum cap, which was pierced by a 20-gauge needle and introduced into an argon-filled glovebox antechamber. Once transferred inside the glovebox, anhydrous NaOH (0.3 mmol), Ni(cod)2 (20 mol%), and anhydrous sec-butanol (0.5 mL) were added. After stirring for 30 sec, the vial was sealed with a screw-top cap, removed from the glovebox, and left to stir at room temperature for 12 h. After this time, the reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (1 mL), poured into a test tube filled with satd. aq. NaHCO3 (10 mL) rinsing with EtOAc (1 mL), and was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 1 mL). The organic layers were combined, and the solvent was removed in vacuo to leave a yellow residue, which afforded pure product after preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC).</p>","answer":"1,2-Diarylation of alkenyl sulfonamides with aryl iodides and aryl boronic esters under nickel catalysis is reported. The developed method tolerates coupling partners with disparate electronic properties and substitution patterns. 1,2-and 1,1-Disubstituted alkenes, as well as alkenes distal from the directing group, are all accommodated. Control experiments are consistent with a N-Ni coordination mode of the directing group, which stands in contrast to earlier reports on amide-directed 1,2-diarylation that involve carbonyl coordination. The synthetic utility of the method arises from the dual function of the sulfonamide as both a directing group and masked amine nucleophile. This is highlighted by various product diversifications where complex amine compounds are synthesized in a two-step sequence of N-functionalization and deprotection of the sulfonyl group."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Considerable basic work will have to be done in medical ophthalmological units before any impression is made on the mass of systemic disease that underlies such afflictions as optic atrophy , diabetic retinopathy , uveitis , the hypertensive and vascular disorders , and possibly also the senile macular lesions . To face the problems of tomorrow ophthalmology must at the very least exp and beyond its surgical frontiers into the medical wards and the research laboratories.4 It is perhaps worth noting that during the period 1948 - 62 there has been an increase of about 25 % in the number of beds available for ophthalmic cases and there has been an expansion of some 50 % of patients treated over the same number of years , but the number of ophthalmic consultants has shown little change-from 295 to 310 . Little wonder that few ophthalmic consultants have the energy at the end of their day to contribute to the advance of their specialtyTitle 2:Serological response to chemoprophylaxis in extended contacts in leprosy--a randomized controlled trial.Abstract 2:Chemoprophylaxis was carried out on high risk group of extended contacts of new leprosy cases in Nyaungdon Township , Ayeyarwaddy Division , Myanmar and serological response was followed up for two years . In September 2003 , blood sample s were collected from 829 contacts after getting informed consent and sera were tested for immunoglobulin M antibodies using NTP-BSA ELISA test . These 300 seropositives were r and omized to treated and non-treated groups . In each group 102 each were enrolled in adults and 48 each in children . A single dose of ROM ( rifampicin , ofloxacin and minocycline ) and RMP ( rifampicin ) by body weight was administered to treated group of above 15 years and those below 15 years respectively . The vitamins were administered to non-treated group . The blood sample s of all contacts were collected again in September 2004 and September 2005 and ELISA was carried out on paired sample s on one plate . The mean optical density ( OD ) titers before vs after chemoprophylaxis were 0.24 vs 0.10 and 0.20 vs 0.09 in treated and non-treated group respectively in adults and 0.25 vs 0.11 and 0.22 vs 0.11 respectively in children after one year . These were 0.24 vs 0.17 and 0.20 vs 0.19 respectively in adults and 0.25 vs 0.19 and 0.22 vs 0.20 respectively in children after two years . The difference of mean antibody titers before and after chemoprophylaxis in treated group was significantly reduced compared to non-treated group in adults but was not significant in children . The findings show that there is a significant role of chemoprophylaxis on serological response in the form of decreasing antibody titer among the adult group of extended contactsTitle 3:Effectiveness of single dose rifampicin in preventing leprosy in close contacts of patients with newly diagnosed leprosy: cluster randomised controlled trialAbstract 3:Objective To determine the effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis using a single dose of rifampicin to prevent leprosy in close contacts . Design Single centre , double blind , cluster r and omised , placebo controlled trial . Setting Leprosy control programme in two districts of northwest Bangladesh with a population of more than four million . Participants 28 092 close contacts of 1037 patients with newly diagnosed leprosy . 21 711 contacts fulfilled the study requirements . Interventions A single dose of rifampicin or placebo given to close contacts in the second month of starting the index patient ’s treatment , with follow-up for four years . Main outcome measure Development of clinical leprosy . Results 18 869 of the 21 711 contacts ( 86.9 % ) were followed-up at four years . Ninety one of 9452 contacts in the placebo group and 59 of 9417 in the rifampicin group had developed leprosy . The overall reduction in incidence of leprosy using a single dose of rifampicin in the first two years was 57 % ( 95 % confidence interval 33 % to 72 % ) . The groups did not differ between two and four years . The overall number needed to treat ( NNT ) to prevent a single case of leprosy among contacts was 297 ( 95 % confidence interval 176 to 537 ) . Differences were found between subgroups at two years , both in reduction of incidence and in NNT . Conclusion A single dose of rifampicin given to contacts of patients with newly diagnosed leprosy is effective at preventing the development of clinical leprosy at two years . The effect was maintained , but no difference was seen between the placebo and rifampicin groups beyond two years .

To the present , a decrease of incidence has not been observed , possibly because of the long incubation period of the disease , and because general implementation of MDT is still recent . Other reasons , such as environmental sources of infection or the role of healthy carriers in transmitting Mycobacterium leprae , can not be excluded . Therefore , one must seek alternative or supplementary strategies , such as chemoprophylaxis . Household contacts of leprosy patients are at greater risk of developing leprosy than is the general population . Therefore , a r and omized , controlled trial of chemoprophylaxis , using a single 10 mg/kg dose of rifampicin , or a placebo , is planned in nine projects in India , among the household contacts of newly detected leprosy patients . Based upon assumptions of a protective efficacy of the chemoprophylaxis of 50 % , an annual incidence of 2 per 1000 contacts , a desired power of the study of 90 % , and a level of significance of 95 % , 15,000 household contacts will be allocated r and omly by household to each arm of the study , and followed for 5 years . Considered as household contacts will be all persons living in the same household as an index case and sharing the same kitchen . Pregnant women and infants will be excluded . To be certain that transmission of the organisms from the index case can not occur once the prophylaxis is administered , rifampicin will be administered 2 months after diagnosis of the index case . Diagnosis of leprosy will be clinical , and confirmed independently . Although household contacts usually constitute only a small proportion of the new patients detected in a control programme , their high-risk status makes them particularly appropriate for a study of the potential effect of chemoprophylaxis . Following the trial , one could evaluate the usefulness and feasibility of using the same strategy in other population -groups , based on the number of persons necessary to treat to prevent one caseTitle 5:Limited duration acedapsone prophylaxis in leprosy.Abstract 5:A r and omized controlled chemoprophylaxis trial was carried out in Madras city using 560 disease-free household child contacts of 264 multibacillary cases as study subjects . In the study , 13 cases were diagnosed among 280 contacts who received 3 injections of acedapsone at 10 weeks interval as against 30 cases among 280 contacts who had the same number of placebo injections  , during the follow-up period of 225 weeks . The difference in the incidences in the two groups was statistically significant . ( X2 6.45 ; P less than 0.02 ) . The protection due to the limited duration of  acedapsone  prophylaxis was 56.7 percent . There were no cases of multi-bacillary leprosy in either group . The efficacy of prophylaxis was significant in male children over 9 years of age and female children in the age-group 1 - 8 years . The other prognostic factors like the infectivity status of the index cases in the household and the duration of exposure to them could have possibly influenced the effectiveness of prophylaxis in preventing progression from infection to clinical disease among the subjects studied . Their effects could not be assessed in this study","answer":"CONCLUSION Chemoprophylaxis is effective in lowering the incidence of leprosy in contacts of patients diagnosed with the disease"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake.Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

In basilar arteries, endothelin-1 reduces the contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), by the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619, and by vasopressin. The inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on the contraction induced by 5-HT is abolished by deendothelialization, by the endothelin ET(B) receptor antagonist RES 701-1, by indomethacin, or by glibenclamide. In mesenteric arteries, endothelin-1 potentiates the contractile effects of 5-HT, U46619, and vasopressin. The potentiation of the contractile effect induced by 5-HT is only somewhat modified by deendothelialization, but abolished by the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists GR32191 and ridogrel. U46619 potentiates the 5-HT-effect in mesenteric arteries. Thus, though the contractile endothelin ET(A) receptors were not blocked, threshold concentrations of endothelin-1 inhibited contractile effects in the rat basilar artery via activation of endothelial ET(B) receptors. Prostaglandins and ATP-sensitive K+ channels are involved in this inhibitory action. In contrast, endothelin-1 potentiates contractile actions in mesenteric arteries via the release of endogeneous thromboxane A2 from non-endothelial cells. The study points out the completely different role of the endothelium in combined effects of endothelin-1 between cerebral and mesenteric arteries.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"U46619\\", \\"5-HT\\", \\"glibenclamide\\", \\"vasopressin\\", \\"GR32191\\", \\"Prostaglandins\\", \\"ridogrel\\", \\"ATP\\", \\"5-hydroxytryptamine\\", \\"indomethacin\\", \\"RES 701-1\\", \\"thromboxane A2\\", \\"K+\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"vasopressin\\", \\"endothelial ET(B) receptors\\", \\"endothelin ET(B) receptor\\", \\"endothelin-1\\", \\"endothelin ET(A) receptors\\", \\"ATP-sensitive K+ channels\\", \\"thromboxane A2 receptor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We have found four mutations in the human gene encoding the beta-subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE beta) that cosegregate with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative disease of photoreceptors. In one family two affected siblings both carry allelic nonsense mutations at codons 298 and 531. Affected individuals have abnormal rod and cone electroretinograms. PDE beta is the second member of the phototransduction cascade besides rhodopsin that is absent or altered as a cause of retinitis pigmentosa, suggesting that other members of this pathway may be defective in other forms of this disease.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"beta-subunit of rod phosphodiesterase\\", \\"rhodopsin\\", \\"beta-subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase\\", \\"PDE beta\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

To investigate the nature of somatic von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations, we analyzed 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas for mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of DNA. We detected abnormal SSCP pattern in 73 samples. After sequencing, we identified microdeletions in 58% of cases, microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations in 17%. Among these mutations, 50% correspond to new mutations. VHL mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype, as previously reported. To compare somatic and germline mutations, we used the VHL database, which includes 507 mutations. The study of mutational events revealed a significant difference between somatic and germline mutations with mutations leading to truncated proteins observed in 78% of somatic mutations vs only 37% in germline mutations (P < 0. 001). We postulated that a specific pattern of VHL mutations is associated with sporadic RCC. This pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations. We then analyzed the occurrence of RCC in VHL families, based on the nature of mutations. We observed RCC in at least one member of the VHL families in 77% of cases with mutations leading to truncated proteins versus 55% in cases with missense mutations (P < 0. 05). Thus, mutations resulting in truncated proteins may lead to a higher risk of RCC in VHL patients","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"VHL\\", \\"nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma\\", \\"renal cell carcinomas\\", \\"sporadic renal cell carcinoma\\", \\"VHL tumor\\", \\"sporadic RCC\\", \\"von Hippel-Lindau\\", \\"RCC\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Methods A r and omly selected sample of 1088 high school students from 20 schools completed surveys about their lunch practice s and vending machine purchases . School food policies were assessed by principal and food director surveys . The number of vending machines and their hours of operation were assessed by trained research staff . Results Students at schools with open campus policies during lunchtime were significantly more likely to eat lunch at a fast food restaurant than students at schools with closed campus policies ( 0.7 days/week vs. 0.2 days/week , p < .001 ) . Student snack food purchases at school were significantly associated with the number of snack machines at schools ( p < .001 ) and policies about the types of food that can be sold . In schools with policies , students reported making snack food purchases an average of 0.5 ± 1.1 days/week as compared to an average of 0.9 ± 1.3 days/week in schools without policies ( p < .001 ) . In schools in which soft drink machines were turned off during lunch time , students purchased soft drinks from vending machines 1.4 ± 1.6 days/week as compared to 1.9 ± 1.8 days/week in schools in which soft drink machines were turned on during lunch ( p = .040 ) . ConclusionS chool food policies that decrease access to foods high in fats and sugars are associated with less frequent purchase of these items in school among high school students . Schools should examine their food-related policies and decrease access to foods that are low in nutrients and high in fats and sugarsTitle 2:Weight Teasing and Disordered Eating Behaviors in Adolescents: Longitudinal Findings From Project EAT (Eating Among Teens)Abstract 2:OBJECTIVE . To assess whether weight-related teasing predicts the development of  binge eating , unhealthy weight control behaviors , and frequent dieting  among male and female adolescents . METHODS . A prospect i ve study was conducted with an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 2516 adolescents who completed surveys at both time 1 ( 1998–1999 ) and time 2 ( 2003–2004 ) of the Project EAT ( Eating Among Teens ) study . RESULTS . In 1998–1999 , approximately one fourth of participants reported being teased about their weight at least a few times a year . After adjustment for age , race/ethnicity , socioeconomic status ( SES ) , and BMI , boys who were teased about their weight were more likely than their peers to initiate binge eating with loss of control and unhealthy weight control behaviors 5 years later . The predicted prevalence for incident binge eating behaviors with loss of control among boys who were teased was 4.1 % as compared with 1.4 % for those who were not teased , after adjustment for age , race/ethnicity , SES , and BMI . For unhealthy weight control behaviors at time 2 , the predicted prevalence was 27.5 % among boys who were teased and 19.3 % for boys who were not teased , after adjustment for age , race/ethnicity , SES , and BMI . Girls who were teased were more likely than their peers to become frequent dieters . The predicted prevalence for incident frequent dieting among girls who were teased was 18.2 % as compared with 11.0 % for those who were not teased , after adjustment for age , race/ethnicity , SES , and BMI . CONCLUSIONS . Weight teasing in adolescence predicts disordered eating behaviors at 5-year follow-up . The patterns of these associations differ by gender . Reducing teasing through educational interventions and policies may reduce the level of disordered eating behaviors among youthsTitle 3:Pricing and promotion effects on low-fat vending snack purchases: the CHIPS Study.Abstract 3:OBJECTIVES This study examined the effects of pricing and promotion strategies on purchases of low-fat snacks from vending machines . METHODS  Low-fat snacks were added to 55 vending machines in a convenience sample of 12 secondary schools and 12 worksites . Four pricing levels ( equal price , 10 % reduction , 25 % reduction , 50 % reduction ) and 3 promotional conditions ( none , low-fat label , low-fat label plus promotional sign ) were crossed in a Latin square design . Sales of low-fat vending snacks were measured continuously for the 12-month intervention . RESULTS Price reductions of 10 % , 25 % , and 50 % on low-fat snacks were associated with significant increases in low-fat snack sales ; percentages of low-fat snack sales increased by 9 % , 39 % , and 93 % , respectively . Promotional signage was independently but weakly associated with increases in low-fat snack sales . Average profits per machine were not affected by the vending interventions . CONCLUSIONS Reducing relative prices on low-fat snacks was effective in promoting lower-fat snack purchases from vending machines in both adult and adolescent populationTitle 4:Environmental interventions for eating and physical activity: a randomized controlled trial in middle schools.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND Our objective was to evaluate the effects of environmental , policy , and social marketing interventions on physical activity and fat intake of middle school students on campus . DESIGN Twenty-four middle schools were r and omly assigned to intervention or control conditions . Baseline measures were collected in spring 1997 , and interventions were conducted during the 1997 - 1998 and 1998 - 1999 school years SETTING /PARTICIPATION : The schools had mean enrollments of 1109 , with 44.5 % nonwhite students . Over 2 years , physical activity interventions were design ed to increase physical activity in physical education classes and throughout the school day . Nutrition interventions were design ed to provide and market low-fat foods at all school food sources , including cafeteria breakfasts and lunches , a la carte sources , school stores , and bag lunches . School staff and students were engaged in policy change efforts , but there was no classroom health education . MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Primary outcomes were measured by direct observation and existing records . RESULTS R and omized regression models ( N = 24 schools ) revealed a significant intervention effect for physical activity for the total group ( p < 0.009 ) and boys ( p < 0.001 ) , but not girls ( p < 0.40 ) . The intervention was not effective for total fat ( p < 0.91 ) or saturated fat ( p < 0.79 ) . Survey data indicated that the interventions reduced reported body mass index for boys ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Environmental and policy interventions were effective in increasing physical activity at school among boys but not girls . The interventions were not effective in reducing fat intake at school . School environmental and policy interventions have the potential to improve health behavior of the student population , but barriers to full implementation need to be better understood and overcomeTitle 5:An environmental intervention to promote lower-fat food choices in secondary schools: outcomes of the TACOS Study.Abstract 5:OBJECTIVES We evaluated an environmental intervention intended to increase sales of lower-fat foods in secondary school cafeterias . METHODS Twenty secondary schools were r and omly assigned to either an environmental intervention or a control group for a 2-year period . The intervention increased the availability of lower-fat foods and implemented student-based promotions . RESULTS A steeper rate of increase in sales of lower-fat foods in year 1 ( 10 % intervention vs -2.8 % control , P = .002 ) and a higher percentage of sales of lower-fat foods in year 2 ( 33.6 % intervention vs 22.1 % control , P = .04 ) were observed . There were no significant changes in student self-reported food choices . CONCLUSIONS School-based environmental interventions to increase availability and promotion of lower-fat foods can increase purchase of these foods among adolescentsTitle 6:Competitive foods available in Pennsylvania public high schools.Abstract 6:OBJECTIVE This study examined the types and extent of competitive foods available in public high schools in Pennsylvania . DESIGN We developed , pilot tested , and distributed surveys to school foodservice directors in a r and om sample of 271 high schools in Pennsylvania . SUBJECTS Two hundred twenty-eight surveys were returned , for a response rate of 84 % . Statistical analyses were performed : Descriptive statistics were used to examine the extent of competitive food sales in Pennsylvania public high schools . The survey data were analyzed using SPSS software version 11.5.1 ( 2002 , SPSS base 11.0 for Windows , SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL ) . RESULTS A la carte sales provide almost dollar 700/day to school foodservice programs , almost 85 % of which receive no financial support from their school districts . The top-selling a la carte items are \\" hamburgers , pizza , and s and wiches . \\" Ninety-four percent of respondents indicated that vending machines are accessible to students . The item most commonly offered in vending machines is bottled water ( 71.5 % ) . While food items are less often available through school stores and club fund-raisers , c and y is the item most commonly offered through these sources . CONCLUSIONS Competitive foods are widely available in high schools . Although many of the items available are low in nutritional value , we found several of the top-selling a la carte options to be nutritious and bottled water the item most often identified as available through vending machinesTitle 7:Food environment in secondary schools: a la carte, vending machines, and food policies and practices.Abstract 7:OBJECTIVES This study described the food environment in 20 Minnesota secondary schools . METHODS Data were collected on school food policies and the availability and nutritional content of foods in school à la carte ( ALC ) areas and vending machines ( VMs ) . RESULTS Approximately 36 % and 35 % of foods in ALC areas and in VMs , respectively , met the lower-fat criterion ( < or = 5.5 fat grams/serving ) . The chips/crackers category constituted the largest share of ALC foods ( 11.5 % ) . The median number of VMs per school was 12 ( 4 soft drink , 2 snack , 5 other ) . Few school food policies were reported . CONCLUSIONS The availability of healthful foods and beverages in schools as well as school food policies that foster healthful food choices among students needs greater attentionTitle 8:School competitive food policies: perceptions of Pennsylvania public high school foodservice directors and principals.Abstract 8:The objectives of this study were to describe the extent , nature , and enforcement of school competitive food policies in Pennsylvania public high schools and to determine if there are differences between school foodservice directors ' and principals ' perceptions of the existence and enforcement of these policies . A survey was distributed to 271 school foodservice directors and 100 principals in a representative , r and om sample of high schools . Two hundred twenty-eight school foodservice directors ( 84 % ) and 79 principals ( 79 % ) returned surveys . Descriptive statistics , chi2 analyses , and a proportions test were done using SPSS statistical software ( SPSS base 11.5 for Windows , 2002 , SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL ) . Few nutrition policies were reported related to setting nutritional st and ards for competitive foods ( 0.5 % to 15.0 % ) . Respondents ' reporting of existence of policies not always enforced ranged from 0 % to 12.8 % . School foodservice directors reported uncertainty about existence of several policies outside their direct domain , but with potential effect on school meals participation .

Autoimmunity is largely prevented by medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs) through their expression and presentation of tissue-specific Ags to developing thymocytes, resulting in deletion of self-reactive T cells and supporting regulatory T cell development. The transcription factor Prdm1 has been implicated in autoimmune diseases in humans through genome-wide association studies and in mice using cell type-specific deletion of Prdm1 in T and dendritic cells. In this article, we demonstrate that Prdm1 functions in TECs to prevent autoimmunity in mice. Prdm1 is expressed by a subset of mouse TECs, and conditional deletion of Prdm1 in either Keratin 14- or Foxn1-expressing cells in mice resulted in multisymptom autoimmune pathology. Notably, the development of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells occurs normally in the absence of Blimp1. Importantly, nude mice developed anti-nuclear Abs when transplanted with Prdm1 null TECs, but not wild-type TECs, indicating that Prdm1 functions in TECs to regulate autoantibody production. We show that Prdm1 acts independently of Aire, a crucial transcription factor implicated in medullary TEC function. Collectively, our data highlight a previously unrecognized role for Prdm1 in regulating thymic epithelial function.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"Aire\\", \\"Blimp1\\", \\"Foxp3\\", \\"Keratin 14\\", \\"Prdm1\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"Foxn1\\"]}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper. Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:  In many applications, the training data for a machine learning task is partitioned across multiple nodes, and aggregating this data may be infeasible due to storage, communication, or privacy constraints.In this work, we present Good-Enough Model Spaces (GEMS), a novel framework for learning a global satisficing (i.e. \\"good-enough\\") model within a few communication rounds by carefully combining the space of local nodes' satisficing models.In experiments on benchmark and medical datasets, our approach outperforms other baseline aggregation techniques such as ensembling or model averaging, and performs comparably to the ideal non-distributed models.There has been significant work in designing distributed optimization methods in response to challenges arising from a wide range of large-scale learning applications.These methods typically aim to train a global model by performing numerous communication rounds between distributed nodes.However, most approaches treat communication reduction as an objective, not a constraint, and seek to minimize the number of communication rounds while maintaining model performance.Less explored is the inverse setting-where our communication budget is fixed and we aim to maximize accuracy while restricting communication to only a few rounds.These few-shot model aggregation methods are ideal when any of the following conditions holds:• Limited network infrastructure: Distributed optimization methods typically require a connected network to support the collection of numerous learning updates.Such a network can be difficult to set up and maintain, especially in settings where devices may represent different organizational entities (e.g., a network of different hospitals).•Privacy and data ephemerality: Privacy policies or regulations like GDPR may require nodes to periodically delete the raw local data. Few-shotmethods enable learning an aggregate model in ephemeral settings, where a node may lose access to its raw data. Additionally, as fewer messages are sent between nodes, these methods have the potential to offer increased privacy benefits.• Extreme asynchronicity: Even in settings where privacy is not a concern, messages from distributed nodes may be unevenly spaced and sporadically communicated over days, weeks, or even months (e.g., in the case of remote sensor networks or satellites). Few-shot methods drasticallylimit communication and thus reduce the wall-clock time required to learn an aggregate model.Throughout this paper, we reference a simple motivating example. Consider two hospitals, A andB, which each maintain private (unshareable) patient data pertinent to some disease. As A and B are geographicallydistant, the patients they serve sometimes exhibit different symptoms. Without sharing the raw trainingdata, A and B would like to jointly learn a single model capable of generalizing to a wide range of patients. The prevalent learning paradigmin this settingdistributed or federated optimization-dictates that A and B share iterative model updates (e.g., gradient information) over a network.From a meta-learning or multitask perspective, we can view each hospital (node) as a separate learning task, where our goal is to learn a single aggregate model which performs well on each task. However, these schemes often makesimilar assumptions on aggregating data and learning updates from different tasks.As a promising alternative, we present good-enough model spaces (GEMS), a framework for learning an aggregate model over distributed nodes within a small number of communication rounds. Intuitively, the key idea in GEMSis to take advantage of the fact that many possible hypotheses may yield 'good enough' performance for a learning task on local data, and that considering the intersection between these sets can allow us to compute a global model quickly and easily. Our proposed approach has severaladvantages. First, it is simple and interpretablein that each node only communicates its locally optimal model and a small amount of metadata corresponding to local performance. Second, each node's message scales linearlyin the local model size. Finally, GEMS is modular, allowing the operatorto tradeoff the aggregate model's size against its performance via a hyperparameter .We make the following contributions in this work. First, we present a general formulation of theGEMS framework. Second, we offer a method for calculating thegood-enough space on each node as a R d ball. We empirically validate GEMS on both standardbenchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR-10) as well as a domain-specific health dataset. We consider learning convex classifiers and neuralnetworks in standard distributed setups as well as scenarios in which some small global held-out data may be used for fine-tuning. We find that on average, GEMS increases the accuracyof local baselines by 10.1 points and comes within 43% of the (unachievable) global ideal. With fine-tuning, GEMS increases the accuracy of localbaselines by 41.3 points and comes within 86% of the global ideal.In summary, we introduce GEMS, a framework for learning an aggregated model across different nodes within a few rounds of communication.We validate one approach for constructing good-enough model spaces (as R d balls) on three datasets for both convex classifiers and simple feedforward networks.Despite the simplicity of the proposed approach, we find that it outperforms a wide range of baselines for effective model aggregation TAB0","answer":"We present Good-Enough Model Spaces (GEMS), a framework for learning an aggregate model over distributed nodes within a small number of communication rounds."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

This was an open-label, single dose, case-controlled study in which eight subjects with liver cirrhosis classed as moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7-9) and eight demographically-matched healthy subjects received a single oral 400 mg dose of lumiracoxib. Routine safety assessments were made and blood samples were taken for determination of lumiracoxib concentrations for 96 h post dose. The ex vivo binding of lumiracoxib to plasma proteins was determined pre dose and at 2 and 12 h post dose. An analysis of variance was used to detect differences in PK parameters (AUC, Cmax and Tmax) between the treatment groups. There were no significant differences between subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy subjects in the area under the lumiracoxib plasma concentration-time curves (AUC(0-infinity)): 29.2 +/- 6.7 microg h ml(-1) versus 28.7 +/- 6.3 mircrog h ml(-1). The rate of absorption of lumiracoxib was not significantly altered by hepatic impairment based on Cmax and Tmax. The protein-bound fraction of lumiracoxib exceeded 98% both in healthy control subjects and in those with moderate hepatic insufficiency. A single dose of 400 mg lumiracoxib was well tolerated. In conclusion, no dose adjustments appear to be required when lumiracoxib is administered to patients with either mild or moderate hepatic impairment.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Prexige\\", \\"lumiracoxib\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"cyclooxygenase-2\\", \\"COX-2\\"]}"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Four prenylflavonoids, kurarinone (1), a chalcone of 1, kuraridin (2), kurarinol (3), kushenol H (4) and kushenol K (5) isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens were investigated for their inhibitory effects on diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). The flavonoids inhibited DGAT activity in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 10.9 microM (1), 9.8 microM (2), 8.6 microM (3), 142.0 microM (4) and 250 microM (5). The prenylflavonoids without C3-OH (1, 2, 3) showed stronger inhibition than those with C3-OH (4, 5). On the other hand, flavonoids without side chains (hesperetin, naringenin, quercetin and kaempferol) did not inhibit the enzyme activity at a final concentration of 800 microM. These data suggest that the lavandulyl side chain and the position of the hydroxy group are important for high DGAT inhibitory activity. Compound 1 also inhibited de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol (TG) in Raji cells.","answer":"[[\\"kurarinol\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"kuraridin\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"diacylglycerol acyltransferase\\"], [\\"chalcone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"diacylglycerol acyltransferase\\"], [\\"chalcone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"prenylflavonoids\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"diacylglycerol acyltransferase\\"], [\\"kurarinone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"hydroxy\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"kurarinone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"diacylglycerol acyltransferase\\"], [\\"kuraridin\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"kushenol K\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"lavandulyl\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"kushenol H\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"diacylglycerol acyltransferase\\"], [\\"kushenol K\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"diacylglycerol acyltransferase\\"], [\\"kushenol H\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"prenylflavonoids\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"], [\\"kurarinol\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"diacylglycerol acyltransferase\\"], [\\"flavonoids\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"DGAT\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Microspheres serve as convenient substrates for studying DNA activity on surfaces. Here, in addition to employing conventional sample preparation involving multiple wash and resuspension steps prior to flow cytometry measurements, we also directly sampled the reaction volume to acquire in situ measurements of primary and competitive hybridization events. Even in the absence of post hybridization wash steps, nonspecific binding events were negligible and thus allowed for direct, quantitative assessment of hybridization events as they occurred on colloidal surfaces. The in situ results indicate that primary duplex formation between immobilized probes and soluble targets on microsphere surfaces is less favorable than predicted by solution models. The kinetics of competitive displacement of primary hybridization partners by secondary targets measured in situ or post washing also deviate from expectations based on theoretical solution thermodynamics, but are consistent with predicted kinetic trends stemming from differences in either the toehold base length or branch migration.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Design A nine point classification system for missing outcome data in r and omised trials was developed and applied to the trials assessed in a large , unselected cohort of Cochrane systematic review s. Research ers who conducted the trials were contacted and the reason sought for the non-reporting of data . A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the impact of outcome reporting bias on review s that included a single meta- analysis of the review primary outcome . Results More than half ( 157/283 ( 55 % ) ) the review s did not include full data for the review primary outcome of interest from all eligible trials . The median amount of review outcome data missing for any reason was 10 % , whereas 50 % or more of the potential data were missing in 70 ( 25 % ) review s. It was clear from the publications for 155 ( 6 % ) of the 2486 assessable trials that the research ers had measured and analysed the review primary outcome but did not report or only partially reported the results . For reports that did not mention the review primary outcome , our classification regarding the presence of outcome reporting bias was shown to have a sensitivity of 88 % ( 95 % CI 65 % to 100 % ) and specificity of 80 % ( 95 % CI 69 % to 90 % ) on the basis of responses from 62 trialists . A third of Cochrane review s ( 96/283 ( 34 % ) ) contained at least one trial with high suspicion of outcome reporting bias for the review primary outcome . In a sensitivity analysis undertaken for 81 review s with a single meta- analysis of the primary outcome of interest , the treatment effect estimate was reduced by 20 % or more in 19 ( 23 % ) . Of the 42 meta-analyses with a statistically significant result only , eight ( 19 % ) became non-significant after adjustment for outcome reporting bias and 11 ( 26 % ) would have overestimated the treatment effect by 20 % or more . Conclusions Outcome reporting bias is an under-recognised problem that affects the conclusions in a substantial proportion of Cochrane review s. Individuals conducting systematic review s need to address explicitly the issue of missing outcome data for their review to be considered a reliable source of evidence . Extra care is required during data extraction , review ers should identify when a trial reports that an outcome was measured but no results were reported or events observed , and contact with trialists should be encouragedTitle 2:Levetiracetam monotherapy in juvenile myoclonic epilepsyAbstract 2:PURPOSE To describe our experience with levetiracetam ( LEV ) as initial or conversion monotherapy treatment for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( JME ) .  Valproate , the usual first line agent for JME , has chronic adverse effects , particularly for women of childbearing potential . Since JME requires lifetime treatment , chronic adverse effects of therapy are important consideration . METHODS We review ed the medical records of patients with JME treated with LEV in the first 4 years after marketing . We recorded demographic data , results of  EEG and imaging studies , antiepileptic drug ( AED ) history , LEV initial dose and final dose , side effects related to LEV , and  therapeutic response  to treatment . We classified JME into definite and probable based on clinical and EEG criteria . The minimum duration of follow up was 1 year . RESULTS LEV was the first therapy in 12 patients and the initial appropriate agent in 16 . Fourteen patients had been treated with another appropriate AED . Eighty percent ( 24/30 ) of patients became seizure free with LEV monotherapy and two additional patients showed improved seizure control . Final therapeutic doses of LEV ranged from 12 to 50mg/(kgday ) . Complete seizure control using LEV was not predicted by previous AED use . Treatment failure with valproate also did not predict failure of LEV . Patients with definite JME responded best within the study group ( 11 of 11 seizure free , p<0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS This study supports consideration of LEV for first line treatment of JME and suggests the need for a large prospect i ve trialTitle 3:Topiramate for the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.Abstract 3:OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate ( TPM ) in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( JME ) . METHOD We assessed seizure control and adverse effects of TPM in 22 patients ( 18 females ) aged 13 to 53 years . Target TPM dosage was up to 200 mg/day . The patients were subdivided into 3 groups : those treated with seizure control plus side effects ( n=4 ) ; treated with non-controlled seizures ( n=15 ) and with JME newly diagnosed ( n=3 ) . RESULTS Sixteen patients completed the first year of the follow-up . Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were completely controlled in 10 ( 62.5 % ) ; more than 50 % of reduction in 4 ( 25.0 % ) and less than 50 % in 2 ( 12.5 % ) . Myoclonia were controlled in 11 ( 68.8 % ) and persisted in 5 ( 31.2 % ) patients . Absence seizures were present in 5 ( 22.7 % ) of whom 2 ( 9.0 % ) showed more than 50 % of seizure reduction while 3 ( 13.6 % ) presented worsening . Discontinuations were due to inadequate seizure control and adverse events ( N=4 ) , low compliance and loss of follow-up ( N=2 ) and subject choice ( N=1 ) . CONCLUSION TPM showed to be an effective and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of JME . Although frequently observed , TPM side effects were tolerable and the drug could be maintained in the majority of patientsTitle 4:Topiramate in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND Topiramate is a broad-spectrum agent effective against primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures ( PGTCS ) as well as partial-onset seizures .  Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is one of the most common idiopathic generalized epilepsies , with most patients experiencing PGTCS . OBJECTIVE To evaluate topiramate as add-on therapy in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy . DESIGN Post-hoc analysis of a patient subset from 2 multicenter , double-blind , r and omized , placebo-controlled , parallel-group trials . SETTING Eighteen centers in the United States ; 10 centers in Europe ; 1 center in Costa Rica ( primary trials ) . PATIENTS A total of 22 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials assessing topiramate ( target dose , 400 mg/d in adults ) in inadequately controlled PGTCS . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Reduction of PGTCS . RESULTS A 50 % or more reduction of PGTCS in 8 of 11 topiramate-treated patients ( 73 % ) and 2 of 11 placebo-treated patients ( 18 % ) ( P = .03 ) . Reductions in myoclonic , absence , and total generalized seizures were also observed , although topiramate vs placebo differences did not achieve statistical significance . CONCLUSION As a broad-spectrum agent , topiramate is an effective option for patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsyTitle 5:A randomized open-label observational study to compare the efficacy and tolerability between topiramate and valproate in juvenile myoclonic epilepsyAbstract 5:Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( JME ) is managed with valproate in most patients ; however , valproate is an antiepileptic drug that has relatively severe adverse effects , especially in women . We performed a prospect i ve , open-label , r and omized observational study for comparison of efficacy and tolerability between topiramate and valproate in patients with JME . The inclusion criteria were patients with newly diagnosed JME or previously diagnosed JME with a history of a poor response or adverse effects to other antiepileptic drugs . The primary endpoint of this study was percentage of patients who were free of myoclonic seizures for 24 weeks in the two groups . The frequency and severity of adverse effects were also assessed . Sixteen patients were r and omized to topiramate and 17 to valproate . In the topiramate arm , 11 of 16 patients ( 68.9 % ) completed 24-week maintenance therapy and seven of the 11 ( 64 % ) were seizure-free . In the valproate arm , 16 of 17 patients ( 94.1 % ) completed 24-week follow-up and nine of 16 ( 56 % ) were seizure-free . The difference ( 64 % topiramate versus 56 % valproate ) did not reach statistical significance in this study group ( p = 0.08 , Fisher 's exact test ) . However , the severity of adverse effects was significantly different . Only 1 of 10 adverse effects from topiramate was ranked moderate-to-severe ( 10 % ) , in comparison with severe rankings for 10 of 17 adverse effects from valproate ( 59 % ) ( p = 0.018 , Fisher 's exact test ) . In summary , the efficacy of topiramate and valproate was not different , but the severity of adverse effects was favourable for topiramate . Our findings suggest that valproate may be replaced with topiramate , especially for the patients with JME who do not tolerate valproateTitle 6:Low‐dose topiramate in adults with treatment‐resistant partial‐onset seizuresAbstract 6:Objectives – Based on dose predictions from animal and human volunteer studies , most patients enrolled in initial r and omized controlled trials of topiramate as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial‐onset seizures were r and omized to ≥ 600 mg/day topiramate . Subsequent experience suggests that dosage needs were overestimated . This double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study evaluated 200 mg/day topiramate in adults with treatment‐resistant partial‐onset seizures receiving a concurrent enzyme‐inducing antiepileptic agent ( carbamazepine ) . Material and methods – After a 4‐week baseline , 263 adults receiving carbamazepine who had at least three partial‐onset seizures during the baseline period were r and omized  to placebo or one of two topiramate 200 mg/day treatment arms : topiramate escalated weekly 25 mg/day(8‐week escalation ) or 50 mg/day(4‐week escalation ) . Therapy was then maintained for the remainder of the 12‐week double‐blind study . Results – Median percent reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to study end was 44 % with topiramate and 20 % with placebo ( P ≤ 0.001 ) . A significant therapeutic effect was present at 2 weeks with a dose of 100 mg/day . The most common adverse events ( ≥10 % incidence in topiramate‐treated patients ) were somnolence , fatigue , paresthesia , nervousness and anorexia ; 8 % of topiramate‐treated patients and 2 % of placebo‐treated patients discontinued because of adverse events . As a result of the low incidence of adverse events , differences between titration rates in terms of tolerability were not detected . Conclusion – Topiramate 200 mg/day is an appropriate target dose as adjunctive therapy in adults with treatment‐resistant partial‐onset seizures , even when receiving an enzyme‐inducing agent ; 100 mg/day also appears to be effective . A significant therapeutic effect may be seen in the second week of treatment with a dose of 100 mg/dayTitle 7:Topiramate or valproate in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: A randomized open-label comparisonAbstract 7:Few r and omized , controlled trials evaluating antiepileptic drug ( AED ) efficacy and tolerability have focused solely on patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( JME ) . We conducted a pilot , r and omized controlled trial comparing  topiramate ( N=19 ) and valproate ( N=9 ) in adolescents/adults with JME to evaluate clinical response when these broad-spectrum agents are titrated to optimal effect . Rating scales were used to systematic ally assess tolerability . Among patients completing 26 weeks of treatment , 8 of 12 ( 67 % ) in the topiramate group and 4 of 7 ( 57 % ) in the valproate group were seizure-free during the 12-week maintenance period . Median daily dose was 250 mg topiramate or 750 mg valproate . Two ( 11 % ) topiramate-treated patients and one ( 11 % ) valproate-treated patient discontinued due to adverse events . Systemic toxicity scores , but not neurotoxicity scores , differed substantially between the two groups ; greater systemic toxicity was associated with valproate . Our preliminary findings that topiramate may be an effective , well-tolerated alternative to valproate warrant validation in a double-blind trial","answer":"There were no significant differences between topiramate and valproate in participants responding with a 50 % or more reduction in myoclonic seizures or in PGTCS , or becoming seizure-free .This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support topiramate for the treatment of people with JME .Based on the current limited available data , topiramate seems to be better tolerated than valproate , but has no clear benefits over valproate in terms of efficacy ."},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

The fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ciprofloxacin (cipro), induces hyperproduction of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged IL-2 and IL-2 mRNA response was also detected in both stimulated (T cell mitogens or alloantigens) murine splenocytes and in the stimulated murine T cell line EL-4 in the presence of ciprofloxacin (5-80 micrograms / ml) as compared to control cells without antibiotics. However, in contrast to human lymphocytes, IFN-gamma production was inhibited and IFN-gamma mRNA levels were unaffected at 24 h and only slightly upregulated at 48 and 72 h of culture in murine splenocytes incubated with cipro (20 micrograms / ml). EL-4 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter and enhancer region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Analysis of CAT activity revealed that cipro enhanced IL-2 gene induction.

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) transcription is dependent on the interaction of host-cell transcription factors with cis-regulatory DNA elements within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). Much attention has focused on the series of sequence elements upstream of the transcriptional initiation site in the U3 region of the LTR including the Sp1 and NF-kappaB binding sites. Recent studies, however, demonstrate that the transcribed 5'-untranslated leader region (5'-UTR) also contains important transcriptional elements. These regulatory elements situated downstream of transcription interact with constitutive and inducible transcription factors, mediate transmission of cellular activation signals, and are important for efficient HIV-1 transcription and replication. The 5'-UTR contains binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1, NF-kappaB, NF-AT, IRF, and Sp1. Mutations in these binding sites can interfere with the viral response to cell activation signals, decrease LTR transcription, and inhibit viral replication. The 5'-UTR also interacts with a specific nucleosome that is rapidly displaced during transcriptional activation of the latent provirus. We propose that the inducible transcription factor binding sites in the 5'-UTR comprise a downstream enhancer domain that can function independent of, or in concert with, the LTR promoter to rapidly increase latent proviral transcription in response to cell activation signals. In this review, we describe the host-cell transcription factors that interact with the 5'-UTR and discuss their role in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [\\"LTR\\", \\"transcriptional elements\\", \\"viral long terminal repeat\\", \\"5u0027 - UTR\\", \\"U3 region\\", \\"cis - regulatory DNA elements\\", \\"inducible transcription factor binding sites\\", \\"regulatory elements\\", \\"transcriptional initiation site\\", \\"LTR promoter\\", \\"downstream enhancer domain\\", \\"binding sites\\", \\"5u0027 - untranslated leader region\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"NF - AT\\", \\"Sp1\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"the host - cell transcription factors\\", \\"host - cell transcription factors\\", \\"IRF\\", \\"nucleosome\\", \\"transcription factors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Multiple oximes have been synthesized and evaluated for use as countermeasures against chemical warfare nerve agents. The current U.S. military and civilian oxime countermeasure, 2-[ (hydroxyimino) methyl]-1-methylpyridin-1-ium chloride (2-PAM), is under consideration for replacement with a more effective acetylcholinesterase reactivator, 1,1'-methylenebis{4-hydroxyiminomethyl}pyridinium dimethanesulfonate (MMB-4). Kinetic data in the scientific literature for MMB-4 are limited; therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for a structurally related oxime, 1,1'-trimethylenebis{4-hydroximinomethyl}pyridinium dibromide. Based on a previous model structure for the organophosphate diisopropylfluorophosphate, the model includes key sites of acetylcholinesterase inhibition (brain and diaphragm), as well as fat, kidney, liver, rapidly perfused tissues and slowly perfused tissues. All tissue compartments are diffusion limited. Model parameters were collected from the literature, predicted using quantitative structure-property relationships or, when necessary, fit to available pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The model was parameterized using rat plasma, tissue and urine time course data from intramuscular administration, as well as human blood and urine data from intravenous and intramuscular administration; sensitivity analyses were performed. The PBPK model successfully simulates rat and human data sets and has been evaluated by predicting intravenous mouse and intramuscular human data not used in the development of the model. Monte Carlo analyses were performed to quantify human population kinetic variability in the human evaluation data set. The model identifies potential pharmacokinetic differences between rodents and humans, indicated by differences in model parameters between species. The PBPK model can be used to optimize the dosing regimen to improve oxime therapeutic efficacy in a human population.","answer":"[[\\"MMB-4\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"acetylcholinesterase\\"], [\\"1,1u0027-methylenebis{4-hydroxyiminomethyl}pyridinium dimethanesulfonate\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"acetylcholinesterase\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The plastic network model (PNM) is used to generate a conformational change pathway for Escherichia coli adenylate kinase based on two crystal structures, namely that of an open and a closed conformer. In this model, the energy basins corresponding to known conformers are connected at their lowest common energies. The results are used to evaluate and analyze the minimal energy pathways between these basins. The open to closed transition analysis provides an identification of hinges that is in agreement with the existing definitions based on the available X-ray structures. The elastic energy distribution and the Cα pseudo-dihedral variation provide similar information on these hinges. The ensemble of the 45 published structures for this protein and closely related proteins is shown to always be within 3.0 A of the pathway, which corresponds to a conformational change between two end structures that differ by a Cα-atom root-mean-squared deviation of 7.1 A. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  This paper presents a new method for computing macromolecular motions based on the combination of path planning algorithms, originating from robotics research, and elastic network normal mode analysis. The low-frequency normal modes are regarded as the collective degrees of freedom of the molecule. Geometric path planning algorithms are used to explore these collective degrees of freedom in order to find possible large-amplitude conformational changes. To overcome the limits of the harmonic approximation, which is valid in the vicinity of the minimum energy structure, and to get larger conformational changes, normal mode calculations are iterated during the exploration. Initial results show the efficiency of our method, which requires a small number of normal mode calculations to compute large-amplitude conformational transitions in proteins. A detailed analysis is presented for the computed transition between the open and closed structures of adenylate kinase. This transition, important for its biological function, involves large-amplitude domain motions. The obtained motion correlates well with results presented in related works. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  We present a general framework for the generation, alignment, comparison, and hybridization of motion pathways between two known protein conformations. The framework, which is rooted in probabilistic motion-planning techniques in robotics, allows for the efficient generation of collision-free motion pathways, while considering a wide range of degrees of freedom involved in the motion. Within the framework, we provide the means to hybridize pathways, thus producing, the motion pathway of the lowest energy barrier out of the many pathways proposed by our algorithm. This method for comparing and hybridizing pathways is modular, and may be used within the context of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The framework was implemented within the Rosetta software suite, where the protein is represented in atomic detail. The K-channels switch between open and closed conformations, and we used the overall framework to investigate this transition. Our analysis suggests that channel-opening may follow a three-phase pathway. First, the channel unlocks itself from the closed state; second, it opens; and third, it locks itself in the open conformation. A movie that depicts the proposed pathway is available in the Supplementary Material (Movie S1) and at http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~angela/SuppKcsA.html. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Proteins are active, flexible machines that perform a range of different functions. Innovative experimental approaches may now provide limited partial information about conformational changes along motion pathways of proteins. There is therefore a need for computational approaches that can efficiently incorporate prior information into motion prediction schemes. In this paper, we present PathRover, a general setup designed for the integration of prior information into the motion planning algorithm of rapidly exploring random trees (RRT). Each suggested motion pathway comprises a sequence of low-energy clash-free conformations that satisfy an arbitrary number of prior information constraints. These constraints can be derived from experimental data or from expert intuition about the motion. The incorporation of prior information is very straightforward and significantly narrows down the vast search in the typically high-dimensional conformational space, leading to dramatic reduction in running time. To allow the use of state-of-the-art energy functions and conformational sampling, we have integrated this framework into Rosetta, an accurate protocol for diverse types of structural modeling. The suggested framework can serve as an effective complementary tool for molecular dynamics, Normal Mode Analysis, and other prevalent techniques for predicting motion in proteins. We applied our framework to three different model systems. We show that a limited set of experimentally motivated constraints may effectively bias the simulations toward diverse predicates in an outright fashion, from distance constraints to enforcement of loop closure. In particular, our analysis sheds light on mechanisms of protein domain swapping and on the role of different residues in the motion. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  Many proteins undergo extensive conformational changes as part of their functionality. Tracing these changes is important for understanding the way these proteins function. Traditional biophysics-based conformational search methods require a large number of calculations and are hard to apply to large-scale conformational motions. In this work we investigate the application of a robotics-inspired method, using backbone and limited side chain representation and a coarse grained energy function to trace large-scale conformational motions. We tested the algorithm on three well known medium to large proteins and we show that even with relatively little information we are able to trace low-energy conformational pathways efficiently. The conformational pathways produced by our methods can be further filtered and refined to produce more useful information on the way proteins function under physiological conditions.

OBJECTIVEChronic exposure to calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids poses renal transplant recipients (RTR) at high risk for development of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction may be crucial to the pathophysiology of NODAT and specific markers for β-cell dysfunction may have additive value for predicting NODAT in this population. Therefore, we prospectively investigated whether proinsulin, as a marker of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, is associated with future development of NODAT and improves prediction of it. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAll RTR between 2001 and 2003 with a functioning graft for ≥1 year were considered eligible for inclusion, except for subjects with diabetes at baseline who were excluded. We recorded incidence of NODAT until April 2012.RESULTSA total of 487 RTR (age 50 ± 12 years, 55% men) participated at a median time of 6.0 (interquartile range [ IQR ], 2.6-11.5) years after transplantation. Median fasting proinsulin levels were 16.6 (IQR, 11.0-24.2) pmol/L. During median follow-up for 10.1 (IQR, 9.1-10.4) years, 42 (35%) RTR had development of NODAT in the highest quartile of the distribution of proinsulin versus 34 (9%) in the lowest three quartiles (P < 0.001). In Cox regression analyses, proinsulin (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-2.83; P < 0.001) was strongly associated with NODAT development. This was independent of age, sex, calcineurine inhibitors, prednisolone use, components of the metabolic syndrome, or homeostasis model assessment. CONCLUSIONSIn conclusion, fasting proinsulin is strongly associated with NODAT development in RTR. Our results highlight the role of β-cell dysfunction in the pathophysiology of NODAT and indicate the potential value of proinsulin for identification of RTR at increased risk for NODAT.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

The more narrowly defined chem(o)informatics discipline focuses on the organization and systematic analysis of small molecules, associated experimental data, and structure-property relationships as well as on the design and prediction of new chemical entities with desired properties2–4. In addition, chemoinformatics addresses emerging 'big data' trends in chemistry5,6 and covers artificial intelligence methods, which experience a new wave of excitement in many scientific fields including chemistry7,8. Notably, machine learning methods have a long history in chemoinformatics and are a mainstay for compound property prediction4. Given its scope and methodological repertoire, chemoinformatics can be rationalized as a part of the CIS spectrum1,9.</p>Evolution of the chemical information science gateway<p>In 2015, the CIS Gateway (CISG) was originally launched as a CIS publication 'Channel' by F1000Research9 to provide a new open access and open peer review10 platform for broadly defined CIS publications. It was considered a much-needed extension of the CIS journal landscape with emphasis on open science and transparent peer review9. In 2017, the CIS Channel became a Gateway, its scope was further refined, and its advisory board extended11, leading to CISG in its current form. Without doubt, CISG filled a void within the journal landscape. In addition to fostering open science and post-publication communication, the CISG initiative strongly emphasized contributions of high scientific quality. Therefore, a two-stage review was established. Submissions to CISG were pre-reviewed by its advisory board to determine if the work had scientific quality and potential to advance the field. If so, the manuscript was published in CISG and subjected to open peer review using referees agreed upon by the authors. If not, authors still had the opportunity to publish their work in F1000Research outside CISG. Furthermore, the submission of off-the-beaten-path contributions to CISG was strongly encouraged9,11, for example, studies showing why a computational method was not capable of solving a particular problem. From the beginning, the CISG concept was enthusiastically received by investigators in the field and a number of leading experts joined CISG's advisory board. Hence, CISG was off to a good start, with strong support from F1000Research.</p>The first years in review<p>In the past four years, CISG has not attracted the attention in the greater CIS community we initially had hoped for. So far, only 16 papers have been published in CISG (including only one in 2018). The number of papers was never regarded as a primary success criterion for CISG, but steady growth was desirable, as an indicator of increasing awareness and acceptance in the field. While it is generally difficult to establish new journals or publication platforms, more positive resonance was anticipated. Some CISG advisors have explored reasons for the apparent reluctance to publish in CISG and a few likely causes emerged. First and foremost, the absence of an impact factor (IF) –consistent with the publication philosophy of F1000Research– presents a problem for scientists whose advancement largely depends on IF criteria. This affects entire academic communities (such as in China). While views concerning IFs greatly differ in the field, IF-dependent publication restrictions cannot be disregarded and inevitably confine the number of potential authors. In addition, required article processing charges for open access (which are moderate at F1000Research) appear to play a role for many in the CIS field, more so than one might expect. Moreover, perhaps surprisingly, a number of investigators do not feel comfortable with open peer review, whereas others strongly support it. However, there still is a tendency to shy away from exposing scientific work to public evaluations, although open review and scientific discourse need to follow defined criteria and standards10,12. On the other hand, open review might occasionally also come across as too timid. Taken together, these points indicate that more efforts –and more publications– will be required to establish an open review culture in the CIS field that rivals anonymous peer review.</p><p>The considerations above concerning IF, article processing charges, and open review are general in nature and not specific to CISG. However, in combination, these issues have made it difficult to establish CISG on the CIS publication landscape, although it is rather sparsely populated with specialized journals (with low to moderate IFs). Moreover, there are at least two CISG-specific issues that might have hindered its evolution. First, the two-stage review process is frequently viewed controversially and might be considered as overly strict. Second, CISG has occasionally been regarded as a quasi \\"private\\" or \\"elite\\" publication venue, which was, of course, far from being the intention. The quest for high scientific quality was never considered the privilege of just a few. Regardless, these issues have most likely also contributed to the slow development of CISG over the past four years, while a flagship journal in the CIS field is currently missing.</p><p>On a positive note, since launching CISG, open science in the traditionally conservative chemical sciences has further progressed. For example, new open access journals have been introduced by major publishers and there is a clear trend to make chemical data and software tools publicly available on open access platforms (in part due to more stringent data deposition requirements for publications). In addition, many academic-industry collaborations have been initiated in drug discovery, material science, and nanoscience, and CIS (focusing on artificial intelligence), which also help to support open science initiatives. Furthermore, with the recent announcement of Plan S13, major funding agencies including the EU commission will now require open access dissemination of research results including the chemical sciences. F1000Research in particular has seen a growth in submissions since 2015 as open access publishing becomes more 'mainstream'.</p>Entering the next phase<p>Despite the complications discussed above, reasons for further supporting and promoting CISG remain unchanged and are as attractive as at the time of CISG's inception: open science, open access, fast publication, transparent reviews, and ample opportunities for unconventional contributions. While we will not be able to address IF-related publication constraints, going forward, some adjustments will be made to further increase the visibility of CISG and its attractiveness as a publication venue.</p><p>CISG will continue to build upon its high-calibre advisory board and emphasize high-quality science. However, we will soften the two-stage review process and pre-review criteria. Only if there is a consensus view among advisors that a submission is scientifically not suitable for CISG, it will be forwarded to F1000Research for further consideration. Otherwise, the manuscript will be published immediately in CISG and subjected to open peer review, with the help of advisors. Several early career researchers will be added to the advisory board to further increase its range of scientific interests, motivations, and experiences.</p><p>Importantly, other Gateways and Collections have emerged on the F1000Research platform, which are related to CISG from a methodological viewpoint, such as theCytoscape Apps14 andRPackage15 Gateways or theBioinformatics Education and Training16 and thePython17 Collections. For example, Python has become the preferred programming language for CIS. These related Gateways and Collections including CISG may be more closely linked going forward and positioned in context, offering opportunities for cross-over calls for papers or other joint initiatives. For example, given the increasing emphasis put on data science and artificial intelligence in chemistry, biology, and drug discovery, themed calls for contributions focusing on data science and artificial intelligence in different fields might be considered. F1000Research's staff will launch and coordinate such efforts, which will provide many opportunities for submission of Method Articles, Software Tool Articles, Data Notes, or other types of papers, allowing researchers credit for the range of research outputs they are producing. Given the close connection between the Python Collection and programing in CIS, there should also be significant potential for growth in this area, especially for publication of Software Tool Articles. F1000Research have worked closely with software communities to help support computational paper submissions more broadly by allowing authors to submit in LaTeX18, integrate interactive figures into articles via Plotly19 and be able to run code re-analysis on the article page20. In addition, Data Notes will become increasingly important for CISG, given its close link to data science, similar to developments in computational biology.</p><p>We are looking forward to seeing CISG entering its next phase, hopefully with more resonance from the CIS field. It is noted that CISG continues to provide the only opportunity for open review in CIS and we hope that more investigators will see the benefits of the open post-publication review culture. From the CISG access statistics, it is clearly evident that articles published there are seen and read. From our own contributions to CISG, I know that they are widely cited as well, which is more important than an IF label. Hence, there are good reasons to give it a try and submit to CISG, with the added bonus of efficient handling of papers by F1000Research and its streamlined editorial procedures.</p>Data availability<p>No data are associated with this study.</p>","answer":"The Chemical Information Science Gateway (CISG) of F1000Research was originally conceptualized as a forum for high-quality publications in chemical information science (CIS) including chemoinformatics.

Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively.The outcome of one study suggested that children with autism were more likely to have a mother who was prescribed an SSRI during pregnancy.A history of maternal (adjusted odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.08) but not paternal depression was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders in offspring. In the subsample with available data on drugs, this association was confined to women reporting antidepressant use during pregnancy (3.34, 1.50 to 7.47, P=0.003), irrespective of whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors were reported.In utero exposure to both SSRIs and non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors (tricyclic antidepressants) was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders, particularly without intellectual disability.Repeated findings of elevated platelet serotonin levels in approximately one third of children with autism has led some to believe that dysfunctional serotonin signaling may be a causal mechanism for the disorder. Because serotonin is critical to fetal brain development, concerns have arisen regarding prenatal exposure to substances that manipulate serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).Though the majority of studies conducted in infants and children suggest prenatal exposure to SSRIs does not affect neurodevelopment, interpretation must be tempered given small sample sizes. The only published study that focused on prenatal SSRI exposure and ASD found an increased risk with exposure to SSRIs, especially during the first trimester.Among the potential environmental factors, hyperserotonemia during pregnancy and its effect on brain development could be playing a role in this prevalence raise. In the rodent model developed by Whitaker-Azmitia and colleagues, hyperserotonemia during fetal development results in a dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, affecting the amygdala as well as pro-social hormone oxytocin regulation. Dysfunction of the amygdala and abnormal oxytocin levels may underlie many clinical features of ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the most widely used class of antidepressants drugs, and they are not contraindicated during pregnancy.In adjusted logistic regression models, we found a 2-fold increased risk of ASD associated with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by the mother during the year before delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.3]), with the strongest effect associated with treatment during the first trimester (adjusted odds ratio, 3.8 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-7.8]).Although the number of children exposed prenatally to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this population was low, results suggest that exposure, especially during the first trimester, may modestly increase the risk of ASD.Together, these results indicate that administration of SSRIs during a sensitive period of brain development results in long-lasting alterations in NE-LC circuit function in adults and may be useful in understanding the etiology of pervasive developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.Although several studies have not confirmed an increased risk for adverse neurodevelopment, a recent study observed an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders in prenatally exposed offspring.Considering the important role of serotonin in central nervous system development, more studies are needed to assess the possible adverse effects on long-term neurodevelopment.","answer":"Greater risk for autism spectrum disorders has been reported among mothers that have used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy. However, others did not find an association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring. Also, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during pregnancy were associated with a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with autism spectrum disorders."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

dominated radio structures ( _ e.g. _ miley 1980 ) .such models require a confining medium to exist over hundreds of kpc , the scale lengths and pressures being comparable with those found in clusters of galaxies .an advantage of instigating a search in this manner is provided by the fact that a quasar will pinpoint the redshift of interest and through careful choice of filters facilitate the identification of associated galaxies by way of their colours .these reasons make it possible to build a sample of distant groups and clusters from a study of radio loud quasars ( rlqs ) , although care must be taken to understand the selection function . with reasonable estimates regarding the lifetime of the agn and its effect on the clusterthis can be achieved . in any casethe opportunity to study clusters and their constituents is not lost .a related benefit is that we may find and study small and compact groups at high redshift .current optical and x - ray methods will be insensitive to such low mass / luminosity systems and the environments of rlqs may offer the best method of finding significant numbers of these systems at high redshift for some time to come .the quasars used for this study are drawn from the molonglo quasar sample ( mqs , kapahi et al .1998 ) of low frequency selected radio loud quasars .this is a complete sample of 111 rlqs with s@xmath1 jy in a contiguous area of southern sky ( @xmath2 , but excluding the r.a .range @xmath3 - @xmath4 ) .    within the range @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7there are 30 mqs objects which have @xmath0 , 22 for which we have data .eight sources with these criteria were _ randomly _ excluded due to observing time restrictions .this sample has many merits .firstly it has a single selection criterion , that of low frequency radio luminosity .thus it does not attempt to \`\` match '' catalogues of what may be intrinsically different objects .secondly , of all objects in our chosen redshift range none are excluded based on optical or radio bias .the remaining objects can therefore be thought of as a _ representative _ sample .also , the low frequency selection avoids preferentially selecting core dominated objects , ie : those which may be of intrinsically lower luminosity but have doppler boosted emission due to their orientation to the line of sight .the mrq is thus useful as a \`\` complete and unbiased '' sample on which to study the environmental properties of rlqs .we have observed our objects in 2 or more filters which straddle the redshifted 4000  break in order to maximise the contrast for early type galaxies . in several cases we also have near infrared ( nir ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 filters .the telescopes used were the ctio 4 m , the eso 2.2 m and 3.6 m and the aat .previous investigators have sought to quantify the excess of objects around quasars , ( or radio galaxies , or any other object ) , by counting sources within a certain radius in a single filter ( 0.5 mpc in most cases ) .we initially analyse clustering around quasars with reference to such a measure , the galaxy - quasar spatial cross correlation amplitude , @xmath10 .a detailed derivation can be found in yee & green ( 1984 ) and longair & seldner ( 1979 ) .the results of applying this method to our data can be seen in figure 1 , as well as those for other investigators .our results confirm that the quasars occupy a variety of environments and show no evidence for evolution to a redshift of 1 .there are , however , reasons why these methods are not necessarily the most accurate to use at high redshift .firstly , they assume that the agn is at the centre of any ( roughly circular ) overdensity .as we progress to higher redshifts , clusters are less likely to be in relaxed spheroidal systems and may exhibit significant substructure which can extend further than 0.5 mpc from the quasar . secondly , the number density of objects at the magnitude levels of interest displays variation on the scale - lengths of distant clusters making it difficult to estimate the background to subtract from any overdensity .thirdly , even when an obvious overdensity is discovered , it may consist of objects which have the wrong colours to be galaxies at the redshift of the quasar ( see fig .2b ) . in this casethese statistical analyses will not only be wrong , they may bias the average result systematically and in doing so render any measure of the average properties of a sample incorrect .by choosing optical filters which straddle the 4000  break , we can select the passively evolving elliptical galaxies at the redshift of the quasar .figure 2 . shows the density of objects around three of our quasars separated according to colour .we can identify agglomerations as having the potential to be at the quasars redshift by using these sort of plots .further analysis looking at the colour dispersion or for a red sequence or using nir filters can then quantify accurately which galaxies belong to the cluster core and which do not .examples of these techniques are to be found in baker et al .( 2001 ) and bremer et al .( 2001 ) .because of the arguments regarding the formation of the radio lobes being dependent on a large scale medium , we would expect to see a correlation between the size of the source and the clustering around it .we see just such a correlation in figure 3 .our sample is separated into those sources with a radio size @xmath11 and those with @xmath12 .unresolved flat spectrum sources , ( @xmath13 ) , are rejected in order to prevent beamed sources with intrinsically lower luminosity from being included . the remaining sample of 19 steep spectrum objects is thus split approximately in half .if we loosely define our clusters as those with more than 10 associated core members , we see that five out of our six clusters are associated with smaller radio structures. we would nt expect to see a 1:1 relationship between size and clustering .the age of the source may have allowed it to expand despite a clustered environment , or conversely , perhaps we see a young source which is expanding unconfined .projection effects may also hide the true size of the source .we have found that rlqs exist in a variety of environments from the field through compact groups to rich clusters . in order to correctly quantify the environments of these sources ,multicolour information must be used .there is evidence for a radio size - environment relation with smaller sources located in richer systems . by selecting small , powerful rlqs we can efficiently create a sample of distant groups and clusters .we also have the ability to \`\` dial up '' clusters at a specific redshift by looking at agn .","answer":"we have carried out multi -

The UAVs are coordinated in a specific formation to collect data of the inspecting objects. The communication platform for data transmission is based on the Internet of things (IoT). In the proposed architecture, the UAV formation is established via angle-encoded particle swarm optimization to generate an inspecting path and redistribute it to each UAV where communication links are embedded with an IoT board for network and data processing capabilities. The data collected are transmitted in real time through the network to remote computational units. To detect potential damage or defects, an online image-processing technique is proposed and implemented based on histograms. Extensive simulation, experiments, and comparisons have been conducted to verify the validity and performance of the proposed system.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The challenge of aerial robotic contact-based inspection is the driving motivation of this paper. The problem is approached on both levels of control and path-planning by introducing algorithms and control laws that ensure optimal inspection through contact and controlled aerial robotic physical interaction. Regarding the flight and physical interaction stabilization, a hybrid model predictive control framework is proposed, based on which a typical quadrotor becomes capable of stable and active interaction, accurate trajectory tracking on environmental surfaces as well as force control. Convex optimization techniques enabled the explicit computation of such a controller which accounts for the dynamics in free-flight as well as during physical interaction, ensures the global stability of the hybrid system and provides optimal responses while respecting the physical limitations of the vehicle. Further augmentation of this scheme, allowed the incorporation of a last-resort obstacle avoidance mechanism at the control level. Relying on such a control law, a contact-based inspection planner was developed which computes the optimal route within a given set of inspection points while avoiding any obstacles or other no-fly zones on the environmental surface. Extensive experimental studies that included complex \\"aerial-writing\\" tasks, interaction with non-planar and textured surfaces, execution of multiple inspection operations and obstacle avoidance maneuvers, indicate the efficiency of the proposed methods and the potential capabilities of aerial robotic inspection through contact.[2]: In this paper, we consider the structure inspection problem using a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The influence of the wind on the UAV behavior and onboard energy limitations are important parameters that must be taken into account in the structure inspection problem. To tackle these problems, we derive three methods to inspect a structure. First, we develop a Zermelo-Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) method to compute the optimal route to inspect a simple virtual structure. Second, we derive a method that combines meshing techniques with the Zermelo-TSP method. In this approach, the inspection coordinates for the interest points are obtained automatically by means of a meshing algorithm, then, the Zermelo-TSP method is used to compute the time-optimal route to inspect all the interest points in minimal time. Finally, we derive a method for structure inspection based on the Zermelo-Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). These methods have been validated in a simulated environment.[3]: A concept for a multicopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) automatically performing inspection flights at a wind turbine is proposed. Key aspects of the concept are (1) a priori 3D mapping of the plant and (2) spline-based flight path planning as well as (3) a collision avoidance and distance control system. A quadrotor UAV prototype and its dynamical model are presented. Validation of the different aspects is carried out in simulation and partially in indoor tests using Robot Operating System (ROS). Existence of a 3D map is an essential precondition for path planning and collision-free flight. A brief initial flight preceding the actual inspection with a 2D LiDAR sensor yields a point cloud of the plant which is used for 3D mapping. This map is efficiently generated and represented using octrees, a hierarchical data structure that can be used for 3D maps. Subsequently a smooth and collision-free flight path is generated using splines. For redundancy's sake navigation tasks not only rely on GPS but also on the LiDAR sensor mentioned before. The sensor allows for continuous estimation of the distance between multicopter and wind turbine. A distance control algorithm guarantees collision-free flight.[4]: Within this paper, a new fast algorithm that provides efficient solutions to the problem of inspection path planning for complex 3D structures is presented. The algorithm assumes a triangular mesh representation of the structure and employs an alternating two-step optimization paradigm to find good viewpoints that together provide full coverage and a connecting path that has low cost. In every iteration, the viewpoints are chosen such that the connection cost is reduced and, subsequently, the tour is optimized. Vehicle and sensor limitations are respected within both steps. Sample implementations are provided for rotorcraft and fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems. The resulting algorithm characteristics are evaluated using simulation studies as well as multiple real-world experimental test-cases with both vehicle types.","answer":"For automatic inspection, sophisticated systems featured path planning and path-following control algorithms have been proposed. In [1] , an aerial robotic system for the contact-based surface inspection has been introduced using not only optimal trajectory tracking but also accurate force control techniques. In [4] , an iterative viewpoint re-sampling path planning algorithm was proposed for the inspection of complex 3D structures. The inspection of outdoor structures under windy conditions was addressed in [2] by using the viewpoint selection and optimal time route algorithms. Besides, an UAV-based inspection system for wind turbines was developed in [3] with the capability of creating smooth and collision-free flight paths based on the data recorded from LIDAR sensors.

And is it possible to predict the characteristics of future music genres? In order to answer these questions, we produced a hand-crafted dataset with the intent to put together features about style, psychology, sociology and typology, annotated by music genre and indexed by time and decade. We collected a list of popular genres by decade from Wikipedia and scored music genres based on Wikipedia descriptions. Using statistical and machine learning techniques, we find trends in the musical preferences and use time series forecasting to evaluate the prediction of future music genres.Motivation, Background and Related WorkUntil recent times, the research in popular music was mostly bound to a non-computational approach BIBREF0 but the availability of new data, models and algorithms helped the rise of new research trends. Computational analysis of music structure BIBREF1 is focused on parsing and annotate patters in music files; computational music generation BIBREF2 trains systems able to generate songs with specific music styles; computational sociology of music analyzes databases annotated with metadata such as tempo, key, BPMs and similar (generally referred to as sonic features); even psychology of music use data to find new models.Recent papers in computational sociology investigated novelty in popular music, finding that artists who are highly culturally and geographically connected are more likely to create novel songs, especially when they span multiple genres, are women, or are in the early stages of their careers BIBREF3. Using the position in Billboard charts and the sonic features of more than 20K songs, it has been demonstrated that the songs exhibiting some degree of optimal differentiation in novelty are more likely to rise to the top of the charts BIBREF4. These findings offer very interesting perspectives on how popular culture impacts the competition of novel genres in cultural markets. Another problem addressed in this research field is the distinction between what is popular and what is significative to a musical context BIBREF5. Using a user-generated set of tags collected through an online music platform, it has been possible to compute a set of metrics, such as novelty, burst or duration, from a co-occurrence tag network relative to music albums, in order to find the tags that propagate more and the albums having a significative impact. Combining sonic features and topic extraction techniques from approximately 17K tracks, scholars demonstrate quantitative trends in harmonic and timbral properties that brought changes in music sound around 1964, 1983 and 1991 BIBREF6. Beside these research fields, there is a trend in the psychology of music that studies how the musical preferences are reflected in the dimensions of personality BIBREF7. From this kind of research emerged the MUSIC model BIBREF8, which found that genre preferences can be decomposed into five factors: Mellow (relaxed, slow, and romantic), Unpretentious, (easy, soft, well-known), Sophisticated (complex, intelligent or avant-garde), Intense (loud, aggressive, and tense) and Contemporary (catchy, rhythmic or danceable).Is it possible to find trends in the characteristics of the genres? And is it possible to predict the characteristics of future genres? To answer these questions, we produced a hand-crafted dataset with the intent to put together MUSIC, style and sonic features, annotated by music genre and indexed by time and decade. To do so, we collected a list of popular music genres by decade from Wikipedia and instructed annotators to score them. The paper is structured as follows: In section SECREF2 we provide a brief history of popular music, in section SECREF3 we describe the dataset and in section SECREF4 we provide the results of the experiments. In the end we draw some conclusions.Data DescriptionFrom the description of music genres provided above emerges that there is a limited number of super-genres and derivation lines BIBREF19, BIBREF20, as shown in figure FIGREF1.From a computational perspective, genres are classes and, although can be treated by machine learning algorithms, they do not include information about the relations between them. In order to formalize the relations between genres for computing purposes, we define a continuous genre scale from the most experimental and introverted super-genre to the most euphoric and inclusive one. We selected from Wikipedia the 77 genres that we mentioned in bold in the previous paragraph and asked to two independent raters to read the Wikipedia pages of the genres, listen to samples or artists of the genres (if they did not know already) and then annotate the following dimensions:genre features: genre scale (a score between 0 and 1 where 0=downtempo/industrial, 0.1=metal, 0.15=garage/punk/hardcore, 0.2=rock, 0.25=pop rock, 0.3=blues, 0.4=country, 0.5=pop/traditional, 0.55=gospel, 0.6=jazz, 0.65=latin, 0.7=RnB/soul/funk, 0.75=reggae/jamaican, 0.8=rap, 0.85=DnB, 0.9=electro/house, 0.95=EDM, 1=techno/trance) and category of the super-genre (as defined in figure FIGREF1) and influence variety 0.1=influence only from the same super-genre, 1=influences from all the supergenresperceived acoustic features: sound (0=acoustic, 0.35=amplified, 0.65=sampled/manipulated, 1=synthetic), vocal melody (1=melodic vocals, 0=rhythmical vocals/spoken words), vocal scream (1=screaming, 0=soft singing), vocal emotional (1=emotional vocals, 0=monotone vocals), virtuous (0.5=normal, 0=not technical at all, 1=very technical); richbass 1=the bass is loud and clear, 0=there is no bass sound; offbeat 1=the genre has a strong offbeat, 0=the genre has not offbeattime: decade (classes between 1900s and 2010s) and year representative of the time when the genre became meainstreamplace features: origin place 0=Australia, 0.025=west USA, 0.05=south USA, 0.075=north/east USA, 0.1=UK, 0.2=jamaica, 0.3=carribean, 0.4=latin america, 0.5=africa, 0.6=south EU, 0.65=north/east EU, 0.7=middle east, 0.8=India, 0.9=China/south asia, 1=Korea/north asia; place urban (0=the origin place is rural, 1=the origin place is urban), place poor (0=the origin place is poor, 1=the origin place is rich)media features: media mainstream (0=independent media, 1=mainstream media, 0.5=both), media live 0=sell recorded music, 1=sell live performance)emotion features: joy/sad (1=joy, 0=sad), anticipation/surprise (1=anticipation or already known, 0=surprise), anger/calm (1=anger, 0=calm).style features: novelty 0=derivative, 0.5=normal, 1=totally new characteristics and type retro 1=the genre is a revival, 0.5=normal, 0=the genre is not a revival, lyrics love/explicit 0.5=normal, 1=love lyrics, 0=explicit lyrics, style upbeat 1=extroverted and danceable, 0=introverted and depressive, style instrumental 1=totally instrumental, 0=totally singed, style eclecticism 1=includes many styles, 0=has a stereotypical style, style longsongs 0.5=radio format (3.30 minutes), 1=more than 6 minutes by average, 0=less than 1 minute by average; largebands 1=bands of 10 or more people, 0.1=just one musician; subculture 1=the audience one subculture or more, 0=the audience is the main culture; hedonism 1=the genre promotes hedonism, 0=the genre does not promote hedonism; protest 1=the genre promotes protest, 0=the genere does not promote protest; onlyblack 1=genere produced only by black communities, 0=genre produced only by white communities; ; 44beat 1=the genre has 4/4 beat, 0=the genre has other types of measures; outcasts 1=the audience is poor people, 0=the audience is rich people; dancing 1=the genre is for dancing, 0=the genre is for home listening; drugs 1=the audience use drugs, 0=the audience do not use drugsMUSIC features: mellow (1=slow and romantic, 0=fast and furious), sophisticated (1=culturally complex, 0=easy to understand), intense (1=aggressive and loud, 0=soft and relaxing), contemporary (1=rhythmical and catchy, 0=not rhythmical and old-fashioned), uncomplicated (1=simple and well-known, 0=strange and disgustive)We computed the agreement between the two annotators using Cronbach's alpha statistics BIBREF21. The average between all features is alpha =0.793, which is good. Among the most agreed features there are genre, place, sound and MUSIC features. In particular, the genre scale got an excellent alpha =0.957, meaning that the genre scale is a reliable measure. In the final annotation all the divergences between the two annotators were agreed upon and the scores were averaged or corrected accordingly. The final dataset is available to the scientific community.ExperimentsWhat are the tendencies that confirm or disconfirm previous findings? We noticed very interesting remarks just from the distributions of the features, reported in figure FIGREF11.We can see that most of the popular music genres have a novelty score between 0.5 and 0.65, which is medium-high. This confirms the findings of previous work about the optimal level of innovation and acceptance. It is interesting to note that almost all the popular genres come from an urban context, where the connections between communities are more likely to create innovations. Moreover, we can see that the distribution of mainstream media is bi-modal: this means that an important percentage of genres are popularized by means of underground or new media. This happened many times in music history, from the the free radios to the web of the user-generated content. Crucially, popular music genres strongly tend to be perceived as technically virtuous.Why the sound changed from acoustic to synthetic during the last century? To answer this question we used a correlation analysis with the sound feature as target. It emerged that the change towards sampled and synthetic sound is correlated to dancing, to intensity/aggressiveness, to a larger drug usage and to a large variety of infleunces, while it is negatively correlated to large bands and mellow tones. In summary a more synthetic sound allowed a more intense and danceable music, reducing the number of musicians (in other words reducing costs for the industry).How the music taste of the audience of popular music changed in the last century? The trend lines of the MUSIC model features, reported in figure FIGREF12, reveal that audiences wanted products more and more contemporary, intense and a little bit novel or sophisticated, but less and less mellow and (surprisingly) unpretentious. In other words, the audiences of popular music are getting more demanding as the quality and variety of the music products increases.Is it possible to predict future genres by means of the genre scale? To answer this question we used time series forecasting. In particular, we exploited all the features in the years from 1900 to 2010 to train a predictive model of the scores from 2011 to 2018. As the year of the genre label is arbitrary, predicted scores and labels can be not aligned, thus MAE or RSME are not suitable evaluation metrics. As evaluation metric we defined average accuracy as a=frac{sum count(|l-h|<0.1)}{count(t)} , where the label (l) and the prediction (h) can be anywhere within the year serie (t). Table TABREF13, shows the results of the prediction of genre scale for the years 2011 to 2018 with different algorithms: linear regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), multi layer perceptron (MPL), nearest neighbors (IBk), and a meta classifier (stacking) with SVM+MLP+IBk.The results reveal that the forecasting of music genres is a non-linear problem, that IBk predicts the closest sequence to the annotated one and that a meta classifier with nearest neighborsBIBREF22 is the most accurate in the prediction. Deep Learning algorithms does not perform well in this case because the dataset is not large enough. Last remark: feature reduction (from 41 to 14) does not affect the results obtained with IBk and meta classifiers, indicating that there is no curse of dimensionality.Conclusion Acknowledgments and FutureWe annotated and presented a new dataset for the computational analysis of popular music. Our preliminary studies confirm previous findings (there is an optimal level of novelty to become popular and this is more likely to happen in urban contexts) and reveal that audiences tend to like contemporary and intense music experiences. We also performed a back test for the prediction of future music genres in a time series, that turned out to be a non-linear problem. For the future we would like to update the corpus with more features about audience types and commercial success. This work has also been inspired by Music Map.Fig. 1.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Some companies have built their very businesses on their ability to collect, analyze, and act on data.Literature Review:","answer":"Research trends for diagnosis standards 5.7.1 Process mining and process verification. Process mining aims to diagnose business processes by mining event logs to understand process, control, data, organizational and social structures. This allows analysts to compare the real behavior of an information system or its users with the intended or expected behavior (van der Aalst). In recent years, the focus has shifted from mere process mining to verification of the processes mined. Earlier work on process mining primarily focused on process discovery, by automatically constructing models of knowledge extracted from event logs  . However, in view of recent focus on good corporate governance, there is a need to also spot and pre-empt unexpected behavior observed in the event logs. 5.7.2 Quality of service for business processes. The \\"quality of service (QoS)\\" in BPM is different from that of computer networking. According to BIB001 , the management of quality of service (QoS) metrics such as products or services to be delivered, deadlines, quality of products, and cost of services directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. When services or products are created or managed using workflows or web processes, the underlying workflow engine must accept the specifications and be able to estimate, monitor, and control the QoS rendered to customers. Cardoso et al. presented a predictive QoS model that makes it possible to automatically compute the QoS for workflows based on atomic task QoS attributes. 5.7.3 Business analytics. From a business viewpoint, business analytics BIB002 underscores the need for the diagnosis stage of the BPM life cycle. In their paper, Davenport and Harris observe that successful companies are often those which keep a history of their data (e.g. business process, customer relationship, customer preferences, etc.), analyze them and act on them. In the authors' view, diagnosis urgently needs diagnostic formalisms and methodologies, i.e. business analytics born out of process mining, process verification, and QoS metrics."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between 8q24 (rs13281615 and rs6983267) polymorphism and BC risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science and the Cochrane Library up to August 13, 2015 for relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of associations. Twenty-six studies published from 2008 to 2014, with a total of 52,683 cases and 64,672 controls, were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that there was significant association between 8q24 rs13281615 polymorphism and BC risk in any genetic model. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the effects remained in Asians and Caucasians. However, no genetic models reached statistical association in Africans. There was no association in any genetic model in rs6983267. This meta-analysis suggests that 8q24 rs13281615 polymorphism is a risk factor for susceptibility to BC in Asians, Caucasians and in overall population, While, there was no association in Africans.

Noise presents a major challenge for the robust function of natural and engineered cellular networks. Past studies have analyzed how noise is regulated at the intracellular level. Cell–cell communication, however, may provide a complementary strategy to achieve robust gene expression by enabling the coupling of a cell with its environment and other cells. To gain insight into this issue, we have examined noise regulation by quorum sensing( QS), a mechanism by which many bacteria communicate through production and sensing of small diffusible signals. Using a stochastic model, we analyze a minimal QS motif in Gram-negative bacteria. Our analysis shows that diffusion of the QS signal, together with fast turnover of its transcriptional regulator, attenuates low-frequency components of extrinsic noise. We term this unique mechanism “diffusional dissipation” to emphasize the importance of fast signal turnover( or dissipation) by diffusion. We further show that this noise attenuation is a property of a more generic regulatory motif, of which QS is an implementation. Our results suggest that, in a QS system, an unstable transcriptional regulator may be favored for regulating expression of costly proteins that generate public goods.Introduction:Cellular processes are subject to random fluctuations( or noise) in quantities of interacting molecules. Cells may take advantage of noise to achieve diverse functions[1],[2]. In a mechanism called stochastic resonance, noise may improve detection of weak periodic input signals[3], whereas stochastic focusing may turn a gradual response into a threshold-like response[4]. Also, noise is often exploited to initiate cell differentiation or phenotypic switching. A classical example is the lysis-lysogeny decision in phage λ development, where noise is necessary to trigger the decision[5]. Similarly, noise is implicated in the competence development of Bacillus subtilis[6]. However, noise often presents a major challenge for reliable cellular function. To this end, cells use specific biochemical networks or motifs to minimize deleterious effects of noise[1],[7]. For instance, reducing translation burst rates( number of proteins synthesized per transcript) attenuates noise in gene expression[8]. Based on this observation, it has been argued that evolution tends to favor noise reduction in essential genes as they appear to have smaller burst rates compared with non-essential genes in yeast[9]. Also, several regulatory motifs have been found to be effective in reducing noise. Negative feedback reduces noise by shifting the noise spectrum to a higher frequency region[10]–[12]. Ultrasensitive switches and feedforward loops are able to attenuate noise in input signals[13],[14]. These noise regulation mechanisms all operate at the intracellular level. At the population level, cell–cell communication may play an important role in achieving robust gene expression dynamics. For example, it has been shown to be important for the proper function of many rhythmic processes in physiology[15],[16]. Intuitively, intracellular noise, which primarily originates from the stochastic nature of chemical reactions of interacting species and fluctuations in cellular conditions, may be reduced when a population of cells carries out their function cooperatively. In bacteria, cell–cell communication can be established by quorum sensing( QS), a mechanism by which many bacteria broadcast and sense their density[17]–[19]. A canonical QS system is the lux system from the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri( Figure 1A). This system consists of two genes encoding proteins LuxI and LuxR. LuxI is an AHL( acyl homoserine lactone) synthase; LuxR is a transcriptional regulator activated by the AHL. The AHL signal is produced inside the cell but freely diffuses across the cell membrane into the environment: therefore, the AHL concentration is low at a low cell density. As the cell density increases, the signal accumulates in the environment and inside the cell. At sufficiently high concentrations, AHL can bind to and activate LuxR, which will then activate downstream genes. Lux-type QS systems are common in gram negative bacteria[18],[20], and they are critical for regulating diverse physiological functions, such as bioluminescence, biofilm formation, and bacterial pathogenicity[18],[20],[21]. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to analyze noise regulation in QS-mediated gene expression. Recently, stochastic simulations of QS-mediated dynamics have been carried out for Vibrio fischeri[22] and Agrobacterium tumefaciens[23]. These studies have provided insights into dynamics of QS-regulated gene expression coupled with positive feedback regulation and population dynamics. In contrast, however, we have focused on a minimal QS motif without feedback regulation, in order to dissect the contribution of QS per se to noise regulation. Also, it should be noted that not all QS systems have feedback regulation. For instance, Ravn et al identified that production of 3-Oxo-hexanoyl-homoserin lactone( OHHL, one type of AHL signal) in Serratia proteamaculans( SprI/R system) and Erwinia carotovora( CarI/R or ExpI/R system; both CarI and ExpI produce OHHL) is approximately constitutive[24]. We find that QS can serve as an effective noise-reduction mechanism. In particular, diffusion of the QS signal and fast decay of the transcriptional regulator can reduce noise by synergistically attenuating low-frequency components of extrinsic noise. We term this noise reduction mechanism “diffusional dissipation, ” as its defining feature is fast dissipation of signal molecules through diffusion. Further analysis indicates that this noise attenuation is the result of a more generic regulatory motif—bimolecular interaction—of which QS is an implementation. Our results further suggest a connection between QS-regulated functions and the decay of the QS transcriptional regulator. An unstable transcriptional regulator may be favored for regulating expression of costly proteins that generate public goods, as QS-mediated noise reduction in the target protein can increase the average population fitness, thus providing a selection advantage.Discussion:Extensive studies have been carried out to define characteristics of noise generation[8],[26],[32]–[36], propagation[13],[25],[27],[37], and regulation( negative feedback[10]–[12], ultrasensitivity[13], and feedforward loop[14]). Complementary to those mechanisms that operate at the intracellular level, quorum sensing may serve as an additional layer of control for regulating robust cell behavior. On one hand, it may facilitate synchronization of complex dynamics generated by otherwise independent circuits in a population of cells[38]–[40], or enable generation of coherent population dynamics by integration of cell populations[41]–[44]. On the other, it may directly modulate the noise characteristics in individual cells. To this end, Cox et al analyzed stochastic dynamics of QS in V. fischeri in two aspects: the role of positive feedback and the modulation of noise frequencies by reversible reactions[22]. By analyzing a minimal QS motif without feedback regulation, our study aims to expose the contribution to noise reduction by communication per se. To simplify analysis, we focus on noise reduction in the complex( C), which, upon dimerization, leads to activation of downstream genes. We find that fast diffusion and fast R decay can synergistically reduce the extrinsic noise in C but has relatively little impact on its intrinsic noise. The noise reduction is achieved by decreasing the gain of low-frequency fluctuations in the extrinsic noise. Importantly, our analysis reveals that QS is a unique mechanism to attenuate extrinsic noise, which we call diffusional dissipation to underscore the importance of the signal and the R protein turnover. The term “diffusional” reflects fast signal turnover achieved by diffusion, a defining feature of AHL-based QS. Moreover, our analysis suggests that QS is an implementation of a more generic regulatory motif( Figure 4) in which the fast dissipation of two species( A and R), which together form a heterodimer( C), reduces extrinsic noise by suppressing low frequency components( Text S1); the signal diffusion in QS is a specific implementation to increase effective signal dissipation. The importance of A and R turnover also explains the counterintuitive observation that noise reduction by multiple cells( coupled by QS) is similar to that by a single cell( Figure S2). Although the coupling of a cell with its environment via diffusion effectively speeds up Ai turnover, further coupling with other cells does not significantly affect turnover of either Ai or R. Also, although coupling among multiple cells reduces noise of extracellular AHL( Ae) by increasing the total number of molecules, this reduction is unlikely to impact downstream gene expression, as the noise in Ae is already much smaller than that in other species even for a single cell( Figure S2). How does the noise reduction in C affect downstream gene expression? In general, unbranched gene expression machinery( e. g., linear cascade) works as a low-pass filter whose critical frequency is largely determined by the decay rate constant of the output protein[11],[45]. Thus, high-frequency fluctuations in C will be filtered out by downstream genes. This makes modulation of low-frequency fluctuations in C particularly relevant. In fact, only reduction in low-frequency fluctuations can effectively affect downstream gene expression. Also, given that dimerization of C confers cooperativity to the downstream gene expression, fluctuation of C around the intermediate level could have a significant effect on gene expression[27]. As extrinsic noise often dominates total noise in gene expression[25],[26], noise reduction in C can thus effectively attenuate noise in downstream gene expression. In a lux-type QS system, an R protein is often highly unstable in the absence of its cognate signal[29]–[31]. Fast R protein turnover may prevent premature activation of QS genes[46] or improve fidelity in recognizing the cognate signal( Smith, Song, and You, Signal discrimination by differential regulation of protein stability in quorum sensing, submitted). Our results suggest yet another scenario: this apparently wasteful process may facilitate reduction of extrinsic noise in the QS-regulated gene expression. However, under what conditions is reduction of extrinsic noise beneficial to cells? We note that QS often controls functions costly to individual but beneficial to the population. Examples include secretion of exoenzymes[47]–[49], production of antibiotics and exotoxins[18],[21], as well as bioluminescence[50]. In these scenarios, the benefit of the effector to an individual cell is determined by its total level in the population, whereas its cost to each cell solely depends on its expression rate in the cell. Therefore, noise in effector expression can lead to significant variations in the division rates of individual cells. If the cost of the effector increases with its level more than linearly, mathematical analysis indicates that reduction in the effector noise can increase the average fitness of the population( Figure S6). That is, in cooperative production of a common good, noise attenuation by QS might provide an intrinsic mechanism to resist decline of average population fitness and invasion of cheaters. In contrast, not all QS-regulated functions may benefit from noise reduction. However, as signal diffusion is essential for communication, noise reduction originating from fast turnover of the signal appears to be an indivisible side effect of QS systems. Again, it is worth emphasizing the noise modulation by the stability of R proteins. It would be interesting to explore a potential connection between the stability of R proteins and QS-regulated functions in the context of noise regulation.","answer":"Quorum sensing ( QS ) is a mechanism by which many bacteria regulate gene expression via the synthesis and detection of small , diffusible signals .

It can either lock or encrypt the target devices, and victims are forced to pay ransoms to restore their data. Hence, the prompt detection of such attacks has a priority in comparison to other malicious threats. Previous works on Android malware detection mainly focused on Machine Learning-oriented approaches that were tailored to identifying malware families, without a clear focus on ransomware. More specifically, such approaches resorted to complex information types such as permissions, user-implemented API calls, and native calls. However, this led to significant drawbacks concerning complexity, resilience against obfuscation, and explainability. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose and discuss learning-based detection strategies that rely on System API information. These techniques leverage the fact that ransomware attacks heavily resort to System API to perform their actions, and allow distinguishing between generic malware, ransomware and goodware. We tested three different ways of employing System API information, i.e., through packages, classes, and methods, and we compared their performances to other, more complex state-of-the-art approaches. The attained results showed that systems based on System API could detect ransomware and generic malware with very good accuracy, comparable to systems that employed more complex information. Moreover, the proposed systems could accurately detect novel samples in the wild and showed resilience against static obfuscation attempts. Finally, to guarantee early on-device detection, we developed and released on the Android platform a complete ransomware and malware detector (R-PackDroid) that employed one of the methodologies proposed in this paper.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The number of malicious Android apps is increasing rapidly. Android malware can damage or alter other files or settings, install additional applications, and so on. To determine such behaviors, a security analyst can significantly benefit from identifying the family to which an Android malware belongs rather than only detecting if an app is malicious. Techniques for detecting Android malware, and determining their families, lack the ability to handle certain obfuscations that aim to thwart detection. Moreover, some prior techniques face scalability issues, preventing them from detecting malware in a timely manner. To address these challenges, we present a novel machine-learning-based Android malware detection and family identification approach, RevealDroid, that operates without the need to perform complex program analyses or to extract large sets of features. Specifically, our selected features leverage categorized Android API usage, reflection-based features, and features from native binaries of apps. We assess RevealDroid for accuracy, efficiency, and obfuscation resilience using a large dataset consisting of more than 54,000 malicious and benign apps. Our experiments show that RevealDroid achieves an accuracy of 98 in detection of malware and an accuracy of 95 in determination of their families. We further demonstrate RevealDroid’s superiority against state-of-the-art approaches.","answer":"proposed RevealDroid , a static system for detecting Android malware samples and classifying them in families.

Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrieval-based methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.Related WorkWe discuss two classes of related work: retrieval-based web question-answering (simple reasoning with large scale KB) and science question-answering (complex reasoning with small KB).Tuple Inference SolverWe first describe the tuples used by our solver. We define a tuple as (subject; predicate; objects) with zero or more objects. We refer to the subject, predicate, and objects as the fields of the tuple.Tuple KBWe use the text corpora (S) from BIBREF6 aristo2016:combining to build our tuple KB. For each test set, we use the corresponding training questions Q_mathit {tr} to retrieve domain-relevant sentences from S. Specifically, for each multiple-choice question (q,A) in Q_mathit {tr} and each choice a in A , we use all non-stopword tokens in q and a as an ElasticSearch query against S. We take the top 200 hits, run Open IE v4, and aggregate the resulting tuples over all a in A and over all questions in Q_mathit {tr} to create the tuple KB (T).Tuple SelectionGiven a multiple-choice question qa with question text q and answer choices A= lbrace a_irbrace  , we select the most relevant tuples from T and S as follows.Selecting from Tuple KB: We use an inverted index to find the 1,000 tuples that have the most overlapping tokens with question tokens tok(qa). . We also filter out any tuples that overlap only with tok(q) as they do not support any answer. We compute the normalized TF-IDF score treating the question, q as a query and each tuple, t as a document: &textit {tf}(x, q)=1; textmd {if x} in q ; textit {idf}(x) = log(1 + N/n_x) &textit {tf-idf}(t, q)=sum _{x in tcap q} idf(x)  where N is the number of tuples in the KB and n_x are the number of tuples containing x . We normalize the tf-idf score by the number of tokens in t and q . We finally take the 50 top-scoring tuples T_{qa} .On-the-fly tuples from text: To handle questions from new domains not covered by the training set, we extract additional tuples on the fly from S (similar to BIBREF17 knowlhunting). We perform the same ElasticSearch query described earlier for building T. We ignore sentences that cover none or all answer choices as they are not discriminative. We also ignore long sentences ( > 300 characters) and sentences with negation as they tend to lead to noisy inference. We then run Open IE on these sentences and re-score the resulting tuples using the Jaccard score due to the lossy nature of Open IE, and finally take the 50 top-scoring tuples T^{prime }_{qa} .Support Graph SearchSimilar to TableILP, we view the QA task as searching for a graph that best connects the terms in the question (qterms) with an answer choice via the knowledge; see Figure 1 for a simple illustrative example. Unlike standard alignment models used for tasks such as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) BIBREF18 , however, we must score alignments between a set T_{qa} cup T^{prime }_{qa} of structured tuples and a (potentially multi-sentence) multiple-choice question qa .The qterms, answer choices, and tuples fields form the set of possible vertices, mathcal {V} , of the support graph. Edges connecting qterms to tuple fields and tuple fields to answer choices form the set of possible edges, mathcal {E} . The support graph, G(V, E) , is a subgraph of mathcal {G}(mathcal {V}, mathcal {E}) where V and E denote “active” nodes and edges, resp. We define the desired behavior of an optimal support graph via an ILP model as follows.Similar to TableILP, we score the support graph based on the weight of the active nodes and edges. Each edge e(t, h) is weighted based on a word-overlap score. While TableILP used WordNet BIBREF19 paths to compute the weight, this measure results in unreliable scores when faced with longer phrases found in Open IE tuples.Compared to a curated KB, it is easy to find Open IE tuples that match irrelevant parts of the questions. To mitigate this issue, we improve the scoring of qterms in our ILP objective to focus on important terms. Since the later terms in a question tend to provide the most critical information, we scale qterm coefficients based on their position. Also, qterms that appear in almost all of the selected tuples tend not to be discriminative as any tuple would support such a qterm. Hence we scale the coefficients by the inverse frequency of the tokens in the selected tuples.Since Open IE tuples do not come with schema and join rules, we can define a substantially simpler model compared to TableILP. This reduces the reasoning capability but also eliminates the reliance on hand-authored join rules and regular expressions used in TableILP. We discovered (see empirical evaluation) that this simple model can achieve the same score as TableILP on the Regents test (target test set used by TableILP) and generalizes better to different grade levels.We define active vertices and edges using ILP constraints: an active edge must connect two active vertices and an active vertex must have at least one active edge. To avoid positive edge coefficients in the objective function resulting in spurious edges in the support graph, we limit the number of active edges from an active tuple, question choice, tuple fields, and qterms (first group of constraints in Table 1 ). Our model is also capable of using multiple tuples to support different parts of the question as illustrated in Figure 1 . To avoid spurious tuples that only connect with the question (or choice) or ignore the relation being expressed in the tuple, we add constraints that require each tuple to connect a qterm with an answer choice (second group of constraints in Table 1 ).We also define new constraints based on the Open IE tuple structure. Since an Open IE tuple expresses a fact about the tuple's subject, we require the subject to be active in the support graph. To avoid issues such as (Planet; orbit; Sun) matching the sample question in the introduction (“Which object ldots  orbits around a planet”), we also add an ordering constraint (third group in Table 1 ).Its worth mentioning that TupleInf only combines parallel evidence i.e. each tuple must connect words in the question to the answer choice. For reliable multi-hop reasoning using OpenIE tuples, we can add inter-tuple connections to the support graph search, controlled by a small number of rules over the OpenIE predicates. Learning such rules for the Science domain is an open problem and potential avenue of future work.ExperimentsComparing our method with two state-of-the-art systems for 4th and 8th grade science exams, we demonstrate that (a) TupleInf with only automatically extracted tuples significantly outperforms TableILP with its original curated knowledge as well as with additional tuples, and (b) TupleInf's complementary approach to IR leads to an improved ensemble. Numbers in bold indicate statistical significance based on the Binomial exact test BIBREF20 at p=0.05 .We consider two question sets. (1) 4th Grade set (1220 train, 1304 test) is a 10x larger superset of the NY Regents questions BIBREF6 , and includes professionally written licensed questions. (2) 8th Grade set (293 train, 282 test) contains 8th grade questions from various states.We consider two knowledge sources. The Sentence corpus (S) consists of domain-targeted ~ 80K sentences and 280 GB of plain text extracted from web pages used by BIBREF6 aristo2016:combining. This corpus is used by the IR solver and also used to create the tuple KB T and on-the-fly tuples T^{prime }_{qa} . Additionally, TableILP uses sim  70 Curated tables (C) designed for 4th grade NY Regents exams.We compare TupleInf with two state-of-the-art baselines. IR is a simple yet powerful information-retrieval baseline BIBREF6 that selects the answer option with the best matching sentence in a corpus. TableILP is the state-of-the-art structured inference baseline BIBREF9 developed for science questions.Error AnalysisWe describe four classes of failures that we observed, and the future work they suggest.Missing Important Words: Which material will spread out to completely fill a larger container? (A)air (B)ice (C)sand (D)waterIn this question, we have tuples that support water will spread out and fill a larger container but miss the critical word “completely”. An approach capable of detecting salient question words could help avoid that.Lossy IE: Which action is the best method to separate a mixture of salt and water? ...The IR solver correctly answers this question by using the sentence: Separate the salt and water mixture by evaporating the water. However, TupleInf is not able to answer this question as Open IE is unable to extract tuples from this imperative sentence. While the additional structure from Open IE is useful for more robust matching, converting sentences to Open IE tuples may lose important bits of information.Bad Alignment: Which of the following gases is necessary for humans to breathe in order to live?(A) Oxygen(B) Carbon dioxide(C) Helium(D) Water vaporTupleInf returns “Carbon dioxide” as the answer because of the tuple (humans; breathe out; carbon dioxide). The chunk “to breathe” in the question has a high alignment score to the “breathe out” relation in the tuple even though they have completely different meanings. Improving the phrase alignment can mitigate this issue.Out of scope: Deer live in forest for shelter. If the forest was cut down, which situation would most likely happen?...Such questions that require modeling a state presented in the question and reasoning over the state are out of scope of our solver.ConclusionWe presented a new QA system, TupleInf, that can reason over a large, potentially noisy tuple KB to answer complex questions. Our results show that TupleInf is a new state-of-the-art structured solver for elementary-level science that does not rely on curated knowledge and generalizes to higher grades. Errors due to lossy IE and misalignments suggest future work in incorporating context and distributional measures.Appendix: ILP Model DetailsTo build the ILP model, we first need to get the questions terms (qterm) from the question by chunking the question using an in-house chunker based on the postagger from FACTORIE. Experiment DetailsWe use the SCIP ILP optimization engine BIBREF21 to optimize our ILP model. To get the score for each answer choice a_i , we force the active variable for that choice x_{a_i} to be one and use the objective function value of the ILP model as the score. For evaluations, we use a 2-core 2.5 GHz Amazon EC2 linux machine with 16 GB RAM. To evaluate TableILP and TupleInf on curated tables and tuples, we converted them into the expected format of each solver as follows.Using curated tables with TupleInfFor each question, we select the 7 best matching tables using the tf-idf score of the table w.r.t. the question tokens and top 20 rows from each table using the Jaccard similarity of the row with the question. (same as BIBREF9 tableilp2016). We then convert the table rows into the tuple structure using the relations defined by TableILP. For every pair of cells connected by a relation, we create a tuple with the two cells as the subject and primary object with the relation as the predicate. The other cells of the table are used as additional objects to provide context to the solver. We pick top-scoring 50 tuples using the Jaccard score.Using Open IE tuples with TableILPWe create an additional table in TableILP with all the tuples in T . Since TableILP uses fixed-length (subject; predicate; object) triples, we need to map tuples with multiple objects to this format. For each object, O_i in the input Open IE tuple (S; P; O_1; O_2 ldots ) , we add a triple (S; P; O_i) to this table.Figure 1: An example support graph linking a question (top), two tuples from the KB (colored) and an answer option (nitrogen).Table 2: TUPLEINF is significantly better at structured reasoning than TABLEILP.9Table 1: High-level ILP constraints; we report results for ~w = (2, 4, 4, 4, 2); the model can be improved with more careful parameter selectionTable 3: TUPLEINF is complementarity to IR, resulting in a strong ensembleQuestion: What was the textual source to which OpenIE was applied?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"domain-targeted ~ 80K sentences and 280 GB of plain text extracted from web pages used by BIBREF6 aristo2016:combining\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"We consider two knowledge sources.

Five hundred and twenty-four patients were younger than 65 years (YG), and 96 patients were 65 years or older (EG). The following parameters were considered in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation: presence, duration, and severity of GERD symptoms, presence of a hiatal hernia, manometric and 24 hour pH-monitoring data, duration of operation, incidence of complications and length of hospital stay.(RESULTS) Elderly patients more often had atypical symptoms of GERD and at manometric evaluation had a higher rate of impaired esophageal peristalsis in comparison with younger patients. The duration of the operation was similar between the two groups. The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications was low and the difference was not statistically significant between the two groups. An excellent outcome was observed in 93.0% of young patients and in 88.9% of elderly patients (p = NS).Question:Is the advanced age a contraindication to GERD laparoscopic surgery?Answer:","answer":"NO"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The effect of salivary exposure time on the abrasive wear of acid-eroded dentine was evaluated in situ . One-hundred and twenty bovine root dentine slabs were randomly assigned into six groups ( A-F ) and placed in intraoral palatal devices , which were worn by 10 volunteers for 4 d. On the first day , no erosive/abrasive procedures were carried out . On the following 3 d , erosive challenges were performed extraorally , two times per day , by immersing the device for 90 s in a soft drink . Subsequently , the group A specimens were immediately brushed ( 40 strokes ) , and the others were brushed after the following times : B , 20 min ; C , 40 min ; and D , 60 min . Group E specimens were only acid-eroded and those of group F were only brushed . Dentine wear was measured with a profilometer . anova and Dunnett 's test showed that groups A-D did not differ statistically from the control group E but differed from the control group F.

Recently, we described the aminothiazole lead (4-biphenyl-4-ylthiazol-2-yl) - (6-methylpyridin-2-yl) -amine (1), which exhibits many desirable properties, including excellent stability in liver microsomes, oral bioavailability of ∼40%, and high exposure in the brains of mice. Despite its good pharmacokinetic properties, compound 1 exhibited only modest potency in mouse neuroblastoma cells overexpressing the disease-causing prion protein PrP (Sc). Accordingly, we sought to identify analogues of 1 with improved antiprion potency in ScN2a-cl3 cells while retaining similar or superior properties. Herein we report the discovery of improved lead compounds such as (6-methylpyridin-2-yl) -[4- (4-pyridin-3-yl-phenyl) thiazol-2-yl]amine and cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (4-biphenylthiazol-2-yl) amide, which exhibit brain exposure/EC50 ratios at least tenfold greater than that of compound 1.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

However, it is not immediately clear how to include such modules in standard deep networks; the classifiers need to somehow be applied to the correct portion of the image, while the symbolic transformations need to be applied to the correct representations at the appropriate time and, moreover, will typically be non-differentiable, precluding the possibility of training via backpropogation.In this work we propose an approach that solves this type of task in two steps. First,the machine learning practitioner identifies a collection of modules, each performing an elementary information processing function that is predicted to be useful in the domain of interest, and assembles them into a designed information processing machine called an interface BID30 that is coupled to the external environment. Second, reinforcement learning (RL) is used to train a controller to make use of the interface; use of RL alleviates any need for the interface to be differentiable. For example, in this paper we make use of an interface for the visual arithmetic domain that contains: a discrete attention mechanism; three pre-trained perceptual neural networks that classify digits/classify arithmetic symbols/detect salient locations (respectively); several modules performing basic arithmetic operations on stored internal representations. Through theuse of RL, a controller learns to sequentially combine these components to solve visual arithmetic tasks.There are number of possible future directions related to the current work, including potential benefits of our approach that were not explored here.These include the ability to take advantage of conditional computation; in principle, only the subset of the interface needed to carry out the chosen action needs to be executed every time step.If the interface contains many large networks or other computationally intensive modules, large speedups can likely be realized along these lines.A related idea is that of adaptive computation time; in the current work, all episodes ran for a fixed number of time steps, but it should be possible to have the controller decide when it has the correct answer and stop computation at that point, saving valuable computational resources.Furthermore, it may be beneficial to train the perceptual modules and controller simultaneously, allowing the modules to adapt to better perform the uses that the controller finds for them.Finally, the ability of reinforcement learning to make use of discrete and non-differentiable modules opens up a wide array of possible interface components; for instance, a discrete knowledge base may serve as a long term memory.Any generally intelligent system will need many individual competencies at its disposal, both perceptual and algorithmic; in this work we have proposed one path by which a system may learn to coordinate such competencies.We have proposed a novel approach for solving tasks that require both sophisticated perception and symbolic computation.This approach consists in first designing an interface that contains information processing modules such as pre-trained deep neural networks for processing perceptual data and modules for manipulating stored symbolic representations.Reinforcement learning is then used to train a controller to use the interface to solve tasks.Using the Visual Arithmetic task domain as an example, we demonstrated empirically that the interface acts as a source of inductive bias that allows tasks to be solved using a much smaller number of training examples than required by traditional approaches.","answer":"We use reinforcement learning to train an agent to solve a set of visual arithmetic tasks using provided pre-trained perceptual modules and transformations of internal representations created by those modules."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The CDs display bright PL, narrow emission spectra, pH -dependent PL intensity, high photostability, and up-converted luminescence. The CDs exhibit a quenching of both down- and up-conversion PL in the presence of morin and thus serve as useful probes for morin detection. Both down- and up-conversion measurements allow the quantification of concentrations from 0 to 300 μmol/L with a detection limit of 0.6 μmol/L, and this dual-mode detection increases the reliability of the measurement.

Usually these cases are thought to be forme fruste of TSC due to somatic mosaicism.Female germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis confirmed by molecular genetic analysisThis is the first case of germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis proven by molecular genetic analysis and also the first example of female germline mosaicism for a characterized autosomal dominant gene mutation apparently not associated with somatic mosaicism.Mutation screening by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the TSC2 gene identified a 4 bp insertion TACT following nucleotide 2077 in exon 18 which was present in the three affected children but not in five unaffected siblings or the parents. This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Introduction<p>Single-drop micro-extraction (SDME), a new sample preparation technique introduced by Jeannot and Cantwell [1], has attracted increasing attentions. In this straightforward technique, a microdrop of solvent is suspended at the tip of a conventional microsyringe and then exposed in the sample headspace. Since only the volatile or semivolatile compounds can be volatilized into headspace and extracted to a single drop, interferences from the complex matrix will be decreased greatly. Other advantages of this method are the small amount of organic solvent required and the simple experimental and sampling equipment, while extraction, concentration, and sample introduction are integrated into a single step [2]. Several papers have been published using this sample preparation approach for the determination of environmental specimen [3–8], food [9, 10], biological products [11–14], engine oil samples [15], and pesticide residue [10, 16]. In SDME process, it is very important to use a suitable extraction solvent to achieve a good selectivity for the analytes, especially for complicated samples. In the above-mentioned papers, only one extraction solvent for several substances was employed [3–16], but there is little reported for complex extraction solvent. In our previous investigations, a single extraction solvent was successfully used</p><p>to analyze traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) [17, 18]. However, these methods based on a single extraction still had the following drawbacks that amount and categories of extracted compounds almost depended on the polarity of the single extraction solvent.</p><p>To overcome the shortcomings of single solvent extraction in the present study, mixed solvent extraction based on SDME was developed for analysis of volatile components in TCM, Herba Asari. Herba Asari was used to dispel wind heat, headache, toothache, snuffling, and rheumatism [19]. The method precision and the parameters of SDME were studied.</p>2.1. Reagents and Materials<p>The extraction solvents (benzyl alcohol, n-tridecane, n-tetradecane, 1,4-butanediol, butyl acetate, n-dodecane, methylbenzene, 1-octanol, decane, decanol, isobutyl alcohol, and n-tridecane) were purchased from our Chem Company (of GC grade or minimum purity of 99%) and used without any further purification. One-microliter SGE microsyringe and water bath were purchased for the SDME procedure. A manual SPME holder and 100 μm PDMS fibers from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA) were used for the SPME procedure. Fibers were conditioned prior to use according to the supplier's instructions.</p><p>The dry root samples of Herba Asari were purchased from An'guo traditional Chinese medicine market in Hebei province of China and were authenticated by the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Academy of Medical Science of China. The samples were dried in air, cut, milled, and then sieved via 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mesh, respectively, to obtain different particle size samples. Finally, the pound samples were stored in tightly sealed weighing bottles until analysis.</p>2.2. GC-MS Conditions<p>Chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent 6890 GC (USA) with a PEG-20W Innowax (Agilent) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The oven temperature program was 7.0 min at 50°C 20°C/min to 130°C (keeping 130°C for 1 min), 1°C/min to 150°C, and 8°C/min to 190°C (keeping 190°C for 5 min). The injector and detector temperatures were 230°C and 260°C, respectively. Nitrogen of high purity was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The split ratio was 1 : 100. The mass spectrometer was fitted with an EI source operated at 70 eV, and mass spectra were recorded in the range of m/z 50 to 450 amu in the full-scan acquisition mode. The interface temperature and the ion source temperature were fixed at 240°C and 230°C, respectively. Volatile compounds were identified by comparing the obtained mass spectra of the analytes with those of authentic standards from the NIST and Hist 98 libraries with a resemblance percentage above 85%.</p>2.3. SDME Procedure<p>A 15 mL vial (Supclo, USA) with PTFE septum containing the powdered sample was placed at a fixed position in a water bath. Then a 1 μL GC micro-syringe was pierced into the headspace of the vial, which was clamped at a fixed position for improving precision of the method. The microsyringe was washed at least 20 times by extraction solvent between runs. After a preset extraction time, the extraction solvent was retracted into the needle and swiftly injected onto GC-MS for the analysis.</p><p>SDME parameters including the type of the extracting solvent, extraction temperature and time, headspace volume (sample amount), solvent volume, and particle size of the pound sample were investigated.</p>3.1. Selection of SDME Conditions<p>Selecting a proper extraction solvent is especially crucial for the analysis of volatile compounds of TCMs because of the great differences of the compounds in polarity and volatility. Mass transfer of the analytes from the pound sample to the microdrop continues until thermodynamic equilibrium is attained or the extraction is stopped according to the considerations of SDME. The principle \\"like dissolves like\\" can become the basis of the solvent selection. Different solvents were tested to find a suitable one that meets such requirements as high extraction efficiency in terms of the compounds and yields especially those of low volatility, less toxicity, and satisfactory chromatographic resolution for the analytes. Low volatility is helpful to keep the solvent micro-drop at the tip of the micro-syringe needle sustainable over the extraction time period. If possible, the front/end solvent peak is preferred to avoid the solvent problem with GC-MS. The decane, n-tridecane, n-tetradecane, butyl acetate, methylbenzene, 1-octanol benzyl alcohol, decanol, and isobutyl alcohol were selected and benzyl alcohol offered a better extraction. Then a mixture of two solvents was selected and after a detailed comparison of the peak areas of the seven main compounds (shown in Figure 1), n-tridecane mixed with butyl acetate was found to be the optimal combination and was finally adopted as the extraction solvent.</p>3.2. Percent of Mixed Extraction Solvent<p>Selecting a proper percent of mixed extraction solvent is also important for the analysis of volatile compounds. The volume scale of the mixed solvent of n-tridecane and butyl acetate was investigated in the ranges of 1 : 0, 3 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 3, and 0 : 1, while keeping the other parameters under the following conditions: powdered sample, 0.500 g; extraction solvent volume, 0.6 μL; particle size, 100 mesh; extraction time, 20 min; extraction temperature, 70°C. The results showed that the peak area ratios of analytes of interest to benzyl alcohol (internal standard 0.2%) rapidly increased with the elevated percent of n-tridecane from 0 to 50 but decreased slowly after 50% n-tridecane. As a result, 50% was chosen as the extraction percent for the analysis (show in Figure 2).</p><p>The solvent volume was investigated by setting the volume of the solvent at the volume of the solvent in the range of 0.30 to 0.90 μL. It can be known that the amount of the extracted analytes in the solvent drop increased with the solvent volume. However, the results also showed that when the volume exceeded 0.60 μL, the chromatographic peak of the solvent broadened and even overlapped the peaks of analytes of interest. In light of this, the solvent volume of 0.60 μL was finally used in the present study.</p>3.3. Extraction Time<p>The extraction time was determined by varying the exposure time of the microdrop in the headspace of a sample from 5 to 25 min while keeping the other parameters under the same conditions as Section 3.2. The peak areas of the seven main chosen compounds to the peak areas of benzyl alcohol were different from 5 to 25 min, but their sum peak areas were the largest at 15 min. So the extraction time of 15 min was chosen for the present work.</p>3.4. Extraction Temperature<p>The extraction efficiency of SDME procedure was temperature dependent. The effect of sample temperature on the extraction efficiency was investigated in the range of 50–90°C while keeping the other parameters under the same conditions as Section 3.3. The results showed that the peak areas of the seven main compounds in Herba Asari and their sum peak areas to benzyl alcohol (internal standard 0.2%) increased significantly with the temperature from 50°C to 70°C but deceased dramatically after 70°C. As a result, 70°C was chosen as the extraction temperature for the analysis.</p>3.5. Particle Size of Sample<p>For a solid sample, particle size plays an important part in the extraction. Particle size of the sample was tested from 40 to 120 mesh at 70°C for 15 min with powdered sample 0.500 g. The results showed that the amount of volatile compounds increased with the decrease of particle size from 40 to 100 mesh but deceased after 100 mesh. As a result, 100 mesh was chosen as the optimal extraction particle size of the sample.</p>3.6. Sample Amount<p>Sample amount was determined by varying the amount of the powdered sample in a 15 mL vial. Increasing sample amount led to an increase of the analytes concentrations in the headspace which chanced the extracted amount of the analytes in the drop and a decrease of headspace volume. The extracted amount of the analytes increased continuously with the sample amount from 0.25 to 0.75 g and then decreased at 1.25 g. This observation could be explained by the fact that the powdered sample matrix could not be stirred during the process; consequently, with the increase of the sample amount, both the convection in the matrix and the mass transfer became slow. So 0.75 g was chosen as the optimal sample amount.</p>3.7. Repeatability<p>Under the determined conditions, the repeatability of the SDME method was determined by performing six replicate experiments. Relative standard deviations (RSD) of the seven main peak areas of the analytes of interest to the internal standard were 2.3% for 3-Pinene, 8.7% for eucarvone, 7.5% for 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, 9.2% for n-pentadecane, 9.8% for safrole, and 9.0% for methyleugenol. The RSD values for the seven compounds were all below 9.8%, indicating a satisfactory repeatability of the SDME method compared with the above-mentioned papers 10.8% [17].</p>3.8. SDME-GC-MS Results<p>The typical total ion chromatograms of SDME-GC-MS methods are shown in Figure 3 and the corresponding volatile compounds identified are listed in Table 1. The retention index of every compound was calculated under the same temperature process. The number of the volatile compounds identified was 61 for SDME-GC-MS. In general, SDME-GC-MS can be used as a good method for the analysis of volatile compounds in TCMs. SDME-GC-MS has a much lower cost (only using negligible volume of a solvent) and wider availability of extraction solvents.</p>4. Conclusions<p>SDME-GC-MS has a lower cost, more choices of extraction solvents, requires a smaller amount of sample, and directly utilizes the ground powder of traditional Chinese medicines for the analysis. SDME-GC-MS method is a simple, cheap, and effective method for the analysis of volatile compounds in TCM.</p>","answer":"A rapid headspace single-drop microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SDME-GC-MS) for the analysis of the volatile compounds in Herba Asari was developed in this study. The extraction solvent, extraction temperature and time, sample amount, and particle size were optimized. A mixed solvent of n-tridecane and butyl acetate (1 : 1) was finally used for the extraction with sample amount of 0.750 g and 100-mesh particle size at 70°C for 15 min. Under the determined conditions, the pound samples of Herba Asari were directly applied for the analysis. The result showed that SDME-GC–MS method was a simple, effective, and inexpensive way to measure the volatile compounds in Herba Asari and could be used for the analysis of volatile compounds in Chinese medicine."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

This increased susceptibility to respiratory infections may contribute to risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with severe mental illness or those in inpatient settings. Atypical antipsychotic (AA) medications are FDA approved to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and irritability associated with autism. Our team and others have shown that AA may have anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of mental health disorders. Additionally, AA are widely prescribed off-label for diverse indications to non-psychotic patients including older adults, who are also at increased risk for COVID-19 complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine if AA medications such as risperidone (RIS) alter the ability to mount an appropriate response to an acute inflammatory or adaptive immune challenge using a preclinical model. Short-term treatment of healthy mice with a dose of RIS that achieves plasma concentrations within the low clinical range resulted in disrupted response to an inflammatory (LPS) challenge compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, RIS also prevented treated animals from mounting an antibody response following vaccination with Pneumovax23(R). These data indicate that short-to intermediate-term exposure to clinically relevant levels of RIS dysregulate innate and adaptive immune responses, which may affect susceptibility to respiratory infections, including COVID-19.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\", \\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

PURPOSE: This phase I study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of the combination of decitabine with vorinostat.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were eligible. Sequential and concurrent schedules were studied.  RESULTS: Forty-three patients were studied in 9 different dose levels (6 sequential and 3 concurrent). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on the sequential schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg three times a day on days 6-12. The MTD on the concurrent schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 with vorinostat 200 mg twice a day on days 3-9. However, the sequential schedule of decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg twice a day on days 6-12 was more deliverable than both MTDs with fewer delays on repeated dosing and it represents the recommended phase II (RP2D) dose of this combination. Dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle consisted of myelosuppression, constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms and occurred in 12/42 (29%) patients evaluable for toxicity. The most common ≥ grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (49% of patients), thrombocytopenia (16%), fatigue (16%), lymphopenia (14%), and febrile neutropenia (7%). Disease stabilization for ≥ 4 cycles was observed in 11/38 (29%) evaluable patients.  CONCLUSION: The combination of decitabine with vorinostat is tolerable on both concurrent schedules in previously treated patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The sequential schedule was easier to deliver. The combination showed activity with prolonged disease stabilization in different tumor types.sentence: Phase I study of decitabine in combination with vorinostat in patients with advanced solid tumors and non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas .","answer":"[[\\"decitabine\\", \\"vorinostat\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVE To compare in vivo bitewing film quality using the holder versus the paper loop technique . METHOD AND MATERIALS Four bitewing films were taken from the right and left premolar and molar regions of 45 dental students using both the bitewing holder and paper loop techniques . A total of 360 films were taken and assessed by an experienced practitioner not apprised of the bitewing technique used . Of interest were : ( 1 ) the number of overlaps and the percentage of teeth showing the alveolar crest ; ( 2 ) proper film positioning ; and ( 3 ) the percentage of cone cutting . A Poisson regression using generalized estimating equations ( GEEs ) was used to estimate the difference in overlap between the two techniques . For proper positioning and cone cutting , logistic regressions using GEEs were used . RESULTS The average number of horizontal overlaps for the loop and holder techniques at the right premolar , right molar , left premolar , and left molar were 1.64 , 2.11 , 2.16 , 2.78 , and 1.64 , 2.00 , 2.00 , 2.18 , respectively . The loop technique was 1.11 times more likely to cause overlapping than the holder technique . The highest percentage of teeth showing the alveolar crest by the loop technique was 97.8 % in the mandibular second premolar and first molar . With respect to film positioning , the loop technique was 1.12 times more likely to cause improper positioning than the holder technique . Both techniques demonstrated minimal cone cutting ( 1 in the loop versus 0 in the holder ) .

Emerging pharmacological and clinical data suggest a highly promising role of cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as druggable cancer targets. However, large-scale experimental identification of cancer-related PPIs remains challenging, and currently available resources to explore oncogenic PPI networks are limited.Results: Recently, we have developed a PPI high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines. To facilitate prioritization of PPIs for further biological studies, this resource combines network connectivity analysis, mutual exclusivity analysis of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins and domain-domain interactions. Estimates of PPI essentiality allow users to evaluate the functional impact of PPI disruption on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, connecting the OncoPPi network with the approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials enables discovery of new tumor dependencies to inform strategies to interrogate undruggable targets like tumor suppressors. The OncoPPi Portal serves as a resource for the cancer research community to facilitate discovery of cancer targets and therapeutic development.Availability and implementation: The OncoPPi Portal is available at http://oncoppi.emory.edu.Contact: andrey.ivanov@emory.edu or hfu@emory.edu.Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines.Explore Protein-Protein Interactions for Cancer Target Discovery Using the OncoPPi PortalThe established network of oncogenic PPIs , termed the OncoPPi network , is available through the OncoPPi Portal , an interactive web resource that allows to access and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines integrated with the analysis of mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations , cellular co-localization of interacting proteins , domain-domain interactions , and therapeutic connectivityExplore Protein-Protein Interactions for Cancer Target Discovery Using the OncoPPi Portal.This chapter presents a guide to explore the OncoPPi network using the OncoPPi Portal to facilitate cancer biology.The established network of oncogenic PPIs, termed the OncoPPi network, is available through the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows to access and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines integrated with the analysis of mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins, domain-domain interactions, and therapeutic connectivity.","answer":"The OncoPPi Portal"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

When other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for FLOLAN to increase the risk of bleeding. However, patients receiving infusions of FLOLAN in clinical trials were maintained on anticoagulants without evidence of increased bleeding. In clinical trials, FLOLAN was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide or digoxin in whom therapy with FLOLAN was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87. The change in furosemide clearance value is not likely to be clinically significant. However, patients on digoxin may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with FLOLAN, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [\\"FLOLAN\\"], \\"Drug\\": [\\"oxygen\\", \\"digoxin\\", \\"furosemide\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"diuretics\\", \\"antiplatelet agents\\", \\"anticoagulants\\", \\"vasodilators\\", \\"antihypertensive agents\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Synthetic hydrazines are also prevalent in the general environment [2]. In some cases, hydrazines are beneficial components of pharmaceutical drugs such as the antidepressant drugs isoniazid and phenelzine, but are also toxic and can act as cancer causative agents [1, 2]. For example, the newly FDA-approved drug DUOPA® for Parkinson's disease contains the substituted hydrazine carbidopa with a known hemolytic anemia side effect. The parent hydrazine (NH2NH2) is found in tobacco and tobacco smoke [3]. Hydrazines can also be present in certain foods. For example, 4-hydroxymethylphenylhydrazine is generated as a metabolite from agaritine, a food component from the edible commercial mushroom Agaris bisporus [4].</p><p>Phenylhydrazine is toxic to red blood cells [5], and the hemoglobin-phenylhydrazine reaction has been used to model hemolytic anemia. Interactions of substituted hydrazines with human hemoglobin (Hb) may also result in hemolysis, Heinz-body formation, and degradation of the protein [6]. Related interactions of substituted hydrazines and diazenes (RN=NH) with other heme proteins such as myoglobin (Mb) [7-9], cytochrome P450 [10-12], and catalase [13] have been reported [14]. The generated products often contain heme σ-aryl bonds with direct Fe–C(aryl) linkages (Scheme 1) as determined by UV-vis and NMR spectroscopy. In some cases, an Fe–to–N(porphyrin) migration of the aryl ligand (Scheme 1; right) occurs upon extraction of the heme from the protein, or occurs within the heme protein active site (for cytochrome P450) [14].</p><p>Only two X-ray crystal structures have been reported to date for such heme protein σ-aryl species. The preparation and crystal structure of the prototypical wild-type (wt) sperm whale (sw) Mb–phenyl complex, obtained from the reaction of ferric Mb (metMb) with phenylhydrazine, was published by Ringe and Ortiz de Montellano and coworkers in 1984 [7]. The related preparation and crystal structure of the cytochrome P450cam–phenyl complex, obtained from the reaction with phenyldiazene, was reported by Poulos and Ortiz de Montellano and coworkers in 1990 [12].</p><p>The potential of arylhydrazines to serve as steric probes for heme protein active sites has been evaluated [14]. It is well established that the arylhydrazine reactions with heme proteins proceed via carbon-based radicals [15, 16] formed during aerobic reaction with the protein en route to Fe–C bond formation [17]. New X-ray structural data that clarify which aryl C atoms bind to the Fe centers, and information regarding preferred aryl ligand orientations from reactions involving substituted arylhydrazines as a function of active site structure are thus desirable.</p><p>We have prepared a representative set of derivatives from the reactions of arylhydrazines with wt and mutant Mbs (Chart 1) to determine the mode of attachment of the substituted aryl groups to the iron centers [18], and the effect of mutating the distal pocket H64 residue on the orientation of the aryl ligands. We chose the H64A mutant to remove distal sidechain H-bonding, and the H64Q mutant to provide an alternate H-bonding capacity in the heme pocket.</p><p>The aerobic reaction of sw metMb with phenylhydrazine results in spectral changes in the UV-vis spectrum identical to those reported previously (Supporting Information Figure S1) [8, 9]. The related reaction of the metMb H64A mutant (λmax 408 nm) [19] with m-tolylhydrazine in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 reveal similar spectral features to generate a product (λmax 436 nm), shown in Figure 1A. When p-chlorophenylhydrazine is used for the reaction, similar spectral shifts are observed (Figure 1B). Both reactions are essentially complete after ∼1.5 min (Figure S2 in the SI). Reactions of the metMb H64Q mutant [19] with m-tolylhydrazine and p-chlorophenylhydrazine proceed similarly, with the reactions being complete after ∼6 min and ∼3 min, respectively (Figure S3 in the SI).</p><p>We have successfully obtained the X-ray crystal structures of all four myoglobin H64A–tolyl-m (1.77 Å resoln), H64A–chlorophenyl-p (1.70 Å resoln), H64Q–tolyl-m (1.88 Å resoln), and H64Q–chlorophenyl-p (1.87 Å resoln) derivatives. We also reproduced the crystal structure of the known wt sw Mb–phenyl complex [7] at 1.87 Å resolution (Figure S4 in the SI). Careful exposure of the respective pre-formed metMb crystals to solutions of the arylhydrazines in air resulted in the formation of products that retained their crystallinity.1 Numerous trials (>40 trials for each derivative) were needed to obtain suitable product crystals with good diffraction, as this reaction generally resulted in disruption of crystallinity and crystal cracking. Indeed, we have not yet obtained suitable crystals for the wt Mb derivatives with the tolyl and chlorophenyl ligands.</p><p>The heme sites of the Mb H64A and H64Q products are shown in Figure 2, and demonstrate direct Fe–C bond formation to generate the product complexes. The Fe–C bond lengths of 1.9–2.0 Å are similar to those obtained in heme model Fe–aryl compounds (∼1.96 Å) [20].</p><p>The tolyl ligand in the H64A–tolyl-m derivative (Figure 2A) is bound to Fe via the carbon atom bearing the initial hydrazine functional group (i.e., in the meta position). The aryl methyl substituent points to the hydrophobic interior of the protein, with the closest contact of 3.4 Å between the ligand methyl C-atom and the δ2 C-atom of Leu29. The aryl plane essentially eclipses diagonal porphyrin N atoms, and is perpendicular to the heme N4-plane (with a small ∼5° tilt to the heme normal).</p><p>In the H64A–chlorophenyl-p structure (Figure 2B), the aryl ligand binds via the para-C atom which held the hydrazine moiety. The ligand plane also eclipses diagonal porphyrin N-atoms, but has a larger (∼18°) tilt from the normal to the heme plane in the direction of Phe43 and Phe46, with the closest calculated distance being between the centroid of the aryl ring and Cγ2 of Val68.</p><p>The structures of the H64Q derivatives are similar to those of the H64A mutant in terms of the points of attachment of the aryl ligands to the Fe centers and these ligands eclipsing diagonal porphyrin N atoms. However, although the tolyl ligand plane (Figure 2C) has a similar tilt (∼8°) with respect to the heme normal as seen in the H64A derivative, the chlorophenyl ligand plane (Figure 2D) has a significantly smaller (∼7°) tilt from the heme normal than that observed in the H64A mutant (∼18°). The calculated distances between the chlorophenyl ligand atoms (Figure 2D) and closest distal pocket residues are >3.6 Å.</p><p>The X-ray crystal structures in Figure 2 provide valuable information that can be used to address substituent and distal pocket influences on the ligand conformation in these bioorganometallic Fe–C complexes. A superposition of these structures on those of the respective sw metMb precursors [21][19][22] is shown in Figure 3. As noted above, both the H64A and H64Q mutants gave the same reaction products upon reactions with the arylhydrazines, both in terms of ligand identity and mode of attachment, with no clear hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the ligands. We focus our discussion on the sidechains of the residues Val68, Gln64, and Phe46, and the CD loop region.</p><p>In the H64A–tolyl-m structure, the Val68 sidechain flips to a \\"vertical\\" orientation from its initial horizontal orientation in the metMb H64A structure, creating a 3.7 Å distance between this sidechain and the centroid of the aryl ring. This Val68 flip relieves a steric clash with the tolyl ligand. In contrast, the Val68 sidechain does not flip in the H64A–chlorophenyl structure, probably due to the significant ∼18° tilt of the aryl ligand from the heme normal and away from this residue. Interestingly, this same aryl ligand tilt results in a 45° rotation of the aryl plane of Phe46 and its subsequent movement away from the heme pocket. Within the backbone structure, the largest change occurs in the H64A–chlorophenyl derivative when compared with the metMb precursor and the tolyl complex. In the H64A–chlorophenyl derivative, a ∼1.0 Å downward movement of the CD loop region that contains Phe46 is evident (Figure S5 in the SI), and is likely associated with the change in Phe46 orientation induced by the chlorophenyl tilt in the pocket.</p><p>In the related H64Q derivatives, the Val68 sidechains flip to a vertical orientation for both the tolyl and chlorophenyl complexes, when compared with the starting H64Q metMb structure (Figure 3B). Interestingly, a major orientation change occurs for the Gln64 sidechains in the tolyl and chlorophenyl derivatives from the original position in the H64Q metMb precursor where it H-bonds with the H2O ligand to Fe. The new Gln64 orientation in the tolyl and chlorophenyl derivatives establishes a new H-bonding contact with Asp60 thus stabilizing this conformation. To the best of our knowledge, this Gln64 orientation shift away from the distal pocket interior towards the exterior is the first such observed movement in any single or multi-mutant H64Q structure reported. Unlike that observed in the H64A structures, no significant movement of the CD loop region is observed in these H64Q structures.</p><p>There are several other points to note regarding the crystal structures shown in Figures 2 and 3. First, these products resulting from a rather complicated reaction of arylhydrazines with the metMb heme proteins were obtained from soaking pre-formed crystals of the metMb precursors with the arylhydrazine reagents, and show only one preferred conformation for each of the bound aryl ligands. Given that both H64A and H64Q mutants gave the same ligand identities in the products, it seems that the nature of the distal pocket mutation is relatively unimportant in these reactions reported here. The results also suggest that the aryl radical intermediates that form during the heme-induced reaction are generated in close proximity to the Fe centers to enable rapid attachment of the ligands to the Fe, resulting in a single attachment isomer from the arylhydrazine precursors. Consistent with previous NMR studies by others on wt sw Mb–aryls [9, 17], we do not observe any migrations of the aryl ligands to heme pyrrole N-atoms. The observed distal pocket changes suggest a role for Val68 in that it may flip its orientation as a function of bound ligand to accommodate varied sizes and/or orientations of the ligands. Further, larger aryl ligands can be accommodated with additional changes in other distal pocket residues such as Phe46 with concomitant movements in the CD loop region. Notably, the distal pocket Gln sidechains in the H64Q mutant products display significant movement towards the protein exterior to accommodate the new ligands.</p><p>Given the known interactions between hydrazine derivatives and hemoglobins, and their associated relationships to hemolysis and other deleterious effects, the new structures obtained from this work provide an expanded framework for an improved understanding and interpretation of structure-function studies in this important area.</p>","answer":"Bioorganometallic Fexe2x80x93C bonds are biologically relevant species that may result from the metabolism of natural or synthetic hydrazines.

This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to tackle a classification problem in categorizing social content written in Hindi-English into Abusive, Hate-Inducing and Not offensive categories. We utilize bi-directional sequence models with easy text augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap, and random deletion to produce a state of the art classifier that outperforms the previous work done on analyzing this dataset.IntroductionHinglish is a linguistic blend of Hindi (very widely spoken language in India) and English (an associate language of urban areas) and is spoken by upwards of 350 million people in India. While the name is based on the Hindi language, it does not refer exclusively to Hindi, but is used in India, with English words blending with Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi and Hindi. Sometimes, though rarely, Hinglish is used to refer to Hindi written in English script and mixing with English words or phrases. This makes analyzing the language very interesting. Its rampant usage in social media like Twitter, Facebook, Online blogs and reviews has also led to its usage in delivering hate and abuses in similar platforms. We aim to find such content in the social media focusing on the tweets. Hypothetically, if we can classify such tweets, we might be able to detect them and isolate them for further analysis before it reaches public. This will a great application of AI to the social cause and thus is motivating. An example of a simple, non offensive message written in Hinglish could be:\\"Why do you waste your time with <redacted content>. Aapna ghar sambhalta nahi(<redacted content>). Chale dusro ko basane..!!\\"The second part of the above sentence is written in Hindi while the first part is in English. Second part calls for an action to a person to bring order to his/her home before trying to settle others.Introduction ::: Modeling challengesFrom the modeling perspective there are couple of challenges introduced by the language and the labelled dataset. Generally, Hinglish follows largely fuzzy set of rules which evolves and is dependent upon the users preference. It doesn't have any formal definitions and thus the rules of usage are ambiguous. Thus, when used by different users the text produced may differ. Overall the challenges posed by this problem are:Geographical variation: Depending upon the geography of origination, the content may be be highly influenced by the underlying region.Language and phonetics variation: Based on a census in 2001, India has 122 major languages and 1599 other languages. The use of Hindi and English in a code switched setting is highly influenced by these language.No grammar rules: Hinglish has no fixed set of grammar rules. The rules are inspired from both Hindi and English and when mixed with slur and slang produce large variation.Spelling variation: There is no agreement on the spellings of the words which are mixed with English. For example to express love, a code mixed spelling, specially when used social platforms might be pyaar, pyar or pyr.Dataset: Based on some earlier work, only available labelled dataset had 3189 rows of text messages of average length of 116 words and with a range of 1, 1295. Prior work addresses this concern by using Transfer Learning on an architecture learnt on about 14,500 messages with an accuracy of 83.90. We addressed this concern using data augmentation techniques applied on text data.Related Work ::: Transfer learning based approachesMathur et al. in their paper for detecting offensive tweets proposed a Ternary Trans-CNN model where they train a model architecture comprising of 3 layers of Convolution 1D having filter sizes of 15, 12 and 10 and kernel size of 3 followed by 2 dense fully connected layer of size 64 and 3. The first dense FC layer has ReLU activation while the last Dense layer had Softmax activation. They were able to train this network on a parallel English dataset provided by Davidson et al. The authors were able to achieve Accuracy of 83.9%, Precision of 80.2%, Recall of 69.8%.The approach looked promising given that the dataset was merely 3189 sentences divided into three categories and thus we replicated the experiment but failed to replicate the results. The results were poor than what the original authors achieved. But, most of the model hyper-parameter choices where inspired from this work.Related Work ::: Hybrid modelsIn another localized setting of Vietnamese language, Nguyen et al. in 2017 proposed a Hybrid multi-channel CNN and LSTM model where they build feature maps for Vietnamese language using CNN to capture shorterm dependencies and LSTM to capture long term dependencies and concatenate both these feature sets to learn a unified set of features on the messages. These concatenated feature vectors are then sent to a few fully connected layers. They achieved an accuracy rate of 87.3% with this architecture.Dataset and FeaturesWe used dataset, HEOT obtained from one of the past studies done by Mathur et al. where they annotated a set of cleaned tweets obtained from twitter for the conversations happening in Indian subcontinent. A labelled dataset for a corresponding english tweets were also obtained from a study conducted by Davidson et al. This dataset was important to employ Transfer Learning to our task since the number of labeled dataset was very small. Basic summary and examples of the data from the dataset are below:Model ArchitectureWe tested the performance of various model architectures by running our experiment over 100 times on a CPU based compute which later as migrated to GPU based compute to overcome the slow learning progress. Our universal metric for minimizing was the validation loss and we employed various operational techniques for optimizing on the learning process. These processes and its implementation details will be discussed later but they were learning rate decay, early stopping, model checkpointing and reducing learning rate on plateau.Model Architecture ::: Loss functionFor the loss function we chose categorical cross entropy loss in finding the most optimal weights/parameters of the model. Formally this loss function for the model is defined as below:The double sum is over the number of observations and the categories respectively. While the model probability is the probability that the observation i belongs to category c.Model Architecture ::: ModelsAmong the model architectures we experimented with and without data augmentation were:Fully Connected dense networks: Model hyperparameters were inspired from the previous work done by Vo et al and Mathur et al. This was also used as a baseline model but we did not get appreciable performance on such architecture due to FC networks not being able to capture local and long term dependencies.Convolution based architectures: Architecture and hyperparameter choices were chosen from the past study Deon on the subject. We were able to boost the performance as compared to only FC based network but we noticed better performance from architectures that are suitable to sequences such as text messages or any timeseries data.Sequence models: We used SimpleRNN, LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM model architecture to capture long term dependencies of the messages in determining the class the message or the tweet belonged to.Based on all the experiments we conducted below model had best performance related to metrics - Recall rate, F1 score and Overall accuracy.Model Architecture ::: Hyper parametersChoice of model parameters were in the above models were inspired from previous work done but then were tuned to the best performance of the Test dataset. Following parameters were considered for tuning.Learning rate: Based on grid search the best performance was achieved when learning rate was set to 0.01. This value was arrived by a grid search on lr parameter.Number of Bidirectional LSTM units: A set of 32, 64, 128 hidden activation units were considered for tuning the model. 128 was a choice made by Vo et al in modeling for Vietnamese language but with our experiments and with a small dataset to avoid overfitting to train dataset, a smaller unit sizes were considered.Embedding dimension: 50, 100 and 200 dimension word representation from Glove word embedding were considered and the best results were obtained with 100d representation, consistent with choices made in the previous work.Transfer learning on Embedding; Another bit flag for training the embedding on the train data or freezing the embedding from Glove was used. It was determined that set of pre-trained weights from Glove was best when it was fine tuned with Hinglish data. It provides evidence that a separate word or sentence level embedding when learnt for Hinglish text analysis will be very useful.Number of dense FC layers.Maximum length of the sequence to be considered: The max length of tweets/message in the dataset was 1265 while average was 116. We determined that choosing 200 resulted in the best performance.ResultsDuring our experimentation, it was evident that this is a hard problem especially detecting the hate speech, text in a code- mixed language. The best recall rate of 77 % for hate speech was obtained by a Bidirectional LSTM with 32 units with a recurrent drop out rate of 0.2. Precision wise GRU type of RNN sequence model faired better than other kinds for hate speech detection. On the other hand for detecting offensive and non offensive tweets, fairly satisfactory results were obtained. For offensive tweets, 92 % precision was and recall rate of 88% was obtained with GRU versus BiLSTM based models. Comparatively, Recall of 85 % and precision of 76 % was obtained by again GRU and BiLSTM based models as shown and marked in the results.Conclusion and Future workThe results of the experiments are encouraging on detective offensive vs non offensive tweets and messages written in Hinglish in social media. The utilization of data augmentation technique in this classification task was one of the vital contributions which led us to surpass results obtained by previous state of the art Hybrid CNN-LSTM based models. However, the results of the model for predicting hateful tweets on the contrary brings forth some shortcomings of the model. The biggest shortcoming on the model based on error analysis indicates less than generalized examples presented by the dataset. We also note that the embedding learnt from the Hinglish data set may be lacking and require extensive training to have competent word representations of Hinglish text. Given this learning's, we identify that creating word embeddings on much larger Hinglish corpora may have significant results. We also hypothesize that considering alternate methods than translation and transliteration may prove beneficial.References[1] Mathur, Puneet and Sawhney, Ramit and Ayyar, Meghna and Shah, Rajiv, Did you offend me? classification of offensive tweets in hinglish language, Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Abusive Language Online (ALW2)[2] Mathur, Puneet and Shah, Rajiv and Sawhney, Ramit and Mahata, Debanjan Detecting offensive tweets in hindi-english code-switched language Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media[3] Vo, Quan-Hoang and Nguyen, Huy-Tien and Le, Bac and Nguyen, Minh-Le Multi-channel LSTM-CNN model for Vietnamese sentiment analysis 2017 9th international conference on knowledge and systems engineering (KSE)[4] Hochreiter, Sepp and Schmidhuber, Jürgen Long short-term memory Neural computation 1997[5] Sinha, R Mahesh K and Thakur, Anil Multi-channel LSTM-CNN model for Vietnamese sentiment analysis 2017 9th international conference on knowledge and systems engineering (KSE)[6] Pennington, Jeffrey and Socher, Richard and Manning, Christopher Glove: Global vectors for word representation Proceedings of the 2014 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP)[7] Zhang, Lei and Wang, Shuai and Liu, Bing Deep learning for sentiment analysis: A survey Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery[8] Caruana, Rich and Lawrence, Steve and Giles, C Lee Overfitting in neural nets: Backpropagation, conjugate gradient, and early stopping Advances in neural information processing systems[9] Beale, Mark Hudson and Hagan, Martin T and Demuth, Howard B Neural network toolbox user’s guide The MathWorks Incs[10] Chollet, François and others Keras: The python deep learning library Astrophysics Source Code Library[11] Wei, Jason and Zou, Kai EDA: Easy Data Augmentation Techniques for Boosting Performance on Text Classification Tasks Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)Table 1: Annotated Data setTable 2: Examples in the datasetTable 3: Train-test splitFigure 1: Deep learning network used for the modelingFigure 2: Results of various experimentsQuestion: How big is the dataset?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"3189 rows of text messages\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"Dataset: Based on some earlier work, only available labelled dataset had 3189 rows of text messages of average length of 116 words and with a range of 1, 1295.

Murray et al. (2006) has underlined the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents in causing more severe acute exacerbations in the airway. This is especially true when not all exacerbation events occurred during the viral infection but may also occur well after viral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Stolz et al., 2019) in particular the late onset of a bacterial infection (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a . In addition, viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation, as the nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections. Moreover, not all viral infections of the airway will lead to acute exacerbations, suggesting a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the \\"united airway\\" hypothesis (Kurai et al., 2013) . On the other hand, viral infections or their components persist in patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Hence, their presence may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. Future studies should be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance (Hammond et al., 2015; McKendry et al., 2016; Akbarshahi et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells (Becker, 2006; McKendry et al., 2016) . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium (Contoli et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2019; Wark, 2019) . Due to the viral components remaining in the airway, antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation (Wood et al., 2011; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018) . These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) . With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection. On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway (Guibas et al., 2018) . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections (Vasileiou et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation. Another mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Sajjan et al., 2008; Kast et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018) . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Another recent area of interest is the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome. The development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases is usually linked to specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment (Diver et al., 2019) . In the event of a viral infection such as RV infection, the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present (Molyneaux et al., 2013; Kloepfer et al., 2014; Kloepfer et al., 2017; Jubinville et al., 2018; van Rijn et al., 2019) . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation (Marks et al., 2013; Chao et al., 2014) . Moreover, a viral infection may also alter the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth (Siegel et al., 2014; Mallia et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the destabilization is further compounded by impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a Wang et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2019) . All these may gradually lead to more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles (Teo et al., 2018) . These changes may in turn result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between virus and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Wark et al., 2013; Singanayagam et al., 2018) . To counteract these effects, microbiome-based therapies are in their infancy but have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome (Bakken et al., 2011) . Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection. Viral infections can cause the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier. Ciliary proteins FIGURE 2 | Changes in the upper airway epithelium contributing to viral exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. The upper airway epithelium is the primary contact/infection site of most respiratory viruses. Therefore, its infection by respiratory viruses may have far reaching consequences in augmenting and synergizing current and future acute exacerbations. The destruction of epithelial barrier, mucociliary function and cell death of the epithelial cells serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. The opening of tight junction increasing the leakiness further augments the inflammation and exacerbations. In addition, viral infections are usually accompanied with oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. Finally, the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promotes growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome. Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection. Viral specific trait contributing to exacerbation mechanism (with literature evidence) Oxidative stress ROS production (RV, RSV, IFV, HSV)As RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation (see text for abbreviations). that aid in the proper function of the motile cilia in the airways are aberrantly expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells which are the major target for RV infection (Griggs et al., 2017) . Such form of secondary cilia dyskinesia appears to be present with chronic inflammations in the airway, but the exact mechanisms are still unknown (Peng et al., , 2019 Qiu et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, it was found that in viral infection such as IFV, there can be a change in the metabolism of the cells as well as alteration in the ciliary gene expression, mostly in the form of down-regulation of the genes such as dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) and multiciliate differentiation And DNA synthesis associated cell cycle protein (MCIDAS) (Tan et al., 2018b . The recently emerged Wuhan CoV was also found to reduce ciliary beating in infected airway epithelial cell model (Zhu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, viral infections such as RSV was shown to directly destroy the cilia of the ciliated cells and almost all respiratory viruses infect the ciliated cells (Jumat et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) .

OBJECTIVES: SLCO1B1*5 and SLCO1B1*15 have been reported to reduce the clearance of pravastatin in healthy volunteers. However, there remains controversy in the effects of SLCO1B1*5 on the activity of OATP1B1 in vitro. In addition, the effect of SLCO1B1*15 on the function of OATP1B1 has not been studied using cDNA-expression systems. Object of the present study was to study the influence of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, a novel haplotype found in a patient with pravastatin-induced myopathy, on the functional properties of OATP1B1 by transient expression systems of HEK293 and HeLa cells using endogenous conjugates and statins as substrates. METHODS: Transporting assays for endogenous substrates were performed using tritium labeled estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and estrone-3-sulfate. Quantitation of pravastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin and simvastatin were carried out using HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The transporting activities of cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G decreased significantly but those of SLCO1B1*1b, *1a+C1007G and *1b+C1007G were not altered for all of the substrates tested except for simvastatin. Kinetic analysis of pravastatin and atorvastatin showed that Km values were not altered but Vmax values decreased significantly in cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G. Immunocytochemical study showed that SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G proteins are localized not only at the plasma membrane but also in the intracellular space. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 521T>C, existing commonly in SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, is the key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that determines the functional properties of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G allelic proteins and that decreased activities of these variant proteins are mainly caused by a sorting error produced by this SNP.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"OATP-C\\", \\"OATP1B1\\", \\"SLCO1B1\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Benzenesulfonamides incorporating cyanoacrylamide moieties strongly inhibit Saccharomyces cerevisiae β-carbonic anhydrase.A series of benzenesulfonamides incorporating cyanoacrylamide moieties (tyrphostine analogs) were assayed as inhibitors of the β-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ScCA. Some of these compounds were low nanomolar or subnanomolar ScCA inhibitors and showed selectivity ratios in the range of 4.91-69.86 for inhibiting the yeast enzyme over the offtarget human (h) isoforms hCA I and of 6.46-13.52 for inhibiting ScCA over hCA II. The model organism S. cerevisiae and this particular enzyme may be useful for detecting antifungals with a novel mechanism of action compared to the classical azole drugs to which significant drug resistance emerged.

Although increased plasma concentrations (AUC 0-24 hrs) of loratadine and/or descarboethoxyloratadine were observed following coadministration of loratadine with each of these drugs in normal volunteers (n = 24 in each study), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of loratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events. There were no significant effects on QTc intervals, and no reports of sedation or syncope. No effects on plasma concentrations of cimetidine or ketoconazole were observed.

Instead, CNN work has focused on approaches to fuse spatial and temporal networks, but these were typically limited to processing shorter sequences. We present a new video representation, called temporal linear encoding (TLE) and embedded inside of CNNs as a new layer, which captures the appearance and motion throughout entire videos. It encodes this aggregated information into a robust video feature representation, via end-to-end learning. Advantages of TLEs are: (a) they encode the entire video into a compact feature representation, learning the semantics and a discriminative feature space; (b) they are applicable to all kinds of networks like 2D and 3D CNNs for video classification; and (c) they model feature interactions in a more expressive way and without loss of information. We conduct experiments on two challenging human action datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. The experiments show that TLE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both datasets.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We describe an approach to object and scene retrieval which searches for and localizes all the occurrences of a user outlined object in a video. The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films.[2]: We tackle the problem of large scale visual place recognition, where the task is to quickly and accurately recognize the location of a given query photograph. We present the following three principal contributions. First, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is trainable in an end-to-end manner directly for the place recognition task. The main component of this architecture, NetVLAD, is a new generalized VLAD layer, inspired by the \\"Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors\\" image representation commonly used in image retrieval. The layer is readily pluggable into any CNN architecture and amenable to training via backpropagation. Second, we develop a training procedure, based on a new weakly supervised ranking loss, to learn parameters of the architecture in an end-to-end manner from images depicting the same places over time downloaded from Google Street View Time Machine. Finally, we show that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms non-learnt image representations and off-the-shelf CNN descriptors on two challenging place recognition benchmarks, and improves over current state-of-the-art compact image representations on standard image retrieval benchmarks.[3]: [4]: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown their promise as a universal representation for recognition. However, global CNN activations lack geometric invariance, which limits their robustness for classification and matching of highly variable scenes. To improve the invariance of CNN activations without degrading their discriminative power, this paper presents a simple but effective scheme called multi-scale orderless pooling (MOP-CNN). This scheme extracts CNN activations for local patches at multiple scale levels, performs orderless VLAD pooling of these activations at each level separately, and concatenates the result. The resulting MOP-CNN representation can be used as a generic feature for either supervised or unsupervised recognition tasks, from image classification to instance-level retrieval; it consistently outperforms global CNN activations without requiring any joint training of prediction layers for a particular target dataset. In absolute terms, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging SUN397 and MIT Indoor Scenes classification datasets, and competitive results on ILSVRC2012 2013 classification and INRIA Holidays retrieval datasets.[5]: Bilinear models has been shown to achieve impressive performance on a wide range of visual tasks, such as semantic segmentation, fine grained recognition and face recognition. However, bilinear features are high dimensional, typically on the order of hundreds of thousands to a few million, which makes them impractical for subsequent analysis. We propose two compact bilinear representations with the same discriminative power as the full bilinear representation but with only a few thousand dimensions. Our compact representations allow back-propagation of classification errors enabling an end-to-end optimization of the visual recognition system. The compact bilinear representations are derived through a novel kernelized analysis of bilinear pooling which provide insights into the discriminative power of bilinear pooling, and a platform for further research in compact pooling methods. Experimentation illustrate the utility of the proposed representations for image classification and few-shot learning across several datasets.[6]: Approximation of non-linear kernels using random feature mapping has been successfully employed in large-scale data analysis applications, accelerating the training of kernel machines. While previous random feature mappings run in O(ndD) time for @math training samples in d-dimensional space and D random feature maps, we propose a novel randomized tensor product technique, called Tensor Sketching, for approximating any polynomial kernel in O(n(d+D D )) time. Also, we introduce both absolute and relative error bounds for our approximation to guarantee the reliability of our estimation algorithm. Empirically, Tensor Sketching achieves higher accuracy and often runs orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art approach for large-scale real-world datasets.[7]: Perceptual systems routinely separate “content” from “style,” classifying familiar words spoken in an unfamiliar accent, identifying a font or handwriting style across letters, or recognizing a familiar face or object seen under unfamiliar viewing conditions. Yet a general and tractable computational model of this ability to untangle the underlying factors of perceptual observations remains elusive (Hofstadter, 1985). Existing factor models (Mardia, Kent, & Bibby, 1979; Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Ghahramani, 1995; Bell & Sejnowski, 1995; Hinton, Dayan, Frey, & Neal, 1995; Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Hinton & Ghahramani, 1997) are either insufficiently rich to capture the complex interactions of perceptually meaningful factors such as phoneme and speaker accent or letter and font, or do not allow efficient learning algorithms. We present a general framework for learning to solve two-factor tasks using bilinear models, which provide sufficiently expressive representations of factor interactions but can nonetheless be fit to data using efficient algorithms based on the singular value decomposition and expectation-maximization. We report promising results on three different tasks in three different perceptual domains: spoken vowel classification with a benchmark multi-speaker database, extrapolation of fonts to unseen letters, and translation of faces to novel illuminants.[8]: We present a novel method for generic visual categorization: the problem of identifying the object content of natural images while generalizing across variations inherent to the object class. This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information.[9]: Despite the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the image classification task on datasets like Cifar and ImageNet, CNN's representation power is still somewhat limited in dealing with object images that have large variation in size and clutter, where Fisher Vector (FV) has shown to be an effective encoding strategy. FV encodes an image by aggregating local descriptors with a universal generative Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). FV however has limited learning capability and its parameters are mostly fixed after constructing the codebook. To combine together the best of the two worlds, we propose in this paper a neural network structure with FV layer being part of an end-to-end trainable system that is differentiable; we name our network FisherNet that is learnable using backpropagation. Our proposed FisherNet combines convolutional neural network training and Fisher Vector encoding in a single end-to-end structure. We observe a clear advantage of FisherNet over plain CNN and standard FV in terms of both classification accuracy and computational efficiency on the challenging PASCAL VOC object classification task.[10]: Recently SVMs using spatial pyramid matching (SPM) kernel have been highly successful in image classification. Despite its popularity, these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n2 n3) in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the training size, implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle more than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel on histograms, and is even better than the nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors.[11]: The Fisher kernel (FK) is a generic framework which combines the benefits of generative and discriminative approaches. In the context of image classification the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9 to 58.3 . Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A major advantage is that these results are obtained using only SIFT descriptors and costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we compare two abundant resources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets.","answer":"As to prior encoding methods, there is a vast literature on BoW [8] [1] , Fisher vector encoding [5]7 and sparse encoding [5]2 . Such methods have performed very well in various vision tasks. FV encoding [9] and VLAD [2] [4] have lately been integrated as a layer in ConvNet architectures, and CNN encoded features have produced superior results for several challenging tasks. Likewise, Bilinear models [3] [5]6 have been widely used and have achieved state-of-the-art results. Bilinear models are computationally expensive as they return matrix outer products, hence can lead to prohibitively high dimensions. To tackle this problem, compact bilinear pooling [5] was proposed which uses the Tensor Sketch Algorithm [6] , to project features from a high dimensional space to a lower dimensional one, while retaining state-of-the-art performances. Compact bilinear pooling has shown to perform better than FV encoding and fully-connected networks [5] . Moreover, this type of feature representation is compact, non-redundant, avoids over-fitting, and reduces the number of parameters of CNNs significantly, as it replaces fully-connected layers."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A 51/2-year-old black girl with recurrent meningococcal meningitis and absence of the sixth component of complement (C6) is reported. To explore the pathogenesis of recurrent neisserial infections in C6 deficiency, a detailed analysis of her immune competence was conducted. Her serum had normal chemotactic, opsonic, alternative complement pathway, and specific antibody activity, but lacked complement-mediated bacteriolytic activity. In addition, her C6-deficient serum was indistinguishable from normal serum in a complement-dependent assay of phagocyte bactericidal activity. Absent bacteriolysis remains the only consistent defect associated with recurrent neisserial infections and absence of one of the late-acting complement components..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"C6 deficiency\\", \\"meningococcal meningitis\\", \\"C6-deficient\\", \\"neisserial infections\\", \\"absence of the sixth component of complement\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

The standard acquisition of NMR experiments in three (or higher) dimensions, however, is time intensive taking of the order of a day or longer. For example, 3D NMR experiments of uniformly 15N,13C-labeled protein samples are traditionally acquired by independently incrementing the evolution times t1 and t2 along the 13C and 15N dimensions with N1 and N2 complex points, respectively.[1–2] This leads to a total acquisition time that grows with N1 × N2, where N1 and N2 are typically set to 32 – 64 increments so that the spectral resolution after FT along the two indirect dimensions is sufficiently high (typically of the order of a few tens of Hz).</p><p>There has been a surge of new methods for shortening the measurement time by reducing the total number of increments, which was reviewed recently.[3] Most methods belong to one of two sampling schemes: in radial sampling, t1 and t2 are simultaneously incremented, which corresponds to the measurement of one (or several) tilted frequency planes,[4–5] whereas in non-uniform sampling (NUS), certain t1, t2 points are left out at random by preferentially retaining time points at shorter evolution times due to their on average higher signal-to-noise. The two types of sampling schemes have complementary benefits: in radial sampling a modified form of the standard fast Fourier transform method can be applied, but the reconstruction of the full 3D spectrum is prone to artifacts. NUS does not allow processing by standard Fourier transformation requiring the use of a regularization condition for reconstruction, such as the maximum entropy[6–7] or compressed sensing condition,[8–9] striking a balance between the consistency of the reconstructed spectrum with the experimental data and the achievable sparseness of the final spectrum. The two sampling schemes can also be combined for the high-grade reconstruction of multidimensional spectra.[10]</p><p>Another approach is time-domain fitting, which has been used originally in linear prediction (LP) where a truncated time-domain signal is extended in time so that it can be subjected to regular Fourier transformation.[11] Although this improves spectral resolution and minimizes truncation artifacts, it is typically limited to a two-fold reduction in measurement time per indirect dimension. More recently, other time-domain fitting methods have been proposed, such as the filter diagonalization method,[12–13] the CRAFT method for the compilation of tables with frequencies, linewidths, and amplitudes of signals in 1D and 2D NMR datasets,[14–15] and for a more accurate extraction of peak amplitudes from 2D HSQC spectra.[16] For all of these methods, the absolute minimal number of increments to attain the relevant spectral information is unknown.</p><p>In practice, the spectroscopic parameters of interest from high dimensional NMR experiments are often the chemical shifts of nuclei that belong to the same spin system, such as the nuclei of peptide bonds on the protein backbone. For some experiments, such information is available with minimal measurement time. For example, for a 3D HNCO spectrum[17] of a protein with a single carbonyl C' resonance belonging to a selected 15N,1H frequency pair, the carbonyl resonance frequency ωC can be extracted from a single complex time point t1 >0[18]:(1)ωC=arctan{S(t1),C(t1)}/t1whereC(t1)=A exp{−R2t1}cos(ωCt1)S(t1)=A exp{−R2t1} sin(ωCt1)are the cosine and sine modulated experimental data points along the indirect time dimension t1 of the 15N,1H frequency pair of interest and arctan(y,x) is the two-argument variant of the arctangent function (also known as atan2) that is sensitive to the sign information of its arguments, whereby transverse relaxation effects A exp(−R2t1) with decay rate R2 cancels out leaving ωC as the only unknown. Application of Eq. (1) to the 2nd complex t1 increment along the C' dimension of a HNCO experiment is an extension of the SPEED method[18] to 3D NMR data but without the need for a 13C carbonyl reference spectrum. Results for ubiquitin (8.5 kDa, 76 amino acids) and arginine kinase (AK, 42 kDa, 357 amino acids)[19] show overall good agreement with peak positions obtained from the 3D FT processed spectrum with a RMSD of 0.18 and 0.34 ppm, respectively (Figure 1A,C). For ubiquitin, Ile3 is an outlier because of severe peak overlap at its 15N,1H frequencies (Figure S1). It is worth noting that FT of a single time-domain point would fail to provide any useful frequency information.</p><p>The accuracy of the experimental chemical shifts can be further improved by directly performing non-linear least squares time-domain fitting of the sum of cosine and sine functions, C(t1) and S(t1), to multiple t1 increments. This also allows the determination of multiple resonance frequencies that belong to the same 15N,1H pair:C(t1)=∑k=1MAk exp(−R2t1)cos(ωC,kt1)(2)S(t1)=∑k=1MAk exp(−R2t1)sin(ωC,kt1)where in the case of uniform sampling, t1 = nΔt1 (n=0,…, N−1), the sampling rate is the Nyquist frequency 1/Δt1 (spectral width). There are just 2 fit parameters per resonance k, namely the amplitude Ak and frequency ωC,k. For small N, i.e. short maximal evolution times, transverse (R2) relaxation is negligible in good approximation. For larger N and longer evolution times or larger proteins with rapid R2 relaxation, a uniform non-zero R2 value can help improve the fitting results. In principle, the smallest possible N is equal to the number of resonances (M) being fitted (i.e. N = M complex t1 increments), which is the absolute minimal sampling (AMS) limit. In practice, use of a slightly larger N>M improves the robustness and accuracy of the fitted frequencies and amplitudes.</p><p>Figure 1B,D shows the fits of AMS 3D HNCO data obtained using Eq. (2) for N = 4 t1 increments, which significantly improve the C' chemical shift accuracy to 0.06 ppm (9 Hz) for ubiquitin and 0.13 ppm (26 Hz) for AK. This corresponds to a chemical shift accuracy comparable to the C' natural linewidths (see Supporting Information). The experiment time for the AMS data of AK is only 2.5 hours as compared to 28 hours for the full 3D data set amounting to a speed-up of a factor 11.</p><p>Surprisingly, in the presence of multiple resonances, the non-linear least squares fit allows the accurate and robust determination of the dominant frequency with little effect by the presence of a 2nd minor resonance. This is shown in Figure 2 where the goodness-of-fit parameter χ2 is plotted as function of the frequency offset and the number of sampling points N. The global χ2 minimum is at the correct position (172 ppm) with a 2nd local minimum found at the frequency of the minor resonance (180 ppm). With larger N, the minimum becomes narrower and better defined and, depending on the signal-to-noise, allows a more accurate fitting of the spectral parameters. The median signal-to-noise ratios of the first 15N,1H planes of the HNCO experiments of ubiquitin and AK were approximately 200:1 and 40:1, respectively.</p><p>The AMS approach permits accurate determination of resonance positions and amplitudes also for 3D experiments where more than one 13C' cross-peak is present for each backbone 15N,1H frequency pair as is the case in the HN(CA)CO experiment.[20]Figure 3 shows for selected residues of arginine kinase HN(CA)CO and HNCO cross sections of the full 3D FT spectra along with AMS fits (red bars). The results show that both the peak positions and their amplitudes match very well the FT results that required >7-fold longer measurement times. This applies also for HN(CA)CO traces with multiple resonances present (Figure 3D,E,F), despite a median signal-to-noise ratio of the first 15N,1H plane of only about 15:1. The comparison for all assigned residues of AK, which is given in the Supporting Information, demonstrates that the AMS approach produces peak lists with high accuracy and reliability in an optimal amount of time.</p><p>The AMS approach directly fits resonance frequencies and their amplitudes from time-domain signals along an indirect dimension, such as the 13C dimension, without invoking a Fourier transformation. Hence, the performance of AMS is not bound to the uncertainty principle of FT. For example, for the HNCO of AK with N=4 the digital resolution of the Fourier spectrum along the C' dimension is 706 Hz (¼ of the spectral width). Remarkably, the average error of the AMS fitted C' frequencies is only 26 Hz or 3.7% of the digital resolution attesting to the effectiveness of this method. In most 3D NMR experiments the number of resonances along an axis is small, even for large proteins, which drastically limits the number of time points needed along the indirect dimension(s) of interest to typically well below 10. AMS is particularly beneficial for those multidimensional experiments that are less limited by sensitivity rather than by the time required to sample the indirect dimensions, which is the case for most resonance assignment experiments. As in CRAFT, the result of AMS is a set of frequencies with associated amplitudes rather than a traditional FT spectrum.</p><p>The goal of AMS is to obtain 3D cross-peak positions with the least possible number of increments and, hence, a minimal amount of time and resources. AMS does not require the use of any complex regularization, projection, or non-uniform reconstruction scheme and can be applied to any standard NMR pulse sequence. There are no computer hard drive and memory limitations for AMS, as the full, high-resolution spectrum is not explicitly reconstructed. It is possible to perform AMS fitting while the NMR experiment is still in progress. Once a desired goodness-of-fit for the time-domain signals along the dimension(s) of interest is sufficiently high, the pulse sequence could be automatically stopped, which can be useful, for example, when multiple 3D pulse sequences are queued on a spectrometer, possibly in combination with an automated sample changer to run a maximal number of experiments or samples in a minimal amount of time. Alternatively, for sample limited proteins, the emphasis can be shifted to signal averaging instead of resolution.</p><p>The AMS approach has been demonstrated here for the kind of 3D NMR experiments that are routinely used in many laboratories for protein backbone resonance assignments and which cumulatively use a significant fraction of the total measurement time on high-field NMR systems. For these types of experiments, the NMR time savings afforded by AMS compares favorably to the standard 3D FT approach as well as to alternative sampling methods.</p>","answer":"Standard three-dimensional Fourier transform (FT) NMR experiments of molecular systems often involve prolonged measurement times due to extensive sampling required along the indirect time domains to obtain adequate spectral resolution. In recent years, a wealth of alternative sampling methods has been proposed to ease this bottleneck. However, due to their algorithmic complexity, for a given sample and experiment it is often hard to determine the minimal sampling requirement, and hence the maximal achievable experimental speed up. Here we introduce an absolute minimal sampling (AMS) method that can be applied to common 3D NMR experiments. We show for the proteins ubiquitin and arginine kinase that for widely used experiments, such as 3D HNCO, accurate carbon frequencies can be obtained with a single time increment, while for others, such as 3D HN(CA)CO, all relevant information is obtained with as few as 6 increments amounting to a speed up of a factor 7 xe2x80x93 50."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Under the assumption that field potentials recorded from particular brain areas reflect the net balance of neurotransmitter activities, the dose- and time-dependent responses induced by intraperitoneal application of different neuroleptic drugs are quantified by spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram recorded from frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation. The actions of haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine, prothipendyl and thioridazine in general were characterized by increases of the spectral power in the alpha 1 and beta range, at higher dosages also in the theta range. This observed pattern of changes is in line with the neuroleptic induced spectral changes reported in the literature for other animals and man. In the light of the already known effects of other psychoactive drugs on the frequency content of field potentials in the rat, it should now be possible to classify different drugs in terms of their clinical indication. With respect to the type of neurotransmitter control underlying the changes produced by various neuroleptics, it is quite obvious from the comparisons with the respective drug effects that dopamine-D1-receptor controlled transmission is not responsible for this action. On the basis of earlier findings a possible interaction between dopamine-D2 receptor or glutamatergic transmitter control is discussed.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Perceptual user interfaces (PUIs) are an important part of ubiquitous computing. Creating such interfaces is difficult because of the image and signal processing knowledge required for creating classifiers. We propose an interactive machine-learning (IML) model that allows users to train, classify/view and correct the classifications. The concept and implementation details of IML are discussed and contrasted with classical machine learning models. Evaluations of two algorithms are also presented. We also briefly describe Image Processing with Crayons (Crayons), which is a tool for creating new camera-based interfaces using a simple painting metaphor. The Crayons tool embodies our notions of interactive machine learning 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We introduce a novel approach to incorporating domain knowledge into Support Vector Machines to improve their example efficiency. Domain knowledge is used in an Explanation Based Learning fashion to build justifications or explanations for why the training examples are assigned their given class labels. Explanations bias the large margin classifier through the interaction of training examples and domain knowledge. We develop a new learning algorithm for this Explanation-Augmented SVM (EA-SVM). It naturally extends to imperfect knowledge, a stumbling block to conventional EBL. Experimental results confirm desirable properties predicted by the analysis and demonstrate the approach on three domains. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Machine learning is an increasingly used computational tool within human-computer interaction research. While most researchers currently utilize an iterative approach to refining classifier models and performance, we propose that ensemble classification techniques may be a viable and even preferable alternative. In ensemble learning, algorithms combine multiple classifiers to build one that is superior to its components. In this paper, we present EnsembleMatrix, an interactive visualization system that presents a graphical view of confusion matrices to help users understand relative merits of various classifiers. EnsembleMatrix allows users to directly interact with the visualizations in order to explore and build combination models. We evaluate the efficacy of the system and the approach in a user study. Results show that users are able to quickly combine multiple classifiers operating on multiple feature sets to produce an ensemble classifier with accuracy that approaches best-reported performance classifying images in the CalTech-101 dataset. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  End-user interactive concept learning is a technique for interacting with large unstructured datasets, requiring insights from both human-computer interaction and machine learning. This note re-examines an assumption implicit in prior interactive machine learning research, that interaction should focus on the question \\"what class is this object?\\". We broaden interaction to include examination of multiple potential models while training a machine learning system. We evaluate this approach and find that people naturally adopt revision in the interactive machine learning process and that this improves the quality of their resulting models for difficult concepts. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  This paper addresses some of the problems that arise when applying active learning to the context of human-robot interaction (HRI). Active learning is an attractive strategy for robot learners because it has the potential to improve the accuracy and the speed of learning, but it can cause issues from an interaction perspective. Here we present three interaction modes that enable a robot to use active learning queries. The three modes differ in when they make queries: the first makes a query every turn, the second makes a query only under certain conditions, and the third makes a query only when explicitly requested by the teacher. We conduct an experiment in which 24 human subjects teach concepts to our upper-torso humanoid robot, Simon, in each interaction mode, and we compare these modes against a baseline mode using only passive supervised learning. We report results from both a learning and an interaction perspective. The data show that the three modes using active learning are preferable to the mode using passive supervised learning both in terms of performance and human subject preference, but each mode has advantages and disadvantages. Based on our results, we lay out several guidelines that can inform the design of future robotic systems that use active learning in an HRI setting. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  As surveillance cameras become widespread, filters are needed to process large streams of image data and spot interesting events. Programmed image filters generally result in low to medium performing solutions. Data-derived filters perform better in that they tap on selected image features, but require a per-sensor effort by an analyst or a machine learning expert. This contribution addresses filter shaping as a data-driven process that is ‘placed in the hands of many end-users’ with extensive domain knowledge but no expertise in machine learning. The focus is on interactive machine learning technologies as a means to achieve self programming and specialization of image filters that learn to search images by their content, sequential order, and temporal attributes. We describe and assess the performance of two interactive algorithms designed and implemented for a real case study in process monitoring for nuclear safeguards. Experiments show that interactive machine learning helps detect safeguards relevant event while significantly reducing the number of false positives. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  Medical researchers looking for evidence pertinent to a specific clinical question must navigate an increasingly voluminous corpus of published literature. This data deluge has motivated the development of machine learning and data mining technologies to facilitate efficient biomedical research. Despite the obvious labor-saving potential of these technologies and the concomitant academic interest therein, however, adoption of machine learning techniques by medical researchers has been relatively sluggish. One explanation for this is that while many machine learning methods have been proposed and retrospectively evaluated, they are rarely (if ever) actually made accessible to the practitioners whom they would benefit. In this work, we describe the ongoing development of an end-to-end interactive machine learning system at the Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center. More specifically, we have developed abstrackr, an online tool for the task of citation screening for systematic reviews. This tool provides an interface to our machine learning methods. The main aim of this work is to provide a case study in deploying cutting-edge machine learning methods that will actually be used by experts in a clinical research setting. 8. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB008):  How do you test a program when only a single user, with no expertise in software testing, is able to determine if the program is performing correctly? Such programs are common today in the form of machine-learned classifiers. We consider the problem of testing this common kind of machine-generated program when the only oracle is an end user: e.g., only you can determine if your email is properly filed. We present test selection methods that provide very good failure rates even for small test suites, and show that these methods work in both large-scale random experiments using a “gold standard” and in studies with real users. Our methods are inexpensive and largely algorithm-independent. Key to our methods is an exploitation of properties of classifiers that is not possible in traditional software testing. Our results suggest that it is plausible for time-pressured end users to interactively detect failures-even very hard-to-find failures-without wading through a large number of successful (and thus less useful) tests. We additionally show that some methods are able to find the arguably most difficult-to-detect faults of classifiers: cases where machine learning algorithms have high confidence in an incorrect result.Literature Review:","answer":"The ability to reverse actions appears to be a highly valued interaction feature in IML.

A number of IML interfaces have attempted to address this issue by allowing users to label features rather than instances, such as allowing users to select words considered representative of a document class rather than just assigning documents to categories. This approach better exploits human insight and appears to promote user engagement. BIB003 present an augmentation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that can incorporate domain knowledge to improve SVM learning. The study does not apply domain knowledge directly extracted from domain experts but does provide a suitable framework. The difficulty lies in elucidating that domain knowledge and transforming it into a format that is useful to the learner. Users do not enjoy being repeatedly asked \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" questions and so frustration and interruptability needs to be carefully managed. BIB006 highlight that an ignorant learner asking many questions can be perceived as annoying. To reduce user annoyance, there are a number of potential strategies for minimising the frequency of interaction requests or minimising the impact of individual interruptions. For example, it may be possible to reduce the frequency of interaction requests by ensuring only questions of high relevance are posed to the user. A novel approach suggested by BIB008 , in seeking to exploit the knowledge and experience of domain experts, is to allocate classification labelling to different users depending on the confidence of the learner. The probabilistic measures generated for a particular instance may be useful in deciding whether to present that instance for review by a highly experienced user versus a less experienced user. The importance of interactivity in IML is further emphasised by the fact that many applications in IML may only be feasibly evaluated by the end-users themselves BIB009 . A user training a learner for a specific task must be provided with the tools to understand how well it performs. No external methods or testing can be applied to evaluate their specific use case on their specific dataset. The execution speed of the learning algorithm may also have implications for interactivity. BIB002 hypothesise that fast algorithms are more important than inductive power. BIB007 express this attribute in another way as the need to ensure computation time at each iteration stays within human acceptable levels. These observations are consistent with the direct manipulation concept of \\"rapid incremental reversible operations whose impact on the object of interest is immediately visible\\" BIB001 . However, certain machinelearning techniques applied on large volumes of data may unavoidably have very large execution times. Careful design of the interface can help to mitigate the imposition on interactivity under these circumstances."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

In this work, the interactions between loperamide and two ACTH secretagogues, lysine vasopressin (LVP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), were investigated in patients with Addison's disease. After loperamide (16 mg orally) or placebo administration, 5 patients received LVP (0.06 IU/kg i.v. over 1 h) and 6 patients received oCRH (1 micrograms/kg i.v. as bolus). In all patients loperamide induced a significant fall in plasma ACTH levels. LVP increased ACTH levels after both loperamide (from 48 +/- 17.3 to a peak of 95 +/- 21 pmol/l) and placebo (from 231 +/- 59.5 to 365 +/- 86.6 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was not significant. CRH caused a rise in plasma ACTH after both loperamide (from 30 +/- 16.6 to a peak of 108 +/- 31 pmol/l) and placebo (from 98.5 +/- 47 to 211 +/- 61.7 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was significant, and the first phase of CRH-induced ACTH secretion was significantly lower after loperamide. These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of LVP and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, LVP and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way. Although these findings might be explained by the involvement of different intracellular ACTH-secreting mechanisms, an influence of loperamide on some suprapituitary factors modulating the ACTH response is suggested.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Loperamide\\", \\"lysine vasopressin\\", \\"LVP\\", \\"loperamide\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"corticotropin-releasing hormone\\", \\"ACTH\\", \\"LVP\\", \\"lysine vasopressin\\", \\"oCRH\\", \\"adrenocorticotropin\\", \\"CRH\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

SMOC assembly is thought to drive digital all-or-none responses, yet TLR activation by diverse microbes induces anything from mild to severe inflammation. Using single-molecule imaging of TLR4-MyDDosome signaling in living macrophages, we find that MyDDosomes assemble within minutes of TLR4 stimulation. TLR4/MD2 activation leads only to formation of TLR4/MD2 heterotetramers, but not oligomers, suggesting a stoichiometric mismatch between activated receptors and MyDDosomes. The strength of TLR4 signalling depends not only on the number and size of MyDDosomes formed but also how quickly these structures assemble. Activated TLR4, therefore, acts transiently nucleating assembly of MyDDosomes, a process that is uncoupled from receptor activation. These data explain how the oncogenic mutation of MyD88( L265P) assembles MyDDosomes in the absence of receptor activation to cause constitutive activation of pro-survival NF-κB signalling.Introduction:During infections and tissue injury, large oligomeric complexes of proteins are assembled. The complexes represent supramolecular organizing centers( SMOCs), which serve as the principal subcellular source of signals that promote inflammation( Kagan et al., 2014). In the Toll-like receptor( TLR) pathways, the most commonly discussed organizing center is the MyDDosome, which induces NF-κB and AP-1 activation to drive inflammatory transcriptional responses to infection( Motshwene et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2010; Gay et al., 2014). Cell death pathways are also regulated by SMOCs, such as the pyroptosis-inducing inflammasomes and the apoptosis- inducing DISC( Lu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2009). A common feature of these organizing centers is their ability to be assembled inducibly during infection or other stressful experiences. Structural analysis has also highlighted similarities in the architecture of SMOCs, in that they assemble into helical oligomers( Lu et al., 2014). Currently, it is believed that the purpose of assembling these complexes is to create an activation threshold in the innate immune system, such that all-or-none responses can be induced during infection. Microbes, however, contain various inflammatory mediators of varying potency. It is unclear how the innate immune system can convert this diversity of microbial stimuli into a digital response, yet single cell analysis of NF-κB activation induced by TLRs suggests that such a response is indeed induced. As TLR-dependent inflammation is controlled by the MyDDosome, an interrogation of this organizing center in living cells may provide an answer to the receptor proximal events that promote inflammation. We considered several possibilities of how MyDDosome assembly can be regulated by microbial ligands of diverse inflammatory potency. First, there may be a direct correlation between MyDDosome size and the inflammatory activity of microbial products. Second, there may be a direct correlation between the number of MyDDosomes assembled and inflammatory activity. Finally, the speed of MyDDosome assembly may dictate the inflammatory activity of individual microbial products. In order to dissect these possibilities, quantitative single cell analysis in living macrophages is required.Discussion:Here we show that in the absence of ligand, TLR4/MD2 on the surface of living immune system cells is in a dynamic equilibrium with populations of heterodimers and heterotetramers. The binding of LPS likely stabilizes the tetrameric form and initiates conformational changes that lead to signal transduction. In the absence of ligand, the ECDs of the endosomal TLR8 exist as stable, inactive preformed dimers. The binding of small molecule agonists causes an extensive conformational rearrangement within the dimer that brings the C-termini of the TLR8 ECDs closer together( Tanji et al., 2013). Our molecular dynamic analysis suggests that TLR4 activation involves a similar process in which the two ECDs tilt and rotate with respect to each other during signal transduction. This also suggests that the crystal structure of heterotetrameric TLR4/MD2 might represent an inactive transition state corresponding to the first step of the concerted activation process( Figure 2C,[Gay et al., 2006]) We also visualize, for the first time, the assembly of the membrane associated MyDDosome signaling scaffold in vivo and show that signaling flux depends on the size and number of these structures. The absence of oligomeric receptor clusters also implies that active TLR4 does not form a stoichiometric post-receptor complex with the MyDDosome. A dimer of the receptor TIR domains is assumed to have two binding sites for MyD88( Valkov et al., 2011; Núñez Miguel et al., 2007) whereas the Myddosome has about 6 MyD88 molecules both in vitro and in vivo. This stoichiometric mismatch taken together with the highly transient nature of the Myddosome( Figure 1) indicates that the activated receptor nucleates the assembly of the higher order MyDDosome structures that associate only transiently with the membrane bound receptor rather than forming a stable signalosome( Motshwene et al., 2009; Triantafilou et al., 2004). This assembly mechanism is similar to that proposed for the pyrin domain of Asc which nucleates assembly of filamentous NLRP3 inflammasomes( Lu et al., 2014). Rapid dissociation of the MyDDosome from the receptor is likely to be coupled to TLR4/MD-2 internalisation providing a mechanism for the sequential activation of the MyD88 and TRIF directed signals from the cell surface and endosomes respectively( Kagan et al., 2008; Zanoni et al., 2011). These findings also explain the properties of an oncogenic somatic mutation in MyD88( L265P) commonly found in B-cell lymphomas and other conditions such as Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia( Treon et al., 2012; Ngo et al., 2011). In these diseases, MyDDosomes assemble spontaneously in the absence of receptor activation causing constitutive activation of NFκB which acts as a pro-survival signal( Avbelj et al., 2014). Our results are consistent with another model of cooperative assembly for the Mal/TIRAP adaptor that was proposed recently Ve et al., 2017 Our data show that partial agonists stimulate the formation of a smaller number of MyDDosomes more slowly than the agonist LPS and that this leads to slower translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. LPS forms a larger number of MyDDosomes more rapidly resulting in more rapid NF-κB translocation. Surprisingly only a small number of MyDDosomes need to be formed on the cell surface for full cellular signalling to occur and we proposed that the difference between full and partial agonism is determined by MyDDosome number and the speed of their formation. This can simply be controlled by the equilibrium between the agonist or partial agonist for the TLR4 dimers present on the cell surface, with agonists having faster on-rates or slower off rates than the partial agonists that is a higher affinity. This provides a simple explanation of how a graded response is achieved in TLR4 signalling. The small number of MyDDosomes needed for signalling is reminiscent of the situation with the T-cell recptor( TCR). In this case 10 TCRs can activate a T-cell with each triggered TCR rapidly forming a larger signalling complex( Smith-Garvin et al., 2009; Irvine et al., 2002). Both TCR and TLR4 signalling are highly sensitive, show graded responses and occur at the level of the single molecule requiring a mechanism to be in place to prevent inadvertent signalling. For the TCR this is based on the affinity of the ligand presented by the MHC to the receptor, and this provides for discrimination between self and non-self by mechanisms that still need to be elucidated( Huang et al., 2013). For TLR4 it seems that receptor dimers need to be stabilised by an agonist in order to signal. Affinity is also the mechanism used by TLR4 to obtain a graded response by stabilising TLR4 dimers to greater or lesser extents. In both TCR and TLR4 signalling a larger signalling complex is formed as a result of a single molecule event leading to significant signal amplification. In summary, our study suggests that TLR4 signalling occurs at the level of single molecules with agonists stabilising low numbers of preformed dimers that then nucleate the formation of a short-lived MyDDosome signalling complex which is then removed from the cell surface. Partial agonists form less MyDDosomes more slowly leading to a smaller overall cellular response. This provides new insights into the mechanism of TLR4 signalling and how it is possible to obtain a graded response to different agonists.","answer":"Cells in the immune system have proteins at their surface that detect molecules produced by invading microbes . One of these proteins is Toll-like receptor 4 , TLR4 for short . Once TLR4 is activated , the immune cells form MyDDosomes – intricate complexes made of many different proteins . These structures form a signal that mobilizes the cell to fight the infection . In particular , the complexes set up a chain of events that leads to a gene-regulating protein getting access to the cell’s DNA . There , the protein switches on genes which produce other proteins important for inflammation , one of the body’s most important tools to fight an infection . The activation of TLR4 is thought to be an all-or-nothing mechanism: the receptors are either ‘on’ or ‘off’ . However , different microbial molecules recognized by TLR4 trigger different levels of inflammation , ranging from mild to severe . It remained unclear how an all-or-none response from the frontline receptors could lead to a gradual response from the cell . Here , Latty et al . compare what happens to TLR4 , MyDDosomes and the gene-regulating proteins when living immune cells are stimulated by different doses of two microbial molecules . These agents are both recognized by TLR4 , but they lead to different levels of inflammation . The type of microbial molecule , or their concentration , does not change how TLR4 is activated . Two TLR4 proteins can loosely associate with each together to form a dimer . When they bind a microbial molecule , the dimer becomes more stable . This changes the shape of the TLR4 proteins , which in turn triggers the formation of a scaffold of MyDDosomes . More stable TLR4 dimers are formed when the cells is in contact with a microbial molecule that triggers a strong immune reaction , and possibly when its concentration is higher . Crucially , the different microbial agents and their concentration levels modify how MyDDosomes assemble . By ‘tagging’ each protein in the complex with a fluorescent chemical , Latty et al . can follow its formation as it actually happens . When the cells are stimulated with microbial molecules that provoke a strong inflammation , the MyDDosomes may be bigger , in greater numbers , and form more quickly . In turn , under strong microbial activation , the gene-regulating protein that switches on the immune response genes goes to the DNA faster and in higher numbers . This suggests that the pace of assembly , the size and the number of MyDDosomes control the strength of the immune response . TLR4 is involved in diseases such as cancer or Alzheimer’s disease , where the body has an incorrect inflammation response . Knowing in greater detail the cellular processes activated by TLR4 could help efforts to find new drug targets for these conditions ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

particle angular correlations has been developed that fully utilizes the extensive coverage in pseudorapidity  ( @xmath10 ) and azimuthal angle  ( @xmath11 ) provided by the phobos multiplicity  ( octagon ) detector and its corresponding ability to measure the full bulk of charged particle emission down to very low momentum .studies related to this analysis initially have focused on the short - range correlations in pseudorapidity .preliminary results for cu+cu  @xcite and final results for p+p  @xcite have recently been reported .since the start of the rhic program , studies of collective phenomena via the measurement of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles have been one of the most important probes of the dynamics of nucleus  nucleus collisions . in particular ,elliptic flow is sensitive to the early stages of the collision and its study provides unique insights into the properties of the hot , dense matter that is produced in these collisions . at the root of the interpretation of elliptic flow lies the connection to the initial overlap geometry of the colliding nuclei .the azimuthal spatial asymmetry of the almond - shaped overlap region can only be reflected in the azimuthal distribution of detected particles if the produced particles do significantly interact already shortly after the initial production . at top rhic energy ,a large elliptic flow  ( @xmath12 ) signal near midrapidity has been observed  @xcite .its magnitude is found to be in agreement with hydrodynamical model calculations of a relativistic hydrodynamic fluid which supports the current view that a strongly interacting state of matter is produced early in the collision process .one of the primary motivations of colliding cu+cu and au+au nuclei at rhic was to enable a detailed study of the effect of system size on all measurable physics observables .this is particularly interesting for elliptic flow .shows the magnitude of the elliptic flow , @xmath12 , obtained from the phobos hit -

Comparatively little is known of the cytogenetics of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). This is primarily due to the low proliferation of the clonal B cells, which precludes conventional karyotyping in many cases. Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene at 14q32 are characteristic of many B-cell lymphomas and myelomas. Initial reports suggested that the t(9;14) was characteristic of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (the underlying pathological diagnosis in WM), but subsequent studies have failed to confirm the uniqueness of the translocation. To clarify this, we examined 69 cases of WM with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and failed to demonstrate an IgH translocation in 67 (97%). We conclude that IGH translocations are not a feature of WM, and the implications of this finding are discussed.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"IGH\\", \\"IgH\\", \\"immunoglobulin heavy chain\\"]}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Li et al., 2016) .This is known as scalar quantization (SQ).Other methods explore vector quantization (VQ), which is closely related to k-means clustering, in which each vector of filter coefficients is quantized jointly (Chen, J. Wilson, et al., 2015; Ullrich et al., 2017) .This is equivalent to enumerating a finite set of representers Figure 1 : Visualization of representers in scalar quantization vs. reparameterized quantization.The axes represent two different model parameters (e.g., linear filter coefficients).Small black dots are samples of the model parameters, red and blue discs are the representers.Left: in scalar quantization, the representers must be given by a Kronecker product of scalar representers along the cardinal axes, even though the distribution of samples may be skewed.Right: in reparameterized scalar quantization, the representers are still given by a Kronecker product, but in a transformed (here, rotated) space.This allows a better adaptation of the representers to the parameter distribution.(representable vectors), while in SQ the set of representers is given by the Kronecker product of representable scalar elements.VQ is much more general than SQ, in the sense that representers can be placed arbitrarily: if the set of useful filter vectors all live in a subset of the entire space, there is no benefit in having representers outside of that subset, which may be unavoidable with SQ (Figure 1 , left).Thus, VQ has the potential to yield better results, but it also suffers from the \\"curse of dimensionality\\": the number of necessary states grows exponentially with the number of dimensions, making it computationally infeasible to perform VQ for much more than a handful of dimensions.One of the key insights leading to this paper is that the strengths of SQ and VQ can be combined by representing the data in a \\"latent\\" space.This space can be an arbitrary rescaling, rotation, or otherwise warping of the original data space.SQ in this space, while making quantization computationally feasible, can provide substantially more flexibility in the choice of representers compared to the SQ in the data space (Figure 1, right) .This is in analogy to recent image compression methods based on autoencoders (Ballé, Laparra, et al., 2016; Theis et al., 2017) .The contribution of this paper is two-fold.First, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable model compression method that uses scalar quantization and entropy penalization in a reparameterized space of model parameters.The reparameterization allows us to use efficient SQ, while achieving flexibility in representing the model parameters.Second, we provide state-of-the-art results on a variety of network architectures on several datasets.This demonstrates that more complicated strategies involving pretraining, multi-stage training, sparsification, adaptive coding, etc., as employed by many previous methods, are not necessary to achieve good performance.Our method scales to modern large image datasets and neural network architectures such as ResNet-50 on ImageNet.Existing model compression methods are typically built on a combination of pruning, quantization, or coding.Pruning involves sparsifying the network either by removing individual parameters or higher level structures such as convolutional filters, layers, activations, etc.Various strategies for pruning weights include looking at the Hessian (Cun et al., 1990) or just their p norm (Han et al., 2015) .Srinivas and Babu (2015) focus on pruning individual units, and H.

Adv Pharmacol 63:1-42, 2012).Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake.Bilirubin elimination is a multifaceted process consisting of uptake of bilirubin into the hepatocytes facilitated by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.OATP1B1 polymorphism is a major determinant of serum bilirubin level but not associated with rifampicin-mediated bilirubin elevation.Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is taken up into hepatocytes by human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1; encoded for by the SLCO1B1 gene).However, because drug transporters also contribute to bilirubin elimination, the purpose of this work was to investigate the in vitro inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MRP2, and BSEP of select test drugs known to elicit hyperbilirubinemia.

Due to limited solubility and poor ionization of bilirubin and its glucuronide, the formation of estradiol 3-glucuronide was used as a surrogate to assess UGT1A1 activity, while the transport of pitavastatin, CDCF, and taurocholate were used as surrogate probe substrates to monitor the function of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, MRP2, and BSEP, respectively.In vitro, faldaprevir inhibited key processes involved in bilirubin clearance: UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (UGT1A1) (IC50 0.45 µM), which conjugates bilirubin, and hepatic uptake and efflux transporters, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (IC50 0.57 µM), OATP1B3 (IC50 0.18 µM), and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2 (IC50 6.2 µM), which transport bilirubin and its conjugates.In vitro OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition is associated with observations of benign clinical unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.3.  The results indicated that in vivo Fi values >0.2 or R-values >1.5 for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, but not UGT1A1, are associated with previously reported clinical cases of drug-induced unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.OATP1B1 and OATP1B3-mediated transport of bilirubin was confirmed and inhibition was determined for atazanavir, rifampicin, indinavir, amprenavir, cyclosporine, rifamycin SV and saquinavir.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2016 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

We tested the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen and a major regulator of angiogenesis, is upregulated in response to low heart rate and consequential increased stroke volume. Bradycardia was induced in rats by administering the bradycardic drug alinidine (3 mg/kg body weight) twice daily. Heart rate decreased by 32% for 20 to 40 minutes after injection and was chronically reduced by 10%, 14%, and 18.5% after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of treatment, respectively. Arterial pressure and cardiac output were unchanged. Left ventricular capillary length density (mm/mm(3)) increased gradually with alinidine administration; a 15% increase after 2 weeks and a 40% increase after 3 weeks of alinidine treatment were documented. Left ventricular weight, body weight, and their ratio were not significantly altered by alinidine treatment. After 1 week of treatment, before an increase in capillary length density, VEGF mRNA increased  greater than 2-fold and then declined to control levels after 3 weeks of treatment. VEGF protein was higher in alinidine-treated rats than in controls after 2 weeks and increased further after 3 weeks of treatment. Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibodies over a 2-week period completely blocked alinidine-stimulated angiogenesis. In contrast, bFGF mRNA was not altered by alinidine treatment. These data suggest that VEGF plays a key role in the angiogenic response that occurs with chronic bradycardia. The mechanism underlying this VEGF-associated angiogenesis may be an increase in stretch due to enhanced diastolic filling.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"capillary\\", \\"Arterial\\", \\"body\\", \\"heart\\", \\"endothelial cell\\", \\"Heart\\", \\"Left ventricular capillary\\", \\"coronary\\", \\"Left ventricular\\", \\"cardiac\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Antineoplastic agents (e. g., nitrogen mustard, etc.) should be given concomitantly only with great caution. Corticosteroids and Corticotropin (ACTH): may potentiate amphotericin B- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction. Avoid concomitant use unless necessary to control side effects of amphotericin B. If used concomitantly, closely monitor serum electrolytes and cardiac function. Digitalis glycosides: amphotericin B-induced hypokalemia may potentiate digitalis toxicity. Serum potassium levels and cardiac function should be closely monitored and any deficit promptly corrected. Flucytosine: while a synergistic relationship with amphotericin B has been reported, concomitant use may increase the toxicity of flucytosine by possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or impairing its renal excretion. Imidazoles (e. g., ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, etc.): in vitro and animal studies with the combination of amphotericin B and imidazoles suggest that imidazoles may induce fungal resistance to amphotericin B.

We gather and annotate a large scale dataset from Twitter, MMHS150K, and propose different models that jointly analyze textual and visual information for hate speech detection, comparing them with unimodal detection. We provide quantitative and qualitative results and analyze the challenges of the proposed task. We find that, even though images are useful for the hate speech detection task, current multimodal models cannot outperform models analyzing only text. We discuss why and open the field and the dataset for further research.IntroductionSocial Media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit have empowered individuals' voices and facilitated freedom of expression. However they have also been a breeding ground for hate speech and other types of online harassment. Hate speech is defined in legal literature as speech (or any form of expression) that expresses (or seeks to promote, or has the capacity to increase) hatred against a person or a group of people because of a characteristic they share, or a group to which they belong BIBREF0. Twitter develops this definition in its hateful conduct policy as violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.In this work we focus on hate speech detection. Due to the inherent complexity of this task, it is important to distinguish hate speech from other types of online harassment. In particular, although it might be offensive to many people, the sole presence of insulting terms does not itself signify or convey hate speech. And, the other way around, hate speech may denigrate or threaten an individual or a group of people without the use of any profanities. People from the african-american community, for example, often use the term nigga online, in everyday language, without malicious intentions to refer to folks within their community, and the word cunt is often used in non hate speech publications and without any sexist purpose. The goal of this work is not to discuss if racial slur, such as nigga, should be pursued. The goal is to distinguish between publications using offensive terms and publications attacking communities, which we call hate speech.Modern social media content usually include images and text. Some of these multimodal publications are only hate speech because of the combination of the text with a certain image. That is because, as we have stated, the presence of offensive terms does not itself signify hate speech, and the presence of hate speech is often determined by the context of a publication. Moreover, users authoring hate speech tend to intentionally construct publications where the text is not enough to determine they are hate speech. This happens especially in Twitter, where multimodal tweets are formed by an image and a short text, which in many cases is not enough to judge them. In those cases, the image might give extra context to make a proper judgement. Fig. FIGREF5 shows some of such examples in MMHS150K.The contributions of this work are as follows:[noitemsep,leftmargin=*]We propose the novel task of hate speech detection in multimodal publications, collect, annotate and publish a large scale dataset.We evaluate state of the art multimodal models on this specific task and compare their performance with unimodal detection. Even though images are proved to be useful for hate speech detection, the proposed multimodal models do not outperform unimodal textual models.We study the challenges of the proposed task, and open the field for future research.Related Work ::: Visual and Textual Data FusionA typical task in multimodal visual and textual analysis is to learn an alignment between feature spaces. To do that, usually a CNN and a RNN are trained jointly to learn a joint embedding space from aligned multimodal data. This approach is applied in tasks such as image captioning BIBREF14, BIBREF15 and multimodal image retrieval BIBREF16, BIBREF17. On the other hand, instead of explicitly learning an alignment between two spaces, the goal of Visual Question Answering (VQA) is to merge both data modalities in order to decide which answer is correct. This problem requires modeling very precise correlations between the image and the question representations. The VQA task requirements are similar to our hate speech detection problem in multimodal publications, where we have a visual and a textual input and we need to combine both sources of information to understand the global context and make a decision. We thus take inspiration from the VQA literature for the tested models. Early VQA methods BIBREF18 fuse textual and visual information by feature concatenation. Later methods, such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling BIBREF19, utilize bilinear pooling to learn multimodal features. An important limitation of these methods is that the multimodal features are fused in the latter model stage, so the textual and visual relationships are modeled only in the last layers. Another limitation is that the visual features are obtained by representing the output of the CNN as a one dimensional vector, which losses the spatial information of the input images. In a recent work, Gao et al. BIBREF20 propose a feature fusion scheme to overcome these limitations. They learn convolution kernels from the textual information –which they call question-guided kernels– and convolve them with the visual information in an earlier stage to get the multimodal features. Margffoy-Tuay et al. BIBREF21 use a similar approach to combine visual and textual information, but they address a different task: instance segmentation guided by natural language queries. We inspire in these latest feature fusion works to build the models for hate speech detection.The MMHS150K datasetExisting hate speech datasets contain only textual data. Moreover, a reference benchmark does not exists. Most of the published datasets are crawled from Twitter and distributed as tweet IDs but, since Twitter removes reported user accounts, an important amount of their hate tweets is no longer accessible. We create a new manually annotated multimodal hate speech dataset formed by 150,000 tweets, each one of them containing text and an image. We call the dataset MMHS150K, and made it available online . In this section, we explain the dataset creation steps.The MMHS150K dataset ::: Tweets GatheringWe used the Twitter API to gather real-time tweets from September 2018 until February 2019, selecting the ones containing any of the 51 Hatebase terms that are more common in hate speech tweets, as studied in BIBREF9. We filtered out retweets, tweets containing less than three words and tweets containing porn related terms. From that selection, we kept the ones that included images and downloaded them. Twitter applies hate speech filters and other kinds of content control based on its policy, although the supervision is based on users' reports. Therefore, as we are gathering tweets from real-time posting, the content we get has not yet passed any filter.Methodology ::: Unimodal Treatment ::: Images.All images are resized such that their shortest size has 500 pixels. During training, online data augmentation is applied as random cropping of 299times 299 patches and mirroring. We use a CNN as the image features extractor which is an Imagenet BIBREF24 pre-trained Google Inception v3 architecture BIBREF25. The fine-tuning process of the Inception v3 layers aims to modify its weights to extract the features that, combined with the textual information, are optimal for hate speech detection.Methodology ::: Multimodal ArchitecturesThe objective of this work is to build a hate speech detector that leverages both textual and visual data and detects hate speech publications based on the context given by both data modalities. To study how the multimodal context can boost the performance compared to an unimodal context we evaluate different models: a Feature Concatenation Model (FCM), a Spatial Concatenation Model (SCM) and a Textual Kernels Model (TKM). All of them are CNN+RNN models with three inputs: the tweet image, the tweet text and the text appearing in the image (if any).Methodology ::: Multimodal Architectures ::: Spatial Concatenation Model (SCM)Instead of using the latest feature vector before classification of the Inception v3 as the visual representation, in the SCM we use the 8times 8times 2048 feature map after the last Inception module. Then we concatenate the 150 dimension vectors encoding the tweet text and the tweet image text at each spatial location of that feature map. The resulting multimodal feature map is processed by two Inception-E blocks BIBREF28. After that, dropout and average pooling are applied and, as in the FCM model, three fully connected layers are used to reduce the dimensionality until the classification layer.Methodology ::: Multimodal Architectures ::: Textual Kernels Model (TKM)The TKM design, inspired by BIBREF20 and BIBREF21, aims to capture interactions between the two modalities more expressively than concatenation models. As in SCM we use the 8times 8times 2048 feature map after the last Inception module as the visual representation. From the 150 dimension vector encoding the tweet text, we learn K_t text dependent kernels using independent fully connected layers that are trained together with the rest of the model. The resulting K_t text dependent kernels will have dimensionality of 1times 1times 2048. We do the same with the feature vector encoding the image text, learning K_{it} kernels. The textual kernels are convolved with the visual feature map in the channel dimension at each spatial location, resulting in a 8times 8times (K_i+K_{it}) multimodal feature map, and batch normalization is applied. Then, as in the SCM, the 150 dimension vectors encoding the tweet text and the tweet image text are concatenated at each spatial dimension. The rest of the architecture is the same as in SCM: two Inception-E blocks, dropout, average pooling and three fully connected layers until the classification layer. The number of tweet textual kernels K_t and tweet image textual kernels K_it is set to K_t = 10 and K_it = 5. The TKM architecture is illustrated in Fig. FIGREF29.ResultsTable TABREF31 shows the F-score, the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and the mean accuracy (ACC) of the proposed models when different inputs are available. TT refers to the tweet text, IT to the image text and I to the image. It also shows results for the LSTM, for the Davison method proposed in BIBREF7 trained with MMHS150K, and for random scores. Fig. FIGREF32 shows the Precision vs Recall plot and the ROC curve (which plots the True Positive Rate vs the False Positive Rate) of the different models.First, notice that given the subjectivity of the task and the discrepancies between annotators, getting optimal scores in the evaluation metrics is virtually impossible. However, a system with relatively low metric scores can still be very useful for hate speech detection in a real application: it will fire on publications for which most annotators agree they are hate, which are often the stronger attacks. The proposed LSTM to detect hate speech when only text is available, gets similar results as the method presented in BIBREF7, which we trained with MMHS150K and the same splits. However, more than substantially advancing the state of the art on hate speech detection in textual publications, our key purpose in this work is to introduce and work on its detection on multimodal publications. We use LSTM because it provides a strong representation of the tweet texts.The FCM trained only with images gets decent results, considering that in many publications the images might not give any useful information for the task. Fig. FIGREF33 shows some representative examples of the top hate and not hate scored images of this model. Many hate tweets are accompanied by demeaning nudity images, being sexist or homophobic. Other racist tweets are accompanied by images caricaturing black people. Finally, MEMES are also typically used in hate speech publications. The top scored images for not hate are portraits of people belonging to minorities. This is due to the use of slur inside these communities without an offensive intention, such as the word nigga inside the afro-american community or the word dyke inside the lesbian community. These results show that images can be effectively used to discriminate between offensive and non-offensive uses of those words.Despite the model trained only with images proves that they are useful for hate speech detection, the proposed multimodal models are not able to improve the detection compared to the textual models. Besides the different architectures, we have tried different training strategies, such as initializing the CNN weights with a model already trained solely with MMHS150K images or using dropout to force the multimodal models to use the visual information. Eventually, though, these models end up using almost only the text input for the prediction and producing very similar results to those of the textual models. The proposed multimodal models, such as TKM, have shown good performance in other tasks, such as VQA. Next, we analyze why they do not perform well in this task and with this data:[noitemsep,leftmargin=*]Noisy data. A major challenge of this task is the discrepancy between annotations due to subjective judgement. Although this affects also detection using only text, its repercussion is bigger in more complex tasks, such as detection using images or multimodal detection.Complexity and diversity of multimodal relations. Hate speech multimodal publications employ a lot of background knowledge which makes the relations between visual and textual elements they use very complex and diverse, and therefore difficult to learn by a neural network.Small set of multimodal examples. Fig. FIGREF5 shows some of the challenging multimodal hate examples that we aimed to detect. But although we have collected a big dataset of 150K tweets, the subset of multimodal hate there is still too small to learn the complex multimodal relations needed to identify multimodal hate.Figure 1.

In social media conversations, users show different stances and attitudes towards rumourous stories. Some users take a definite stance, supporting or denying the rumour at issue, while others just comment it, or ask for additional evidence related to the veracity of the rumour. On this line, a new shared task has been proposed at SemEval-2017 (Task 8, SubTask A), which is focused on rumour stance classification in English tweets. The goal is predicting user stance towards emerging rumours in Twitter, in terms of supporting, denying, querying, or commenting the original rumour, looking at the conversation threads originated by the rumour. This paper describes a new approach to this task, where the use of conversation-based and affective-based features, covering different facets of affect, has been explored. Our classification model outperforms the best-performing systems for stance classification at SemEval-2017 Task 8, showing the effectiveness of the feature set proposed.SemEval-2017 Task 8: RumourEvalThe SemEval-2017 Task 8 Task A BIBREF2 has as its main objective to determine the stance of the users in a Twitter thread towards a given rumour, in terms of support, denying, querying or commenting (SDQC) on the original rumour. Rumour is defined as a “circulating story of questionable veracity, which is apparently credible but hard to verify, and produces sufficient skepticism and/or anxiety so as to motivate finding out the actual truth” BIBREF7 . The task was very timing due to the growing importance of rumour resolution in the breaking news and to the urgency of preventing the spreading of misinformation.Dataset The data for this task are taken from Twitter conversations about news-related rumours collected by BIBREF3 . They were annotated using four labels (SDQC): support - S (when tweet's author support the rumour veracity); deny -D (when tweet's author denies the rumour veracity); query - Q (when tweet's author ask for additional information/evidence); comment -C (when tweet's author just make a comment and does not give important information to asses the rumour veracity). The distribution consists of three sets: development, training and test sets, as summarized in Table TABREF3 , where you can see also the label distribution and the news related to the rumors discussed. Training data consist of 297 Twitter conversations and 4,238 tweets in total with related direct and nested replies, where conversations are associated to seven different breaking news. Test data consist of 1049 tweets, where two new rumourous topics were added.Participants Eight teams participated in the task. The best performing system was developed by Turing (78.4 in accuracy). ECNU, MamaEdha, UWaterloo, and DFKI-DKT utilized ensemble classifier. Some systems also used deep learning techniques, including Turing, IKM, and MamaEdha. Meanwhile, NileTRMG and IITP used classical classifier (SVM) to build their systems. Most of the participants exploited word embedding to construct their feature space, beside the Twitter domain features.Structural FeaturesThey were designed taking into account several Twitter data characteristics, and then selecting the most relevant features to improve the classification performance. The set of structural features that we used is listed below.Retweet Count: The number of retweet of each tweet.Question Mark: presence of question mark \\"?\\"; binary value (0 and 1).Question Mark Count: number of question marks present in the tweet.Hashtag Presence: this feature has a binary value 0 (if there is no hashtag in the tweet) or 1 (if there is at least one hashtag in the tweet).Text Length: number of characters after removing Twitter markers such as hashtags, mentions, and URLs.URL Count: number of URL links in the tweet.Conversation Based FeaturesThese features are devoted to exploit the peculiar characteristics of the dataset, which have a tree structure reflecting the conversation thread.Text Similarity to Source Tweet: Jaccard Similarity of each tweet with its source tweet.Text Similarity to Replied Tweet: the degree of similarity between the tweet with the previous tweet in the thread (the tweet is a reply to that tweet).Tweet Depth: the depth value is obtained by counting the node from sources (roots) to each tweet in their hierarchy.Dialogue-Act FeaturesWe also included additional 11 categories from bf LIWC, which were already proven to be effective in dialogue-act task in previous work BIBREF6 . Basically, these features are part of the affective feature group, but we present them separately because we are interested in exploring the contribution of such feature set separately. This feature set was obtained by selecting 4 communicative goals related to our classes in the stance task: agree-accept (support), reject (deny), info-request (question), and opinion (comment). The 11 LIWC categories include:Agree-accept: Assent, Certain, Affect;Reject: Negate, Inhib;Info-request: You, Cause;Opinion: Future, Sad, Insight, Cogmech.Experiments, Evaluation and AnalysisWe used the RumourEval dataset from SemEval-2017 Task 8 described in Section SECREF2 . We defined the rumour stance detection problem as a simple four-way classification task, where every tweet in the dataset (source and direct or nested reply) should be classified into one among four classes: support, deny, query, and comment. We conducted a set of experiments in order to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of our proposed feature set..The results are summarized in Table TABREF28 , showing that our system outperforms all of the other systems in terms of accuracy. Our best result was obtained by a simple configuration with a support vector classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Our model performed better than the best-performing systems in SemEval 2017 Task 8 Subtask A (Turing team, BIBREF19 ), which exploited deep learning approach by using LTSM-Branch model. In addition, we also got a higher accuracy than the system described in BIBREF20 , which exploits a Random Forest classifier and word embeddings based features.We experimented with several classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, noting that SVM outperforms the other classifiers on this task. We explored the parameter space by tuning the SVM hyperparameters, namely the penalty parameter C, kernel type, and class weights (to deal with class imbalance). We tested several values for C (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000), four different kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid) and weighted the classes based on their distribution in the training data. The best result was obtained with C=1, RBF kernel, and without class weighting.An ablation test was conducted to explore the contribution of each feature set. Table TABREF32 shows the result of our ablation test, by exploiting several feature sets on the same classifier (SVM with RBF kernel) . This evaluation includes macro-averages of precision, recall and INLINEFORM0 -score as well as accuracy. We also presented the scores for each class in order to get a better understanding of our classifier's performance.Using only conversational, affective, or dialogue-act features (without structural features) did not give a good classification result. Set B (conversational features only) was not able to detect the query and deny classes, while set C (affective features only) and D (dialogue-act features only) failed to catch the support, query, and deny classes. Conversational features were able to improve the classifier performance significantly, especially in detecting the support class. Sets E, H, I, and K which utilize conversational features induce an improvement on the prediction of the support class (roughly from 0.3 to 0.73 on precision). Meanwhile, the combination of affective and dialogue-act features was able to slightly improve the classification of the query class. The improvement can be seen from set E to set K where the INLINEFORM0 -score of query class increased from 0.52 to 0.58. Overall, the best result was obtained by the K set which encompasses all sets of features. It is worth to be noted that in our best configuration system, not all of affective and dialogue-act features were used in our feature vector. After several optimization steps, we found that some features were not improving the system's performance. Our final list of affective and dialogue-act based features includes: DAL Activation, ANEW Dominance, Emolex Negative, Emolex Fear, LIWC Assent, LIWC Cause, LIWC Certain and LIWC Sad. Therefore, we have only 17 columns of features in the best performing system covering structural, conversational, affective and dialogue-act features.We conducted a further analysis of the classification result obtained by the best performing system (79.50 on accuracy). Table TABREF30 shows the confusion matrix of our result. On the one hand, the system is able to detect the comment tweets very well. However, this result is biased due to the number of comment data in the dataset. On the other hand, the system is failing to detect denying tweets, which were falsely classified into comments (68 out of 71). Meanwhile, approximately two thirds of supporting tweets and almost half of querying tweets were classified into the correct class by the system.In order to assess the impact of class imbalance on the learning, we performed an additional experiment with a balanced dataset using the best performing configuration. We took a subset of the instances equally distributed with respect to their class from the training set (330 instances for each class) and test set (71 instances for each class). As shown in Table TABREF31 , our classifier was able to correctly predict the underrepresented classes much better, although the overall accuracy is lower (59.9%). The result of this analysis clearly indicates that class imbalance has a negative impact on the system performance.AcknowledgementsEndang Wahyu Pamungkas, Valerio Basile and Viviana Patti were partially funded by Progetto di Ateneo/CSP 2016 (Immigrants, Hate and Prejudice in Social Media, S1618_L2_BOSC_01).Table 1: Semeval-2017 Task 8 (A) dataset distribution.Table 2: Results and comparison with state of the artTable 3: Confusion MatrixTable 4: Confusion Matrix on Balanced DatasetTable 5: Ablation test on several feature sets.Question: What conversation-based features are used?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"Text Similarity to Source Tweet\\", \\"Text Similarity to Replied Tweet\\", \\"Tweet Depth\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"Conversation Based Features\\", \\"These features are devoted to exploit the peculiar characteristics of the dataset, which have a tree structure reflecting the conversation thread.\\", \\"Text Similarity to Source Tweet: Jaccard Similarity of each tweet with its source tweet.\\", \\"Text Similarity to Replied Tweet: the degree of similarity between the tweet with the previous tweet in the thread (the tweet is a reply to that tweet).\\", \\"Tweet Depth: the depth value is obtained by counting the node from sources (roots) to each tweet in their hierarchy.\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Rizatriptan is a selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine. This randomized double- blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg/caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy. Of patients expressing a preference (89.1%), more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine/caffeine (69.9 vs. 30.1%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54.2% of patients who preferred ergotamine/caffeine. The co-primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan. Forty-nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 24.3% treated with ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% for rizatriptan and 47.3% for ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine/caffeine within 30 min of dosing. Almost 36% of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001). Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine/caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea, vomiting, phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p < or = 0.001). More patients were (completely, very or somewhat) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan (69.8%) than at 2 h after treatment with ergotamine/caffeine (38.6%, p < or = 0.001). Recurrence rates were 31.4% with rizatriptan and 15.3% with ergotamine/caffeine. Both active treatments were well tolerated. The most common adverse events (incidence > or = 5% in one group) after rizatriptan and ergotamine/caffeine, respectively, were dizziness (6.7 and 5.3%), nausea (4.2 and 8.5%) and somnolence (5.5 and 2.3%).","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"5-HT\\", \\"Rizatriptan\\", \\"caffeine\\", \\"ergotamine\\", \\"rizatriptan\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"migraine\\", \\"pain\\", \\"dizziness\\", \\"vomiting\\", \\"nausea\\", \\"phonophobia\\", \\"photophobia\\", \\"Headache\\", \\"somnolence\\", \\"headache\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

NLPO, a parameterized-masked extension of PPO, learns to mask out less relevant tokens in-context as it trains. NLPO accomplishes this via top-p sampling, which restricts tokens to the smallest possible set whose cumulative probability is greater than the probability parameter p (Holtzman et al., 2018). Specifically, NLPOmaintains a masking policy pi_{psi}: the masking policy is a copy of the current policy (pi_{theta}), but is updated only every mu steps.A parameterized-invalid-mask is created from pi_{psi} by first selecting the top-p tokens from the vocabulary,444pi_{psi} could be trained with alternate sampling techniques like top-k or beam search (or even hard-coded via rules by domain experts), though we find top-p sampling to be most effective in practice. and then applying an invalid-mask to the remaining tokens—i.e. setting their probabilities to zero when sampling actions from pi_{theta} during training;this periodic updating policy pi_{psi} is inspired by off-policy Q-learning algorithms (Andrychowicz et al., 2017),providing the policy pi_{theta} with an additional constraint that balances between the benefits of containing more task relevant information than the KL penalty derived from pi_{0} and the risk of reward hacking.We provide pseudocode in Algorithm 1 (green portions highlight the differences with PPO). PPO vs. NLPO.Figure 2 shows that NLPO generally outperforms PPO and supervised, especially when applied after supervised training.We hypothesize that the primary reason for NLPO’s improved performance and stability is because the masking policy provides an additional constraint for the current policy.This constraint is not based on the initial untuned policy like the KL penalty but of the policy from mu iterations ago and likely contains more task-relevant information learned during RL training.Table 3 (and Appendix Table 8) shows how performance increases up to a point and then decreases as p in top-p sampling is increased for the masking policy, relaxing the constraint by eliminating less tokens at each step, implying that there is a balance to be found in how much the model should be constrained during RL training.Question: Why is the masking policy only updated every certain number of steps?","answer":"The authors mention that they update the masking function every \\"mu\\" steps, but the main text of the paper itself does not appear to contain the exact value of mu itself - there is a possibility that the author's model could work with mu=1 instead (i.e. update every step) instead of updating it every couple of steps (i.e. mu > 1), though the authors do not explain in this paper if this were done. However, the authors mention that one reason why NLPO outperforms PPO is probably because of this dynamic masking function that is updated occasionally - this indicates to us that mu is probably not an unbounded or very large number (if mu were very large, tending to infinity, the function would no longer be dynamic)."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The gene encoding the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -specific dUTPase was amplified from virus DNA by PCR. The active enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and in insect cells as a non-fusion protein. The protein from E. coli specifically converted dUTP to dUMP and did not react with other dNTPs or NTPs. Preliminary experiments yielded a Km value of about 0. 8 microM for dUTP. MAbs against the dUTPase reacted with a protein of approximately 31 kDa in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) -stimulated B cells harbouring either type 1 or type 2 EBV. The protein was found in untreated cells at low levels, whereas induction of the lytic replication cycle by TPA treatment or by providing the immediate early transactivator BZLF1 in trans resulted in increased expression. We demonstrated that the virus dUTPase isolated from EBV-infected cells is a phosphoprotein. The protein expressed in insect cells was used to test for the presence of specific antibodies in sera from normal, healthy carriers and from patients with various diseases. While the sera of EBV-negative individuals (0 / 3) or healthy carriers (0 / 33) did not contain detectable levels of antibodies, patients with mononucleosis (5 / 18), chronic EBV infection (2 / 7), EBV reactivation (7 / 20) and human immunodeficiency virus infection (5 / 24) showed elevated antibody titres against the enzyme. This indicated that the dUTPase is expressed during EBV replication and reactivation.

We aimed to compare these agents in patients with KRAS (exon 2) codon 12/13 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.  methods In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18-75 years with stage IV, histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, an estimated life expectancy of greater than 3 months, and adequate organ function, from centres in Germany and Austria. Patients were centrally randomised by fax (1:1) to FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (using permuted blocks of randomly varying size), stratified according to ECOG performance status, number of metastatic sites, white blood cell count, and alkaline phosphatase concentration. The primary endpoint was objective response analysed by intention to treat. The study has completed recruitment, but follow-up of participants is ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00433927.  findings Between Jan 23, 2007, and Sept 19, 2012, 592 patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumours were randomly assigned and received treatment (297 in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab group and 295 in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group). 184 ( 62·0 % , 95 % CI 56·2 - 67·5 ) patients in the cetuximab group achieved an objective response compared with 171 ( 58·0 % , 52·1 - 63·7 ) in the bevacizumab group ( odds ratio 1·18 , 95 % CI 0·85 - 1·64 ; p=0·18 ) . Median progression-free survival was 10·0 months (95% CI 8·8-10·8) in the cetuximab group and 10·3 months (9·8-11·3) in the bevacizumab group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·88-1·26; p=0·55); however, median overall survival was 28·7 months (95% CI 24·0-36·6) in the cetuximab group compared with 25·0 months (22·7-27·6) in the bevacizumab group (HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·62-0·96; p=0·017). Safety profiles were consistent with the known side-effects of the study drugs. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in both treatment groups were haematotoxicity (73 [25%] of 297 patients in the cetuximab group vs 62 [21%] of 295 patients in the bevacizumab group), skin reactions (77 [26%] vs six [2%]), and diarrhoea (34 [11%] vs 40 [14%]).  interpretation Although the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response did not significantly differ between the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab groups, the association with longer overall survival suggests that FOLFIRI plus cetuximab could be the preferred first-line regimen for patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.  funding Merck KGaA.sentence: 184 ( 62·0 % , 95 % CI 56·2 - 67·5 ) patients in the cetuximab group achieved an objective response compared with 171 ( 58·0 % , 52·1 - 63·7 ) in the bevacizumab group ( odds ratio 1·18 , 95 % CI 0·85 - 1·64 ; p=0·18 ) .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

It is a cubiodal, nonciliated cell in human and rabbit terminal bronchioles, containing a basally-situated nucleus, an apical dome extending variable distances into the airway lumen, and discrete, oval densely-staining granules (Figure 2). Ultrastructural and morphometric analysis by Plopper and colleagues provided insights into Clara cell function, and led to ongoing studies demonstrating critical roles in barrier maintenance, secretion, and metabolism (Stripp and Reynolds, 2006). Multispecies comparisons established diversity as a defining hallmark of Clara cell biology (Figure 3). In spite of extensive structural and functional variation, antibody reagents specific to the secretoglobin (SCGB1A1) family allowed Clara cells and their variants to be identified on the basis of secreted protein expression (Reynolds et al., 2002). Members of the SCGB protein class are referred to as uteroglobin (Ug) in humans and rabbits or Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP, CC10) in mice and rats. We will use CCSP as a catch-all phrase to indicate secretoglobin 1A1.</p><p>This review describes unique aspects of Clara cell biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology that define this cell as a facultative progenitor (i.e., a proliferatively senescent, metabolically active cell that retains the ability to reenter the cell cycle in response to injury of the bronchiolar epithelium) and a subset of Clara cells as tissue-specific stem cells. These functional characteristics support the potential for Clara cells to serve as cancer-initiating cells (Figure 4).</p>Origin and plasticity: Establishment of the Clara cell pool<p>Embryological studies established that all airway epithelial cells, with the possible exception of neuroepithelial cells, are derived sequentially from the foregut endoderm (Rawlins et al., 2008). Subdivision of the conducting airway epithelium begins during the second trimester in human lung, and the earliest CCSP-expressing cells are positioned within the luminal aspect of neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) (Khoor et al., 1996). Continuous labeling studies in hamsters supported the conclusion that neuroepithelial bodies serve as mitotic centers during lung development (Hoyt et al., 1991). Neural peptides secreted by pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are epithelial mitogens (Shan et al., 2004). Analyses of naphthalene-injured lungs indicated a central role for NEB in airway segmentation and the establishment of unique Clara cell pools (Stripp and Reynolds, 2006). However, normal prenatal lung development in NEB-deficient mice suggested that this structure may serve as a marker for an as yet undefined signaling center (Ito et al., 2000). Additional studies are needed to determine the functional significance of this Clara cell-NEB association.</p><p>A stabilized form of β-catenin expressed specifically in CCSP-positive cells in mice indicated that functional maturation of Clara cells was modulated by Wnt signaling during prenatal lung development (Reynolds et al., 2008). Two populations of Clara cells may thus exist in the adult bronchiole, those \\"born\\" during lung development and those resulting from proliferation and differentiation in air-breathing post-natal animals. The functional significance of these putative \\"embryological\\" and adult Clara cells and their impact on lung injury, repair, and susceptibility to chronic lung disease are under investigation. Clara cells with tissue specific stem cell function (see below) may be analogous to canalicular stage Clara cell precursors, and constitutive β-catenin signaling in adulthood may mimic tissue specific stem cell specification. Additional studies using regulated expression of Wnt-pathway agonists and antagonists could substantiate this interpretation and define the microenvironmental influences that delineate the bronchiolar stem cell.</p><p>Individual Clara cells retain the capacity to refine their phenotype in response to alterations in the lung milieu, microenvironmental influences specific to trophic units, and exposure to environmental agents including ozone, pathogens and their byproducts, and chemotherapeutic agents. Analysis of how mouse Clara cells respond to allergic inflammation or the Th2 cytokine, IL-13, suggest a lineage relationship between Clara cells and mucus cells (Kuperman et al., 2002); (Evans et al., 2004; Larson et al., 2004). Pulse labeling studies showed that mucus metaplasia of Clara cells generates a terminally differentiated cell that can no longer enter the cell cycle. Thus, Clara cell phenotypic plasticity could be a physiological Catch-22: metaplasia to a mucus producing cell may provide critical protection of the airways but also lead to loss of reparative potential in chronic lung disease.</p>Functions: Clara cells as reparative cells for the airway epithelium<p>Within the normal lung, Clare cell proliferation maintains the facultative progenitor cell pool (self-renewal) and restores terminally differentiated cells of the conducting airway epithelium (ciliated cells). This vast reparative reservoir distinguishes lung epithelia from tissues such as the intestine that are maintained through proliferation and differentiation of tissue-specific stem cells. The unique features of lung epithelial maintenance and repair suggest that chronic lung disease could be treated through interventions that stabilize the Clara cell pool or by cell replacement strategies that restore this abundant cell type.</p><p>Studies designed to test the hypothesis that tissue-specific stem cells participate in maintenance of the bronchiolar epithelium suggest that this specialized cell is mitotically inactive in the steady state (Giangreco et al., 2009) and under conditions in which the facultative progenitor cell pool is activated by ozone-mediated injury of ciliated cells (Reynolds et al., 2000). Parenteral naphthalene exposure reduces the Clara cell population and activates a putative bronchiolar tissue-specific stem cell located within the NEB and bronchiolar-alveolar duct junction (BADJ) (Stripp and Reynolds, 2008). Both microenvironments contained naphthalene-resistant cells that could initiate and sustain repopulation of the airway epithelium. These cells divide infrequently and were distinguished from most Clara cells by less expression of the phase 1 enzyme, CYP450-2F2. Genetic sensitization of Clara cells to the anti-viral drug, gancyclovir, demonstrated that the bronchiolar stem cell expressed CCSP. These studies were the basis for naming the bronchiolar stem cell a variant CCSP-expressing cell, the vCE. vCEs are rare, sequestered within specific microenvironments (NEB or BADJ), slow-cycling (label-retaining), relatively undifferentiated (CYP450-2F2 low), and express CCSP.</p><p>Caveats to this \\"stemness\\" claim include identification of multiple label-retaining cell types (neuroepithelial and differentiated Clara cells) in naphthalene injured bronchioles, identical differentiation potential of vCE and Clara cells, and failure to fulfill Koch's postulates through isolation and functional analysis of putative stem cells in vivo. One study employed the cell surface markers, stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1) and CD34, to identify a population of CCSP-pro surfactant protein C (proSPC) dual positive cells (Kim et al., 2005). Although this enriched cell population was contaminated with ciliated cells, in vitro analysis indicated that these cells could generate daughters that expressed markers associated with terminally differentiated bronchiolar and alveolar cell types. The validity of Sca1 and CD34 as markers for the bronchoalveolar stem cell has been questioned (McQualter et al., 2009; Teisanu et al., 2009). A sharp border is apparent between lineage-traced cells of the terminal bronchiole and the alveolar duct of steady state mice (Rawlins et al., 2009; Reynolds et al., 2008). These data, in addition to demonstrations that Clara cells alter their phenotype in response to injury, suggest that in vitro culture induces a third level of Clara cell plasticity, the ability to assume phenotypic characteristics of secretory cells from adjacent compartments. The functional significance of this phenotypic plasticity and its contribution to lung health and disease is unexplored.</p>Associated pathologies: Clara cells and cancer<p>Inflammation encourages neoplasia, as shown by elevated cancer risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the inverse correlation between lung tumor macrophage content and patient survival (Malkinson, 2005). Clara cells may regulate inflammation through secretion of CCSP and consequent regulation of eicsoanioid production and the clotting cascade, immune effecter cell chemotaxis and phagocytosis. In human adenocarcinomas, most tumor cells are CCSP-negative even if they have morphologic or other biochemical characteristics of Clara cells (Linnoila et al., 2000). Transfection of CCSP-negative lung cancer cell lines with the CCSP gene diminished their invasiveness and anchorage-independence. CCSP −/− mice are more susceptible to chemically-induced lung tumorigenesis than wild type controls (Linnoila et al., 2000). Thus, CCSP may have tumor suppressor activity that is due in part to its anti-inflammatory function.</p><p>The cellular heterogeneity within a tumor makes it difficult to assign a cell of origin, particularly if a characteristic cell marker such as CCSP is down-modulated upon neoplastic conversion and the cell of interest is phenotypically plastic. Pro-SPC mRNA, a marker of alveolar type 2 cells, is often expressed in lung tumors in mice. Whether this is because tumors arise from type 2 cells or because cancer cells gain this expression is unclear. The presence of both of these cell-specific markers, along stem cell markers such as Sca1 and CD34, led Kim et al (Kim et al., 2005) to propose a subset of tissue stem cells as the cells of lung tumor origin. Figure 4A shows a fascinating example of the cellular heterogeneity in a spontaneous mouse lung tumor found in a FVB/N mouse, a strain susceptible to chemically-induced lung tumorogenesis. Most cells within the lung tumor express proSPC exclusively, whereas rare cells, including highly aggressive cells invading a bronchiole, express both SPC and CCSP. Figure 4B illustrates label-retention in uninvolved and tumor cells, indicating that a subpopulation of tumor cells is long-lived and cycles infrequently. Identification of a rare population of such \\"label-retaining\\" cells supports the concept of a cancer stem cell.</p><p>Clara cells are non-ciliated secretory cells in the small airways and trachea. Their morphology and biochemical composition display amazing heterogeneity within the airway epithelium of a single species, among different species, and in response to injury.</p><p>Clara cells have several lung protective functions. They detoxify xenobiotics and oxidant gasses, control the extent of inflammation, participate in mucociliary clearance of environmental agents, and proliferate / differentiate to maintain the ciliated cell population.</p><p>Clara cells are secretory and the source of Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) and contribute surfactant apoproteins A, B, and D, proteases, antimicrobial peptides, several cytokines and chemokines, and mucins to the extracellular fluid lining the airspaces.</p><p>In humans, many forms of lung cancer may originate from Clara cells, including adenocarcinoma, the most frequently diagnosed form of lung cancer. Whether Clara cells have a similar etiologic function in mouse models of adenocarcinoma is more controversial.</p>","answer":"Clara cells were first described as a morphologically distinct cell type by Kolliker in 1881, but take their name from the seminal study of human and rabbit bronchioles by Max Clara in 1937. Since their discovery, Clara cells have been identified as central players in protecting the airway from environmental exposures. The diverse functions of Clara cells in lung homeostasis include roles in xenobiotic metabolism, immune system regulation, and progenitor cell activity. Recent identification of a sub-population of Clara cells as a bronchiolar tissue-specific stem cell and a potential tumor initiating cell has focused the attention of cell and molecular biologists on the Clara cell and its behavior under normal and disease conditions."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We extracted lipids from fast-food Mediterranean type foodstuffs , and tested them in vitro for their ability to inhibit or antagonize PAF towards washed rabbit platelets . We chose the foodstuffs that exerted the most potent in vitro anti-PAF activity and fed 22 healthy ( group A ) and 23 type 2 diabetics ( group B ) subjects on a diet containing the chosen foodstuffs . The 22 type 2 diabetics ( group C ) subjects were kept on their regular diet that was being followed before entering the study . Before and after a 4-week diet , all enrolled subjects underwent the following examinations ; measurement of total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein ( LDL-cholesterol ) , high density lipoprotein ( HDL-cholesterol ) , triglycerides , glucose , HbA(1c ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , and platelet aggregation in response to PAF , adenosine 5 ' diphosphate ( ADP ) and arachidonic acid ( AA ) . RESULTS The chosen diet significantly increased the EC(50 ) values of PAF and ADP to groups A and B ( p<0.05 ) . No statistical difference was observed on the EC(50 ) value of group C. No statistical differences were detected among Cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , triglycerides , glucose , HBA(1c ) , BMI , and EC(50 ) for AA values , for any of the three groups . CONCLUSIONS Consumption of a fast-food Mediterranean type diet rich in PAF antagonist improved platelet response of type 2 diabetics and healthy human subjects against thrombotic , inflammatory and proatherogenic factorsTitle 2:The effect of eicosapentaenoic acid consumption on human neutrophil chemiluminescenceAbstract 2:The effect of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) on the inflammatory potential of neutrophils was investigated by supplementing the diets of 12 subjects with 2.16 g of EPA or 12 g of olive oil per day for 4 weeks in a double blind crossover study . Neutrophil function as assessed by luminol enhanced chemiluminescence responses to plateletactivating factor ( PAF ) and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-EPA but not after olive oil consumption in the subjects who consumed EPA first . In contrast , EPA had no significant effect on neutrophil chemiluminescence in the subjects who consumed olive oil first .

Substitution of whole grains and legumes for refined rice was associated with the replacement of 7 % of energy from carbohydrates with energy from protein ( about 4 % ) and fat . After 12 weeks , the whole grain and legume group showed a significant decrease in fasting glucose , insulin , homeostasis model assessment -insulin resistance , hemoglobin A1c , malondialdehyde , plasma Lp-PLA2 activity , and oxidized LDL ( ox-LDL ) , and an increase in LDL particle size . The changes ( Δs ) in these variables in the whole grain and legume group were significantly different from those in controls after adjustment for the baseline levels . When all subjects were considered , Δ plasma Lp-PLA2 positively correlated with Δ glucose , Δ P BMC Lp-PLA2 , Δ ox-LDL , and Δ urinary 8-epi-prostagl and in F2α after being adjusted for confounding factors . The Δ P BMC Lp-PLA2 correlated positively with Δ glucose and Δ ox-LDL , and negatively with Δ LDL particle size and baseline P BMC Lp-PLA2 . The substitution of whole grains and legumes for refined rice result ed in a reduction in Lp-PLA2 activities in plasma and P BMC s partly through improved glycemic control , increased consumption of protein relative to carbohydrate , and reduced lipid peroxidesTitle 4:Moderate alcohol consumption and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND AND AIMS To investigate the effect of moderate alcohol consumption on lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity , markers of inflammation and oxidative stress and whether these effects are modified by BMI . METHODS AND RESULTS Eleven lean ( BMI : 18.5 - 25 kg/m(2 ) ) and 9 overweight ( BMI > 27 kg/m(2 ) ) men participated in a r and omized controlled crossover trial . After consuming 3 cans of beer ( 40 g ethanol ) or alcohol-free beer daily during 3 weeks ,  fasting blood sample s were taken . HDL cholesterol increased by 18.2 % ( p<0.001 ) after beer compared to alcohol-free beer , while LDL cholesterol decreased by 7.8 % ( p=0.008 ) . Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity was not different ( p=0.23 ) between beer ( 47.5+/-0.8 ) and alcohol-free beer ( 48.9+/-0.8 ) . High-sensitive C-reactive protein was unaffected , but urinary isoprostanes tended to increase ( p=0.09 ) after beer ( 114.0+/-6.9 ) compared to alcohol-free beer ( 96.9+/-6.5 ) . An interaction between BMI and treatment ( p<0.05 ) on liver enzymes was observed , indicating an increase of liver enzymes after moderate alcohol consumption in overweight men only . CONCLUSION Despite profound effects on HDL and LDL cholesterol , moderate alcohol consumption did not affect lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity . Liver enzymes increased after alcohol consumption in overweight men only , suggesting a less favorable response to moderate alcohol consumption in overweight peopleTitle 5:Plasma lipid levels and platelet and neutrophil function in patients with vascular disease following fish oil and olive oil supplementation.Abstract 5:This double-blind study was design ed to examine and compare the effects of supplementing the existing diet with fish oil or olive oil on lipids and cell function in patients with peripheral vascular disease . Thirty-two patients with symptomatic and angiographically demonstrated peripheral vascular disease were screened , matched , and r and omly allocated to take either 15 g/d fish oil or olive oil for 4 weeks . Fish oil reduced serum triglyceride levels by 26 % , but increased total cholesterol levels due to a significant increase in both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and high-density lipoprotein-2 cholesterol ( HDL2-C ) . There was a nonsignificant decrease in HDL3-C levels .  Olive oil reduced total cholesterol levels , accountable to a significantly decrease in LDL-C levels . Serum thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) levels remained unchanged following fish oil , but were significantly increased by olive oil .  Urinary excretion of TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was unaffected by either oil supplement . Platelet aggregation , which was measured in platelet-rich plasma in response to two doses of collagen or platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) , was significantly reduced after fish oil , but was increased by olive oil . Following fish oil , there was a significant increase in eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA , 20:5 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA , 22:6 ) levels and a decrease in arachidonic acid content of platelet phospholipids . The platelet fatty acid composition after olive oil was unchanged . Fish oil decreased neutrophil leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) generation following calcium ionophore stimulation by 33 % , while leukotriene B5 levels increased significantly . Neutrophil PAF production and plasma lyso-PAF were unaffected by either oil . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDSTitle 6:Interactions between dietary fat, fish, and fish oils and their effects on platelet function in men at risk of cardiovascular disease.Abstract 6:Recent studies have suggested that omega 3-fats of marine origin may have a protective role in heart disease . This study aim ed to compare the effects of fish or fish oil , in the setting of a high- or low-fat diet , on platelet aggregation and platelet thromboxane in men with increased risk of cardiovascular disease . One hundred twenty men who were nonsmokers , 30 to 60 years old , with mildly elevated blood pressure and cholesterol were r and omly allocated to one of five high-fat ( 40 % of daily energy ) or two low-fat ( 30 % ) groups for 12 weeks . The five high-fat groups took either 6 or 12 fish oil capsules daily ; fish ; a combination of fish and fish oil ; or placebo capsules . The two low-fat groups took either fish or placebo capsules . Fish meals provided 1.3 g of eicosapentaenoic acid daily , equivalent to 6 fish oil capsules , and contained an average of 3.65 g/d of omega 3-fatty acids . Multiple regression analysis of the combined groups showed that all groups taking omega 3-fatty acids reduced platelet aggregation to both collagen ( P < .0001 ) and platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) ( P < .05 ) and platelet thromboxane B2 responses ( P < .05 ) to collagen-induced aggregation . The low-fat diet alone had no effect on PAF-induced platelet aggregation and only a small effect on platelet responses to collagen ( P < .05 ) . Platelet aggregation responses to PAF were reduced more by fish oil than fish in a high-fat diet , whereas fish had a greater effect when part of a low-fat rather than a high-fat diet . There was no significant difference in collagen-induced platelet aggregation or platelet thromboxane between fish and fish oils on a high or low fat intake . In conjunction with our previous findings of improvements in lipoproteins , blood pressure , and heart rate in this population , these results on platelet function suggest that dietary omega 3-fatty acids incorporated into a low- rather than a high-fat diet have a wider spectrum of more favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factorsTitle 7:Omega-3 fatty acids and lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 in healthy older adult males and femalesAbstract 7:Purpose Lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 ( Lp-PLA2 ) is a novel inflammatory factor that has been independently associated with stroke and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Omega-3 fats have been implicated in reducing inflammation associated with CVD . The aim of this study was to determine if an 8-week isocaloric diet supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic ( DHA ) in the form of fish oil or α-linolenic acid ( ALA ) in the form of flaxseed oil would alter Lp-PLA2 among healthy adults ages 50 years and older . Methods Fifty-nine healthy adults ( ~75 % female , average age 61 years ) were r and omized to one of three groups with equal amounts of total fat intake . All capsules contained ~1 g of fat . The control group ( n = 19 ) consumed olive oil capsules ( ~11 g/day ) ; the ALA group ( n = 20 ) consumed flaxseed oil capsules ( ~11 g/day ) and the EPA/DHA group ( n = 20 ) consumed fish oil capsules ( ~2 g/day + 9 g/day of olive oil ) . Fasting blood sample s were obtained before and after the 8-week intervention for determination of Lp-PLA2 mass and activity as well as lipid values . Results We did not find any significant changes in Lp-PLA2 mass or activity after the intervention in any of the groups ; however , change in oxidized LDL was associated with change in Lp-PLA2 mass ( r = 0.37 , p < 0.01 ) . ConclusionS upplementing the diet with omega-3 fatty acids for 8-weeks did not influence Lp-PLA2 activity or mass among older adults ; altering oxidized LDL may be necessary to see changes in Lp-PLA2 levels","answer":"However , preliminary results indicate that the characteristic \\" healthy \\" components of the MD , especially , cereals , legumes , vegetables , fish and wine can favorably modulate the pro-inflammatory actions of PAF and regulate its metabolism ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

We investigated whether environmental cues such as packaging and container size are so powerful that they can increase our intake of foods that are less palatable . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS In a 2 x 2 between-subjects design , 158 moviegoers in Philadelphia ( 57.6 % male ; 28.7 years ) were r and omly given a medium ( 120 g ) or a large ( 240 g ) container of free popcorn that was either fresh or stale ( 14 days old ) . Following the movie , consumption measures were taken , along with measures of perceived taste . OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS Moviegoers who were given fresh popcorn ate 45.3 % more popcorn when it was given to them in large containers . This container-size influence is so powerful that even when the popcorn was disliked , people still ate 33.6 % more popcorn when eating from a large container than from a medium-size container . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION S Even when foods are not palatable , large packages and containers can lead to overeating . The silver lining of these findings may be that portion size can also be used to increase the consumption of less preferred healthful foods , such as raw vegetablesTitle 2:The more food young adults are served, the more they overeat.Abstract 2:Young and Nestle suggested that the increase in the portion size of food products evident in the United States during the past 20 years may be responsible for the epidemic of overweight and obesity . They based their conclusion on statistical correlations . The purpose of the present study was to provide experimental evidence to support their proposal . Cornell undergraduate students were given access to a buffet lunch on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday and were told this was a test of flavor enhancers . They were instructed to eat as much or as little as they wanted . On the same days of the following week , the subjects were divided into 3 groups . Each group was served either 100 % , 125 % , or 150 % of the amount of food they had consumed the previous week . When larger amounts were served , significantly greater amounts of food were consumed . Each of the 4 foods that comprised the meal ( soup , pasta , breadsticks , ice cream ) increased significantly in proportion to the portion size . The data clearly support the hypothesis proposed by Young and Nestle and support the powerful role that environment plays in determining energy intake and potential increases in body weightTitle 3:Human cortical gustatory areas: a review of functional neuroimaging data.Abstract 3:In an effort to define human cortical gustatory areas we review ed functional neuroimaging data for which coordinates st and ardized in Talairach proportional space were available . We observed a wide distribution of peaks within the insula and parietal and frontal opercula , suggesting multiple gustatory regions within this cortical area . Multiple peaks also emerged in the orbitofrontal cortex . However , only two peaks , both in the right hemisphere , were observed in the caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex , the region likely homologous to the secondary taste area described in monkeys . Overall significantly more peaks originated from the right hemisphere suggesting asymmetrical cortical representation of taste favoring the right hemisphereTitle 4:Thrifty genes for obesity, an attractive but flawed idea, and an alternative perspective: the ‘drifty gene’ hypothesisAbstract 4:Almost 50 years ago Neel proposed a hypothesis to explain the prevalence of  obesity and diabetes in modern society — the ‘ thrifty gene ’ hypothesis . The fundamental basis of the hypothesis was that , in our early evolutionary history , genes , that promoted efficient fat deposition would have been advantageous because they allowed their holders to survive at periods of famine . In modern society , such genes are disadvantageous because they promote fat deposition in preparation for a famine that never comes , and the result is widespread obesity and diabetes . In recent years I , and others , have question ed some of the fundamental assumptions of this hypothesis — particularly focusing on whether differential survival of lean against obese in famines provides sufficient selective pressure for the spread of so-called ‘ thrifty genes ’ . These arguments have been criticized because famines not only affect survival but also fecundity , and obese people would be expected to sustain fecundity longer in the face of food shortages . In this paper , I show that the reduced fecundity argument is flawed because famines are almost universally followed by periods of enhanced fecundity , which offsets the decline observed during the famine itself . The net effect of famines on fecundity is consequently insufficient to rescue the thrifty gene idea . Elsewhere , I have suggested an alternative scenario that subsections of the population have a genetic predisposition to obesity due to an absence of selection , combined with genetic drift . The scenario presented earlier was based on evidence from prehistory concerning the release of our ancestors from heavy predation pressure around 2 million years ago . I suggest here that this is one of a number of potential scenarios based on r and om genetic drift that may explain the specific aetiology of the obesity epidemic . Together , these alternatives , based on central notion that genetic drift rather than positive selection was a dominant factor , may be called the ‘ drifty gene ’ hypothesisTitle 5:Art of persuasion: an analysis of techniques used to market foods to children.Abstract 5:AIM Persuasive marketing techniques , such as promotional characters , influence children 's food preferences and requests for foods . The aim of this research was to describe the techniques used to market unhealthy foods and beverages to children on Sydney free-to-air television . METHODS Marketing techniques design ed to appeal to children were identified from international literature and summarised into a systematic coding tool . Using this tool , the marketing techniques used in a r and om sample of 100 unique food advertisements , broadcasted on Sydney free-to-air television , were coded . Frequency of marketing techniques was analysed overall and for use in advertisements marketing unhealthy foods , emotionally or verbally appealing to parents , or featuring child actors . RESULTS Advertisers ' use of persuasive techniques generally did not differ by type of food advertised . Marketing techniques with greater prominence in unhealthy food advertising were palatability ( 54 % of unhealthy food advertisements ) , convenience ( 52 % ) , fantasy/imagination ( 28 % ) , fun/happiness ( 17 % ) and cartoon characters ( 9 % ) . Advertisements emotionally appealing to parents ( 24 % ) were significantly more likely to make general health or nutrition statements ( 38 % vs. 17 % ) , and appealed to children concurrently through fun/happiness and fantasy/imagination appeals . Children were depicted in advertisements as eating with friends or family , situated within the home and frequently snacking on less healthy foods . CONCLUSIONS Food and beverage advertisers use a range of visual , audio and emotive techniques to appeal to children and their parents that do not discriminate by the type of food advertised . The range and complexity of these techniques complicate the restriction of their use in food advertising to childrenTitle 6:Rewards can be used effectively with repeated exposure to increase liking of vegetables in 4-6-year-old children.Abstract 6:OBJECTIVE To examine whether parents offering a sticker reward to their child to taste a vegetable the child does not currently consume is associated with improvements in children 's liking and consumption of the vegetable . DESIGN A r and omized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of exposure only ( EO ) and exposure plus reward ( E + R ) , relative to a control group , on children 's liking and consumption of a target vegetable . Assessment s were conducted at baseline and 2 weeks from baseline ( post-intervention ) . Follow-up assessment s were conducted at 4 weeks and 3 months from baseline . SETTING The study took place in Adelaide , South Australia . Participants were self-selected in response to local media advertisements seeking to recruit parents finding it difficult to get their children to eat vegetables . SUBJECTS Participants were 185 children ( 110 boys , seventy-five girls ) aged 4 - 6 years and their primary caregiver/parent ( 172 mothers , thirteen fathers ) . RESULTS The E + R group was able to achieve more days of taste exposure . Both EO and E + R increased liking at post-intervention compared with control and no further change occurred over the follow-up period . All groups increased their intake of the target vegetable at post-intervention . Target vegetable consumption continued to increase significantly over the follow-up period for E + R and control but not for EO . CONCLUSIONS The findings provide support for the effectiveness of using a sticker reward with a repeated exposure strategy . In particular , such rewards can facilitate the actual tastings necessary to change likingTitle 7:Ice cream illusions bowls, spoons, and self-served portion sizes.Abstract 7:BACKGROUND Because people eat most of what they serve themselves , any context ual cues that lead them to over-serve should lead them to over-eat . In building on the size-contrast illusion , this research examines whether the size of a bowl or serving spoon unknowingly biases how much a person serves and eats . METHODS The 2 x 2 between-subjects design involved 85 nutrition experts who were attending an ice cream social to celebrate the success of a colleague in 2002 . They were r and omly given either a smaller ( 17 oz ) or a larger ( 34 oz ) bowl and either a smaller ( 2 oz ) or larger ( 3 oz ) ice cream scoop . After serving themselves , they completed a brief survey as their ice cream was weighed . The analysis was conducted in 2003 . RESULTS Even when nutrition experts were given a larger bowl , they served themselves 31.0 % more ( 6.25 vs 4.77 oz , F(1 , 80 ) = 8.05 , p < 0.01 ) without being aware of it . Their servings increased by 14.5 % when they were given a larger serving spoon ( 5.77 vs 5.04 oz , F(1 , 80)=2.70 , p = 0.10 ) . CONCLUSIONS People could try using the size of their bowls and possibly serving spoons to help them better control how much they consume . Those interested in losing weight should use smaller bowls and spoons , while those needing to gain weight -- such as the undernourished or aged -- could be encouraged to use larger ones . Epidemiologic implication s are discussedTitle 8:Larger portion sizes lead to a sustained increase in energy intake over 2 days.Abstract 8:OBJECTIVE We tested the effect on energy intake of increasing the portion size of all foods and beverages served over 2 consecutive days . DESIGN The study used a r and omized crossover design . SUBJECTS/ SETTING Subjects were 32 adults from a university community . INTERVENTION For 2 consecutive days in each of 3 weeks , subjects ate their main meals in a controlled setting and were given snacks for consumption between meals . We used the same two daily menus each week , but varied the portion sizes of all foods and beverages served in a given week ( either 100 % , 150 % , or 200 % of baseline amounts ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Energy intake and ratings of hunger and satiety were measured . STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED A linear mixed model with repeated measures was used . RESULTS There was a significant effect of portion size on energy intake in both men and women ( P<0.0001 ) . Increasing portions by 50 % increased daily energy intake by 16 % ( women : 335 kcal/day ; men : 504 kcal/day ) , and increasing portions by 100 % increased intake by 26 % ( women : 530 kcal/day ; men : 812 kcal/day ) . Energy intake did not differ between the 2 days of each week . Daily ratings of fullness were lowest in the 100 % portion condition ( P=0.0004 ) , but did not differ significantly in the 150 % and 200 % conditions . CONCLUSIONS Increasing the portion size of all foods result ed in a significant increase in energy intake that was sustained over 2 days . These data support suggestions that large portions are associated with excess energy intake that could contribute to increased body weight","answer":"Increased intake of energy-dense foods high in fat and sugar is not only adding more energy , but may also corrupt neural functions of brain systems involved in nutrient sensing as well as in hedonic , motivational and cognitive processing ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

It is well established that bowel preparations are improved when at least part of the laxative is ingested on the day of the procedure. However, there is concern that this can result in higher gastric residual volumes (GRV) and increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration. The aim of this study is to evaluate GRV and gastric pH in patients who received day - before bowel preparation versus those ingesting their laxative on the day of colonoscopy under anesthesiologist - directed propofol deep sedation. This is a prospective observational study for patients undergoing same - day upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. All included patients had large - volume polyethylene glycol lavage preparation and received propofol sedation. Gastric fluid was collected during the upper endoscopy for volume and pH measurement. The study included 428 patients with 56% receiving same - day laxative preparation and the remainder evening - before preparation. Mean ± SD GRV was 18.1 ± 10.2 mL, 16.3 ± 16.5 mL in each of these preparation groups, respectively (P = .69). GRV ≥ 25 mL or higher than expected GRV adjusted by weight (0.4 mL/kg) were also not different among the study groups (P = .90 and P = .87, respectively). Evaluating GRV based on time since last ingestion of preparation (3-5, 5-7, >7 hours) did not result in any differences (P = .56). Gastric pH was also similar between the bowel preparation groups (P = .23), with mean ± SD of 2.5 ± 1.4 for evening - before and 2.5 ± 1.3 for the same - day preparation. There were more inadequate bowel preparations in day before bowel preparations (P = .001). A large - volume bowel preparation regimen finished on the day of colonoscopy as close as 3 hours before the procedure result s in no increase in GRV or decrease in gastric pH.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"ingested\\", \\"ingesting\\", \\"ingestion\\", \\"pulmonary aspiration\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"Gastric fluid\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"polyethylene glycol\\", \\"propofol\\", \\"laxative\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"GRV\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"improved\\", \\"pH measurement\\", \\"decrease in gastric pH\\", \\"increase the risk of\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"lavage preparation\\", \\"Evaluating\\", \\"Colonoscopy\\", \\"Bowel Preparations\\", \\"colonoscopy\\", \\"sedation\\", \\"deep sedation\\", \\"preparation\\", \\"Deep Sedation\\", \\"regimen\\", \\"bowel preparation\\", \\"endoscopy\\", \\"Oral\\", \\"bowel preparations\\", \\"evaluate\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"expected\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"groups\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"anesthesiologist\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"Prospective Observational Study\\", \\"study\\", \\"prospective observational study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"part\\", \\"upper\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of rol ABC genes on antioxidant and medicinal potential of lettuce by Agrobacterium -mediated transformation. Transgene integration and expression was confirmed through PCR and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. The transformed plants showed 91-102 % increase in total phenolic contents and 53-65 % increase in total flavonoid contents compared to untransformed plants. Total antioxidant capacity and total reducing power increased up to 112 and 133 % in transformed plants, respectively. Results of DPPH assay showed maximum 51 % increase, and lipid peroxidation assay exhibited 20 % increase in antioxidant activity of transformed plants compared to controls. Different in vivo assays were carried out in rats. The transgenic plants showed up to 80 % inhibition in both hot plate analgesic assay and carrageenan - induced hind paw edema test, while untransformed plants showed only 45 % inhibition. Antidepressant and anticoagulant potential of transformed plants was also significantly enhanced compared to untransformed plants. Taken together, the present work highlights the use of rol genes to enhance the secondary metabolite production in lettuce and improve its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and anticoagulatory properties.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"Transgene\\", \\"rol ABC Genes\\", \\"rol ABC genes\\", \\"rol genes\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"Agrobacterium\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"Antioxidant\\", \\"antioxidant activity\\", \\"transformation\\", \\"integration\\", \\"expression\\", \\"Transformation\\", \\"Anticoagulant Activities\\", \\"lipid peroxidation\\", \\"antioxidant\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"phenolic\\", \\"Extracts\\", \\"secondary metabolite\\", \\"flavonoid\\", \\"DPPH\\", \\"carrageenan\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"untransformed plants\\", \\"Lettuce\\", \\"transgenic plants\\", \\"lettuce\\", \\"transformed plants\\", \\"rats\\", \\"Rats\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"antidepressant\\", \\"anticoagulant\\", \\"anti-inflammatory\\", \\"Anti-Inflammatory\\", \\"analgesic\\", \\"Analgesic\\", \\"Antidepressant\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"edible crop\\", \\"dietary\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"hot plate analgesic assay\\", \\"assay\\", \\"hind paw edema test\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"PCR\\", \\"study\\", \\"real-time RT-PCR\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

While the post-ingestive rewarding effect, which artificial sweeteners do not have, signals the nutrient value of sugar and influences food preference, the neural circuitry that mediates the rewarding effect of glucose is unknown. In this study, we show that optogenetic activation of melanin-concentrating hormone( MCH) neurons during intake of the artificial sweetener sucralose increases striatal dopamine levels and inverts the normal preference for sucrose vs sucralose. Conversely, animals with ablation of MCH neurons no longer prefer sucrose to sucralose and show reduced striatal DA release upon sucrose ingestion. We further show that MCH neurons project to reward areas and are required for the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose in sweet-blind Trpm5−/− mice. These studies identify an essential component of the neural pathways linking nutrient sensing and food reward.Introduction:Animals and humans generally prefer sugars containing glucose, such as sucrose, compared to non-nutritive sweeteners such as sucralose( Smiciklas-Wright et al., 2002; Jacobson, 2005; Domingos et al., 2011; Sicher, 2011) as a result of the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose( Domingos et al., 2011). This post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose was first described by showing that non-nutritive liquids that are paired to glucose administration either in the intra-gastric tract or in plasma, are greatly preferred over liquids that are not paired with nutrients( de Araujo et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2010; de Araujo et al., 2010; Oliveira-Maia et al., 2011; Sclafani et al., 2011; Fernstrom et al., 2012; de Araujo et al., 2013). In addition, sweet-blind Trpm5 knockout mice can still sense the nutrient value of sucrose( de Araujo et al., 2008). These studies have indicated that the nutrient value of sucrose is sensed and in turn establishes a preference for nutritive sugars( Ren et al., 2010; de Araujo et al., 2010; Sclafani et al., 2011; Fernstrom et al., 2012). These data further indicate that the post-ingestive rewarding effect plays an important role in driving nutrient choice( in addition to sweet taste). However, despite the substantial evidence that they play a major, perhaps dominant, role in driving food intake and sweetener preference, the neural pathways that sense glucose and mediate the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose have not been identified. Rodent studies have further shown that sucrose but not artificial sweeteners such as sucralose can drive dopamine( DA) release in the midbrain even in the absence of taste( de Araujo et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2010; de Araujo et al., 2010; Oliveira-Maia et al., 2011; Sclafani et al., 2011; Fernstrom et al., 2012; de Araujo et al., 2013). The combination of sweet taste plus an increase of dopamine accounts for the preference for natural vs artificial sweeteners( Domingos et al., 2011). We previously reported that the artificial sweetener sucralose is preferred to sucrose only if supplemented by a proxy for this post-ingestive reward in the form of optogenetic activation of DA neurons( Domingos et al., 2011). However, the elements of the neural circuit that convey the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose and activate DA neurons are unknown. Melanin-concentrating hormone-expressing neurons( Pmch or, MCH neurons; in accordance with previous literature[Shimada et al., 1998; Alon and Friedman, 2006; Kong et al., 2010], we adopt the later nomenclature throughout this report) in the lateral hypothalamus( LH) are glucose sensitive, and show increased activity when extracellular glucose levels increase( Burdakov et al., 2005; Kong et al., 2010). Pmch knockout and MCH neuronal ablation lead to reduced body weight, indicating a critical role of these neurons in the regulation of energy balance( Shimada et al., 1998; Whiddon and Palmiter, 2013). In addition, MCH neurons send dense projections to reward centers in the striatum and midbrain where dopaminergic neurons are located( current report). This strong anatomical connection between MCH neurons and reward nuclei, as well as the fact that MCH neurons sense glucose levels, led us to hypothesize that these hypothalamic neurons could play a role in conveying the reward value of sucrose.Discussion:In this manuscript, we report that MCH neurons are necessary and sufficient for establishing a preference for sucrose vs sucralose, an artificial sweetener. MCH neurons serve as an essential link between glucose sensing and sugar reward, and these data thus identify a key component of the neural circuit that establishes the preference for natural vs artificial sweeteners( Smiciklas-Wright et al., 2002; Jacobson, 2005; Domingos et al., 2011; Sicher, 2011). MCH neurons have previously been shown to be excited by glucose( Burdakov et al., 2005; Kong et al., 2010), suggesting that direct glucose sensing by these neurons regulates reward. However, it is also possible that glucose is sensed elsewhere, such as by putative gastric/intestinal sensors or other nutrient sensors, which inform the brain and MCH neurons about the nutrient content of ingested food( Sclafani et al., 2011). Glucose sensing in MCH neurons or elsewhere would explain why, even in the absence of taste( such as in Trpm5–/– mice), sucrose is able to drive significant increase of striatal DA. This increase, in turn, conveys reward and conditions behavior( de Araujo et al., 2008). We note, however, that optogenetic stimulation of MCH neurons alone is not sufficient to alter behavior in the absence of taste. The data thus suggest that MCH neurons are components of a reward-encoding network that integrates information from multiple sources, including the nutrients themselves, lingual taste buds and, possibly, other sites of glucose sensing like the gut. Consistent with this possibility, viral tracing from lingual taste buds shows that MCH neurons are part of a circuit processing gustatory information( Pérez et al., 2011). This finding is also consistent with the optogenetic data reported here, showing a requirement for both sweet taste and activation of MCH neurons to drive reward. The role of MCH neurons uncovered here contrasts with that of DA neurons, which upon optogenetic stimulation have been shown to be rewarding when paired to water( Domingos et al., 2011). A synergy between taste and the post-ingestive rewarding effect would explain why sucrose and other fructose/glucose disaccharides, which are more potent stimulators of sweet-taste receptors than glucose alone, are generally preferred to glucose alone( Sclafani and Mann, 1987; Nelson et al., 2001). This synergy would also explain why our optogenetic gain of function experiments lead to an inversion of preference, rather than an isopreference, which could perhaps have been achieved by decreasing the concentration of sucralose. Likewise, the loss of function of MCH neurons leads to isopreference, but this could perhaps be biased toward sucralose by increasing its concentration. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relevant sites of glucose sensing, identify additional elements of the neural circuit integrating gustatory perception with nutrient sensing and reward, as well as elucidating the neural mechanisms by which MCH neurons regulate striatal DA release. Several methods including viral tracing can be used to identify monosynaptic or polysynaptic inputs onto MCH and DA neurons. As mentioned, the activity of MCH neurons is increased by glucose( Burdakov et al., 2005). Glucose-activated MCH neurons and pancreatic β cells share signal transduction components necessary for glucose sensing, and both Kir6. 2 and UCP2 regulate glucose excitability of MCH neurons( Kong et al., 2010). Moreover, a loss of function of Kir6. 1 in MCH neurons leads to alterations in results of a glucose tolerance test with increased plasma glucose at later times, establishing a role for these neurons in glucose homeostasis( Kong et al., 2010). Further studies are required to establish whether these or other components of glucose sensing pathways are also required for the ability of MCH neurons to influence sucrose preference. It is possible, however, that additional neural populations are components of this nutrient sensing circuit. For example, orexin/hypocretin-containing neurons can also sense glucose and it is thus possible that these or other neural populations in the mesolimbic system, or higher order centers can also influence the reward value of sugar( Burdakov et al., 2005; Karnani and Burdakov, 2011). Previous reports have also explored the relationship between MCH neurons and reward: both MCH knockout and MCH ablated mice show augmented locomotor responses to psychostimulant drugs( Pissios et al., 2008; Whiddon and Palmiter, 2013). These augmented locomotor phenotypes contrast with the behavioral effect we see with a loss of sucrose preference in MCH ablated mice. It is possible that the locomotor phenotypes in response to stimulants result from actions in the ventral striatum, where the MCH receptor( MCHR-1) is expressed, and that sucrose preference relies on other brain areas. Further experiments will be required to ascertain which brain areas and MCH projections are relevant for sucrose preference. Loss of function of MCHR-1 recreates the locomotor phenotypes seen in Pmch−/− mice: Mchr1−/− mice are super-sensitive to the locomotor activating effects of d-amphetamine( Smith et al., 2005). These studies do not establish whether it is MCH or another neurotransmitter expressed in these neurons that is responsible for the observed phenotypes, and further experiments will also be required to ascertain whether the MCH neuropeptide itself is relevant for sucrose preference. We assayed dopamine release using microdialysis to show that MCH neural activation increases dopamine release in the striatum and that the increase of dopamine in response to sucrose is lost after ablation of MCH neurons. Consistent with this, the levels of cFos in dopaminergic neurons of the VTA are reduced in MCH-ablated, sweet-blind Trpm5 KO mice given sucrose. These assays of taste-blind mice confirm that MCH neurons regulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons, though the data do not establish whether this effect of dopaminergic neural activity and dopamine release is direct and/or indirect. Further studies will be necessary to establish how MCH neurons regulate dopaminergic signaling. The delineation of this neural circuit may also provide a basis for understanding how leptin modulates reward( Domingos et al., 2011). The effects of leptin on reward are unlikely to be a result of a direct effect on MCH neurons as they do not appear to express the leptin receptor( Leinninger et al., 2011). However, a distinct neural population in the LH expressing neurotensin respond to leptin, and further studies may reveal whether or not leptin reduces MCH activity indirectly by activating these cells( Leinninger et al., 2011). Ablation of MCH neurons attenuates the obese phenotype of leptin deficient ob/ob mice indicating that MCH neurons are downstream of leptin action( Alon and Friedman, 2006). Ablation of MCH neurons causes hypophagia and leanness, and it is possible that the reduced food intake is a result of a loss of the reward value of nutrient in these animals( Alon and Friedman, 2006). The reward value of sugar is also regulated by leptin, which has been recently reported to have a presynaptic action to suppress excitatory synaptic input onto VTA DA neurons( Domingos et al., 2011; Thompson and Borgland, 2013). Further studies will reveal whether leptin modulates excitatory output to the VTA via MCH neurons or influences nutrient preference by a direct effect on DA neurons in the VTA. The importance of brain nutrient sensing for behavior has also been studied in Drosophila( Dus et al., 2011, 2013; Miyamoto et al., 2012, 2013). Future studies will likely elucidate the extent to which the cellular mechanisms and neural pathways that regulate nutrient preference are shared between invertebrates and mammals. Brain nutrient sensing may represent an evolutionary adaptation to avoid starvation, by expediting decisions about which foods to consume. In summary, these results confirm that MCH neurons are both necessary and sufficient for sensing the nutrient value of sucrose and suggest that these neurons play a critical role in establishing nutrient preference. The market share of sugared soda is nearly triple that of diet soda( Smiciklas-Wright et al., 2002; Jacobson, 2005; Sicher, 2011), and our data suggest a biological approach to potentially regulate sugar consumption. This could be achieved via the development of means for suppressing the activity MCH neurons, or via the development of new artificial sweeteners with neuroexcitatory activity specific to MCH neurons.","answer":"Sales of full-sugar fizzy drinks are almost triple those of diet versions , providing real-world confirmation of the laboratory finding that humans , as well as animals , prefer sugar to artificial sweeteners .

Silencing of Glo1 decreased lifespan. Glo1 is a further example of a 'vitagene', a gene which with manipulated change in expression produces life extension [2]. Glo1 is a glutathione-dependent enzyme that catalyses the metabolism of reactive dicarbonyl-glycating agents, MG (methylglyoxal) and glyoxal [3]. It thereby prevents the glycation of proteins by these dicarbonyl compounds. Proteins of mitochondria were found to be major targets of dicarbonyl glycation: increased glycation of mitochondrial proteins was associated with increased formation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and increased proteome damage by oxidative and nitrosative processes. There was a decline of Glo1 expression in C. elegans and increased formation of mitochondrial ROS in normal aging. Overexpression of Glo1 in C. elegans decreased dicarbonyl glycation of mitochondrial proteins, decreased the formation of ROS and proteome markers of dicarbonyl glycation and also markers of oxidative and nitrosative damage (methionine sulfoxide and 3-nitrotyrosine residues respectively) with concomitant life extension. This indicated, for the first time, that dicarbonyl glycation may be the critical damage to the mitochondrial proteome that triggers increased ROS and oxidative damage in aging. It may therefore be important to prevent increased dicarbonyl glycation to achieve a decrease in formation of ROS by mitochondrial dysfunction. This has important implications for current understanding of ROS and oxidative damage in an attempt to achieve healthy aging and prevent vascular disease, particularly in diabetes and renal failure. An important future consideration is what are the likely targets of dicarbonyl glycation in mitochondria?</p>Protein glycation<p>Glycation is a major cause of spontaneous damage to cellular and extracellular proteins in physiological systems, affecting 0.1–0.2% of lysine and arginine residues [4,5]. For some proteins with limited protein turnover, such as lens fibre cells, the extent of protein glycation may be up to 10-fold higher [6]. Most mitochondrial proteins are short-lived, however, with turnovers from 10–30 min to 3–5 days [7]. Quality control of the mitochondrial proteome involves mitochondrial proteases, leading to release of peptides from mitochondria [8], ubiquitination and proteolysis of outer membrane, mitochondrial fission and fusion, and finally autophagy of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) [9].</p><p>Glycation adducts are formed in non-enzymatic spontaneous reactions of monosaccharides with proteins. Glucose can enter mitochondria via GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1), which also transports vitamin C into mitochondria [10]. Probably the most important glycating agents to consider for glycation damage to the mitochondrial proteome are reactive dicarbonyls such as glyoxal, MG and 3DG (3-deoxyglucosone) (Figure 1). Dicarbonyls are formed endogenously by lipid peroxidation and the degradation of glycolytic intermediates and glycated proteins. Dicarbonyl compounds are potent glycating agents, 200–50 000-fold more reactive than glucose. The physiological concentrations of dicarbonyls are typically 10 000–50 000-fold lower than glucose, yet nevertheless dicarbonyl compounds remain important precursors of AGEs (advanced glycation end-products) in physiological systems. MG was suggested to have low permeability of mitochondrial membranes as it inhibited d-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity in inverted inner mitochondrial membrane vesicles better than in intact mitochondria [11], but this may have been be due to decreased inhibitory activity with intact mitochondria owing to binding to GSH of MG.</p><p>Glycation by glucose and other monosaccharides is directed to amino groups of lysine and N-terminal amino acid residues of proteins, whereas glycation by dicarbonyl compounds is mainly, but not exclusively, directed to arginine residues [12].</p>Early-stage glycation adducts and AGEs<p>The initial glycation adducts formed by glycation by glucose and other monosaccharides are called early-stage glycation adducts. The predominant early glycation adduct is FL (Nε-fructosyl-lysine). Schiff base and FL adducts degrade slowly in further advanced reactions to form many different glycation adducts. These adducts are known collectively as AGEs. Dicarbonyls react with proteins directly to also form AGEs. Important AGEs quantitatively are hydroimidazolones derived from arginine residues modified by glyoxal, MG and 3DG: G-H1 [Nδ-(5-hydro-4-imidazolon-2-yl)ornithine], MG-H1 [Nδ-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-ornithine] and 3DG-H {Nδ-[5-hydro-5-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)-4-imidazolon-2-yl]ornithine and related structural isomers}. Other important and widely-studied AGEs are CML (Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine) and CEL (Nε-carboxyethyl-lysine), and the protein cross-links, pentosidine and glucosepane [5,13–16]. Further AGEs and related derivatives of emerging importance are CMC (Nε-carboxymethylcysteine) [17], CMA (Nε-carboxymethylarginine) [18] and ornithine [19], the latter formed as a degradation product of hydroimidazolones (Figure 2).</p>Enzymatic defence against glycation<p>Protein glycation in physiological systems is prevented and repaired by components of the enzymatic defence against glycation [20]. It involves enzymatic activities that suppress the formation of glycation adducts and repair sites of early glycation: Glo1 and AKRds (aldo–keto reductases) and aldehyde dehydrogenases detoxify reactive dicarbonyl-glycating agents [21,22], and amadoriase and fructosamine 3-phosphokinase that catalyse the removal of FL residues and free adducts [23-25] (Figure 3). The enzymatic defence against glycation suppresses damage to biological macromolecules, but it is an imperfect defence; glycation adducts of proteins, nucleotides and basic phospholipids are formed in normal physiological states. The enzymatic defence against glycation is overwhelmed in some disease states, and glycation adduct concentrations increase. The decline of expression of enzymes of the enzymatic defence against glycation may be key to increased protein glycation in the aging phenotype.</p>Glycation of mitochondrial proteins<p>Proteins modified by AGE residues in mitochondria have been detected by immunoassay and by GC–MS. Immunoassay of AGEs suffers problems of incomplete characterization of antibody epitope recognition. For example, the 6D12 monoclonal antibody used to quantify the CML residues in rat liver mitochondrial protein [26,27] detects both CML and CEL residues with different affinities (the later with higher affinity than the former [28]) and cannot be used to quantify AGE residue content of proteins. Solutions of dried milk protein powder, a rich source of CML and other AGE residues [29], was also used to suppress non-specific antibody binding and hence probably produced interferences in these studies. Immunohistochemistry of tissues with 6D12 and anti-AGE antibodies 1F6, and 2A2 all showed mitochondrial immunoreactivity in human tissues [30].</p><p>Estimates of AGE residues of mitochondrial protein of improved analytical security came form the studies of Pamplona et al. [31] using stable-isotopic-dilution analysis/GC–MS. They found 1–2 mmol of CML/mol of lysine in rat heart mitochondrial protein [31]; CML residue content determined by 6D12 immunoassay was approx. 10-fold over estimates [26]. CEL residue content of mitochondrial protein was approx. 0.5 mmol/mol of lysine. Both CML and CEL residue content of mitochondrial protein decreased with caloric restriction [32]. Quantitative immunoblotting of AGE residue content of mitochondrial proteins has been performed with one of the best characterized monoclonal antibodies against AGE residues: monoclonal antibody 1H7G5 which recognizes MG-derived hydroimidazolone MG-H1 [33]. Quantitative immunoblotting with this antibody showed MG-H1 residues of mitochondrial protein in wild-type C. elegans and decreased MG-H1 residues of mitochondrial protein in transgenic C. elegans with overexpression of Glo1 [1]. Similar immunoblotting showed MG-H1 residue content of protein of mitochondria isolated from rat renal cortex. MG-H1 residue content of mitochondrial proteins was increased in diabetic rats [34].</p><p>The proteins modified by AGE residues have, as yet, only been detected by immunoreactivity with anti-AGE antibodies. This has not been corroborated by MS analysis of glycated peptides after limited proteolysis. It has been suggested that glutamate dehydrogenase is a target for AGE modification by immunoblotting with antibody 6D12 [35]. Several other mitochondrial proteins were found to be susceptible to modification by MG [34] (Table 1).</p>Effect of physiological dicarbonyl compounds on mitochondrial function<p>Incubation of rat renal mitochondria with MG (10–200 μM) for only 5 min at 24 °C produced a concentration-dependent decrease in state 3 respiration, an increase and then a decrease in state 4 respiration and a decrease in respiratory control quotient [36]. With such a short incubation time, it is likely that these effects were due to cysteinyl thiol modifications [37]. Reactive surface thiols are present in proteins of complexes I, II and IV [38], and proteins susceptible to thiol oxidation have been identified [39] (Table 1). The cellular concentrations of MG is usually approx. 2–4 μM [40]. Approx. 25% of MG is expected to be bound reversibly to GSH and 50% to protein thiols (assuming cellular concentrations of GSH and protein thiols of 3 and 6 mM respectively [41] and a thiol/MG dissociation constant of 3 mM [3]). It is therefore unclear whether physiological concentrations of MG have an acute effect on mitochondrial respiration; any effect is likely to be a modest decrease of effect on state 3 respiration. Similarly, the acute effects of MG and glyoxal (200 μM–5 mM) on the mitochondrial transition pore protein are of unlikely physiological relevance [42]. The steady-state levels of MG-H1 residues of mitochondrial proteins, as found in C. elegans and rat renal cortical mitochondria [1,34], as MG-H1 is the most important AGE residue quantitatively in physiological systems [43] and is associated with functional impairment of modified proteins [40,44].</p>MG modification of the mitochondrial proteome<p>There are estimated to be approx. 1500 proteins in the mitochondrial proteome. Only 13 proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are encoded by the mitochondrial genome; the others are nuclear-encoded, synthesized in the cytosol and targeted to mitochondria [45]. Seven proteins have, to date, been suggested as susceptible targets of advanced glycation and AGE residue formation (Table 1). We do not yet understand the full consequences of increased modification of mitochondrial proteins by MG. Enoyl-CoA hydratase is involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. Core protein I of complex III was susceptible to S-carboxymethylation and modification inhibited electron-transport activity [46]. Other targets for dicarbonyl glycation are subunits of complex I and F1-ATPase. Mitochondrial electron flavoprotein β-subunit was a further subject for dicarbonyl glycation. Modification of a single arginine residue is known to impede electron transfer [47]. Cytochrome c1 is part of the cytochrome bc1 complex of complex III, a 30 kDa membrane-bound c-type cytochrome protein of mitochondria that functions as an electron donor to cytochrome c [48].</p>Summary<p>Dicarbonyl glycation of proteins and the glyoxalase system has been overlooked as an influential factor on oxidative stress. Life extension and decreased mitochondrial ROS with overexpression of Glo1 in C. elegans has suggested that non-oxidative dicarbonyl glycation may be a critical upstream event of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. This has implications for current hypotheses of the cause of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in vascular cells during hyperglycaemia in diabetes, linked to chronic vascular complications, and to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in aging. Modification of mitochondrial proteins with associated functional impairment may have a critical role in the formation of mitochondrial ROS and also in the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in some circumstances. It is now important to characterize proteins that are susceptible to dicarbonyl glycation and functional impairment associated with the 'dicarbonyl proteome' of mitochondria.</p>","answer":"Protection of mitochondrial proteins from glycation by endogenous dicarbonyl compounds, methylglyoxal and glyoxal, was found recently to prevent increased formation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative and nitrosative damage to the proteome during aging and produce life extension in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This suggests that dicarbonyl glycation damage to the mitochondrial proteome may be a preceding event to mitochondrial dysfunction leading to oxidative stress. Future research will address the functional charges in mitochondrial proteins that are the targets for dicarbonyl glycation."},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper. Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:The available resolution in our visual world is extremely high, if not infinite.Existing CNNs can be applied in a fully convolutional way to images of arbitrary resolution, but as the size of the input increases, they can not capture contextual information.In addition, computational requirements scale linearly to the number of input pixels, and resources are allocated uniformly across the input, no matter how informative different image regions are.We attempt to address these problems by proposing a novel architecture that traverses an image pyramid in a top-down fashion, while it uses a hard attention mechanism to selectively process only the most informative image parts.We conduct experiments on MNIST and ImageNet datasets, and we show that our models can significantly outperform fully convolutional counterparts, when the resolution of the input is that big that the receptive field of the baselines can not adequately cover the objects of interest.Gains in performance come for less FLOPs, because of the selective processing that we follow.Furthermore, our attention mechanism makes our predictions more interpretable, and creates a trade-off between accuracy and complexity that can be tuned both during training and testing time.Our visual world is very rich, and there is information of interest in an almost infinite number of different scales.As a result, we would like our models to be able to process images of arbitrary resolution, in order to capture visual information with arbitrary level of detail.This is possible with existing CNN architectures, since we can use fully convolutional processing (Long et al. (2015) ), coupled with global pooling.However, global pooling ignores the spatial configuration of feature maps, and the output essentially becomes a bag of features 1 .To demonstrate why this an important problem, in Figure 1(a) and(b) we provide an example of a simple CNN that is processing an image in two different resolutions.In(a) we see that the receptive field of neurons from the second layer suffices to cover half of the kid's body, while in(b) the receptive field of the same neurons cover area that corresponds to the size of a foot.This shows that as the input size increases, the final representation becomes a bag of increasingly more local features, leading to the absence of coarselevel information, and potentially harming performance.We call this phenomenon the receptive field problem of fully convolutional processing.An additional problem is that computational resources are allocated uniformly to all image regions, no matter how important they are for the task at hand.For example, in Figure 1 (b), the same amount of computation is dedicated to process both the left half of the image that contains the kid, and the right half that is merely background.We also have to consider that computational complexity scales linearly with the number of input pixels, and as a result, the bigger the size of the input, the more resources are wasted on processing uninformative regions.We attempt to resolve the aforementioned problems by proposing a novel architecture that traverses an image pyramid in a top-down fashion, while it visits only the most informative regions along the way.The receptive field problem of fully convolutional processing.A simple CNN consisted of 2 convolutional layers (colored green), followed by a global pooling layer (colored red), processes an image in two different resolutions.The shaded regions indicate the receptive fields of neurons from different layers.As the resolution of the input increases, the final latent representation becomes a bag of increasingly more local features, lacking coarse information.(c) A sketch of our proposed architecture.The arrows on the left side of the image demonstrate how we focus on image sub-regions in our top-down traversal, while the arrows on the right show how we combine the extracted features in a bottom-up fashion.In Figure 1 (c) we provide a simplified sketch of our approach.We start at level 1, where we process the input image in low resolution, to get a coarse description of its content.The extracted features (red cube) are used to select out of a predefined grid, the image regions that are worth processing in higher resolution.This process constitutes a hard attention mechanism, and the arrows on the left side of the image show how we extend processing to 2 additional levels.All extracted features are combined together as denoted by the arrows on the right, to create the final image representation that is used for classification (blue cube).We evaluate our model on synthetic variations of MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998 ) and on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009 ), while we compare it against fully convolutional baselines.We show that when the resolution of the input is that big, that the receptive field of the baseline 2 covers a relatively small portion of the object of interest, our network performs significantly better.We attribute this behavior to the ability of our model to capture both contextual and local information by extracting features from different pyramid levels, while the baselines suffer from the receptive field problem.Gains in accuracy are achieved for less floating point operations (FLOPs) compared to the baselines, due to the attention mechanism that we use.If we increase the number of attended image locations, computational requirements increase, but the probability of making a correct prediction is expected to increase as well.This is a trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity, that can be tuned during training through regularization, and during testing by stopping processing on early levels.Finally, by inspecting attended regions, we are able to get insights about the image parts that our networks value the most, and to interpret the causes of missclassifications.We proposed a novel architecture that is able to process images of arbitrary resolution without sacrificing spatial information, as it typically happens with fully convolutional processing.This is achieved by approaching feature extraction as a top-down image pyramid traversal, that combines information from multiple different scales.The employed attention mechanism allows us to adjust the computational requirements of our models, by changing the number of locations they attend.This way we can exploit the existing trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy.Furthermore, by inspecting the image regions that our models attend, we are able to get important insights about the causes of their decisions.Finally, there are multiple future research directions that we would like to explore.These include the improvement of the localization capabilities of our attention mechanism, and the application of our model to the problem of budgeted batch classification.In addition, we would like our feature extraction process to become more adaptive, by allowing already extracted features to affect the processing of image regions that are attended later on.Figure 8 we provide the parsing tree that our model implicitly creates.","answer":"We propose a novel architecture that traverses

Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response.The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.Ceritinib is effective and approved for ALK-positive NSCLC in the acquired resistance setting.Ceritinib is an oral, potent, second-generation ALK inhibitor recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug AdministrationPreclinical data showed impressive antitumor activity against crizotinib-resistant clones, and based on available data, ceritinib could represent a suitable option in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC.In this review, we aim to present the current knowledge on acquired resistance of crizotinib known as a first-in-class ALK inhibitor and potential solutions to improve the cost-effectiveness, and to review the difference between ceritinib and crizotinib; preclinical data and results of the elegant early clinical trial of ceritinib which promoted its accelerated approval, pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and tolerability, the updated results (eg, efficacy on brain metastases), and robust design of ongoing phase II/III trials, and future directions of ceritinib to be a potent alternative to crizotinib for ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer are also presented.In particular, ceritinib effectively inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.SIGNIFICANCE: The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib.The ALK inhibitor ceritinib overcomes crizotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.  The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib.The accelerated approval of potent ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib and more recently ceritinib (LDK378), based on the well designed phase I/II trials has been a landmark success in clinical cancer research and contributes a new era of oncogenic targeted therapy characterized by elegant clinical trial design. In this review, we aim to present the current knowledge on acquired resistance of crizotinib known as a first-in-class ALK inhibitor and potential solutions to improve the cost-effectiveness, and to review the difference between ceritinib and crizotinib; preclinical data and results of the elegant early clinical trial of ceritinib which promoted its accelerated approval, pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and tolerability, the updated results (eg, efficacy on brain metastases), and robust design of ongoing phase II/III trials, and future directions of ceritinib to be a potent alternative to crizotinib for ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer are also presented.","answer":"Ceritinib is a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that serves as an effective and approved oral therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

To understand the role of NF-kappa B complexes in T cell development and activation, we have generated transgenic mice in which RelA and c-Rel complexes were selectively inhibited in the T-lineage cells by specific expression of a trans-dominant form of I kappa B alpha. Transgene expression did not affect the thymic development, but led to lowered numbers of splenic T cells and to a dramatic decrease in the ex vivo proliferative response of splenic T lymphocytes. Analysis of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha expression demonstrated that the perturbation of the proliferation response was not attributable to an abnormal expression of these genes. In contrast, expression of IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma was strongly inhibited in the transgenic T cells. The proliferative deficiency of the transgenic T cells was associated with an increased apoptosis. These results point out the involvement of NF-kappa B / Rel family proteins in growth signaling pathways by either regulating proteins involved in the IL-2 signaling or by functionally interfering with the cell cycle progression.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"the T - lineage cells\\", \\"T - lineage cells\\", \\"transgenic T cells\\", \\"splenic T lymphocytes\\", \\"T cells\\", \\"T lymphocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"IL - 4\\", \\"RelA\\", \\"NF - kappa B / Rel family proteins\\", \\"IFN - gamma\\", \\"cytokine\\", \\"regulating proteins\\", \\"IL - 2R alpha\\", \\"IL - 10\\", \\"c - Rel complexes\\", \\"I kappa B alpha\\", \\"NF - kappa B\\", \\"IL - 2\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVE Since January 2008, obese women with type 2 diabetes were advised to gain 0-5 kg during pregnancy. The aim with this study was to evaluate fetal growth and perinatal morbidity in relation to gestational weight gain in these women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective cohort comprised the records of 58 singleton pregnancies in obese women (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)) with type 2 diabetes giving birth between 2008 and 2011. Birth weight was evaluated by SD z score to adjust for gestational age and sex. RESULTS Seventeen women (29%) gained ≤5 kg, and the remaining 41 gained >5 kg. The median (range) gestational weight gains were 3.7 kg (-4.7 to 5 kg) and 12.1 kg (5.5-25.5 kg), respectively. Prepregnancy BMI was 33.5 kg/m(2) (30-53 kg/m(2)) vs. 36.8 kg/m(2) (30-48 kg/m(2)), P = 0.037, and median HbA1c was 6.7% at first visit in both groups and decreased to 5.7 and 6.0%, P = 0.620, in late pregnancy, respectively. Gestational weight gain ≤5 kg was associated with lower birth weight z score (P = 0.008), lower rates of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants (12 vs. 39%, P = 0.041), delivery closer to term (268 vs. 262 days, P = 0.039), and less perinatal morbidity (35 vs. 71%, P = 0.024) compared with pregnancies with maternal weight gain >5 kg. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study in obese women with type 2 diabetes, maternal gestational weight gain ≤5 kg was associated with a more proportionate birth weight and less perinatal morbidity.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The polymeric precursor was made by solution polymerization of aqueous solution of acrylic acid in presence of La(NO3)3 and (NH4)6Mo7O24 with (NH4)S2O8 as the initiator. The typical experimental procedure is first to dissolve the stoichiometric amount of La(NO3)3*6H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24*4H2O in triple distilled water and then the solution is pour into a acrylic acid solution (acrylic acid:H2O, 70:30 wt%) with constant stirring. To this a small amount of 5% (NH4)S2O8 solution was added as initiator to promote the polymerization. Under heating at ~80 degC, a well-distributed polyacrylates of La and Mo is formed. Afterward the resultant polyacrylates were dried at 120 degC for 1-2 h.

Endotoxin selectively induces monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD) without affecting levels of Cu, Zn SOD, catalase, or glutathione peroxidase. However, little is known about the structure-activity relationship and the mechanism by which endotoxin induces Mn SOD. In this study we demonstrated that a mutant Escherichia coli endotoxin lacking myristoyl fatty acid at the 3' R-3-hydroxymyristate position of the lipid A moiety retained its full capacity to coagulate Limulus amoebocyte lysate compared with the wild-type E. coli endotoxin and markedly stimulated the activation of human monocyte nuclear factor-kappaB and the induction of Mn SOD mRNA and enzyme activity. However, in contrast to the wild-type endotoxin, it failed to induce significant production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha by monocytes and did not induce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results suggest that 1) lipid A myristoyl fatty acid, although it is important for the induction of inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes, is not necessary for the induction of Mn SOD, 2) endotoxin-mediated induction of Mn SOD and inflammatory cytokines are regulated, at least in part, through different signal transduction pathways, and 3) failure of the mutant endotoxin to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha production is, at least in part, due to its inability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"monocytes\\", \\"human monocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase\\", \\"glutathione peroxidase\\", \\"Mn SOD\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor - alpha\\", \\"monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD)\\", \\"mutant endotoxin\\", \\"catalase\\", \\"Endotoxin\\", \\"SOD\\", \\"Zn SOD\\", \\"human monocyte nuclear factor - kappaB\\", \\"endotoxin\\", \\"cytokines\\", \\"inflammatory cytokine\\", \\"mitogen - activated protein kinase\\", \\"macrophage inflammatory protein - 1alpha\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"Mn SOD mRNA\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"methotrexate\\", \\"azathioprine\\", \\"Cyclophosphamide\\", \\"chlorambucil\\", \\"alkylating agents\\", \\"folic acid\\", \\"purine\\", \\"cyclophosphamide\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"neoplasms\\", \\"cancers\\", \\"malignancy\\", \\"rheumatoid arthritis\\", \\"carcinoma of the bladder\\", \\"acute nonlymphocytic leukemia\\", \\"synovitis\\", \\"carcinoma\\", \\"non-Hodgkinu0027s lymphoma\\"]}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Several ACPA can be observed before other clinical RA manifestations are apparent.Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein/peptide autoantibodies (ACPAs).Anti-citrullinated peptides as autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis-relevance to treatment.The implications of citrullination affecting integrin binding in disease open up a new area of study and might have implications for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis.In this paper, we will review the three of the main classes of PTMs already associated with RA: citrullination, carbamylation, and oxidation.Citrullinated collagen II (CII) is a well-known autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Among the RA-associated autoantibodies, especially anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have been studied intensively in the last decade.Protein citrullination is a posttranslational modification that has attracted increased attention, especially for its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Identification of citrullinated cellular fibronectin in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Cellular fibronectin (cFn) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and we previously demonstrated the presence of citrullinated cFn in rheumatoid synovial tissues..

Outcome and use of resources were compared with those of patients treated in general medical wards (MWs). A per-protocol rather than intention-to-treat analysis was performed.                A randomized trial with 3-months follow-up. A total of 190 patients aged 70 years and older were randomized to an acute geriatrics-based ward, and 223 patients were randomized to general medical wards.                The two groups were comparable at inclusion. However, after care in the AGW, 71% of patients could be discharged directly home compared with 64% of those treated in MWs (relative risk 1.17; 95% CI, 0.93-1.49). The length of stay was shorter in the AGW (mean 5.9 vs 7.3 days; P = .002). The proportion of patients in geriatric or other hospital wards or in nursing homes did not differ, but the proportion of AGW patients in sheltered living tended to be lower (P = .085). At the follow-up, case fatality, ADL function, psychological well-being, need for daily personal assistance, drug consumption, need for readmission to hospital, and total health care costs after discharge did not differ between the two groups. Poor global outcome was observed in 37% of AGW and 34% of MW patients.                A geriatric approach with greater emphasis on early rehabilitation and discharge planning in the AGW shortened the length of hospital stay and may have reduced the need for long-term institutional living. This occurred despite patients in an acute geriatric ward not having better medical or functional outcome than older acute patients treated in general medical wards.Title 2:Acute care delivery for the geriatric patient: an innovative approach.Abstract 2:As the elderly population and expenditures for health care continue to grow rapidly in the United States, how to provide high-quality, cost-effective geriatric care is becoming a pressing question. To address this question, Choate-Symmes Health Services, Inc, established 10-bed Geriatric Special Care Units (GSCUs) in its two suburban Boston hospitals. Care on the GSCUs is delivered under a primary nursing model and involves comprehensive assessment, development of individual care plans emphasizing independence and activity, an interdisciplinary patient care team, and family participation in care planning. Patients were randomly assigned to either the GSCU or a traditional adult medical/surgical unit; outcomes were studied through questionnaires and medical record data. Researchers anticipated improved functional ability, less frequent use of restraints, fewer complications, shorter lengths of stay, and less frequent readmission to the hospital or admission to nursing homes for GSCU patients. The article presents preliminary results, discusses implementation issues, and describes plans for continued study.Title 3:A randomized controlled trial of exercise to improve outcomes of acute hospitalization in older adults.Abstract 3:Older adults hospitalized for nondisabling diagnoses can lose functional ability. Lack of exercise or physical activity during the acute illness and recovery may be contributory. This study evaluated whether increased exercise in hospital and afterward would shorten length of stay and improve physical function at 1 month.                A randomized controlled trial.                A 700-bed community-based hospital with academic and teaching programs.                Three hundred patients (mean age 78.2 years +/- 5.6) with nondisabling medical and surgical diagnoses who were admitted to an acute care hospital between December 1990 and April 1992. All patients had an expected length of stay 5 or more days, were ambulatory before admission, and were not expected to die within 12 months.                A hospital-based general exercise program was administered to intervention patients along with encouragement to continue the program, self-administered, at home.                The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes at 1 month post-discharge included measures of physical function and other general health indicators.                There was no significant difference in length of stay between treatment and control groups controlling for baseline characteristics and diagnoses. The intervention was associated with better function in instrumental activities of daily living (beta = .433 (95% CI, 0.044-0.842)) at 1 month but no change in perceived general health status and other measures of physical function.                An exercise program started during hospitalization and continued for 1 month did not shorten length of stay but did improve functional outcome at 1 month.Title 4:A randomized trial of geriatric liaison intervention in elderly medical inpatients.Abstract 4:The aim of this study was to examine the effect of psychogeriatric intervention in a group of elderly medical inpatients over 75 years of age. In addition to usual care, intervention consisted of multidisciplinary joint treatment by a psychogeriatric team. The main purpose of intervention was to obtain the optimal level of physical functioning.                In a prospective randomized trial the effect of the intervention (N = 140) compared with usual care (N = 97) was estimated for physical functioning, length of stay, and nursing home placement within 12 months of discharge.                Substantially more patients assigned to the intervention group improved in their physical functioning, and fewer became worse. The mean length of stay was 5 days shorter for the intervention group. There were more readmissions to hospital in the usual care group (29.9%) compared with the intervention group (17.4%). Of the patients assigned to the intervention treatment, 18% were admitted to a nursing home. In the usual care group this was 27%. The effects of intervention remained statistically significant for all the outcome variables after controlling for possible confounding baseline characteristics.                The intervention we studied had clinically relevant effects on important outcome variables. Psychiatric co-morbidity was an important risk factor for the outcome of the patients in our study. By combining elements from a psychiatric and geriatric consultation service with elements from a unit-driven service, we were able to improve health care for the elderly in our hospital in a feasible and cost-effective way.Title 5:Do acute care for elders units increase hospital costs?

A total of 650 medical patients (mean age 80 years, 67% women, 41% nonwhite) assigned randomly to either the intervention unit (n = 326) or usual care (n = 324).                The hospital's resource-based cost of caring for patients was determined from the hospital's cost-accounting system. The cost of the intervention program was estimated and included in the intervention patients' total hospital cost.                The development and maintenance costs of the intervention added 38.43 per bed day to the intervention patients' hospital costs. As a result, the cost per day to the hospital was slightly higher in the intervention patients than in the control patients (876 vs 847, P = .076). However, the average length of stay was shorter for intervention patients (7.5 vs 8.4 days, P = .449). As a result, the hospital's total cost to care for intervention patients was not greater than caring for usual-care patients (6608 in intervention patients vs 7240 in control patients, P = .926). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the cost of the intervention program would need to be 220% greater than estimated before intervention patients would be more expensive then control patients. There were no examined subgroups of patients in whom care on the intervention unit was significantly more expensive than care on the usual-care unit. Ninety-day nursing home use was lower in intervention than control patients (24.1% vs 32.3%, P = .034). Ninety-day readmission rates (36.7% vs 41.1%, P = .283) and caregiver strain scores (3.3 vs. 2.7, P = .280) were similar.                Caring for patients on an intervention ward designed to improve functional outcomes in older patients was not more expensive to the hospital than caring for patients on a usual-care ward even though the intervention ward required a commitment of hospital resources.Title 6:A randomized trial of care in a hospital medical unit especially designed to improve the functional outcomes of acutely ill older patients.Abstract 6:Older persons who re hospitalized for acute illnesses often lose their independence and are discharged to institutions for long-term care.                We studied 651 patients 70 years of age or older who were admitted for general medical care at a teaching hospital; these patients were randomly assigned to receive usual care or to be cared for in a special unit designed to help older persons maintain or achieve independence in self-care activities. The key elements of this program were a specially prepared environment (with, for example, uncluttered hallways, large clocks and calendars, and handrails); patient-centered care emphasizing independence, including specific protocols for prevention of disability and for rehabilitation; discharge planning with the goal of returning the patient to his or her home; and intensive review of medical care to minimize the adverse effects of procedures and medications. The main outcome we measured ws the change from admission to discharge in the number of five basic activities of daily living (bathing, getting dressed, using the toilet, moving from a bed to a chair, and eating) that the patient could perform independently.                Twenty-four patients in each group died in the hospital. At the time of discharge, 65 (21 percent) of the 303 surviving patients in the intervention group were classified as much better in terms of their ability to perform basic activities of daily living, 39 (13 percent) as better, 151 (50 percent) as unchanged, 22 (7 percent) as worse, and 26 (9 percent) as much worse. In the usual care group, 40 (13 percent) of the 300 surviving patients were classified as much better, 33 (11 percent) as better, 163 (54 percent) as unchanged, 39 (13 percent) as worse, and 25 (8 percent) as much worse (P = 0.009). The difference between the groups remained significant (P = 0.04) in a multivariable model in which we controlled for potentially confounding base-line characteristics of the patients. Lengths of stay and hospital charges were similar in the two groups. Fewer patients assigned to the intervention group were discharged to long-term care institutions (43 patients [14 percent], as compared with 67 patients [22 percent] in the usual-care group; P = 0.01). Among the 493 patients discharged to private homes, similar proportions (about 10 percent) in the two groups were admitted to long-term care institutions during the three months after discharge.                Specific changes in the provision of acute hospital care can improve the ability of a heterogeneous group of acutely ill older patients to perform basic activities of daily living at the time of discharge from the hospital and can reduce the frequency of discharge to institutions for long-term care.Title 7:Effects of a multicomponent intervention on functional outcomes and process of care in hospitalized older patients: a randomized controlled trial of Acute Care for Elders (ACE) in a community hospital.Abstract 7:Older persons frequently experience a decline in function following an acute medical illness and hospitalization.                To test the hypothesis that a multicomponent intervention, called Acute Care for Elders (ACE), will improve functional outcomes and the process of care in hospitalized older patients.                Randomized controlled trial.                Community teaching hospital.                A total of 1,531 community-dwelling patients, aged 70 or older, admitted for an acute medical illness between November 1994 and May 1997.                ACE includes a specially designed environment (with, for example, carpeting and uncluttered hallways); patient-centered care, including nursing care plans for prevention of disability and rehabilitation; planning for patient discharge to home; and review of medical care to prevent iatrogenic illness.                The main outcome was change in the number of independent activities of daily living (ADL) from 2 weeks before admission (baseline) to discharge. Secondary outcomes included resource use, implementation of orders to promote function, and patient and provider satisfaction.                Self-reported measures of function did not differ at discharge between the intervention and usual care groups by intention-to-treat analysis. The composite outcome of ADL decline from baseline or nursing home placement was less frequent in the intervention group at discharge (34% vs 40%; P = .027) and during the year following hospitalization (P = .022). There were no significant group differences in hospital length of stay and costs, home healthcare visits, or readmissions. Nursing care plans to promote independent function were more often implemented in the intervention group (79% vs 50%; P = .001), physical therapy consults were obtained more frequently (42% vs 36%; P = .027), and restraints were applied to fewer patients (2% vs 6%; P = .001). Satisfaction with care was higher for the intervention group than the usual care group among patients, caregivers, physicians, and nurses (P < .05).                ACE in a community hospital improved the process of care and patient and provider satisfaction without increasing hospital length of stay or costs. A lower frequency of the composite outcome ADL decline or nursing home placement may indicate potentially beneficial effects on patient outcomes.","answer":"There is 'silver' level evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) that multidisciplinary intervention that includes exercise may increase the proportion of patients discharged to home and reduce length and cost of hospital stay for acutely hospitalised older medical patients."},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Expression of putative renal cell carcinoma markers PAX-2, PAX-8, and hKIM-1 has been reported in a few germ cell tumors, including seminomas1 (PAX-8) and yolk sac tumors2,3 (PAX-2, PAX-8, hKIM-1); however, a thorough characterization in a large series of germ cell tumors has not been previously reported.</p>MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>A tissue microarray composed of 100 randomly distributed germ cell tumors [including choriocarcinoma (1), embryonal carcinoma (21), intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (2), seminoma (61), spermatocytic seminoma (1), teratoma (5), and yolk sac tumor (8)] using 1.2-mm diameter cores was prepared in triplicate (Stanford tissue microarray 136) and evaluated as described elsewhere.4 Immunohistochemical expression of PAX-2 (Z-RX2, 1:100, Zymed, San Francisco, CA), PAX-8 (polyclonal, 1:20, Proteintech, Chicago, IL), and anti-hKIM-1 (AKG7, prediluted, Joseph Bonventre Lab, Boston, MA) was evaluated using the standard avidin-biotin technique with a Dako (Carpinteria, CA) autostainer with citrate retrieval on 4-mm thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded freshly cut sections mounted on charged slides and baked at 60°C for 1 hour. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma was used as an external positive control tissue, with non-neoplastic and nongerm cell testicular tissues present on the germ cell tumor tissue microarray used as negative controls. Positive reactivity was scored as nuclear (PAX-2, PAX-8) or membranous/cytoplasmic (hKIM-1) with staining intensity scored as none, weak, or strong by 1 author (A.R.S.) manually and intraobserver variability assessed by 3 separate scoring sessions with an interval of 3 weeks between each session.</p>RESULTS<p>Of the 100 germ cell tumors evaluated, expression for hKIM-1 was identified in 10 of 21 (48%) embryonal carcinomas (Fig. 1A) and 4 of 8 (50%) yolk sac tumors (Fig. 1B) (weak to strong in both tumors). PAX-2 and PAX-8 reactivity was identified in 4 of 8 (50%) and 2 of 8 (25%) of yolk sac tumors (Figs. 1C, D) (weak to strong and strong, respectively). All other germ cell tumors were negative for all 3 markers. Table 1 summarizes the immunohistochemical staining results. There was no evidence of any intraobserver variability.</p>DISCUSSION<p>The frequency of renal cell carcinoma metastasis to the testis is approximately 1%.5 Despite this low prevalence, reports of unusual clinical presentations of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (testicular metastasis as initial diagnostic presentation of primary renal tumor, ipsilateral primary renal tumor with contralateral testicular metastasis, long interval to testicular metastasis, and paratesticular location of metastasis)6–22 coupled with certain cases showing significant morphologic overlap can make accurate diagnosis challenging. Emerging data on the utility of diagnostic testicular mass biopsies23 yielding small tissue sample can further complicate this problem.</p><p>The main goal of this study was to expand on our initial report of PAX-2, PAX-8, and hKIM-1 immunoreactivity in yolk sac tumors (4 of 5, 1 of 5, and 1 of 5 tumors, respectively)3 by using additional and more numerous germ cell tumor subtypes. The current study's addition of 8 yolk sac tumors corroborates our initial findings, with PAX-2 and PAX-8 staining found in 50% (4/8) cases and hKIM-1 staining found in 25% (2/8) cases. Although our initial report showed no PAX-2/ PAX-8/hKIM-1 staining in 4 embryonal carcinomas, in this study we identified hKIM-1reactivity in 48% (10/21) of embryonal carcinomas. These detailed results, in conjunction with only 2 previously published findings [reported PAX-8 positivity in 3 of 7 \\"mixed germ cell tumor\\"24 and reported PAX-8 positive in 1 of 49 germ cell tumors (single positive case was yolk sac tumor2)], further demonstrate the lack of unequivocal specificity of these 3 putative renal cell carcinoma markers and add to the growing list of reported immunoreactive tumor types. Although PAX-2/PAX-8/hKIM-1 immunoreactivity was not identified in the single choriocarcinoma and 5 teratomas, additional studies using more cases are needed for more definitive assessment.</p><p>Another goal of this study was to investigate the immunoreactivity of PAX-2, PAX-8, and hKIM-1 in seminomas given a prior report of weak (1 to 2+/4+) PAX-8 staining in 2 of 3 cases.1 Corroborating our initial report of no staining with these 3 markers in 20 seminomas,3 we found no staining in 62 additional seminomas. The recent study by Tong et al2 similarly found no PAX-8 staining in 32 seminomas. These findings may prove useful in separating a subset of morphologically challenging cases (in particular, metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma vs. seminoma).</p><p>It should be noted that although the hKIM-1 antibody as used in this study is not currently commercially available, development is underway and should be accessible in the near future (personal communication, J.V.B., Boston, MA). Although some antibodies reportedly sharing homology with hKIM-1 are commercially available (TIM-1; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN and KIM-1; Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Newberg, OR), the diagnostic utility of these markers has not been fully evaluated in this study, limiting appropriate comparative analysis.</p><p>In summary, we confirm PAX-2/PAX-8/hKIM-1 reactivity in yolk sac tumor as we previously noted in a smaller series3 and demonstrate hKIM-1 reactivity in embryonal carcinoma. Our findings indicate that these putative renal cell carcinoma markers should be used cautiously, particularly in cases with morphologic overlap, unusual clinical presentation, and small sample size. A panel approach inclusive of germ cell tumor-specific markers (eg, SALL4) may be useful in these cases. In contrast to prior reports, PAX-8 showed no staining in seminoma. Although the results of this study could conceivably be applicable to extragonadal germ cell tumors, additional studies are needed for verification.</p><p>Presented in part at the 100th meeting of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, San Antonio, TX, March 2011.</p><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p><p>Membranous/cytoplasmic immunostaining for hKIM-1 was seen in approximately half of (A) embryonal carcinomas and (B) yolk sac tumors. Yolk sac tumors were the only germ cell tumor with immunoreactivity for (C) PAX-2 and (D) PAX-8, seen in half/one-quarter of cases, respectively.</p><p>Positive Cases With PAX-2, PAX-8, and hKIM-1 Antibodies in Germ Cell Tumors</p>","answer":"In a subset of cases, metastatic renal cell carcinoma can demonstrate significant morphologic overlap with germ cell neoplasms, making accurate diagnosis challenging. In such cases, immunohistochemistry is often used as an adjunct diagnostic tool. Expression of the putative renal cell carcinoma markers PAX-2, PAX-8, and hKIM-1 has been reported in a small series of certain germ cell tumors, raising doubt about their specificity for renal cell carcinoma. To further characterize these markers, we evaluated PAX-2, PAX-8, and hKIM-1 staining in 100 germ cell tumors using tissue microarrays. PAX-2 and PAX-8 staining was identified in 50% and 25% of yolk sac tumors (respectively), with hKIM-1 staining identified in 48% of embryonal carcinomas and 50% of yolk sac tumors. All other germ tumor cells (notably including 62 seminomas) were negative for all 3 markers, in contrast to prior reports of PAX-8 reactivity in seminoma. This study indicates that PAX-2, PAX-8, and hKIM-1 should be used cautiously in distinguishing renal cell carcinoma from nonseminomatous germ cell neoplasia and also adds to the growing list of nonrenal tumors that express these 3 markers."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

old woman with a two - year history of dizziness and headache was admitted to our hospital after experiencing a generalized tonic clonic seizure .however , six years previously she had undergone a right suboccipital craniectomy and microvascular decompression ( mvd ) of the facial nerve for a hemifacial spasm . a computed tomography scan obtained at the time of her initial presentation showed curvilinear subcortical calcification and sulcus effacement , predominantly in the right temporal lobe ( fig .susceptibility - weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( swi ) then demonstrated multiple curvilinear flow voids along the cerebral surface , thus suggesting the presence of a vascular anomaly .magnetic resonance angiography ( mra ) performed to evaluate the possibility of a vascular lesion , revealed a davf of the isolated right transverse sinus as well as cortical venous reflux ( fig .1b ) . digital subtraction angiography ( dsa ) demonstrated a davf with an isolated right transverse sinus , supplied by the transosseous branches of the bilateral occipital artery , and the petrosquamous branch of the right middle meningeal artery as well as dural branches from the right vertebral artery .there was retrograde cortical venous reflux ( cvr ) via leptomeningeal veins from the temporal lobe ( fig .2a , b ) . due to our fear of the risk of hemorrhage or venous infarction associated with cvran intravenous bolus of 4000 iu of heparin was administered following placement of a 6-french guiding sheath in the right femoral artery .we initiated the embolization procedures using superselective catheterization of the larger arterial pedicle , which supplied the isolated sinus of the davf , in order to achieve the arteriovenous shunt point .a 6-french guiding catheter ( envoy , cordis endovascular , miami lakes , fl , usa ) was placed at the origin of the external carotid artery supplying the meningeal artery chosen for davf catheterization .the microcatheter lumen was then flushed with dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso , ev3 inc . ,after that , 0.3 ml onyx-18 was injected within davf followed by biplanar simultaneous subtracted fluoroscopy . during the injection of onyx ,special attention was given in order to maintain a steady injection of onyx , while looking for any reflux of onyx into the feeding artery along the microcatheter as well as into the cortical vein beyond the isolated sinus .when unwanted flow into a non - targeted areas was observed , the injection was stopped for as long as two minutes .once the affected sinus was completely packed with onyx and there was reflux into the feeding artery along the microcatheter , the injection was terminated .post -

free and follow - up magnetic resonance imaging was then scheduled .although davfs may be found in any dural structures , they occur most frequently in the regions of the transverse , sigmoid , and cavernous sinuses1 ) . patients with a davf may be asymptomatic or may experience symptoms ranging from those which are non - aggressive , ( e.g. , headache , pulsatile tinnitus ) to aggressive symptoms such as hemorrhage , seizures or neurologic deficit .the risk for intracerebral hemorrhage is increased when lesions are in certain locations such as the anterior fossa , and particularly when there is angiographic evidence of cvr . the annual mortality rate for patients with cvr may be as high as 10.4% , whereas the annual risk for hemorrhage or nonhemorrhagic neurologic deficits during follow - up period are 8.1% and 6.9% , respectively , and thus resulting in an annual event rate of 15%15 ) .davf has been reported to develop secondary to sinus thrombosis , trauma or craniotomy5,11,13,16 ) . in casesin which the development is secondary to intracranial surgery , a few authors have reported angiographic identification of davf13 ) .nabors et al.11 ) reported two cases of postoperative davf developing at the surgical site after suboccipital craniectomy , thus suggesting that fistulous development after apposition of the scalp or muscle blood vessels to the dura may be another cause of davf development at craniotomy sites .watanabe et al.16 ) reported arteriovenous malformations at sites other than craniotomy sites and suspected that indigenous davf opened and enlarged under the influence of the change of intracranial pressure after surgery .considering our patient 's previous medical history and the site of the intracranial surgery , we proposed the previous surgery as a possible cause of the davf .its frequent causes include sturge - weber syndrome , tuberous sclerosis , as well as post - chemoradiotherapy and metabolic disorders secondary to parathyroid or thyroid gland abnormalities .although the mechanism causing calcification associated with a vascular anomaly has not yet been identified , calcification accompanied by pial arteriovenous malformation is generally considered to be involved in a dystrophic process caused by focal hypoperfusion by steal phenomenon17 ) . in patients with davf with cvr, the calcification might be associated with hypoperfusion caused by profuse cvr and the distribution of the calcification may reflect the extent of the venous congestion9 ) . in our case ,subcortical calcifications in the right temporal lobe corresponded well with the area of diffuse engorgement of the superficial cortical and deep intramedullary veins identified in the mra , and dsa .davf with an isolated sinus is a peculiar entity in the sense that venous drainage is done through a thrombosed dural sinus , and it is frequently accompanied by a cvr .this hemodynamic mechanism redirects the blood flow to the cortical venous system , thereby resulting in venous hypertension8 ) .the absence of recanalization of an isolated venous sinus frequently renders an endovascular transvenous approach to be not possible .the nidus of a davf with isolated sinus had two types of arterial irrigation in our case .the fist type is that which originates from a transosseous arterial supply , and which is mainly tortuous and multiple , the transosseous branches of the occipital artery . in this main path for most of the blood flow for the davf ,contrary to the transosseous arterial supply , the meningeal artery system penetrates the cranium through its base , thus making the anatomy more navigable and , consequently , more amenable to microcatheterization7 ) .an advantage of using the branches of the meningeal artery is that they are anchored to both the dura and the calvarium .these features , combined with the non - adhesive nature of onyx , facilitate retrieval of the microcatheter at the end of an onyx infusion and minimize the risk of arterial rupture4 ) .several studies have reported high success rates associated with using of the middle meningeal artery ( mma ) as the main embolizing arterial pedicle .nogueira et al.12 ) obtained complete angiographic cures in 11 of 12 patients when using this method .cognard et al.2 ) reported that the fistula was completely obliterated after embolization of one arterial feeder , typically the mma , in 18 of 24 cases .a potential advantage of onyx over n - butyl - cyanoacrylate ( n - bca ) is that onyx embolization may allow for the occlusion of several different vessel feeders from a single pedicle .this therefore avoids the required time and repeated risk of subsequent catheterizations that may be required with n - bca .another consideration regarding the use of onyx is the prolonged fluoroscopic times . in our case ,this drawback must , however , be considered in the context of fewer required catheterizations with the use of onyx .theoretically , multiple catheterizations , as required with n - bca and particulate embolization , also increase the fluoroscopy time . without a prospective comparison of these agents, we can not definitely ascertain whether one technique is associated with shorter fluoroscopy times14 ) . as demonstrated in this case, onyx offers the possibility of venous sinus occlusion using an arterial side approach which may be quite helpful in cases with previous occlusion of a draining venous structure12 ) .davf involving the isolated transverse sinus , and acquired after suboccipital surgery for hemifacial spasm , showed multiple subcortical calcifications associated with venous congestion caused by cortical venous reflux seen on mra and dsa .we found transarterial onyx embolization via the middle meningeal artery to be effective for treating davf .owing to the capacity of onyx to penetrate a shunt and occlude the exit vein , transarterial onyx embolization can be a good option for curing davf with isolated sinus .","answer":"the authors present a case of isolated dural arteriovenous fistula ( davf ) in the transverse sinus , which developed six years after microvascular decompression caused by hemifacial spasm via suboccipital craniectomy .  the lesion was successfully treated by transarterial embolization using onyx .  we reviewed the related radiologic and therapeutic features of davf involving an isolated sinus and described the feasibility of the use of onyx ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Patients with BNP ≥200 pg/mL (High - BNP, n=170) had more advanced HF characteristics, including lower EF (25.0±8.6% vs. 28.1±8.0%, P=0.0008), than those with BNP <200 pg/mL. In the High - BNP patients, peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2) was significantly increased by 8.3±16.2% during the ET program, and changes in peak V̇O2 inversely correlated with changes in BNP (R=-0.453, P<0.0001) and changes in ventilatory efficiency (V̇E / V̇CO2 slope) (R=-0.439, P<0.0001). During a median follow-up of 46 months, patients in the upper tertile of changes in peak V̇O2 (≥13.0%), compared with those in the lower tertile (<1.0%), had lower rates of the composite of all-cause death or HF hospitalization (37.9% vs. 54.4%, P=0.036) and all-cause death (8.6% vs. 24.6%, P=0.056). In the multivariate analysis, change in peak V̇O2 was a significant independent predictor of the composite outcome and all-cause death. Even among advanced HF p atient s with high BNP level, an ET program significantly improved exercise capacity, and a greater improvement in exercise capacity was associated with greater decreases in BNP level and V̇E / V̇CO2 slope and more favorable long-term clinical outcomes.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"death\\", \\"advanced heart failure\\", \\"Advanced Heart Failure\\", \\"HF\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"BNP\\", \\"B-Type Natriuretic Peptide\\", \\"B-type natriuretic peptide\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"peak Vu0307O2\\", \\"Favorable Clinical Outcomes\\", \\"Vu0307O2\\", \\"improved\\", \\"favorable long-term clinical outcomes\\", \\"peak oxygen uptake\\", \\"lower EF\\", \\"decreases\\", \\"Vu0307CO2\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"ejection fraction\\", \\"EF\\", \\"follow-up\\", \\"hospitalization\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"studied\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

In EEG recordings during sleep, Katnal1 1H/1H mice show increased non-REM delta power in the dark phase of the light/dark cycle (f) and following sleep deprivation (g). *P ⩽ 0.05; P ⩽ 0.01; *P ⩽ 0.001.

Conversely when mouse activity was recorded in the home cage, we found no difference between genotypes (distance travelled over 24 h: wild type = 399 ± 77 m, Katnal1 1H/1H = 418 ± 41 m, P = 0.833) suggesting that the former activity differences were due to the novel environment of the open field rather than generalised hyperactivity in Katnal1 1H/1H animals. Finally, in certain conditions (such as maternal separation) mice emit ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs). To test whether Katnal1 1H/1H animals vocalised differently to wild types, we separated pups at postnatal days 7-8 (the age at which mice show peak of USV emission 24 ) and recorded their USVs. In these tests, compared to wild types, Katnal1 1H/1H pups produced fewer ( Figure 2g ) and shorter (Figure 2h ) vocalisations, containing fewer phrases (Figure 2i ). Gross brain morphological abnormalities in Katnal1 1H/1H mice Since we observed a number of behavioural phenotypes in Katnal1 1H/1H mice, we performed histological analysis to ascertain whether differences in brain histology underlied these behaviours. Data and cohort details are given in Supplementary  Table S3 . Analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stained brain sections revealed that, compared to wildtype littermates, Katnal1 1H/1H animals had less tightly packed pyramidal cell layers in the hippocampus (Figures 3a and b) and a narrower cortical layer 1 and wider cortical layer 6 (Figures 3c-e) . To confirm these cortical layer differences, immunofluorescence was performed using the (Figures 3l and m) . Quantification of fluorescence intensity demonstrated that in Katnal1 1H/1H cortex both calbindin and CUX1 labelling was more intense closer to the cortical surface, which is consistent with the reduction in the size of layer 1 (two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), interaction factors 'genotype X distance of fluorescence from cortical surface', calbindin: F(75,988) = 16.8, P o 0.0005; CUX1: F(93,372 = 2.17, P = 0.001; Figures 3h and k) . Similar quantification revealed that FOXP2 labelling extended further from layer 6b (as labelled by CTGF) in the Katnal1 1H/1H cortex, which is consistent with an increase in the size of layer 6 (two-way ANOVA, interaction factors 'genotype X distance of fluorescence from CTGF labelling:' F(93,372) = 1.32, P = 0.038; Figure 3n ). Finally, three dimensional models of the ventricular system were constructed from brain micro-computed tomography scans (Figures 3o and p) . Volumetric analysis revealed that Katnal1 1H/1H mice had substantially larger ventricles than wild types (Figure 3q ). Neuronal migration and morphology defects in Katnal1 1H/1H brains The histological phenotypes of Katnal1 1H/1H mouse brains described above are suggestive of neuronal migration defects. 18 We therefore investigated whether Katnal1 1H/1H mice showed abnormal neuronal migration using BrdU labelling of E13 and E15 embryos and quantified labelled cells in the cortex of P9 pups (described in reference 18). At both ages Katnal1 1H/1H animals had greater numbers of labelled neurons in bins close to the cortical surface neurons positioned closer to the cortical surface compared to wild type. To confirm these results we used a Boyden chamber 19 and performed in vitro neuronal migration analysis in E13.5 primary cortical neuronal cultures. Here we found that a greater proportion of Katnal1 1H/1H cortical neurons migrated to the base of the cell culture insert compared to wildtype controls (Supplementary Figure S3) . Since in both BrdU labelling and the Boyden assay neurons from Katnal1 1H/1H animals migrated further than those of wild-type littermates, these results suggest that Katnal1 1H/1H cortical neurons show defects in the termination of cortical neuronal migration. Given its role in cytoskeletal organisation, we also hypothesised that neuronal morphology is modulated by Katnal1. Analysis of golgi stained neurons from layers 2-3 of the cortex (Figures 4g  and i) demonstrated that, compared to wild-type littermates, Katnal1 1H/1H neurons had larger soma (Figure 4k) , and shorter and thinner axons (Figures 4l and m) (data and cohort details are given in Supplementary Table S3 ). Furthermore, analysis at higher magnification (Figures 4h and j) , demonstrated that the number of synaptic spines on Katnal1 1H/1H neurons was significantly reduced compared to wild type (Figure 4n ). Recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in some microtubule severing enzymes can cause defects in cilia. 5 Since such ciliary defects could underlie the phenotypes described above we studied the motile cilia of the ependymal lining of the lateral ventricle in sections of postnatal day 2 mouse brains from both Katnal1 1H/1H (n = 4) and wild-type animals (n = 3). We found that the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of Katnal1 1H/1H animals was significantly attenuated compared to wild-type (CBF: wildtype = 22.39 ± 0.94 Hz, Katnal1 1H/1H = 14.25 ± 0.92 Hz, P = 0.0001; Figure 5a , Supplementary Movies S1). This reduction in CBF in Katnal1 1H/1H animals was also associated with an increased proportion of cilia with an abnormal beat pattern (ciliary dyskinesia) (proportion of dyskinetic cilia: wild type = 17%, Katnal1 1H/1H = 75%) (Figure 5b and Supplementary Movies S1). Visual inspection of the cilia identified a number of ciliary abnormalities such as a swollen ciliary tip (Supplementary Movie S3) or extremely long cilia (Supplementary Movie S4) scattered throughout the field of cilia in Katnal1 1H/1H ventricles. These abnormalities were observed in approximately 25% of Katnal1 1H/1H brain slices. The abnormal cilia always showed a dyskinetic beat pattern and lower beat frequency. To further investigate ciliary morphology we performed scanning electron microscopy upon the ependymal lining of the lateral ventricles of both Katnal1 1H/1H (n = 3) and wild-type animals (n = 3; Figures 5c and d) . Cilia measurements showed no significant differences in average cilia length between genotypes (average cilia length: wild type = 6.22 ± 0.86 μm, Katnal1 1H/1H = 6.54 ± 0.94 Hz, P = 0.303). However in Katnal1 1H/1H samples we noted the presence of both long and short cilia (Figures 5e and f ; defined as two standard deviations longer or shorter than the average cilia length) that were not present in wild-type samples. In addition, inspection of Katnal1 1H/1H cilia identified ciliary abnormalities including bifurcated cilia (Figure 5g) , abnormal kinks and bends in the cilia (Figure 5h ) and swellings along the length of the cilia (Figure 5i ). Transmission electron microscopy of ependymal cilia found that vesicular aggre- Katnal1 disruption affects CNS functions G Banks et al gates were present within the ciliary swellings described above (Figure 5j ). Although these abnormalities were present in only a small proportion (o1%) of Katnal1 1H/1H cilia, they were notably absent from wild-type cilia. Microtubule severing enzymes play diverse roles in the nervous system. 1, 2 However, at present the microtubule severing enzyme Katnal1 is poorly defined in the context of CNS development and function. Here we present a detailed phenotypic analysis of Katnal1 1H and show that the mutation is associated with changes in circadian rhythms, sleep and behaviour. Furthermore we demonstrate that defects in brain histopathology, neuronal migration and neuronal morphology underlie these phenotypes. Finally we also demonstrate that Katnal1 1H causes a range of defects in the motile cilia of ventricular ependymal cells. The data we present here are the first to associate KATNAL1 with such dysfunctions with important implications for clinical association studies. The Katnal1 1H mutation was initially identified with a circadian deficit including a short free-running period and advanced activity onset. However subsequent ex vivo experiments using SCN slices of animals carrying the PER2::LUC reporter gene demonstrated no defects in SCN cellular rhythms, suggesting that the core circadian clock was unperturbed by the mutation. Phenotypes in circadian running wheel rhythms that are not associated with changes to the core clock mechanism have also been reported in mouse models of schizophrenia. 25 Here it has been suggested that the wheel running changes observed are the result in defects in output pathways from the SCN circadian clock. Similarly, in Katnal1 1H/1H mice we hypothesise that the defects we demonstrate in neuronal anatomy and neuronal morphology may disrupt output signals from the SCN. Alternatively given that various neuropeptides such as oxytocin are secreted in a circadian manner from ependymal cells lining the third ventricle of the brain, 26 altered ventricular morphology and ciliary function in Katnal1 1H/1H mice may disrupt the circulation of factors secreted by the ciliated ventricular ependymal cells and contribute to the disruption of the behavioural rhythms observed. The behavioural consequences of microtubule severing enzyme dysfunction in mouse models have been poorly characterised. Currently the phenotypes described are limited to motor dysfunction in mice lacking the Spg4 gene 27 and head shaking and circling in the Fign mutant. 7, 28, 29 In contrast, here we demonstrate that loss of function of Katnal1 is associated with a range of behavioural phenotypes, including changes in circadian activity, poor learning and memory, hyperactivity in a novel environment (the open field) and deficits in USVs. Notably the learning and memory, anxiety and vocalisation phenotypes reprise the clinical symptoms of ID, increased anxiety in novel situations and delays in language acquisition reported in human patients who carry microdeletions incorporating haploinsufficiency of KATNAL1. 8, 9 While it is also worth noting that mutant mice spend more time the centre of the open field than wild types (implying that Katnal1 1H/1H animals show reduced anxiety), we suggest that this result is confounded by the hyperactivity in novel environments phenotype we also describe in mutant mice. This observation is backed up by the fact that mutant animals showed increased activity in all regions of the open field rather than just the anxiolytic periphery. Here we also highlight defects in Katnal1 1H/1H mice such as compromised neuronal migration and morphology which may underpin such phenotypes. In Drosophila, the homologue of Katnal1 (kat-60L1) has been demonstrated to play a critical role in neuronal morphology during development, 30 however the data that we present here is the first to demonstrate a similar phenotype in mammals and furthermore suggests how subtle perturbations to KATNAL1 function may contribute to specific neural and behavioural conditions. For example, defects in neuronal migration, synaptic spines and neuronal morphology such as those we have demonstrated here, have been suggested to underpin ID in conditions such as lissencephaly, 18 Down's syndrome 31 and Rett syndrome. 32 While we are not suggesting that Katnal1 is causative for these conditions, similarities in symptoms and neuronal phenotypes between these conditions and those linked to Katnal1 dysfunction should be appreciated. Furthermore a rare mutation in KATNAL1 has been associated with schizophrenia 10 (http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/gene book/genebook.cgi?user = guest&cmd = verb-gene&tbox = KATNAL1) and KATNAL1 has been shown to interact with the schizophrenia associated gene DISC1. 33 In line with these observations we note that increases in ventricular volume and reductions in synaptic spines have been reported in schizophrenic patients 34, 35 and our data demonstrates the same phenotypes in Katnal1 1H/1H mice. Thus the range of phenotypes associated with defects in the function of Katnal1 strongly suggests that the gene should be considered in the pathology of disorders such as ID and schizophrenia. We do note one key genetic difference between the human patients and Katnal1 1H/1H animals. While the human patients were all heterozygous for the Katnal1 deletion, we found no phenotype in heterozygous mutant mice (data not shown) suggesting that while haploinsufficiency is causative for phenotypes in humans, mice require complete loss of KATNAL1 function to show similar effects. A similar discrepancy between humans and mice has also been noted for the intellectual disability candidate gene CTNNB1. 17 While heterozygous loss of function mutations in CTNNB1 are causative for intellectual disability in humans, conditional knock outs for CTNNB1 have no reported behavioural or craniofacial phenotypes.Question: What CNS functions can be measured by studying the movement of mice in a T-maze?","answer":"working memory and spatial memory"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

The present study investigated whether resveratrol treatment alleviates renal and vascular injury induced by cyclosporine. Cyclosporine ( 25 mg/kg per day , s.c . ) was given for 7 days to rats either alone or in combination with resveratrol ( 10 mg/kg per day , i.p . ) . Relaxation and contraction responses of aorta were examined. Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, angiotensin II, and angiotensin 1-7 were measured. Histopathological examinations as well as immunostaining for 4-hydroxynonenal and nitrotyrosine were performed in the kidney. RNA expressions of renin-angiotensin system components were also measured in renal and aortic tissues. cyclosporine decreased the endothelium-dependent relaxation and increased vascular contraction in the aorta. It caused renal tubular degeneration and increased immunostaining for 4-hydroxynonenal, an oxidative stress marker. cyclosporine also caused upregulations of the vasoconstrictive renin-angiotensin system components in renal (angiotensin-converting enzyme) and aortic (angiotensin II type 1 receptor) tissues. resveratrol co-treatment prevented the cyclosporine-related deteriorations. Moreover, it induced the expressions of vasodilatory effective angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor in aorta and kidney, respectively. We conclude that resveratrol may be effective in preventing cyclosporine-induced renal tubular degeneration and vascular dysfunction at least in part by modulating the renin-angiotensin system.sentence: Cyclosporine ( 25 mg/kg per day , s.c . ) was given for 7 days to rats either alone or in combination with resveratrol ( 10 mg/kg per day , i.p . ) .","answer":"[[\\"Cyclosporine\\", \\"resveratrol\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

We follow state of the art visual relocalisation results and evaluate response to different data inputs -- namely, depth, grayscale, RGB, spatial position and combinations of these. We use a CNN map representation and introduce the notion of CNN map compression by using a smaller CNN architecture. We evaluate our proposal in a series of publicly available datasets. This formulation allows us to improve relocalisation accuracy by increasing the number of training trajectories while maintaining a constant-size CNN.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such “autoencoder” networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.[2]: A large number of novel encodings for bag of visual words models have been proposed in the past two years to improve on the standard histogram of quantized local features. Examples include locality-constrained linear encoding [23], improved Fisher encoding [17], super vector encoding [27], and kernel codebook encoding [20]. While several authors have reported very good results on the challenging PASCAL VOC classification data by means of these new techniques, differences in the feature computation and learning algorithms, missing details in the description of the methods, and different tuning of the various components, make it impossible to compare directly these methods and hard to reproduce the results reported. This paper addresses these shortcomings by carrying out a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques by: (1) fixing the other elements of the pipeline (features, learning, tuning); (2) disclosing all the implementation details, and (3) identifying both those aspects of each method which are particularly important to achieve good performance, and those aspects which are less critical. This allows a consistent comparative analysis of these encoding methods.

We identify several useful properties of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance.

In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost.

From assembly language to present day’s object-oriented programming, concepts came to make programming easier so that a programmer can focus on the logic and the architecture rather than the code and language itself. To go a step further in this journey of removing human-computer language barrier, this paper proposes machine learning approach using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to convert human language into programming language code. The programmer will write expressions for codes in layman’s language, and the machine learning model will translate it to the targeted programming language. The proposed approach yields result with 74.40% accuracy. This can be further improved by incorporating additional techniques, which are also discussed in this paper.IntroductionRemoving computer-human language barrier is an inevitable advancement researchers are thriving to achieve for decades. One of the stages of this advancement will be coding through natural human language instead of traditional programming language. On naturalness of computer programming D. Knuth said, “Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.”BIBREF0. Unfortunately, learning programming language is still necessary to instruct it. Researchers and developers are working to overcome this human-machine language barrier. Multiple branches exists to solve this challenge (i.e. inter-conversion of different programming language to have universally connected programming languages). Automatic code generation through natural language is not a new concept in computer science studies. However, it is difficult to create such tool due to these following three reasons–Programming languages are diverseAn individual person expresses logical statements differently than otherNatural Language Processing (NLP) of programming statements is challenging since both human and programming language evolve over timeIn this paper, a neural approach to translate pseudo-code or algorithm like human language expression into programming language code is proposed.Problem DescriptionCode repositories (i.e. Git, SVN) flourished in the last decade producing big data of code allowing data scientists to perform machine learning on these data. In 2017, Allamanis M et al. published a survey in which they presented the state-of-the-art of the research areas where machine learning is changing the way programmers code during software engineering and development process BIBREF1. This paper discusses what are the restricting factors of developing such text-to-code conversion method and what problems need to be solved–Problem Description ::: Programming Language DiversityAccording to the sources, there are more than a thousand actively maintained programming languages, which signifies the diversity of these language . These languages were created to achieve different purpose and use different syntaxes. Low-level languages such as assembly languages are easier to express in human language because of the low or no abstraction at all whereas high-level, or Object-Oriented Programing (OOP) languages are more diversified in syntax and expression, which is challenging to bring into a unified human language structure. Nonetheless, portability and transparency between different programming languages also remains a challenge and an open research area. George D. et al. tried to overcome this problem through XML mapping BIBREF2. They tried to convert codes from C++ to Java using XML mapping as an intermediate language. However, the authors encountered challenges to support different features of both languages.Problem Description ::: Human Language FactorOne of the motivations behind this paper is - as long as it is about programming, there is a finite and small set of expression which is used in human vocabulary. For instance, programmers express a for-loop in a very few specific ways BIBREF3. Variable declaration and value assignment expressions are also limited in nature. Although all codes are executable, human representation through text may not due to the semantic brittleness of code. Since high-level languages have a wide range of syntax, programmers use different linguistic expressions to explain those. For instance, small changes like swapping function arguments can significantly change the meaning of the code. Hence the challenge remains in processing human language to understand it properly which brings us to the next problem-Problem Description ::: NLP of statementsAlthough there is a finite set of expressions for each programming statements, it is a challenge to extract information from the statements of the code accurately. Semantic analysis of linguistic expression plays an important role in this information extraction. For instance, in case of a loop, what is the initial value? What is the step value? When will the loop terminate?Mihalcea R. et al. has achieved a variable success rate of 70-80% in producing code just from the problem statement expressed in human natural language BIBREF3. They focused solely on the detection of step and loops in their research. Another research group from MIT, Lei et al. use a semantic learning model for text to detect the inputs. The model produces a parser in C++ which can successfully parse more than 70% of the textual description of input BIBREF4. The test dataset and model was initially tested and targeted against ACM-ICPC participantsínputs which contains diverse and sometimes complex input instructions.A recent survey from Allamanis M. et al. presented the state-of-the-art on the area of naturalness of programming BIBREF1. A number of research works have been conducted on text-to-code or code-to-text area in recent years. In 2015, Oda et al. proposed a way to translate each line of Python code into natural language pseudocode using Statistical Machine Learning Technique (SMT) framework BIBREF5 was used. This translation framework was able to - it can successfully translate the code to natural language pseudo coded text in both English and Japanese. In the same year, Chris Q. et al. mapped natural language with simple if-this-then-that logical rules BIBREF6. Tihomir G. and Viktor K. developed an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integrated code assistant tool anyCode for Java which can search, import and call function just by typing desired functionality through text BIBREF7. They have used model and mapping framework between function signatures and utilized resources like WordNet, Java Corpus, relational mapping to process text online and offline.Recently in 2017, P. Yin and G. Neubig proposed a semantic parser which generates code through its neural model BIBREF8. They formulated a grammatical model which works as a skeleton for neural network training. The grammatical rules are defined based on the various generalized structure of the statements in the programming language.Proposed MethodologyThe use of machine learning techniques such as SMT proved to be at most 75% successful in converting human text to executable code. BIBREF9. A programming language is just like a language with less vocabulary compared to a typical human language. For instance, the code vocabulary of the training dataset was 8814 (including variable, function, class names), whereas the English vocabulary to express the same code was 13659 in total. Here, programming language is considered just like another human language and widely used SMT techniques have been applied.Proposed Methodology ::: Statistical Machine TranslationSMT techniques are widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). SMT plays a significant role in translation from one language to another, especially in lexical and grammatical rule extraction. In SMT, bilingual grammatical structures are automatically formed by statistical approaches instead of explicitly providing a grammatical model. This reduces months and years of work which requires significant collaboration between bi-lingual linguistics. Here, a neural network based machine translation model is used to translate regular text into programming code.Proposed Methodology ::: Statistical Machine Translation ::: Data PreparationSMT techniques require a parallel corpus in thr source and thr target language. A text-code parallel corpus similar to Fig. FIGREF12 is used in training. This parallel corpus has 18805 aligned data in it . In source data, the expression of each line code is written in the English language. In target data, the code is written in Python programming language.Proposed Methodology ::: Statistical Machine Translation ::: Vocabulary GenerationTo train the neural model, the texts should be converted to a computational entity. To do that, two separate vocabulary files are created - one for the source texts and another for the code. Vocabulary generation is done by tokenization of words. Afterwards, the words are put into their contextual vector space using the popular word2vec BIBREF10 method to make the words computational.Proposed Methodology ::: Statistical Machine Translation ::: Neural Model TrainingIn order to train the translation model between text-to-code an open source Neural Machine Translation (NMT) - OpenNMT implementation is utilized BIBREF11. PyTorch is used as Neural Network coding framework. For training, three types of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers are used – an encoder layer, a decoder layer and an output layer. These layers together form a LSTM model. LSTM is typically used in seq2seq translation.In Fig. FIGREF13, the neural model architecture is demonstrated. The diagram shows how it takes the source and target text as input and uses it for training. Vector representation of tokenized source and target text are fed into the model. Each token of the source text is passed into an encoder cell. Target text tokens are passed into a decoder cell. Encoder cells are part of the encoder RNN layer and decoder cells are part of the decoder RNN layer. End of the input sequence is marked by a <eos> token. Upon getting the <eos> token, the final cell state of encoder layer initiate the output layer sequence. At each target cell state, attention is applied with the encoder RNN state and combined with the current hidden state to produce the prediction of next target token. This predictions are then fed back to the target RNN. Attention mechanism helps us to overcome the fixed length restriction of encoder-decoder sequence and allows us to process variable length between input and output sequence. Attention uses encoder state and pass it to the decoder cell to give particular attention to the start of an output layer sequence. The encoder uses an initial state to tell the decoder what it is supposed to generate. Effectively, the decoder learns to generate target tokens, conditioned on the input sequence. Sigmoidal optimization is used to optimize the prediction.Result AnalysisTraining parallel corpus had 18805 lines of annotated code in it. The training model is executed several times with different training parameters. During the final training process, 500 validation data is used to generate the recurrent neural model, which is 3% of the training data. We run the training with epoch value of 10 with a batch size of 64. After finishing the training, the accuracy of the generated model using validation data from the source corpus was 74.40% (Fig. FIGREF17).Although the generated code is incoherent and often predict wrong code token, this is expected because of the limited amount of training data. LSTM generally requires a more extensive set of data (100k+ in such scenario) to build a more accurate model. The incoherence can be resolved by incorporating coding syntax tree model in future. For instance–\\"define the method tzname with 2 arguments: self and dt.\\"is translated into–def __init__ ( self , regex ) :.The translator is successfully generating the whole codeline automatically but missing the noun part (parameter and function name) part of the syntax.Conclusion & Future WorksThe main advantage of translating to a programming language is - it has a concrete and strict lexical and grammatical structure which human languages lack. The aim of this paper was to make the text-to-code framework work for general purpose programming language, primarily Python. In later phase, phrase-based word embedding can be incorporated for improved vocabulary mapping. To get more accurate target code for each line, Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) can be beneficial.The contribution of this research is a machine learning model which can turn the human expression into coding expressions. This paper also discusses available methods which convert natural language to programming language successfully in fixed or tightly bounded linguistic paradigm. Approaching this problem using machine learning will give us the opportunity to explore the possibility of unified programming interface as well in the future.AcknowledgmentWe would like to thank Dr. Khandaker Tabin Hasan, Head of the Depertment of Computer Science, American International University-Bangladesh for his inspiration and encouragement in all of our research works.

Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) acts like a permanently activated receptor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -receptor superfamily and is absolutely required for B cell immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus. Molecular and biochemical approaches demonstrated that LMP1 usurps cellular signaling pathways resulting in the induction of NF-kappaB and AP-1 via two C-terminal activating regions. We demonstrate here that a third region encompassing a proline rich sequence within the 33 bp repetitive stretch of LMP1 's C-terminus is required for the activation of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3). The interaction of LMP1 and JAK3 leads to the enhanced tyrosine auto / transphosphorylation of JAK3 within minutes after crosslinking of a conditional NGF-R: LMP1 chimera and is a prerequisite for the activation of STAT transcription factors. These results reveal a novel activating region in the LMP1 C-terminus and identify the JAK / STAT pathway as a target of this viral integral membrane protein in B cells.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"B cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"C - terminal activating regions\\", \\"STAT transcription factors\\", \\"Janus kinase 3\\", \\"NGF - R  LMP1 chimera\\", \\"STAT proteins\\", \\"viral integral membrane protein\\", \\"NGF - R\\", \\"Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)\\", \\"AP - 1\\", \\"proline rich sequence\\", \\"Latent membrane protein 1\\", \\"C - terminus\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - receptor superfamily\\", \\"LMP1\\", \\"JAK\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"/ STAT\\", \\"JAK3\\", \\"permanently activated receptor\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  While gaze holds a lot of promise for hands-free interaction with public displays, remote eye trackers with their confined tracking box restrict users to a single stationary position in front of the display. We present EyeScout, an active eye tracking system that combines an eye tracker mounted on a rail system with a computational method to automatically detect and align the tracker with the user's lateral movement. EyeScout addresses key limitations of current gaze-enabled large public displays by offering two novel gaze-interaction modes for a single user: In \\"Walk then Interact\\" the user can walk up to an arbitrary position in front of the display and interact, while in \\"Walk and Interact\\" the user can interact even while on the move. We report on a user study that shows that EyeScout is well perceived by users, extends a public display's sweet spot into a sweet line, and reduces gaze interaction kick-off time to 3.5 seconds -- a 62% improvement over state of the art solutions. We discuss sample applications that demonstrate how EyeScout can enable position and movement-independent gaze interaction with large public displays.Literature Review:","answer":"High quality gaze estimation on unmodified handheld mobile devices sets the scene for wide scale eye tracking studies in the wild. Although field studies are one important research method in Mobile HCI BIB001  , eye tracking for analysis of gaze behavior on mobile devices has always been conducted in the lab. For the first time, we will be able to conduct ecologically valid field studies where users' gaze behavior is tracked in every day life scenarios. For example, this will allow us to study gaze behavior when using location-based services; previous work could not achieve that due to participants being required to stay in the lab, or even at a fixed distance from a \\"mobile\\" device that is held by a mount. Usability analysis can now cover contexts that were never studied before, such as how users perceive websites and mobile apps while commuting, while walking, or while engaging with others in conversations. Pervasive advertising is another interesting opportunity. Gaze data analysis can reveal if users see advertisements, if placement of ads is ideal, and could reveal potential interests that can be used to tailor advertisements. Advances in this direction could potentially encourage manufacturers of handheld devices to invest in integrating cameras with wider lenses, or employ movable cameras that would enable active eye tracking (e.g., setting focus on the user's eyes BIB002 ). On the downside, this comes with privacy implications, which we discuss later."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Ovarian progesterone induces and PG and IFNT stimulates endometrial HSD11B1 expression and keto-reductase activity as well as many epithelial genes that govern trophectoderm proliferation, migration, and attachment during elongation. The primary aim of these studies was to test the hypothesis that HSD11B1-derived cortisol has a biological role in endometrial function and conceptus development during early pregnancy in sheep. In study 1, cyclic ewes received vehicle, cortisol, PF 915275 (PF; a selective inhibitor of HSD11B1), cortisol and PF, meloxicam (a selective inhibitor of PTGS2), cortisol and meloxicam, recombinant ovine IFNT, or IFNT and PF into the uterus from day 10 to day14 after estrus. Cortisol and IFNT stimulated endometrial HSD11B1 expression and activity, increased endometrial PTGS2 activity and the amount of PG in the uterine lumen, and up-regulated many conceptus elongation-related genes in the endometrium. Some effects of cortisol and IFNT were mediated by PTGS2-derived PG. In study 2, bred ewes received PF 915275 or recombinant ovine IFNT and into the uterus from day 10 to day 14 after mating. Inhibition of HSD11B1 activity in utero prevented conceptus elongation, whereas IFNT rescued conceptus elongation in PF-infused ewes. These results suggest that HSD11B1-derived cortisol mediates, in part, actions of ovarian progesterone and the conceptus on endometrial function and support the hypothesis that IFNT, PG, and cortisol coordinately regulate endometrial functions important for conceptus elongation and implantation during early pregnancy in sheep.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"hydroxysteroid\\", \\"Cortisol\\", \\"cortisol\\", \\"meloxicam\\", \\"prostaglandins\\", \\"keto\\", \\"progesterone\\", \\"PF 915275\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"PG synthase 2\\", \\"PTGS2\\", \\"interferon-u03c4\\", \\"HSD11B1\\", \\"hydroxysteroid (11-u03b2) dehydrogenase 1\\", \\"IFNT\\", \\"keto-reductase\\", \\"ovine IFNT\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

The present study was designed to test the effects of chronic combined treatment with low doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ( perindopril ) and of the diuretic indapamide in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) .  methods Adult SHR were treated with placebo or increasing doses of the combination of the drugs (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg per day; ratio of doses 0.32). In a separate set of experiments, the effects of the drugs combined (1 mg/kg per day) was compared with those induced by each drug alone.  results The drug combination dose-dependently decreased systolic blood pressure and its hypotensive effect was more marked than those induced by each treatment administered alone (untreated 208 +/- 5 mmHg, indapamide 185 +/- 5 mmHg, perindopril 150 +/- 3 and the combination 123 +/- 7 mmHg). A 12-week treatment with the drug combination (1 mg/kg per day) was not accompanied by any change in diuresis or urinary excretion of Na or K. The same treatment decreased cardiac hypertrophy and collagen. At the vascular level, the drug combination decreased aortic, carotid and femoral media cross-sectional areas, as well as aortic and carotid collagen density. This latter effect was accompanied by a significant increase in carotid artery compliance assessed in vivo at constant pressure. Finally, in isolated aortae, chronic combined drug treatment was associated with an increased basal release of nitric oxide and a decrease in the hypertension-induced endothelium-dependent contractions in response to acetylcholine.  conclusion These experiments suggest that chronic combined treatment with low doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic such as indapamide may be of value in the treatment of hypertension.sentence: The present study was designed to test the effects of chronic combined treatment with low doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ( perindopril ) and of the diuretic indapamide in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) .","answer":"[[\\"perindopril\\", \\"indapamide\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

The arrhythmias may cause syncope or degenerate into cardiac arrest and sudden death which usually occurs during childhoodIn many cases the cause of death can be elucidated by medico-legal autopsy, however, a significant number of these cases remain unexplained despite a detailed postmortem investigation and are labeled as sudden unexplained death (SUD). Post-mortem genetic testing, so called molecular autopsy, revealed that primary arrhythmogenic disorders including long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) may account for a certain number of these cases.We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryanoCatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.In conclusion, patients with CASQ2-associated CPVT should be recommended to receive ICDs to prevent sudden death when medical therapy is not effective.Cardiac channelopathies associated with structurally normal hearts such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) yield no evidence to be found at autopsy, leaving coroners, medical examiners, and forensic pathologists only to speculate that a lethal arrhythmia might lie at the heart of a sudden unexplained death (SUD).Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare adrenergically mediated arrhythmogenic disorder classically induced by exercise or emotional stress and found in structurally normal hearts. It is an important cause of cardiac syncope and sudden death in childhood.We also compare CPVT to other notable cardiomyopathic and channelopathic causes of sudden death in youth including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome.Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF).Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease that manifests as syncope or sudden death during high adrenergic tone in the absence of structural heart defects.Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural heartsEarly detection of CPVT is crucial because opportune medical intervention prevents sudden cardiac death.If untreated, CPVT is highly lethal, as approximately 30% of affected individuals experience at least one cardiac arrest and up to 80% one or more syncopal spells. Sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease.Hereditary non-structural diseases such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT, and the Brugada syndrome as well as structural disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) cause a significant percentage of sudden cardiac deaths in the youngPatients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms.Although structural cardiovascular abnormalities explain most cases of sudden cardiac death in young people, the cause of death remains unexplained after autopsy in 10% to 30% of cases. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and the Brugada syndrome (BrS) may account for at least one-third of these unexplained cases.Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.The inherited arrhythmogenic diseases associated with the transmembranous ionic channels, anchoring proteins or intracellular calcium regulating proteins are thought to be responsible for sudden cardiac death in infants, children, and young adults who have structurally normal hearts. Recent genetic analyses have identified congenital diseases such as the long-QT syndrome (LQTS), the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), the Brugada syndrome (BrS), the short-QT syndrome (SQTS), the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVC2), and the catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) /familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (FPVT).At least some cases of sudden, unexplained death in young individuals may be ascribed to CPVT","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Two in vitro models were used to compare the antiinflammatory properties of PDE inhibitors with that of glucocorticoids. The effect on TNF release from diluted human blood following lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Salmonella abortus equi) stimulation as well as the GM-CSF and TNF release from human nasal polyp cells following allergic stimulation were investigated. Both models proofed to be well suited for the characterisation of the antiinflammatory properties of new chemical entities. In diluted human blood and dispersed human nasal polyp cells the induced TNF release was most potently suppressed by selective PDE4 inhibitors. Amrinone and milrinone, selective PDE3 inhibitors, suppressed TNF secretion to a lesser extent. The effects of theophylline (unspecific PDE inhibitor), vinpocetine (PDE1 inhibitor), EHNA (PDE2 inhibitor) and the PDE5 inhibitors zaprinast and E 4021 were weak. In human blood, the tested glucocorticoids beclomethasone, dexamethasone and fluticasone inhibited the LPS induced TNF release potently in a concentration dependent manner, whereas in dispersed human nasal polyp cells, the effect of the glucocorticoids on allergically induced TNF release, with the exception of dexamethasone, was much less pronounced. Glucocorticoids were the most potent inhibitors of GM-CSF release and the effect correlates well with the affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. The selective PDE 4 inhibitors, and to a certain extent the PDE3 inhibitors amrinone and milrinone, reduced the GM-CSF release in a concentration dependent manner. In all investigations selective PDE4 inhibitors reduced TNF release to a much higher degree (4-10 fold) than GM-CSF release.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Amrinone\\", \\"beclomethasone\\", \\"fluticasone\\", \\"dexamethasone\\", \\"vinpocetine\\", \\"E 4021\\", \\"milrinone\\", \\"zaprinast\\", \\"amrinone\\", \\"theophylline\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"TNF\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor alpha\\", \\"PDE3\\", \\"PDE 1-5\\", \\"PDE 4\\", \\"PDE2\\", \\"glucocorticoid receptor\\", \\"granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor\\", \\"GM-CSF\\", \\"PDE1\\", \\"PDE4\\", \\"PDE\\", \\"cytokines\\", \\"PDE5\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In this mat, which was realized by an electrospinning technique, each component serves a unique function: the carbon coating acts as both an adsorption material for capturing pollutants and as a charge-transfer material, the Ag nanoparticles act as a visible-light sensitizing agent and also as a charge-transfer material, finally the TiO2 nanocable mat acts as a UV sensitive photocatalytic matrix and as the flexible substrate for the other functional components. This multicomponent nanocable mat exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity under simulated solar irradiation for the degradation of model pollutants including RhB and phenol. The significant photocatalytic properties are attributed to the synergetic effect of the three functional components and the unique charge transport \\"freeway\\" property of the nanofibrous mat. In addition, the porous carbon coating infiltrated into the nanocable matrix endows the mat with excellent flexibility and enables robust, large-area (10 × 10 cm) fabrication, representing a significant advantage over previous brittle ceramic nanofibrous mat photocatalyst substrates. This study provides new insight into the design and preparation of an advanced, yet commercially practical and scaleable photocatalytic composite membrane material. The as-prepared photocatalytic mat might also be of interest in solar cell, catalysis, separation technology, biomedical engineering, and nanotechnology.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Ag\\", \\"TiO2\\", \\"carbon\\", \\"RhB\\", \\"phenol\\", \\"graphitic\\"], \\"Protein\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

The latter treatment is associated with more cure and more toxicity. The patients were asked whether they wanted to choose, and if so which treatment they preferred. They also assigned importance weights to the probability of various outcomes, such as survival, cure and adverse effects. Patients who wanted to choose their own treatment (n = 119) are described here.(RESULTS) The majority of these patients (75%) chose the lower radiation dose. Their choice was highly consistent (P<or = .001), with the importance weights assigned to the probability of survival, cure (odds ratio [OR] = 6.7 and 6.9) and late GI and genitourinary adverse effects (OR = 0.1 and 0.2).

Plasma levels of NT-proBNP in patients with an unfavorable outcome were significantly higher than those in patients with a favorable outcome [3432 (interquartile range, 1100-54991) vs. 978 (interquartile range, 123-1705) pg/ml; P=0.000]. In multivariate analyses, after adjusting for all other significant outcome predictors, the NT-proBNP level that remained can be seen as an independent unfavorable outcome predictor, with an adjusted odds ratios of 4.14 (95% confidence interval, 2.72-7.99; P=0.000). Our results show that plasma NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated in patients with an unfavorable outcome and might be of clinical importance as a supplementary tool for the assessment of functional outcomes in patients with AIS.Plasma levels of BNP, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin were associated with stroke severity, as well as short-term functional outcomes. After adjusting for all other significant outcome predictors, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin remained as independent outcome predictors. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the biomarker panel (including BNP, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin) predicted functional outcome and death within 90 days significantly more efficiently than the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or the biomarker alone.The NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher at 4 intervals after ischemic stroke than in healthy and at-risk control subjects (all p<0.001).Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age and NIH Stroke Scale were the 2 strongest independent predictors of increased NT-proBNP levels (all p<0.01). Furthermore, increased NT-proBNP (> or = 150 pg/ml) was the strongest independent predictor of long-term (mean follow-up: 24 months) UFCO (26 patients) (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The NT-proBNP level was markedly elevated after acute ischemic stroke and declined substantially thereafter. An increased NT-proBNP level was strongly and independently correlated with UFCO in patients after ischemic stroke.","answer":"ProBNP serum concentrations are elevated in stroke patients relative to healthy controls.

In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD. In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.Spermidine protects against α-synuclein neurotoxicityIn the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD.

Meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) comprises four stereoisomers consisting of two enantiomeric pairs related to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. HED is transported into adrenergic neurons and radiolabeled HED has been employed in positron emission tomography (PET) to image adrenergic neurons in vivo. To extend structure-activity analyses of binding sites within monoamine transporters and to determine which stereoisomer displayed the best selectivity for PET imaging applications, we tested the HED compounds for their abilities to inhibit [ (3) H]neurotransmitter uptake into platelets, transfected cells, and chromaffin vesicles. We hypothesized that the HED compounds would be most potent at the norepinephrine transporter (NET) compared to the serotonin or dopamine transporters and that the 1R diastereomers would be more effective than 1S diastereomers. Supporting the hypotheses, all stereoisomers were most potent at the NET and the 1R,2S stereoisomer was the most potent inhibitor overall. However, the 1S,2R isomer may be preferred for PET applications because of better selectivity among the transporters and reduced neuronal recycling.","answer":"[[\\"HED\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"monoamine transporters\\"], [\\"meta-hydroxyephedrine\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"monoamine uptake transporters\\"], [\\"HED\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"norepinephrine transporter\\"], [\\"HED\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"NET\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Xie et al., 2019) , making robust models undesirable in some industrial settings.The consistently poor performance of robust models on clean data has lead to the line of thought that there may be a fundamental trade-off between robustness and accuracy (Zhang et al., 2019; Tsipras et al., 2019) , and recent theoretical results characterized this tradeoff (Fawzi et al., 2018; Shafahi et al., 2018; Mahloujifar et al., 2019) .In this work, we aim to understand and optimize the tradeoff between robustness and clean accuracy.More concretely, our objective is to improve the clean accuracy of adversarial training for a chosen level of adversarial robustness.Our method is inspired by the observation that the constraints enforced by adversarial training are infeasible; for commonly used values of , it is not possible to achieve label consistency within an -ball of each input image because the balls around images of different classes overlap.This is illustrated on the left of Figure 1 , which shows that the -ball around a \\"bird\\" (from the CIFAR-10 training set) contains images of class \\"deer\\" (that do not appear in the training set).If adversarial training were successful at enforcing label stability in an = 8 ball around the \\"bird\\" training image, doing so would come at the unavoidable cost of misclassifying the nearby \\"deer\\" images that come along at test time.At the same time, when training images lie far from the decision boundary (eg., the deer image on the right in Fig 1) , it is possible to enforce stability with large with no compromise in clean accuracy.When adversarial training on CIFAR-10, we see that = 8 is too large for some images, causing accuracy loss, while being unnecessarily small for others, leading to sub-optimal robustness.In this work, we focus on improving the robustness-accuracy tradeoff in adversarial training.We first show that realizable robustness is a sample-specific attribute: samples close to the decision boundary can only achieve robustness within a small ball, as they contain samples from a different class beyond this radius.On the other hand samples far from the decision boundary can be robust on a relatively large perturbation radius.Motivated by this observation, we develop instance adaptive adversarial training, in which label consistency constraints are imposed within sample-specific perturbation radii, which are in-turn estimated.Our proposed algorithm has empirically been shown to improve the robustness-accuracy tradeoff in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Imagenet datasets.A recent paper that addresses the problem of improving natural accuracy in adversarial training is mixup adversarial training (Lamb et al., 2019) , where adversarially trained models are optimized using mixup loss instead of the standard cross-entropy loss.In this paper, natural accuracy was shown to improve with no drop in adversarial robustness.However, the robustness experiments were not evaluated on strong attacks (experiments were reported only on PGD-20).We compare our implementation of mixup adversarial training with IAAT on stronger attacks in Table.8.We observe that while natural accuracy improves for mixup, drop in adversarial accuracy is much higher than IAAT.","answer":"Instance adaptive adversarial training for improving robustness-accuracy tradeoff"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Therefore, interactions could occur following concomitant administration of psychotropic drugs (e.g., narcotics, analgesics, antiemetics, sedatives, tranquilizers). Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with PROLEUKIN may increase toxicity in these organ systems. The safety and efficacy of PROLEUKIN in combination with any antineoplastic agents have not been established. In addition, reduced kidney and liver function secondary to PROLEUKIN treatment may delay elimination of concomitant medications and increase the risk of adverse events from those drugs. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose PROLEUKIN and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa. These reactions consisted of erythema, pruritus, and hypotension and occurred within hours of administration of chemotherapy. These events required medical intervention in some patients. Myocardial injury, including myocardial infarction, myocarditis, ventricular hypokinesia, and severe rhabdomyolysis appear to be increased in patients receiving PROLEUKIN and interferon-alfa concurrently. Exacerbation or the initial presentation of a number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been observed following concurrent use of interferon-alfa and PROLEUKIN, including crescentic IgA glomerulonephritis, oculo-bulbar myasthenia gravis, inflammatory arthritis, thyroiditis, bullous pemphigoid, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Although glucocorticoids have been shown to reduce PROLEUKIN-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with PROLEUKIN may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of PROLEUKIN and thus should be avoided. 12 Beta-blockers and other antihypertensives may potentiate the hypotension seen with PROLEUKIN. Delayed Adverse Reactions to Iodinated Contrast Media: A review of the literature revealed that 12.6% (range 11-28%) of 501 patients treated with various interleukin-2 containing regimens who were subsequently administered radiographic iodinated contrast media experienced acute, atypical adverse reactions. The onset of symptoms usually occurred within hours (most commonly 1 to 4 hours) following the administration of contrast media. These reactions include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, rash, diarrhea, hypotension, edema, and oliguria. Some clinicians have noted that these reactions resemble the immediate side effects caused by interleukin-2 administration, however the cause of contrast reactions after interleukin-2 therapy is unknown. Most events were reported to occur when contrast media was given within 4 weeks after the last dose of interleukin-2. These events were also reported to occur when contrast media was given several months after interleukin-2 treatment.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [\\"PROLEUKIN\\"], \\"Drug\\": [\\"methotrexate\\", \\"cis-platinum\\", \\"dacarbazine\\", \\"tamoxifen\\", \\"doxorubicin\\", \\"interferon-alfa\\", \\"indomethacin\\", \\"interleukin-2\\", \\"asparaginase\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"cytotoxic\\", \\"analgesics\\", \\"sedatives\\", \\"antiemetics\\", \\"Beta-blockers\\", \\"Iodinated Contrast Media\\", \\"radiographic iodinated contrast media\\", \\"antineoplastic agents\\", \\"glucocorticoids\\", \\"antihypertensives\\", \\"psychotropic drugs\\", \\"tranquilizers\\", \\"narcotics\\", \\"aminoglycosides\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Echocardiography was performed to measure left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index. Electrocardiogram was performed to measure QTcD.(RESULTS) LVH was present in 42 patients (42%) of the study group, none among controls. Hypertensive patients had significantly greater indices of LVH and QTcD compared with controls (p<0.001 for all). Similarly, among hypertensive patients, those with LVH had a significantly greater QTcD compared with those without (p<0.001). Pearson's correlation coefficient test demonstrated strongly positive correlations between QTcD and the indices of LVH (p<0.001 for all). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curves identified 60 ms as the optimal cut-off value of QTcD that best predicts LVH in hypertensives. Using this value, QTcD was able to predict LVH with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity 98.2%.Question:Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Otilonium bromide (OB) is a spasmolytic drug successfully used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its efficacy has been attributed to the block of L- and T-type Ca(2+) channels and muscarinic and tachykinin receptors in the smooth muscle. Furthermore, in healthy rats, repeated OB administration modified neurotransmitter expression and function suggesting other mechanisms of action. On this basis, we investigated whether repeated OB treatment prevented the functional and neurochemical changes observed in the colon of rats underwent to wrap restrain stress (WRS) a psychosocial stressor considered suitable to reproduce the main IBS signs and symptoms. In control, WRS and OB/WRS rats functional parameters were measured in vivo and morphological investigations were done ex vivo in the colon. The results showed that OB counteracts most of the neurotransmitters changes caused by WRS. In particular, the drug prevents the decrease in SP-, NK1r-, nNOS-, VIP-, and S100β-immunoreactivity (IR) and the increase in CGRP-, and CRF1r-IR. On the contrary, OB does not affect the increase in CRF2r-IR neurons observed in WRS rats and does not interfere with the mild mucosal inflammation due to WRS. Finally, OB per se increases the Mr2 expression in the muscle wall and decreases the number of the myenteric ChAT-IR neurons. Functional findings show a significantly reduction in the number of spontaneous abdominal contraction in OB treated rats. The ability of OB to block L-type Ca(2+) channels, also expressed by enteric neurons, might represent a possible mechanism through which OB exerts its actions.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"ChAT\\", \\"L-type Ca(2+) channels\\", \\"VIP\\", \\"NK1r\\", \\"L- and T-type Ca(2+) channels\\", \\"Mr2\\", \\"CGRP\\", \\"S100u03b2\\", \\"nNOS\\", \\"SP\\", \\"CRF1r\\", \\"CRF2r\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that patients with soft tissue changes related to superficial venous insufficiency ( SVI ) have greater benefits from treatment than those with only symptomatic varicose veins . BACKGROUND A commonly held view is that SVI is only a minor ailment , yet randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) show that treatment improves quality of life ( QoL ) and is cost-effective . In an effort to curb the treatment costs of this common disorder , rationing is applied in many health care systems , often limiting the reimbursement of treatment to those with soft tissue changes . METHODS This cohort study draws its data from an interventional RCT . After informed consent , consecutive patients with symptomatic unilateral SVI were randomized to receive surgical ligation and stripping or endovenous laser ablation . This analysis differentially studies the outcomes of patients with simple varicose veins ( C2 : n = 191 ) and soft tissue complications ( C3-4 : n = 76 ) . Effectiveness outcomes measured up to 1 year included the following : Qol [ short form 36 ( SF36 ) , EuroQol , and the Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire ] , clinical recurrence , and the need for secondary procedures . Multivariable regression analysis was used to control for potential confounding factors . RESULTS Both groups saw significant improvements in QoL . All improvements were equal between groups apart from the SF36 domain of Bodily Pain , where C2 saw an improvement of 12.8 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 4.8-20.8 ] points over C3-4 participants ( P = 0.002 ) , who also suffered more recurrence [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.7 , 95 % CI : 1.2-6.1 , P = 0.022 ] and required more secondary procedures ( OR = 4.4 , 95 % CI : 1.2-16.3 , P = 0.028 ) . CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that rationing by clinical severity contradicts the evidence . Delaying treatment until the development of skin damage leads to a degree of irreversible morbidity and greater recurrence .

No exclusion criteria were based on the size, number, or location of myomas.(INTERVENTIONS) Laparoscopic myomectomy and modifications of the technique: enucleation of the myoma by morcellation while it is still attached to the uterus with and without earlier devascularization.(MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS) In all, 912 myomas were removed in these 505 patients laparoscopically. The mean number of myomas removed was 1.85 +/- 5.706 (95% CI 1.72-1.98). In all, 184 (36.4%) patients had multiple myomectomy. The mean size of the myomas removed was 5.86 +/- 3.300 cm in largest diameter (95% CI 5.56-6.16 cm). The mean weight of the myomas removed was 227.74 +/- 325.801 g (95% CI 198.03-257.45 g) and median was 100 g. The median operating time was 60 minutes (range 30-270 minutes). The median blood loss was 90 mL (range 40-2000 mL). Three comparisons were performed on the basis of size of the myomas (<10 cm and>or=10 cm in largest diameter), number of myomas removed (<or=4 and>or=5 myomas), and the technique (enucleation of the myomas by morcellation while the myoma is still attached to the uterus and the conventional technique). In all these comparisons, although the mean blood loss, duration of surgery, and hospital stay were greater in the groups in which larger myomas or more myomas were removed or the modified technique was performed as compared with their corresponding study group, the weight and size of removed myomas were also proportionately larger in these groups. Two patients were given the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma in their histopathology and 1 patient developed a diaphragmatic parasitic myoma followed by a leiomyoma of the sigmoid colon. Six patients underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy 4 to 6 years after the surgery for recurrent myomas. One conversion to laparotomy occurred and 1 patient underwent open subtotal hysterectomy for dilutional coagulopathy.Question:Laparoscopic myomectomy: do size, number, and location of the myomas form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy?Answer:","answer":"NO"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Two peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2, are involved in the import of proteins into the peroxisome matrix. Human patients with fatal generalized peroxisomal deficiency disorders fall into at least nine genetic complementation groups. Cells from many of these patients are deficient in the import of PTS1-containing proteins, but the causes of the protein-import defect in these patients are unknown. We have cloned and sequenced the human cDNA homologue (PTS1R) of the Pichia pastoris PAS8 gene, the PTS1 receptor (McCollum, D., E. Monosov, and S. Subramani. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 121  761-774). The PTS1R mRNA is expressed in all human tissues examined. Antibodies to the human PTS1R recognize this protein in human, monkey, rat, and hamster cells. The protein is localized mainly in the cytosol but is also found to be associated with peroxisomes. Part of the peroxisomal PTS1R protein is tightly bound to the peroxisomal membrane. Antibodies to PTS1R inhibit peroxisomal protein-import of PTS1-containing proteins in a permeabilized CHO cell system. In vitro-translated PTS1R protein specifically binds a serine-lysine-leucine-peptide. A PAS8-PTS1R fusion protein complements the P. pastoris pas8 mutant. The PTS1R cDNA also complements the PTS1 protein-import defect in skin fibroblasts from patients--belonging to complementation group two--diagnosed as having neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy or Zellweger syndrome. The PTS1R gene has been localized to a chromosomal location where no other peroxisomal disorder genes are known to map. Our findings represent the only case in which the molecular basis of the protein-import deficiency in human peroxisomal disorders is understood.","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"peroxisomal deficiency disorders\\", \\"neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy\\", \\"peroxisomal disorders\\", \\"PTS1 protein-import defect\\", \\"Zellweger syndrome\\", \\"protein-import deficiency\\", \\"peroxisomal disorder\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

In previously healthy adults, a primary sporadic Giardia infection can lead to gut dysfunction and fatigue. These symptoms correlate with markers of inflammation that persist well after the infection is cleared. In contrast, in endemic settings, first exposure occurs in children who are frequently malnourished and also co-infected with other enteropathogens. In these children, Giardia rarely causes symptoms and associates with several decreased markers of inflammation. Mechanisms underlying these disparate and potentially enduring outcomes following Giardia infection are not presently well understood. A body of work suggests that the outcome of experimental Giardia infection is influenced by the nutritional status of the host. Here, we explore the consequences of experimental Giardia infection under conditions of protein sufficiency or deficiency on cytokine responses of ex vivo bone marrow derived dendritic cells( BMDCs) to endotoxin stimulation. We show that BMDCs from Giardia- challenged mice on a protein sufficient diet produce more IL-23 when compared to uninfected controls whereas BMDCs from Giardia challenged mice fed a protein deficient diet do not. Further, in vivo co-infection with Giardia attenuates robust IL-23 responses in endotoxin-stimulated BMDCs from protein deficient mice harboring enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. These results suggest that intestinal Giardia infection may have extra-intestinal effects on BMDC inflammatory cytokine production in a diet dependent manner, and that Giardia may influence the severity of the innate immune response to other enteropathogens. This work supports recent findings that intestinal microbial exposure may have lasting influences on systemic inflammatory responses, and may provide better understanding of potential mechanisms of post-infectious sequelae and clinical variation during Giardia and enteropathogen co-infection.Introduction:Giardia lamblia is one of the most commonly reported intestinal parasitic infections worldwide[1–3]. Exposure results in a wide spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic colonization, to acute or chronic diarrhea. Increasingly, post-infectious sequelae have been observed that include development of conditions that may be associated with altered inflammatory profiles[4, 5] such as irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome[6–11]. Mechanisms that might account for the broad range of clinical manifestations of giardiasis are poorly understood. However, there appear to be patterns of clinical and post-infectious outcomes that associate with global regions of high and low enteropathogen burden and malnutrition. Giardia infection outbreaks in adults in resource-abundant regions, including the USA[3] and Norway[10, 12], increase risk for post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome( IBS)[3], duodenitis[10, 11], persistent elevation of fecal calprotectin[12], and even lingering elevations in serum sCD14[3, 12]. In children living in resource-limited endemic settings with a high prevalence of recurrent and persistent infection, however, Giardia does not associate with diarrhea or routine markers of intestinal inflammation[2, 13, 14]. Rather, in these children who often have restricted dietary protein intake, Giardia associates with increased intestinal permeability, but decreased levels of myeloperoxidase( MPO). Also, in endemic settings, Giardia infection is associated with decreased levels of the serum inflammatory mediator CRP[2, 13, 15, 16]. These diminished markers of inflammation associate with Giardia infection in endemic areas despite the presence of other potentially pro-inflammatory co-enteropathogen exposures such as enteroaggregative Escherichia coli( EAEC)[17]. We have shown that outcomes during persistent experimental Giardia infection in mice are diet dependent[18]. Chronically infected, fully nourished animals develop lymphocytic duodenitis similar to some chronic infections in adults in low endemicity settings. However, mice fed a protein deficient diet do not[17]. This diet-dependent immune discrepancy is opposite of the otherwise robust mucosal and systemic responses to Cryptosporidium or EAEC seen in this protein malnutrition model[17]. Further, Giardia challenge is sufficient to partially diminish calprotectin responses and MPO responses to EAEC[16–18]. There is an emerging body of research suggesting that previous intestinal exposures such as vaccination, alteration of the microbiota, or pathogen exposure, may have long term influences on systemic inflammatory cytokine production from innate immune cells[19]. We have previously shown that this process may help explain persistent inflammatory responses and disparate outcomes during pathogen infection and malnutrition[20–22]. Herein, we hypothesize that the unique immune profiles observed during persistent Giardia infection reflect Giardia-mediated alterations in innate, antigen presenting cell responses[23, 24], and that host nutritional status influences these responses. Ex vivo, GM-CSF expanded bone marrow derived dendritic cells( BMDCs) represent a heterogeneous mix of terminally differentiated cells that can provide an in vitro model of characteristics of the innate antigen presenting cell population in an animal[25–27]. Therefore, we profiled the cytokine response of BMDCs from Giardia challenged mice on either a protein deficient or a protein sufficient control diet to explore how diet and Giardia infection might influence cytokine production following exposure to endotoxin. We also explored the relationship between Giardia colonization followed by co-infection with EAEC during malnutrition, as these co-infections are common in malnourished children in endemic settings.Discussion:Previous studies have suggested that Giardia may exacerbate colitis in genetically pre-disposed hosts( IL10-/- mice) through increased IL12p40/IL-23 production[32]. Our results suggest that Giardia infection led to extra-intestinal effects on BMDC inflammatory cytokine responses to LPS stimulation in a diet-dependent manner. Precise mechanisms underlying these differences in cytokine profile are not yet understood. Intestinal infection with one organism, or vaccination[21], may persistently alter innate immune populations to provide a more robust response to infection with unrelated pathogens in a process coined “trained immunity”[19, 33]. The mechanism of trained immunity is not well understood, but may epigenetic changes in genes important in innate immunity have been implicated[34–37]. These changes might include methylation of H3K27 and H3K4 histones associated with promotor regions of multiple genes, including, but not limited to, IL-23[36]. Epigenetic effects may underlie the phenotype observed in our data, and this will be examined in future studies. In our experiments, mice on a control diet( CD) have significantly higher levels of SAA than those fed the protein deficient( PD diet). Disparate serum levels of host derived damage associated molecular pattern molecules( DAMPs) such as the acute phase protein serum amyloid A( SAA), are induced by the microbiota or infection and have been shown to be important in upregulating expression of epigenetic mediators such as histone demethylases and IL-23 in both myeloid cell lines and bone marrow[28, 36, 38–40]. SAA treatment preferentially increases secretion of IL-23, but not IL-12, in peripheral blood monocytes and the THP-1 monocytic cell line[40]. Increased serum levels of SAA, and direct culture with SAA, has been associated with increased IL-23 production in murine dendritic cells[28]. Thus, the decreased SAA during protein deficiency could limit IL-23 production from BMDCs following Giardia infection. Interestingly, decreased serum SAA associates with linear growth restriction early in life in endemic areas, but as enteric infection exposures like Giardia accumulate, elevated SAA predicts poorer subsequent growth[41]. Altered serum SAA may not fully explain our result as other metabolites or mediators may play a significant role in modulating cytokine production. Indeed, we observed increased IL-10 production by BMDCs from Giardia-infected mice fed the protein deficient diet. Furthermore, using the IL-12p40:IL-10 ratio as a marker of potential dendritic cell/macrophage polarity[30, 31], we found reduced IL-12p40:IL-10 ratios in LPS-stimulated BMDCs from mice fed the PD diet. These data suggest that the combination of Giardia and protein deficiency leads to an altered inflammatory environment. This in turn, might influence the inflammatory profile of innate immune cells during co-infection with another enteropathogen. Thus, to determine whether harboring Giardia during protein deficiency altered BMDC responses following EAEC co-infection, BMDCs from mice infected with Giardia alone, EAEC alone, or Giardia and then EAEC or were stimulated with LPS. Again, Giardia alone did not significantly increase IL-23 in these protein deficient mice, whereas EAEC alone did. Prior Giardia colonization, however, resulted in a minimal IL-23 response to EAEC. These data are consistent with our previous finding that Giardia alters intestinal calprotectin production during EAEC co-infection, and points to Giardia-mediated changes in myeloid cell activation[17]. IL-10 signaling during Giardia infection has recently been shown to be important in preventing development of colitis in mice[32]. Interestingly, our results suggest that during malnutrition Giardia infection may induce innate IL-10 production, that might partially attenuate inflammatory responses induced by enteropathogens that cause enterocolitis. Previous in vitro co-culture experiments have demonstrated that Giardia can directly modulate cytokine production from dendritic cells, with disparate outcomes depending on culture conditions, agonists, and cell type[9, 42]. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that a non-invasive intestinal protozoa alters systemic cytokine profiles of BMDCs and in a diet-dependent manner. Our work suggests that Giardia infection during, or in the absence of protein malnutrition, might persistently alter the responsiveness of innate immune cells to later challenge with infectious agents or their products, as measured via cytokine production( Fig 4). Limitations of the work involve the model system of innate bone marrow immune derived cells( BMDCs). Thus, we were unable to define the specific cell within the BMDC culture responsible for the functional response. Future studies will examine the influence of Giardia infection on proliferation, trafficking and inflammatory potential of hematopoietic and distinct intestinal myeloid immune populations[39]. Giardia infection may also influence hematopoietic cells, as previous studies have suggested that changes in the cytokine responsiveness of BMDCs mediated by the microbiota also correlate with changes in myeloid precursor cells in the marrow[28, 39]. This work is beyond the scope of the current investigation however. In conclusion, we demonstrate that intestinal Giardia infection has extra-intestinal effects on BMDC inflammatory cytokine production in a diet dependent manner. Furthermore, Giardia infection during protein deficiency and co-infection attenuates innate IL-23 responses elicited by the co-infecting enteropathogen( EAEC). Ultimately these studies may help provide better understanding of potential immune mechanisms underlying a range of post-infectious gut dysfunction, environmental enteric dysfunction[43] and other extra-intestinal sequelae due to enteropathogen infection, as well as clinical variability.","answer":"Giardia is a leading cause of gut infection worldwide , with wide variation in acute symptoms .

Repeated cold-air exposures increase human triiodothyronine (T3) plasma clearance rates. To study the response of the nuclear T3 receptor (NT3R) in this condition, binding characteristics were analyzed in human mononuclear leukocytes (MNL). In addition, we supplemented one group of individuals with a daily oral replacement dose of T3 to isolate the influence of serum thyroxine (T4) and thyrotropin (TSH) levels on receptor kinetics. The subjects were exposed to cold air (4 degrees C) twice / d, 30 min / exposure, for a total of 80 exposures. The T3-subjects received placebo [ n = 8 ] and the T3 + subjects received T3 (30 micrograms / d) [ n = 8 ] in a double-blind fashion. Mononuclear leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood before the cold exposure and drug regimen began, and then after every 20 exposures. The dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum binding capacity (MBC) of the NT3R values were log transformed to minimize between-subject variability. In the T3 + group, serum total thyroxine (TT4), free T4 (FT4), and TSH were approx 50% lower than both basal and T3-values. The log10Kd increased 0. 304 + /-0. 139 (p < 0. 04) and the log10MBC increased 0. 49 + /-0. 10 (p < 0. 001) in the T3 + subjects compared to baseline. This change in MBC represents a 311% increase in the MBC over baseline and a fivefold increase over placebo-treated subjects. The T3-group showed no change in MBC over the study. These results describe for the first time the rapid modulation of the NT3R in response to the combined influence of cold exposure and reduced circulating T4 and TSH.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"Mononuclear leukocytes\\", \\"MNL\\", \\"human mononuclear leukocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"nuclear T3 receptor\\", \\"NT3R\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

It leverages the latest advances in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing and applies them to video understanding. The proposed method allows us to create lightweight CNN models that achieve high accuracy and real-time speed using just an RGB mono camera and general purpose CPU. Furthermore, we explain how to improve accuracy by distilling from multiple models with different modalities into a single model. We conduct a comparison with state-of-the-art methods and show that our approach performs on par with most of them on famous Action Recognition datasets. We benchmark the inference time of the models using the modern inference framework and argue that our approach compares favorably with other methods in terms of speed accuracy trade-off, running at 56 FPS on CPU. The models and the training code are available.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: Variational methods are among the most successful approaches to calculate the optical flow between two image frames. A particularly appealing formulation is based on total variation (TV) regularization and the robust L1 norm in the data fidelity term. This formulation can preserve discontinuities in the flow field and offers an increased robustness against illumination changes, occlusions and noise. In this work we present a novel approach to solve the TV-L1 formulation. Our method results in a very efficient numerical scheme, which is based on a dual formulation of the TV energy and employs an efficient point-wise thresholding step. Additionally, our approach can be accelerated by modern graphics processing units. We demonstrate the real-time performance (30 fps) of our approach for video inputs at a resolution of 320 × 240 pixels.[3]: We investigate architectures of discriminatively trained deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) for action recognition in video. The challenge is to capture the complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion between frames. We also aim to generalise the best performing hand-crafted features within a data-driven learning framework. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a two-stream ConvNet architecture which incorporates spatial and temporal networks. Second, we demonstrate that a ConvNet trained on multi-frame dense optical flow is able to achieve very good performance in spite of limited training data. Finally, we show that multitask learning, applied to two different action classification datasets, can be used to increase the amount of training data and improve the performance on both. Our architecture is trained and evaluated on the standard video actions benchmarks of UCF-101 and HMDB-51, where it is competitive with the state of the art. It also exceeds by a large margin previous attempts to use deep nets for video classification.[4]: Motion representation plays a vital role in human action recognition in videos. In this study, we introduce a novel compact motion representation for video action recognition, named Optical Flow guided Feature (OFF), which enables the network to distill temporal information through a fast and robust approach. The OFF is derived from the definition of optical flow and is orthogonal to the optical flow. The derivation also provides theoretical support for using the difference between two frames. By directly calculating pixel-wise spatio-temporal gradients of the deep feature maps, the OFF could be embedded in any existing CNN based video action recognition framework with only a slight additional cost. It enables the CNN to extract spatiotemporal information, especially the temporal information between frames simultaneously. This simple but powerful idea is validated by experimental results. The network with OFF fed only by RGB inputs achieves a competitive accuracy of 93.3 on UCF-101, which is comparable with the result obtained by two streams (RGB and optical flow), but is 15 times faster in speed. Experimental results also show that OFF is complementary to other motion modalities such as optical flow. When the proposed method is plugged into the state-of-the-art video action recognition framework, it has 96.0 and 74.2 accuracy on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 respectively. The code for this project is available at: https: github.com kevin-ssy Optical-Flow-Guided-Feature[5]: Deep convolutional networks have achieved great success for visual recognition in still images. However, for action recognition in videos, the advantage over traditional methods is not so evident. This paper aims to discover the principles to design effective ConvNet architectures for action recognition in videos and learn these models given limited training samples. Our first contribution is temporal segment network (TSN), a novel framework for video-based action recognition. which is based on the idea of long-range temporal structure modeling. It combines a sparse temporal sampling strategy and video-level supervision to enable efficient and effective learning using the whole action video. The other contribution is our study on a series of good practices in learning ConvNets on video data with the help of temporal segment network. Our approach obtains the state-the-of-art performance on the datasets of HMDB51 ( ( 69.4 , )) and UCF101 ( ( 94.2 , )). We also visualize the learned ConvNet models, which qualitatively demonstrates the effectiveness of temporal segment network and the proposed good practices (Models and code at https: github.com yjxiong temporal-segment-networks).","answer":"Currently, there are multiple methods that solve the AR problem with certain quality.

This highlights the expressiveness of our proposed late interaction mechanism, particularly when coupled with a powerful pre-trained LM like BERT. While ColBERT’s re-ranking latency is slightly higher than the non-BERT re-ranking models shown (i.e., by 10s of milliseconds), this difference is explained by the time it takes to gather, stack, and transfer the document embeddings to the GPU. In particular, the query encoding and interaction in ColBERT consume only 13 milliseconds of its total execution time. We note that ColBERT’s latency and FLOPs can be considerably reduced by padding queries to a shorter length, using smaller vector dimensions (the MRR@10 of which is tested in §4.5), employing quantization of the document vectors, and storing the embeddings on GPU if sufficient memory exists. We leave these directions for future work.Question: How much does the late interaction decrease computational costs, and how close is the performance of the late interaction model to the early interaction model?","answer":"In contrast with this trend, ColBERT (which employs late interaction over BERT performs no worse than the original adaptation of BERT for ranking and is only marginally less effective than BERT and our training of BERT.

The present study aimed to describe the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients receiving different regimens of prophylactic anticoagulation. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective review using data from patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation. SETTING: Tertiary-care center in Indianapolis, IN, United States. PATIENTS: Patients hospitalized at international units Health Methodist Hospital with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation between March 23, 2020, and April 8, 2020, who underwent ultrasound evaluation for venous thrombosis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included. Nineteen of 45 patients (42.2%) were found to have deep venous thrombosis. Patients found to have deep venous thrombosis had no difference in time to intubation (p = 0.97) but underwent ultrasound earlier in their hospital course (p = 0.02). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were similar between the groups on day of intubation and day of ultrasound (p = 0.44 and p = 0.07, respectively). D-dimers were markedly higher in patients with deep venous thrombosis, both for maximum value and value on day of ultrasound (p < 0.01 for both). Choice of prophylactic regimen was not related to presence of deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.35). Ultrasound evaluation is recommended if D-dimer is greater than 2,000 ng/mL (sensitivity 95%, specificity 46%) and empiric anticoagulation considered if D-dimer is greater than 5,500 ng/mL (sensitivity 53%, specificity 88%). CONCLUSIONS: Deep venous thrombosis is very common in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. There was no difference in incidence of deep venous thrombosis among different pharmacologic prophylaxis regimens, although our analysis is limited by small sample size. D-dimer values are elevated in the majority of these patients, but there may be thresholds at which screening ultrasound or even empiric systemic anticoagulation is indicated.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\", \\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Bleeding complications and delayed healing of gastric ulcer associated with use of clopidogrel is a common clinical concern; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. This study aimed to clarify whether clopidogrel could cause the damage of the human gastric epithelial cells and to further elucidate the mechanisms involved. After human gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 had been treated with clopidogrel (0.5-2.5 mM), the cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay, apoptosis was measured with DAPI staining and flow cytometry analysis, and the barrier function of the tight junctions (TJ) was evaluated by permeability measurement and transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, expression of the TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1 and the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38, ERK, and JNK were examined by western blot. In addition, three MAPK inhibitors specific to p38, ERK and JNK were used, respectively, to verify the signaling pathways responsible for regulating the expression of the TJ proteins being tested. Results showed that clopidogrel significantly increased dextran permeability, induced apoptosis, suppressed GES-1 cell viability, and reduced the expression of the TJ proteins (occludin and ZO-1), acting through p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, these observed effects were partially abolished by SB-203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor), rather than by either U-0126 (an ERK inhibitor) or SP-600125 (a JNK inhibitor), suggesting that clopidogrel-induced disruption in the gastric epithelial cells is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. It is concluded that attenuated expression of the TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1 in human gastric epithelial cells could be involved in clopidogrel-induced gastric mucosal injury through activation of the p38 MAPK pathway.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"SP-600125\\", \\"U-0126\\", \\"DAPI\\", \\"MTT\\", \\"SB-203580\\", \\"clopidogrel\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

CO2 ice is one of the most abundant components in ice-coated interstellar ices besides H2O and CO, but the most favorable path to CO2 ice is still unclear. Molecular dynamics calculations on the ultraviolet photodissociation of different kinds of CO-H2O ice systems have been performed at 10 K in order to demonstrate that the reaction between CO and an OH molecule resulting from H2O photodissociation through the first excited state is a possible route to form CO2 ice. However, our calculations, which take into account different ice surface models, suggest that there is another product with a higher formation probability ((3.00 ± 0.07) × 10(-2)), which is the HOCO complex, whereas the formation of CO2 has a probability of only (3.6 ± 0.7) × 10(-4). The initial location of the CO is key to obtain reaction and form CO2: the CO needs to be located deep into the ice. The HOCO complex becomes trapped in the cold ice surface in the trans-HOCO minimum because it quickly loses its internal energy to the surrounding ice, preventing further reaction to H + CO2. Several laboratory experiments have been carried out recently, and they confirm that CO2 can also be formed through other, different routes. Here we compare our theoretical results with the data available from experiments studying the formation of CO2 through a similar pathway as ours, even though the initial conditions were not exactly the same. Our results also show that the HCO van der Waals complex can be formed through the interaction of CO with the H atom that is formed as a product of H2O photodissociation. Thus, the reaction of the H atom photofragment following H2O photodissociation with CO can be a possible route to form HCO ice.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"trans-HOCO\\", \\"H2O\\", \\"HOCO\\", \\"HCO\\", \\"CO2\\", \\"CO\\", \\"OH\\", \\"H\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

One benefitis that learning is possible even in the absence of an extrinsic reward signal or with an extrinsic reward signal that is very sparse. Another benefitis that an agent that has fully mastered its environment should be able to reach arbitrary achievable goals, which would allow it to generalize to tasks on which it wasn't explicitly trained. Building reinforcementlearning agents that aim for environment mastery instead of or in addition to learning about a scalar reward signal is currently an open challenge.One way to represent such knowledge about an environment is using an environment model. Modelbased reinforcementlearning methods aim to learn accurate environment models and use them either for planning or for training a policy. While learning accurateenvironment models of some visually rich environments is now possible BID33 BID7 BID15 using learned models in model-based reinforcement learning has proved to be challenging and model-free approaches still dominate common benchmarks.We present a new model-free agent architecture of Discriminative Embedding Reward Networks, or DISCERN for short. DISCERN learns to controlan environment in an unsupervised way by learning purely from the stream of observations and actions. The aim of our agent is tolearn a goal-conditioned policy π θ (a|s; s g ) BID19 BID37 which can reach any goal state s g that is reachable from the current state s. We show how to learn a goalachievement reward function r(s; s g ) that measures how similar state s is to state s g using a mutual information objective at the same time as learning π θ (a|s; s g ). The resulting learned rewardfunction r(s; s g ) measures similarity in the space of controllable aspects of the environment instead of in the space of raw observations. Crucially, the DISCERN architectureis able to deal with goal states that are not perfectly reachable, for example, due to the presence of distractor objects that are not under the agent's control. In such cases the goal-conditionedpolicy learned by DISCERN tends to seek states where the controllable elements match those in the goal state as closely as possible.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three domains -Atari games, continuous control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, and DeepMind Lab. We show that our agent learns to successfullyachieve a wide variety of visually-specified goals, discovering underlying degrees of controllability of an environment in a purely unsupervised manner and without access to an extrinsic reward signal.We have presented a system that can learn to achieve goals, specified in the form of observations from the environment, in a purely unsupervised fashion, i.e. without any extrinsic rewards or expert demonstrations.Integral to this system is a powerful and principled discriminative reward learning objective, which we have demonstrated can recover the dominant underlying degrees of controllability in a variety of visual domains.In this work, we have adopted a fixed episode length of T in the interest of simplicity and computational efficiency.This implicitly assumes not only that all sampled goals are approximately achievable in T steps, but that the policy need not be concerned with finishing in less than the allotted number of steps.Both of these limitations could be addressed by considering schemes for early termination based on the embedding, though care must be taken not to deleteriously impact training by terminating episodes too early based on a poorly trained reward embedding.Relatedly, our goal selection strategy is agnostic to both the state of the environment at the commencement of the goal episode and the current skill profile of the policy, utilizing at most the content of the goal itself to drive the evolution of the goal buffer G. We view it as highly encouraging that learning proceeds using such a naive goal selection strategy, however more sophisticated strategies, such as tracking and sampling from the frontier of currently achievable goals BID16 , may yield substantial improvements.DISCERN's ability to automatically discover controllable aspects of the observation space is a highly desirable property in the pursuit of robust low-level control.A natural next step is the incorporation of DISCERN into a deep hierarchical reinforcement learning setup BID46 BID24 BID30 where a meta-policy for proposing goals is learned after or in tandem with a low-level controller, i.e. by optimizing an extrinsic reward signal.","answer":"Unsupervised reinforcement learning method for learning a policy to robustly achieve perceptually specified goals."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

BACKGROUND: Fibrin deposition and thrombosis have been implicated in both allograft rejection and vasculopathy after cardiac transplantation. Because monocytes play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of intravascular coagulation activation through their ability to synthesize tissue factor (TF), we asked (1) whether monocyte TF activation occurs in cardiac transplant recipients and (2) whether monocyte TF expression is affected by treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA). METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured levels of TF activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and highly purified monocytes / macrophages from 10 consecutive cardiac transplant recipients and 10 healthy control subjects. TF activity generated by both unstimulated and endotoxin-stimulated cells was significantly higher in transplant recipients than in control subjects (P <. 05). Increased monocyte TF expression in transplant recipients was shown to be adversely affected by treatment with CsA: TF induction was markedly reduced by CsA serum concentrations reaching peak CsA drug levels. Inhibition of TF induction in the presence of high CsA blood concentrations was also observed when stimulation of cells was performed with interferon-gamma or interleukin-1beta. As shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively, treatment with CsA leads to decreased TF mRNA expression and reduced activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, which is known to contribute to the induction of the TF promotor in human monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that TF activation, occurring in mononuclear cells of cardiac transplant recipients, is inhibited by treatment with CsA. Inhibition of monocyte TF induction by CsA may contribute to its successful use in cardiac transplant medicine and might be useful in managing further settings of vascular pathology also known to involve TF expression and NF-kappaB activation.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"unstimulated\\", \\"endotoxin - stimulated cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"monocytes\\", \\"highly purified monocytes / macrophages\\", \\"mononuclear cells\\", \\"human monocytes\\", \\"peripheral blood mononuclear cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"TF promotor\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"interferon - gamma\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"TF\\", \\"NF - kappaB transcription factor\\", \\"interleukin - 1beta\\", \\"tissue factor\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"TF mRNA\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Three compartments were combined into one hyphenated, flow-through set-up. In the first compartment, a compound was exposed dynamically to enzymatic digestion in three consecutive microreactors, mimicking the processes of the mouth, stomach, and intestine. The resulting solution (chyme) continued to the second compartment, a flow-through barrier model of the intestinal epithelium allowing absorption of the compound and metabolites thereof. The composition of the effluents from the barrier model were analysed either offline by electrospray-ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), or online in the final compartment using chip-based ESI-MS. Two model drugs , omeprazole and verapamil , were used to test the integrated model . omeprazole was shown to be broken down upon treatment with gastric acid, but reached the cell barrier unharmed when introduced to the system in a manner emulating an enteric-coated formulation.

Nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) 2.5 mg with 17-beta estradiol (E2) 1.5 mg is a new combined oral contraceptive (COC) formulation and is the first monophasic E2 pill to be marketed, having been licensed for use in Europe in 2011. It is available to be taken daily in a regimen of 24 active pills followed by four placebo pills. NOMAC is a highly selective 19-nor progestogen derivative with specific binding to progesterone receptors, anti-estrogenic activity and no androgenic, mineralocorticoid nor glucocorticoid effects. E2 is an estrogen that is identical to endogenous estrogen. While it has been in use for only a short period of time, current evidence suggests that NOMAC/E2 is just as effective, safe, and acceptable as existing COC preparations. Two large Phase III trials conducted in the Americas and across Europe , Australia , and Asia showed lower cumulative pregnancy rates in the NOMAC/E2 groups compared to the drospirenone ( DRSP ) 3 mg in combination with ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) 30 µg ( DRSP/EE ) groups but this difference was not statistically significant . NOMAC/E2 exhibits a good safety profile and has less effects on cardiovascular risk, hemostatic, metabolic, and endocrine factors in comparison to COCs containing EE in combination with levonorgestrel (LNG) or DRSP. NOMAC/E2 has also been found to cause less breast cell proliferation when compared to E2 alone and has some anti-proliferative effect on human breast cancer cells.

Although inflammation and metabolic dysfunction of β-cells elicit secretory defects associated with type-1 or type-2 diabetes, accompanying changes to insulin granules have not been established. To address this, we performed detailed functional analyses of insulin granules purified from cells subjected to model treatments that mimic type-1 and type-2 diabetic conditions and discovered striking shifts in calcium affinities and fusion characteristics. We show that this behavior is correlated with two subpopulations of insulin granules whose relative abundance is differentially shifted depending on diabetic model condition. The two types of granules have different release characteristics, distinct lipid and protein compositions, and package different secretory contents alongside insulin. This complexity of β-cell secretory physiology establishes a direct link between granule subpopulation and type of diabetes and leads to a revised model of secretory changes in the diabetogenic process.Introduction:Blood glucose levels are maintained in a narrow range by secretion of the hormone insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Insufficient insulin secretion leads to elevated levels of blood glucose resulting in diabetes( Rorsman and Ashcroft, 2018). Type 1 diabetes( T1D) results primarily from immune-mediated killing of pancreatic β-cells. In contrast, type 2 diabetes( T2D) arises when peripheral resistance to insulin signaling causes persistent demand for insulin secretion and eventual β-cell exhaustion( Guthrie and Guthrie, 2004; Rorsman and Ashcroft, 2018). Understanding molecular deficiencies of the secretory pathway in diabetes is essential for identifying the underlying causes of the disease. Secretory defects have been observed in diabetic human islet cells. Treatments that mimic these defects have been identified and used to model diabetes in healthy human cells, rodent islets, and immortalized cell lines( Aslamy et al., 2018a; Aslamy et al., 2018b; Gandasi and Barg, 2014; Hoppa et al., 2009; Olofsson et al., 2007). Onset of T1D is modeled by treatment of insulin-secreting cells with proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, INF-γ, and IL-1β, which leads to decreased insulin release and a loss of Doc2B, an established biomarker for the disease( Aslamy et al., 2018a; Aslamy et al., 2018b). T2D is associated with extended exposure to elevated free fatty acids( FFA) caused by high fat diets( Grill and Qvigstad, 2000). The lipotoxicity component of T2D is frequently modeled by sustained treatment of insulin-secreting cells with palmitate, resulting in reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion( Hoppa et al., 2009; Sako and Grill, 1990). Stimulated secretion of insulin normally occurs in two sequential phases, an acute first phase and a sustained second phase, which are differently affected in the T1D and T2D models. Modeling the inflammation of T1D by cytokine treatment causes a defect in insulin secretion attributed to the loss of Doc2B( Aslamy et al., 2018a; Aslamy et al., 2018b), which primarily suppresses the second phase of secretion( Ramalingam et al., 2012). Conversely, modeling T2D by palmitate treatment strongly decreases the first phase( Rorsman and Ashcroft, 2018). These observations show distinct insulin secretion profiles in the two diseases, and understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of how these different outcomes arise would provide a fundamentally new molecular view on the pathology of diabetes. Although the secretory defects leading to T1D and T2D are well established, the cell and molecular biology that underlies the phenotypes of T1D and T2D model treatments is not known. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, we performed large-scale purification of secretory granules on either untreated, palmitate-treated, or cytokine-treated insulin-secreting cells. These granules were characterized comparatively for SNARE-mediated fusion properties in single particle fusion assays with SNARE-containing reconstituted target membranes. This novel cellular dissection and reconstitution approach, which was corroborated in intact insulin-secreting cells undergoing the same treatments, revealed a previously unknown heterogeneity among insulin granules with different subpopulations of secretory vesicles being lost following one or the other of the two diabetes-mimicking treatments. Further study showed remarkable differences in size, composition, and fusion characteristics of these subpopulations. As a result, we were able to identify a strong correlation between the distinct contents of the two subpopulations and known changes in β-cell output of signaling molecules by pancreatic islets during the onset of each type of diabetes. Taken together, these studies lead to a revised model about how the organization and regulation of two insulin secretory pathways potentially impact physiological intra-islet communication and pathological changes that accompany the diabetogenic process.Discussion:Our results reveal that insulin-secreting cells harbor distinct subpopulations of insulin granules that are selectively activated for secretion to release different secretory molecules. Therefore, insulin granules can no longer be considered generic storage units for releasing the full range of secretory molecules without regard to timing and signal strength. Regulated exocytosis provides a complex network of β-cell derived signals that serve as autocrine and paracrine governors of the secretion of insulin and other islet-derived hormones. The current work shows that these secretory regulators are parsed out selectively among the two insulin granule subpopulations that we have characterized in great molecular detail. The biphasic secretory pattern of insulin release in response to glucose has been previously described by its correlation to electrical activity in stimulated islet β-cells( Rorsman and Ashcroft, 2018). Because the granule subpopulations with secretory cargo compositions have different calcium affinities furnished by different synaptotagmin isoforms( Figure 3), we propose that these phases can be interpreted as a staged release of selected peptides and transmitters over time and levels of intracellular calcium. The detailed characteristics of the granule subpopulations and their correlations to T1D and T2D are summarized in Table 1. In our new model linking the progression of T1D and T2D to different subpopulations of insulin secretory granules in the same cells, we posit that the syt9 granules release their content primarily in the first phase of secretion during the initial spike in intracellular calcium supported by their close proximity to calcium channels( Hoppa et al., 2009). Granules harboring the high-affinity calcium sensor syt7 would release their content during both phases. Indeed, both first- and second-phase secretion are decreased in human β-cells upon syt7 knockout( Dolai et al., 2016) and upon Doc2b knockout in mice( Ramalingam et al., 2012), while treatment of human β-cells with free fatty acids inhibits the peak during the initial release phase( Hoppa et al., 2009). It will be interesting to see if physiologic responses can be correlated to time-dependent release of selected cargoes that have local and systemic regulatory roles and if there is further heterogeneity within the discovered subpopulations. Our studies further illustrate the very important contribution of granule membrane protein and lipid composition in supporting the complex signaling capability of β-cell exocytosis. The striking difference in lipid composition between the two granule subpopulations, especially with regard to sphingomyelin and cholesterol content( Figure 4), almost certainly contributes to the specific sorting of the fusion regulatory proteins and transporters( Figure 5). These sorting events enable granule subpopulations to be mobilized according to signaling strength and thereby export different regulatory signals during different phases of T1D and T2D development. Going forward, it will be interesting to define these sorting processes in more detail, determine how they interface with other post-Golgi pathways, and thereby contribute to the pathology of diabetes. A central and striking new finding of the present study is the discovery that the two markedly different insulin granule subpopulations are each selectively sensitive to T1D and T2D model treatments. This brings new insight to the differing secretory pathologies that arise in β-cells during the two types of diabetes. Further, the differential loss of specific granule subpopulations can explain previously observed changes in insulin release characteristics such as more restricted fusion pores after palmitate treatment( Hoppa et al., 2009), which would be consistent with slower content release that we observed after this treatment. Because the levels of neither syt7 nor syt9 are decreased in lysates of cells following diabetic model treatments( Figure 3B), it appears that shifts in granule subpopulations induced by the treatments are not explainable solely by amplified autophagic degradation of a particular type of granule, although the process of granule turnover by crinophagy in β-cells( Marsh et al., 2007) may be membrane-conservative and thus not lead to synaptotagmin degradation. In the case of palmitate treatment, however, it will be necessary to evaluate this deduction in relation to the recently reported crinophagy of newly formed insulin granules under experimental conditions that differ from ours( Pasquier et al., 2019). Follow-up studies may also be needed to examine whether diabetogenic signaling is targeted to granule formation where a role for CAPS has already been defined( Speidel et al., 2008) or to enhanced stimulated secretion( Olofsson et al., 2007). As well, it will be interesting to learn whether perturbed clustering of L-type calcium channels by palmitate( Gandasi and Barg, 2014) and perturbed function of syntaxin-4 caused by proinflammatory cytokines( Oh et al., 2012; Wiseman et al., 2011) interface with the signaling that is targeted to the insulin granule subpopulations. Regardless, the loss of a whole granule subpopulation and with it the loss of a variety of signaling molecules during the onset of T1D or throughout T2D likely explains multiple previously unknown effects on the progression of the disease. For example, losing granules secreting ATP and MIF( Figure 6A) during the onset of T1D might compromise both local signaling and islet protection from immune cells( Stojanovic et al., 2012; Weitz et al., 2018). Although there were prior hints that high and low sensitivity calcium pools co-exist in insulin secreting cells( Wan et al., 2004; Yang and Gillis, 2004), the identities of different granule subpopulations have not been previously described and mapping of the complex arrays of secretory products within these subpopulations has not been achieved. Also, the discovery that these subpopulations and their secretory products are linked to distinct diabetic states of insulin producing cells is novel and provides new mechanistic insight to established defects in diabetic( T1D and T2D) secretory signals. Our granule purification and functional reconstitution approach was ideally suited to characterize heterogeneity of granules subpopulations in extensive detail, which has not been previously achieved using traditional cellular approaches. A recent study demonstrates that the described granule heterogeneity likely extends to human and rodent pancreatic β-cells with differential modulation of calcium sensitivity of exocytosis conferred by synaptotagmin isoforms during pancreatic development and maturation( Huang et al., 2018). Therefore, our current work provides a road map for examining changes of secretory signals within diabetes in authentic islets. The new insights gained here will likely inform the design of future studies to explore granule heterogeneity in human and other mammalian islet secretion of specific products stimulated by appropriate signals under different diabetic states. The presence of functionally and compositionally distinct secretory vesicles revealed here for insulin secreting cells( Table 1) is not unique to pancreatic β-cells and derivatives, but is likely a general property of a variety of regulated secretory cells. Secretory vesicle heterogeneity has been shown to have consequences on synaptic secretion and likely affects secretion from most endocrine cell types as well as from immune cells functioning in host defense. In neurons, the partitioning of VGAT and VGLUT between different vesicles has been observed( Farsi et al., 2016) but no mechanism of how a cell facilitates sorting of these transporters into distinct synaptic vesicles has been explored. The tools developed and presented in this work should open new avenues for future studies of the characteristics and mechanisms of sorting processes in these other cell types and thus help with a better molecular understanding of the diseases that are associated with them.","answer":"Diabetes is a disease that occurs when sugar levels in the blood can no longer be controlled by a hormone called insulin .

Kreutzberger , Kiessling et al . wanted to know whether pro-inflammatory molecules and fatty acids affect insulin granules differently at the molecular level . To do this , insulin-producing cells were grown in the lab and treated with either fatty acids or pro-inflammatory molecules . The insulin granules of these cells were then isolated . Next , the composition of the granules and how they fused to lab-made membranes that mimic the cell membrane was examined . The experiments revealed that healthy β-cells have two types of granules , each with a different version of a protein called synaptotagmin . Cells treated with molecules mimicking type 1 diabetes lost granules with synaptotagmin-7 , while granules with synaptotagmin-9 were lost in cells treated with fatty acids to imitate type 2 diabetes . Each type of granule responded differently to calcium levels in the cell and secreted different molecules , indicating that each elicits a different diabetic response in the body .

Methyleugenol (MEG), which is commonly used as a fragrance and flavoring agent, has been shown to induce hepatocellular tumors in rodents. However, the role of genotoxicity as a possible mechanism of action is not fully understood even though the DNA-reactive metabolite of MEG has been identified. In this study, a gpt delta transgenic rat model was used to clarify whether genotoxic mechanisms are involved in MEG-induced hepatocarcinogenesis following medium-term exposure. F344 gpt delta rats were subjected to repeated oral administration of MEG at dosages of 0, 10, 30, or 100mg/kg (a carcinogenic dose) for 13 weeks. The relative weight of the liver of the male and female rats that were administered 100mg/kg MEG and the absolute weight of the liver of the male rats that were administered 100mg/kg MEG were significantly increased. In addition, the number and area of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive cell ratios in the hepatocytes were significantly increased in the male and female rats that were administered 100mg/kg MEG compared with the control animals. In the in vivo mutation assays, a significant increase in the gpt and Spi (-) mutant frequencies was observed in both sexes at the carcinogenic dose.

(2018) ; Srikant and Ying (2019) ; Dalal et al. (2018a); Cai et al. (2019) .Since each iteration of TD uses one or a mini-batch of samples to estimate the mean of the gradient 1 , TD learning usually suffers from the inherent variance, which substantially degrades the convergence accuracy.Although a diminishing stepsize or very small constant stepsize can reduce the variance Bhandari et al. (2018) ; Srikant and Ying (2019) ; Dalal et al. (2018a) , they also slow down the convergence significantly.Two approaches have been proposed to reduce the variance.The first approach is the so-called batch TD, which takes a fixed sample set and transforms the empirical mean square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) into an equivalent convex-concave saddle-point problem Du et al. (2017) .Due to the finite-sample nature of such a problem, stochastic variance reduction techniques for conventional optimization can be directly applied here to reduce the variance.In particular, Du et al. (2017) showed that SVRG Johnson and Zhang (2013) and SAGA Defazio et al. (2014) can be applied to improve the performance of batch TD algorithms, and Peng et al. (2019) proposed two variants of SVRG to further save the computation cost.However, the analysis of batch TD does not take into account the statistical nature of the training samples, which are generated by a MDP.Hence, there is no guarantee of such obtained solutions to be close to the fixed point of TD learning.The second approach is the so-called TD with centering (CTD) algorithm proposed in Korda and La (2015) , which introduces the variance reduction idea to the original TD learning algorithm.For the sake of better reflecting its major feature, we refer to CTD as Variance Reduced TD (VRTD) throughout this paper.Similarly to the SVRG in Johnson and Zhang (2013) , VRTD has outer and inner loops.The beginning of each inner-loop (i.e. each epoch) computes a batch of sample gradients so that each subsequent inner loop iteration modifies only one sample gradient in the batch gradient to reduce the variance.The main difference between VRTD and batch TD is that VRTD applies the variance reduction directly to TD learning rather than to a transformed optimization problem in batch TD.Though Korda and La (2015) empirically verified that VRTD has better convergence accuracy than vanilla TD learning, some technical errors in the analysis in Korda and La (2015) have been pointed out in follow up studies Dalal et al. (2018a) ; Narayanan and Szepesvári (2017) .Furthermore, as we discuss in Section 3, the technical proof in Korda and La (2015) regarding the convergence of VRTD also has technical errors so that their results do not correctly characterize the impact of variance reduction on TD learning.Given the recent surge of interest in the finite time analysis of the vanilla TD Bhandari et al. (2018) ; Srikant and Ying (2019) ; Dalal et al. (2018a) , it becomes imperative to reanalyze the VRTD and accurately understand whether and how variance reduction can help to improve the convergence accuracy over vanilla TD.Towards this end, this paper specifically addresses the following central questions.• For i.i.d. sampling, it has been shown in Bhandari et al. (2018) that vanilla TD converges only to a neighborhood of the fixed point for a constant stepsize and suffers from a constant error term caused by the variance of the stochastic gradient at each iteration.For VRTD, does the variance reduction help to reduce such an error and improve the accuracy of convergence?How does the error depend on the variance reduction parameter, i.e., the batch size for variance reduction?• For Markovian sampling, it has been shown in Bhandari et al. (2018) ; Srikant and Ying (2019) that the convergence of vanilla TD further suffers from a bias error due to the correlation among samples in addition to the variance error as in i.i.d. sampling.Does VRTD, which was designed to have reduced variance, also enjoy reduced bias error?If so, how does the bias error depend on the batch size for variance reduction?","answer":"This paper provides a rigorous study of the variance reduced TD learning and characterizes its advantage over vanilla TD learning"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Using measurements of capillary erythrocyte-associated transients, fluctuations of oxygen partial pressure( Po2) associated with individual erythrocytes, to infer Po2 in the nearby neuropil, we report the first non-invasive micron-scale mapping of cerebral Po2 in awake, resting mice. Interstitial Po2 has similar values in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer and the somatosensory cortex, whereas there are large capillary hematocrit and erythrocyte flux differences. Awake tissue Po2 is about half that under isoflurane anesthesia, and within the cortex, vascular and interstitial Po2 values display layer-specific differences which dramatically contrast with those recorded under anesthesia. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring energy parameters non-invasively in physiological conditions to precisely quantify and model brain metabolism.Introduction:To understand the relationship between brain oxygenation and diseases associated with hypoxia or ischemia, it is important to first determine what fixes the resting value of tissue Po2, that is, the concentration of oxygen in the interstitium that bridges oxygen delivery from erythrocytes to oxygen consumption by mitochondria. Numerous methods have been used to monitor brain oxygenation, and the most spatially resolved approaches have long relied on fine Clark-type electrodes( for review see Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007), which have been used to report resting-state Po2 and local oxygen consumption in various brain regions( Lecoq et al., 2009; Masamoto et al., 2003; Offenhauser et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2003) during neuronal activation. However, these electrodes are invasive, do not faithfully report Po2 in vessels and cannot easily be used to determine Po2 in physiological conditions, that is, in awake, unstressed animals, avoiding the use of anesthetics. As anesthetics affect resting and evoked neuronal and astrocyte activity, arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow, the physiological values of cerebral interstitial Po2 and their relationship to blood flow parameters in capillaries remain unknown. Recently, a two-photon phosphorescent probe PtP-C343 has been generated( Finikova et al., 2007, 2008) and two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy( 2PLM) has been used to obtain depth-resolved, micron-scale measurements of Po2 in the anesthetized rodent brain( Devor et al., 2011; Lecoq et al., 2011; Parpaleix et al., 2013; Sakadzić et al., 2010; Sakadžić et al., 2014). In addition, by detecting single red blood cells( RBCs) during Po2 measurement, we demonstrated the possibility of simultaneously monitoring blood flow and Po2 in capillaries( Lecoq et al., 2011) and of detecting erythrocyte-associated transients( EATs), Po2 fluctuations associated with each individual erythrocyte flowing in capillaries, which were first reported in mesentery capillaries( Golub and Pittman, 2005). We showed that in olfactory bulb glomeruli of anesthetized mice, one parameter of EATs, the Po2 in between two red blood cells( Po2InterRBC), is at equilibrium with, and thus reports, the Po2 in the nearby neuropil( Parpaleix et al., 2013). This result implied that measurements of Po2InterRBC could provide a powerful tool to non-invasively map local interstitial oxygen concentration in the brain of awake animals. Here, we report that in both the olfactory bulb glomerular layer and the somatosensory cortex of unstressed, awake, resting mice, the interstitial Po2( equivalent to Po2InterRBC) has the same mean value of ~23 mm Hg, spanning over a range of about 40 mm Hg. This contrasts with the large differences of capillary hematocrit and RBC flow values observed between the two brain regions. In addition, we find that in the cortex capillary and interstitial Po2 values display layer-specific differences, being lower in layer I than in layer II/III or layer IV. We also find that hemoglobin in brain capillaries is highly saturated with oxygen. Finally, we show that in both brain regions, the interstitial Po2 is much lower during wakefulness than under isoflurane anesthesia.Discussion:In the olfactory bulb and somatosensory cortex of awake resting mice, we report similar average values of interstitial Po2( ~23 mm Hg). In the awake rodent, brain oxygenation has previously only been investigated with lower resolution approaches. Liu et al.( Liu et al., 1995) used electron paramagnetic resonance( EPR) oximetry with a lithium phthalocyanine crystal being implanted in the cerebral cortex of rats 24 hr prior to the measurements. They reported that restrained and untrained rats have a cerebral Po2 of about 34 mm Hg, which, surprisingly, was reduced by isoflurane anesthesia( 1% in 21% O2) to about 24 mm Hg. This resting value( 34 mm Hg) is significantly higher than our average interstitial Po2 value, most probably due to the effects of the stress resulting from restraint in the absence of habituation. The effect of isoflurane, which decreased Po2 is intriguing, and indicates that the main effect of isoflurane in this case was to abolish the Po2 augmenting effects of stress. Interestingly, increasing the delay from crystal implantation to 7 days and introducing some habituation to restraint reduced cerebral Po2 to 27 mm Hg( Dunn et al., 2000). The best demonstration of physiological measurements of Po2 has been performed in unrestrained rats, in which brain Po2was measured with an implanted fiber optic probe measuring quenching of an oxygen sensor( Ortiz-Prado et al., 2010). Although the probe was very invasive, it reported an average bulk tissue Po2 value of 25 mm Hg, a value very similar to ours. We are thus confident that Po2InterRBC is an excellent reporter of the interstitial Po2, that our extensive habituation procedures are efficient, and that this study gives the first non-invasive and physiological values of Po2, hematocrit and capillary blood flow in the rodent brain. Our results show a number of differences from those previously reported with high-resolution measurement techniques in anesthetized animals. Tissue Po2 values have previously been reported to be in the range of ~5–100 mm Hg, with the higher values occurring in regions close to pial arterioles( Devor et al., 2011; Sakadzić et al., 2010). Our values of tissue Po2( Po2InterRBC) lie in the lower end of this wide range, do not include measurements from the capillary-free peri-arteriolar regions, and so are likely to be reflective of the Po2 levels that exist in the majority of the tissue, away from large arterioles. Considering intravascular Po2, our measurements of capillary Po2Mean( average ≈36 mm Hg in the cortex) seem to be broadly in agreement with those reported by Sakadzić et al., 2010( ~25–35 mm Hg), but our recorded values of capillary RBC Po2( Po2RBC, average ≈66 mm Hg in the cortex), are dramatically higher than those published by Sakadzić et al., 2014, where the most frequent values were ~25–35 mm Hg. A prominent discrepancy between the results of previous studies and our findings in awake, resting animals relates to changes in cortical oxygenation with depth. Many previous studies report drops in interstitial Po2 with increasing depth in the cortex( Cross and Silver, 1962; Devor et al., 2011; Masamoto et al., 2003; Nair et al., 1975; Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007; Whalen et al., 1970), with Po2 in layer I being higher than in underlying layers. In contrast, our measures of Po2InterRBC suggest that interstitial Po2 is lower in layer I than in either layer II/III or IV. These conflicting patterns of laminar variations of Po2 also exist in comparisons of the mean vascular Po2 values( Po2Mean), where previous 2PLM studies have reported decreases in mean vascular Po2 in concert with decreases in penetrating arteriole and venule Po2( Devor et al., 2011; Sakadzić et al., 2010) with increasing depth in the cortex. In the present study, we see an increase in capillary Po2Mean from layer I to deeper layers, and no gradient in penetrating vessel Po2 with depth. It is possible that the deviation from normal physiological conditions inherent in anesthesia and acute surgical preparation, which we avoid with our approach, leads to the emergence of these disagreements. Although average Po2InterRBC values in both the cortex and glomerular layer were ~23 mm Hg, in both structures a number of capillaries were found to have Po2InterRBC values <15 mm Hg, indicating the existence of regions in both structures where the interstitial Po2 is close to reported values of Po2 below which cellular respiratory rate is strongly dependent on Po2( ~10 mm Hg)( Kasischke et al., 2011). Furthermore, examples were found in both brain regions where the Po2InterRBC was below the value of ~3. 4 mm Hg that has previously been reported as the critical Po2 in brain tissue( Kasischke et al., 2011). Similarly low tissue Po2 measurements have previously been observed( Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007; Whalen et al., 1973), but their existence has been interpreted as being related to disruption of normal tissue physiology in the experimental preparations( Wilson et al., 2012). However, the presence of such low values in our awake preparations indicates that, surprisingly, at least some small regions of the brain can subsist at very low Po2 values. Our finding of high Po2RBC and corresponding capillary So2( estimated using the parameters used in Sakadžić et al., 2014) values in both the olfactory bulb and the somatosensory cortex( Figure 7) differs from recently published findings in the anesthetized, ventilated mouse( Sakadžić et al., 2014). We find that capillary So2 in both structures is generally high, indicating that the majority of hemoglobin in these vessels exists as oxyhemoglobin, and thus that capillaries are capable of supplying very significant quantities of oxygen to support neural function. In conclusion, the present study establishes, for the first time, accurate and precise values of physiological Po2 in the vasculature and interstitium of mouse cerebral grey matter. As it is known that O2 concentration is a critical parameter in determining the properties of neuronal function( Huchzermeyer et al., 2008, 2013; Ivanov and Zilberter, 2011), and neurovascular interactions( Gordon et al., 2008), these values provide a standard on which future research can rely to provide relevant, physiologically accurate conditions of oxygenation in which to investigate such processes.","answer":"Brain cells need a constant supply of oxygen to fuel their activities . This oxygen is delivered by the flow of blood through the vessels in the brain . If the blood flow to brain tissue is cut off as happens in stroke , or if an individual stops breathing , the brain becomes deprived of oxygen and brain cells will be damaged and die . To better understand how the brain works in health and disease , scientists need to learn how much oxygen the blood must deliver to the brain tissue to adequately support the activities of brain cells . Many studies have measured oxygen levels in the brain . However , these studies have looked only roughly and taken measurements from large areas of the brain , or they have involved animals receiving anesthesia , which can alter blood flow and oxygen use in the brain . Recently , scientists discovered that they could measure oxygen concentration at high detail in the brain of anesthetized rodents with a specialized microscope , by using molecules that emit light at a rate that depends on the local oxygen concentration . Now , Lyons et al . have shown that this same technique can be used in mice that are awake . First , a piece of the skull was replaced with glass to create a small transparent window . Then , the animals were allowed to recover for a few weeks , and were trained to get them used to how they would be handled during the experiments . After this period , the oxygen concentrations and blood flow in different parts of the mouse brains were measured in fine detail using the microscope while the animals were awake and relaxed . The experiments showed that oxygen levels in awake resting mice are actually lower than in anesthetized mice , and that oxygen levels differ between different parts of the mouse brain . This first detailed look at oxygen levels in the brain of awake animals will likely lead to more studies . For example , future studies may look at how quickly the brain uses oxygen under normal conditions and what happens in the brain during disease ."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

In this work, we represent videos by various appearance, motion and audio information guided with video topic. By following multi-stage training strategy, our experiments show steady and significant improvement on the VATEX benchmark. This report presents an overview and comparative analysis of our system designed for both Chinese and English tracks on VATEX Captioning Challenge 2019.IntroductionVideo captioning has drawn more attention and shown promising results recently. To translate content-rich video into human language is a extremely complex task, which should not only extract abundant multi-modal information from video but also cross the semantic gap to generate accurate and fluent language. Thanks to the recent developments of useful deep learning frameworks, such as LSTM BIBREF1 networks, as well as of machine translation techniques such as BIBREF2, the dominant approach in video captioning is currently based on sequence learning using an encoder-decoder framework.In encoding phase, the main task is to well represent given videos general including appearance, motion, audio even speech information. There are many pretrained models can be used to extract above features. In this report, we illustrate our system how to represent videos in detail and use video topic as a global semantic clue to guide better alignment.In decoding phase, conventional models follow encoder-decoder framework almost predict the next word conditioned on context information and the previous word. Furthermore, the previous word should be ground truth word at training step but model generated word at inference. As a result, the previous word at training and inference are drawn from different distributions, namely, from the data distribution as opposed to the model distribution. This discrepancy, called exposure bias BIBREF3 leads to a gap between training and inference. Meanwhile, most models apply cross-entropy loss as their optimization objective, but typically evaluate at inference using discrete and non-differentiable NLP metrics. For above reasons, we apply multi-stage training strategy to train our model to avoid exposure bias problem and directly optimize metrics for the task at hand. Experiments prove that our strategy can obtain steady and significant improvement during training and testing time.Multi-modal Video RepresentationsWe extract the video representations from multiple clues including appearance, motion and audio. We also use video topic to provide global information for specific videos.Given one video, we uniformly extract 28 frames as key frames, then select 16 frames around the keyframes as segments. As for those videos whose number of frame less than 28, above selection will be looped. Appearance feature extracted from each frames can reflect global information of these key frames. To extract appearance-based representations from videos, we apply ResNet-152 pretrained on ImageNet dataset. We also attempt some deeper and wider networks InceptionResNet, they barely have improvement for the final result. In order to model the motion information of each segments in video, we use I3D pretrained on Kinetics-600 dataset, which exactly has the same data distribution with VATEX dataset. As for audio feature, though use it alone can not get very good result for video captioning, it can be seen as powerful additional feature, which can provide more discriminative information for some similar content videos. We build audio feature extractor based on VGGish network, which is a variant of the VGG network described in BIBREF4. First, we extract MEL-spectrogram patches for each of the input audio. The sample rate of the audio is fixed at 16 KHz. The STFT window length is 25 ms and top length is 10 ms. The number of Mel filters is 64. We uniformly sample 28 patches for computing MEL-spectrogram. We then transfer learn from an existing VGGish model which is pretrained on the Audioset dataset BIBREF5. Specifically, we fine-tune this pretrained VGGish model on VATEX training set for 10 epochs. The input size is  96times 64  for log MEL-spectrogram audio inputs. The last group of convolutional and maxpooling layers are replaced by an embedding layer on the Mel features of size 128. We take this compact embedding layer’s output as our audio feature. In the end, we get  28times 2048  appearance features,  28times 1024  motion features and  28times 128  audio features for each video. Note that each multi-modal feature should be aligned at the same frame to ensure temporal consistency.Inspired by the Wang's work BIBREF6, we found that topic plays an essential role for video captioning. From intuitive understanding, topic can provide global information for specific videos. Topic also can be seen as a cluster, video of the same class always has the similar semantic attributes. We conduct topic-embedding and label-embedding following the same method reported by Wang BIBREF6.Multi-stage Training StrategyIn the fist stage, we also apply teacher-forced method to directly optimize the cross-entropy loss. It is necessary to warm-up model during this step.In the second step, we utilize word-level oracle method BIBREF7 to replace conventional scheduled sampling method BIBREF8. This method mainly consists of two steps: oracle word selection and sampling with decay. In practice, by introducing the Gumbel-Max technique we can acquire more robust word-level oracles, which provides a simple and efficient way to sample from a categorical distribution. What's more, the sampling curve is smoother than scheduled sampling method due to its specially designed sampling function. This step can obviously alleviate the problem of overfitting and improve the exploration ability of model.It's time to go into the third step when the curve of CIDEr BIBREF9 metric is no longer growing for 3 epochs. To avoid exposure bias problem, self-critical reinforcement algorithm BIBREF10 directly optimizes metrics of captioning task. In this work, CIDEr BIBREF9 and BLEU BIBREF11 are equally optimized after the whole sentence generating. This step allow us to more effectively train on non-differentiable metrics, and leads to significant improvements in captioning performance on VATEX.Experiments ::: DatasetWe utilize the VATEX dataset for video captioning, which contains over 41,250 videos and 825,000 captions in both English and Chinese. Among the captions, there are over 206,000 English-Chinese parallel translation pairs. It covers 600 human activities and a variety of video content. Each video is paired with 10 English and 10 Chinese diverse captions. We follow the official split with 25,991 videos for training, 3,000 videos for validation and 6,000 public test videos for final testing.Experiments ::: SystemThe overall video captioning framework is illustrated in Figure FIGREF1. In general, it is composed of two components: 1) Multi-modal video encoder; 2) Top-down BIBREF12 based decoder. In decoding phase, because of the large distribution difference between vision and audio data, we leverage two one-layer LSTM-based architectures to process these two parts of data separately, namely Vision-LSTM and Audio-LSTM. As for vision processing, embedded appearance and motion features are concatenated and then input to Vision-LSTM of 512-D, embedded audio features are directly fed into Audio-LSTM of 128-D. In this way, we can obtain context features with sequential information. During the decoding phase, a top-down based captioning architecture is to be adopted. Attention-LSTM using global video topic and last generated word to guide temporal attention modules to select the most relevant vision and audio regions. Specifically, there are two independent attention modules applying soft-attention to score corresponding regions with topic guide. Meanwhile, Language-LSTM assembles both processed vision and audio context information to generate next word.Experiments ::: Evaluations of Video Captioning SystemFor this task, four common metrics including BLEU-4, METEOR, CIDEr and ROUGE-L are evaluated. In this subsection, we mainly show steady and significant improvement with different training stage as shown in Table TABREF2.ConclusionIn this report, we explain our designed video captioning system in general. Multi-modal information including appearance, motion and audio are extracted to better represent videos. In order to tackle exposure bias and overfitting problem, we utilize several multi-stage training strategies to train our model. Both Chinese and English tracks are all following the above methods. The experiment proves that our methods can obtain steady and significant captioning performance.Figure 1. Overview of the proposes Video Captioning framework. Vision LSTM and Audio LSTM are used to selectively merge temporal information of vision features and audio features. And two independent Attention modules can attend to vision and audio with decoding step.Table 1.

In this study, we identified a rice Chl -deficient mutant, ygdl-1 (yellow green and droopy leaf-1), which showed yellow-green leaves throughout plant development with decreased content of Chls and carotene and an increased Chl a/b ratio. The ygdl-1 mutant also exhibited severe defects in chloroplast development, including disorganized grana stacks. Sequence analysis revealed that the mutant contained a T-DNA insertion within the promoter of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (OsAld-Y), which dramatically reduced the OsAld-Y mRNA level, and its identity was verified by transgenic complementation. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development were concurrently altered in the ygdl-1 mutant. The expression of OsAld-Y - GFP fusion protein in tobacco epidermal cells showed that OsAld-Y was localized to the peroxisome. In addition, the analysis of primary carbon metabolites revealed the significantly reduced levels of sucrose and fructose in the mutant leaves, while the glucose content was similar to wild-type plants. Our results suggest that the OsAld-Y participates in Chl accumulation, chloroplast development and plant growth by influencing the photosynthetic rate of leaves and the sugar metabolism of rice.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"peroxisome\\", \\"epidermal cells\\", \\"grana stacks\\", \\"genes\\", \\"chloroplast\\", \\"peroxisomal\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"ygdl-1 mutant\\", \\"energy transduction\\", \\"metabolism\\", \\"plant growth\\", \\"photosynthetic light-harvesting,\\", \\"plant development\\", \\"expression\\", \\"development\\", \\"ygdl-1\\", \\"mutant\\", \\"yellow green and droopy leaf-1\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"fusion protein\\", \\"carotene\\", \\"Chls\\", \\"T-DNA\\", \\"glucose\\", \\"fructose\\", \\"mRNA\\", \\"promoter\\", \\"aldolase\\", \\"GFP\\", \\"OsAld-Y\\", \\"Chlorophyll\\", \\"sugar\\", \\"Chl\\", \\"primary carbon metabolites\\", \\"sucrose\\", \\"chlorophyll\\", \\"fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"yellow-green leaves\\", \\"tobacco\\", \\"wild-type plants\\", \\"leaves\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"accumulation\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"rice\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"Sequence analysis\\", \\"Real-time PCR analysis\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"study\\", \\"analysis\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Although a large fraction of human protein-coding genes and lincRNAs produce more than one mRNA isoform each, the regulation of this phenomenon is still incompletely understood. Much progress has been made in deciphering the role of sequence-specific features as well as DNA-and RNA-binding proteins in alternative splicing. Recently, however, several experimental studies of individual genes have revealed a direct involvement of epigenetic factors in alternative splicing and transcription initiation. While histone modifications are generally correlated with overall gene expression levels, it remains unclear how histone modification enrichment affects relative isoform abundance. Therefore, we sought to investigate the associations between histone modifications and transcript diversity levels measured by the rates of transcription start-site switching and alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale across protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. We found that the relationship between enrichment levels of epigenetic marks and transcription start-site switching is similar for protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. Furthermore, we found associations between splicing rates and enrichment levels of H2az, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K79me2, and H4K20me, marks traditionally associated with enhancers, transcription initiation, transcriptional repression, and others. These patterns were observed in both normal and cancer cell lines. Additionally, we developed a novel computational method that identified 840 epigenetically regulated candidate genes and predicted transcription start-site switching and alternative exon splicing with up to 92% accuracy based on epigenetic patterning alone. Our results suggest that the epigenetic regulation of transcript isoform diversity may be a relatively common genome-wide phenomenon representing an avenue of deregulation in tumor development.Introduction:Molecular processes such as alternative splicing and transcription start-site switching are primary drivers of transcript diversity. About 95% of the ∼23, 000 human genes are estimated to produce more than one mRNA isoform[1]. Beyond the genes with protein-coding potential, recent discoveries suggest that the approximately 8, 000 large intergenic noncoding RNAs( lincRNAs) found in the human genome generate on average 2. 3 isoforms per lincRNA locus[2]. The analysis of transcript diversity regulation has traditionally focused on splicing factors and RNA sequence features such as splicing enhancers and silencers[3],[4]. In recent years, however, experimental studies have expanded to include other regulatory factors such as histone modifications, suggesting that epigenetic features may have the ability not only to determine when and in which tissues certain genes are expressed, but also to influence how these transcripts are processed. Genome-wide analyses indicate that nucleosomes and histone modifications are not randomly distributed, but often coincide with exon boundaries[5]–[7]. This observation, combined with recent evidence that most events of alternative splicing in human cells occur co-transcriptionally[8],[9], strongly suggest a regulatory potential of histone marks[2],[10]. While the connection of epigenetic regulation with overall gene expression has largely been elucidated[11]–[14], it is much less clear whether and how epigenetic marks determine relative isoform abundance. Qualitative and quantitative models have been built to predict expression on the level of genes using histone modification enrichment information alone[15]. Interestingly, a quantitative prediction model based on histone modification enrichment outperforms models based on transcription factor binding[15]. However, a systematic evaluation of the association of epigenetic marks with transcription start-site switching and splicing frequency is still lacking in the literature. Work by Ernst et al.[16],[17], who classified chromatin states to functionally annotate the genome, identified a combination of histone modifications, which were associated with transcription start site and spliced exons. However, since in this work, the histone mark ChIP-seq tag counts were processed into binary presence and absence calls and since isoform abundance was not estimated from the expression data, the critical question remains whether different levels of epigenetic enrichment are associated with the rates of transcription start-site switching and splicing. In addition to elucidating the epigenetic regulation of transcript diversity, further open questions remain. These questions pertain for instance to the genome-wide prevalence of epigenetic regulation of transcript diversity generated via alternative splicing or transcription start-site switching. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent the involvement of epigenetic marks in the regulation of transcript diversity is gene-specific, ie. whether individual genes respond to different histone marks or whether there is a “universal” set of marks for alternative splicing. Several studies aimed at deciphering the association between histone modifications and alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale[18]–[22] but relied solely on gene annotation for the assignment of alterative splicing events rather than on a comprehensive transcription analysis[22], or with no more than three cell lines lacked the breadth of conditions analyzed[18],[19],[21]. Finally, the association of epigenetic patterning with transcript diversity in cancer cells has not been analyzed methodically in a genome-wide manner; however, understanding the prevalence of this phenomenon is of particular importance in cancer where cells are known to undergo vast epigenetic aberrations[23]. Indeed, epigenetically divergent regions in cancer cell lines are enriched for cancer-associated genes( Module S1 in Text S1). Here, we sought to perform a detailed study investigating the association between histone modification enrichments and the processes that influence isoform abundance – transcription start-site switching and splicing – on a genome-wide level( Fig. 1A and Table 1). We further developed a novel approach that identified a set of 840 genes for which transcription start-site switching and splicing was strongly associated with at least one epigenetic mark. We also showed that histone modification enrichment alone can predict exon splicing and transcription start-site switching with up to 92% accuracy in an independent sample set. Our work strongly suggests a broad-scale involvement of epigenetic factors in transcription start-site switching and alternative splicing.Discussion:In this study, we analyzed the association between transcription start-site switching, spliced exon inclusion rates and histone modification patterns across multiple normal and cancer cell lines for protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. Unlike previous studies[8],[16],[17], which established the relationship between epigenetic patterning and gene expression levels, we addressed the association of the epigenetic background of a gene with its transcript isoform diversity. The main difference between ours and previous investigations therefore is that our study investigates relative isoform diversity of expressed genes, and not actual expression levels. We used two approaches to address this issue. The first approach correlated transcriptome-wide( ie “within cell line”) transcription start site inclusion rates and spliced exon inclusion rates with histone enrichment levels. The second approach investigated gene-specific associations between transcription start site inclusion rates, spliced exon inclusion rates and histone enrichment levels. The shortcomings and assumptions made by each method are discussed below. Overall, our study led to four main findings.( i) The role of epigenetic patterning in transcription start-site switching is likely to be common across the genome for both protein-coding genes as well as lincRNAs.( ii) The role of epigenetic patterns in splicing is likely gene-specific, with the exception of H3K36me3( discussed below).( iii) Our gene-specific approach led to the identification of 840 candidate genes whose exon inclusion rates for transcription start-site switching and splicing were strongly associated with patterns of histone modifications.( iv) Lastly, histone modification data alone can be used to predict the inclusion pattern of an exon. Our first and second findings are based on the observation that both transcriptome-wide and gene-specific approaches identified a common set of histone marks that were associated with transcription start-site switching( H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H2az), whereas the results of these two methods differed for the case of splicing. Transcriptome-wide analysis for splicing showed a pronounced association of splicing inclusion rates with H3K36me3 whereas the gene-specific approach identified H2az, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K79me2, and H4K20me1 as significantly associated marks. This discrepancy is likely a result of a bias by the transcriptome-wide approach to detect common genome-wide trends and the gene-specific approach to identify unique relationships for each exon. Observing both common and gene-specific histone marks associated with splicing is in line with the proposed models of epigenetic regulation of splicing: the kinetic model and the chromatin-adaptor model[38]. According to the kinetic model, chromatin structure affects the elongation rate of RNA polymerase, which in turn influences the competition between weak and strong splice sites for the recruitment of splicing factors[38]. The chromatin-adaptor model, on the other hand, describes an interaction between specific histone marks and pre-mRNA molecules through a chromatin-adaptor complex, which aids in the recruitment of splicing factors to pre-mRNA splicing sites[26],[30],[39]. Since these two models are not mutually exclusive, one can imagine H3K36me3, known to be associated with transcription elongation[16],[17], to act as a common factor in splicing genome-wide, while other histone marks can act in a gene-specific manner. Interestingly, histone marks traditionally associated with transcription initiation and transcription repression, such as H3K4me3 and H3K9me3, respectively, were also found in our study to be associated with splicing gene-specifically. This observation is in line with experimental studies describing splicing chromatin-adaptor complex for H3K4me3[40] and for H3K9me3[41]. Further extending the realm of epigenetic regulation of transcript diversity is a recent work by Mercer and colleagues, which presented evidence for the role of 3-dimensional DNA conformation in splicing[42]. According to this study, exons sensitive to DNase I are spatially located close to transcription factories near promoter regions containing initiating Pol II as well as other general transcription and splicing factors. Interestingly, a large fraction of alternatively spliced exons are DNase I sensitive[42]. This finding suggests that the epigenetic background of an exon cannot only interact with splicing factors via chromatin adaptor complexes, but potentially also induce 3-dimensional DNA conformation changes that enhance the likelihood of interactions with general transcription factors, and perhaps thus influence the splicing frequency. This 3-dimensional conformation is likely enhanced via particular sets of histone modifications. Interestingly, our second analysis, testing individual exon across all cell lines, revealed that alternatively spliced exons were frequently associated with different enrichment levels of histone marks well known to be associated with promoters and enhancers, such as H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K9ac[16],[17]( Fig. 7). Accounting for such a 3-dimensional model could further strengthen the association found between histone modification enrichment and transcription start-site switching and splicing, There are however shortcomings to both approaches. The transcriptome-wide method makes two assumptions that may be violated in cells. First, correlating transcription start site inclusion rates and spliced exon inclusion rates with histone mark enrichment assumes that( i) transcript diversity of all genes is associated with their epigenetic background, and additionally( ii) these rates are associated with the same histone modification. Likely, it is for these reasons that the correlations between exon inclusion rates and histone mark enrichment are rather moderate. As mentioned above, however, because of the rapid change of these correlations over short distances from exons and the consistent patterns across multiple cell lines, these associations suggest a genuine relationship. The shortcoming of the gene-specific approach lies in the low statistical power of eleven cell lines analyzed and the natural tendency to miss tissue specific exon behavior. This is particularly the case for lincRNAs, of which 30%, according to recent estimates, have tissue specific expression[2]. Since a large body of experimental data indicates that aberrant splicing of gene transcripts significantly contributes to many areas of cancer biology, including metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle control, invasion and metastasis[43]–[45], it is imperative to further our understanding of the regulatory and/or potentially disruptive role of epigenetic patterning in alternative splicing and transcription start site selection in tumorigenesis. Significant effort has been devoted to the discovery of DNA aberrations that drive cancer progression[35]–[37],[46]; surprisingly, however, there is only a small number of recurrent genomic changes within and across cancer types, with few prominent exceptions[47]–[49]. While the identification of affected pathways rather than individual genes affected by DNA mutations might lead to more informative results, the possibility remains that aberrant phenotypes in cancer are largely driven by the epigenetic component of gene expression and transcript deregulation[23],[50],[51]. Our study identified several histone modifications( H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H4K27ac, H3K36me3, and H3K79me2) that are strongly associated with transcript diversity across multiple independent cell types as well as 840 candidate genes for which there is evidence of epigenetic co-regulation of transcript diversity. Our work represents a step towards identifying the functional consequences of histone modifications on transcript diversity and suggests a rational methodology for the analysis of modern, large-scale datasets, which can be applied to any sample sets.","answer":"Traditionally , the regulation of gene expression was thought to be largely based on DNA and RNA sequence motifs .

Here, we performed a reverse genetic screen in yeast for genes necessary to inactivate TORC1. The screen consisted of monitoring the expression of a TORC1 sensitive GFP-based transcriptional reporter in all yeast deletion strains using flow cytometry. We find that in response to amino acid starvation, but not to carbon starvation or rapamycin treatment, cells lacking NPR2 and NPR3 fail to fully( 1) activate transcription factors Gln3/Gat1,( 2) dephosphorylate TORC1 effector Npr1, and( 3) repress ribosomal protein gene expression. Both mutants show proliferation defects only in media containing a low quality nitrogen source, such as proline or ammonia, whereas no defects are evident when cells are grown in the presence of glutamine or peptone mixture. Proliferation defects in npr2Δ and npr3Δ cells can be completely rescued by artificially inhibiting TORC1 by rapamycin, demonstrating that overactive TORC1 in both strains prevents their ability to adapt to an environment containing a low quality nitrogen source. A biochemical purification of each demonstrates that Npr2 and Npr3 form a heterodimer, and this interaction is evolutionarily conserved since the human homologs of NPR2 and NPR3( NPRL2 and NPRL3, respectively) also co-immunoprecipitate. We conclude that, in yeast, the Npr2/3 complex mediates an amino acid starvation signal to TORC1.Introduction:The Target of Rapamycin( TOR) kinase has emerged as a central processing unit that can incorporate signals from diverse pathways regarding the availability of glucose, oxygen and amino acids[1]. The TOR kinase is a large scaffolding protein-kinase that is highly conserved in all eukaryotes. In recent years, TOR has been shown to nucleate two different multiprotein complexes. In the TOR Complex 1( TORC1), TOR is associated with raptor and mLST8( yeast Kog1 and Lst8, respectively), and its known mammalian phosphorylation targets are p70 S6K1 and 4E-BP1[2]. In the phosphorylated state, both of these substrates are involved in promoting protein translation. In the TORC2, TOR partners with rictor( yeast Avo3), instead of raptor, and mLST8[3],[4]. Mammalian TORC2 phosphorylates AKT protein at Ser473, but not TORC1 substrates[5]. Interestingly, the natural compound rapamycin only inhibits TORC1 when complexed with intracellular protein FKBP12. The inhibition of TORC1 by the treatment of cells with rapamycin leads to a nutrient starvation-like phenotype, in cells ranging from yeast to human[6],[7]. Befitting its ability to process numerous nutritional signals, TORC1 controls a diverse set of effector pathways. In a nutrient rich environment, TORC1 in yeast is responsible for promoting translation initiation, ribosome biogenesis, and anabolic pathways[8]–[10]. Upon nutrient limitation or rapamycin treatment, these processes are inhibited, and the cell initiates macroautophagy, activates enzymes necessary for catabolic processes, and ultimately enters the G0 phase of the cell cycle[1],[11]. In yeast, an active TORC1 controls these processes by preventing several transcription factors from entering the nucleus and activating their target genes. In rich media, transcription factors Gln3/Gat1 are prevented from activating enzymes necessary for nitrogen catabolism, Msn2/4 from inducing stress response, and Rtg1/3 from activating retrograde signaling[12]–[14]. TORC1 controls ribosomal protein( RP) gene expression by excluding corepressor Crf1 from entering the nucleus and inactivating RP gene transcription[15]. While there has been some progress in understanding how glucose, oxygen and energy status are signaled to TORC1[1], the molecular mechanism by which an amino acid starvation leads to TORC1 inactivation is unclear and controversial[16]. An amino acid starvation, just like rapamycin treatment, leads to a rapid dephosphorylation of the mTORC1 effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1[2]. This inactivation was proposed to be dependent on the presence of tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 and TSC2, which form a heterodimer and connect the insulin/IGF-IRS-PI3K-Akt pathway to the mTORC1 kinase[17]. However, other labs have found TSC2 to be unnecessary for this inactivation[18],[19]. Further, organisms that appear to have an amino acid sensitive TORC1, such as S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, do not have homologs of TSC1 and TSC2. hVPS34, encoding a class III PI3-kinase, has been shown to be required for amino acid induced phosphorylation of S6K1[19], and its kinase activity correlates with amino acid levels[20]. However, at this point it is unclear how hVPS34 regulates TORC1[21]. If Vps34 was necessary to maintain active TORC1, then one would expect cells lacking the VPS34 gene to exhibit severe growth defect and mimic rapamycin treatment. Yet, yeast vps34Δ cells grow normally in rich media[22], despite the fact that Vps34 is the only PI3K found in yeast. Also, a recent report was unable to detect defective TORC1 signaling in Vps34 mutant D. melanogaster[23]. With the hypothesis that the genes necessary to inactivate TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation are distinct from the Vps34 pathway and that these genes are not essential for growth under a rich nutrient environment, we sought to screen the yeast deletion collection for genes necessary to inactivate TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation. We devised a GFP-based transcriptional reporter assay where TORC1 activity can be monitored by measuring intracellular GFP content by high throughput flow cytometry. The screen yielded two largely uncharacterized genes, NPR2 and NPR3, and here we demonstrate that they form a heterodimer that is responsible for inactivating TORC1 specifically in response to amino acid starvation.Discussion:In this study we aimed to systematically screen the yeast genome for genes necessary in sensing amino acid starvation. To achieve this goal, we first established a robust flow cytometry-based assay to monitor the expression of a TOR-sensitive transcriptional reporter. We believe a GFP-based readout has three advantages over a luciferase-based readout:( 1) by employing GFP, there is no need to lyse cells;( 2) a fluorescence reading can be obtained for each individual cell, thereby abolishing the need to normalize the signal for the number of cells; and( 3) this assay offers a possibility of more complicated analyses with sub-populations of cells, such as by co-induction of two different fluorescent proteins. Compared to assays where the plate could be scanned, however, performing flow cytometry in a high throughput manner is still time-consuming. It takes about 45 minutes to process each 96 well plate, with the majority of time spent flushing the fluidics system between samples. Using this assay, we found an evolutionarily conserved Npr2/3 complex that is responsible for the inactivation of TORC1 in response to amino acid limitation. In response to amino acid withdrawal, cells missing NPR2 and NPR3 fail to completely inactivate such TORC1 readouts as Npr1 phosphorylation, Gat1 inhibition and ribosome biosynthesis. Correspondingly, these cells are unable to adjust to a growth environment where the nitrogen source is limiting or of poor quality. Our data appear to indicate that the Npr2/3 complex specifically mediates a signal about the low quality/quantity of amino acids since phenotypes associated with NPR2/3 deletion are evident only when cells are grown on nitrogen sources that are sub-optimal for TORC1 activity. For instance, when cells are grown with peptone or glutamine as nitrogen sources, TORC1 is fully active and under those conditions npr2Δ and npr3Δ cells do not exhibit proliferation defects. Under conditions where a lower activity of TORC1 is required, such as in the presence of proline or ammonia, Npr2/3 are responsible for lowering this activity. In the simplest model, the Npr2/3 complex senses the levels of glutamine and inactivates TORC1 when those levels are low. Further studies must determine whether the Npr2/3 complex is itself responsible for sensing intracellular amino acid pools or whether this complex simply mediates the signal. Interestingly, our results indicate that neither protein plays a role in carbon starvation, since in both mutants TORC1 is inhibited when glucose is removed from the media and both mutants proliferate normally under glucose-limiting conditions( Figure 6D). Despite the high degree of conservation, our best efforts to assign an activity or function to either Npr2 or Npr3 were unsuccessful, as neither protein exhibits characteristic domain structures that could predict their cellular function. Our efforts to co-immunoprecipitate TORC1 and Npr2/3 were inconclusive( data not shown). Also, the Tor1/Kog1 complex was unaltered in npr2Δ and npr3Δ cells( data not shown). Further complicating analysis of both proteins is their relatively low abundance in the cell. In fact, in our hands human NPRL2 is detectable in only a few cell lines( data not shown). This has hindered our attempts to purify additional members of the complex, as well as visualize their sub-cellular location. Clearly, further biochemical and genetic approaches are needed to shed light on the mechanistic aspects of their function. Recently, two groups characterized a role Rag GTPases play in activating TORC1 by amino acids in human tissue culture cells and D. melanogaster[39],[40]. These studies demonstrated that Rag GTPases are part of the extended TORC1 complex and that cells expressing constitutively active RagA/B fail to inactivate TORC1 when amino acids are withdrawn. Interestingly, Rag A and RagB are similar to each other and they appear to be orthologus to yeast Gtr1. If yeast Gtr1 was responsible for activating TORC1, then deletion of GTR1 should lead to lethality or at least mimic a rapamycin-like slow proliferation phenotype. Yet, gtr1Δ cells appear normal and don't express the TORC1-sensitive Dal80pr-GFP reporter in rich media( data not shown). This discrepancy could be explained by either a substitution of Gtr1 by another GTPase in yeast, or by a divergence of the amino acid signaling pathway to TORC1 between metazoans and yeast. By a similar token, yeast Vps34 did not emerge from our screen as a regulator of TORC1( see Introduction). Further studies must examine the role of Rag GTPases in lower eukaryotes and whether the Npr2/3 complex is functionally conserved in higher eukaryotes. Keeping with the conserved nature of TORC1 and its regulation by amino acids, it would be exciting if a unifying mechanism emerges. Except for mTOR itself, many of the upstream and downstream components of the mTOR pathway are known to be either proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors[1]. Interestingly, early reports have implicated NPRL2 as a tumor suppressor gene. NPRL2 is located on the human chromosome 3p21. 3 homozygous deletion region[41], a region that is deleted in various human cancers[42]. Further, reintroduction of NPRL2 into these cells inhibits cell proliferation both in cell lines and in human lung cancer mouse models[43],[44]. Human NPRL2-null cells and yeast npr2Δ cells both have been shown to exhibit resistance to cisplatin[44], suggesting functional conservation and raising the possibility that NPRL2 might act as a repressor of mTORC1. It remains to be determined whether a mutation in NPRL2 is truly the driver mutation that gives rise to neoplastic growth via overactive mTORC1, but a high mTORC1 activity has certainly been ascribed to invasive tumors[45]. Further, as cancer cells with hyperactive mTORC1, either due to loss of PTEN or TSC1/2, have been shown to be particularly sensitive to rapamycin treatment[46],[47], we speculate that cancer cells with mutated NPRL2 might also be particularly sensitive to rapamycin. Also, since both Npr2 and Npr3 are necessary for inactivation of TORC1 in yeast, it would be interesting to examine whether a deletion of human NPRL3 also correlates with tumorigenesis. In conclusion, here we report the discovery of a novel, conserved Npr2/3 complex that specifically inactivates TORC1 in response to amino acid limitation in yeast. Inactivation of TORC1 is important for adaptation to an environment with scarce amino acids, since diminished TORC1 activity leads to activation of amino acid permeases and catabolic enzymes, repression of ribosomal protein gene expression, and induction of macroautophagy. Cells lacking NPR2 or NPR3 are unable to inactivate TORC1, and they fail to thrive in nitrogen challenged environment as a result. These results demonstrate a unique way by which the cells respond to nutrient limitation, and this complex provides a fertile ground to study the regulation of this important pathway.","answer":"Before a eukaryotic cell commits to cell division it must be large enough so that both daughter cells would be of viable size .

The first part of the algorithm produces a cover tree for a dataset using an adaptive threshold that is based on multi-scale local principal component analysis. The resulting cover tree nodes reflect the local geometry of the space and are organized via a scaffolding graph. In the second part of the algorithm, the goals are to uncover the strata that make up the underlying stratified space using a local dimension estimation procedure and topological data analysis, as well as to ultimately visualize the results in a simplified spine graph. We demonstrate our technique on several synthetic examples and then use it to visualize song structure in musical audio data.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The objective of this paper is to show that point cloud data can under certain circumstances be clustered by strata in a plausible way. For our purposes, we consider a stratified space to be a collection of manifolds of different dimensions which are glued together in a locally trivial manner inside some Euclidean space. To adapt this abstract definition to the world of noise, we first define a multi-scale notion of stratified spaces, providing a stratification at different scales which are indexed by a radius parameter. We then use methods derived from kernel and cokernel persistent homology to cluster the data points into different strata. We prove a correctness guarantee for this clustering method under certain topological conditions. We then provide a probabilistic guarantee for the clustering for the point sample setting -- we provide bounds on the minimum number of sample points required to state with high probability which points belong to the same strata. Finally, we give an explicit algorithm for the clustering.[2]: A framework for the regularized and robust estimation of non-uniform dimensionality and density in high dimensional noisy data is introduced in this work. This leads to learning stratifications, that is, mixture of manifolds representing different characteristics and complexities in the data set. The basic idea relies on modeling the high dimensional sample points as a process of translated Poisson mixtures, with regularizing restrictions, leading to a model which includes the presence of noise. The translated Poisson distribution is useful to model a noisy counting process, and it is derived from the noise-induced translation of a regular Poisson distribution. By maximizing the log-likelihood of the process counting the points falling into a local ball, we estimate the local dimension and density. We show that the sequence of all possible local countings in a point cloud formed by samples of a stratification can be modeled by a mixture of different translated Poisson distributions, thus allowing the presence of mixed dimensionality and densities in the same data set. With this statistical model, the parameters which best describe the data, estimated via expectation maximization, divide the points in different classes according to both dimensionality and density, together with an estimation of these quantities for each class. Theoretical asymptotic results for the model are presented as well. The presentation of the theoretical framework is complemented with artificial and real examples showing the importance of regularized stratification learning in high dimensional data analysis in general and computer vision and image analysis in particular.[3]: We introduce a Bayesian model for inferring mixtures of subspaces of different dimensions. The key challenge in such a mixture model is specification of prior distributions over subspaces of different dimensions. We address this challenge by embedding subspaces or Grassmann manifolds into a sphere of relatively low dimension and specifying priors on the sphere. We provide an efficient sampling algorithm for the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We illustrate that a simple extension of our mixture of subspaces model can be applied to topic modeling. We also prove posterior consistency for the mixture of subspaces model. The utility of our approach is demonstrated with applications to real and simulated data.","answer":"Many papers ( [2] , for example) have analyzed stratified spaces as mixtures of general manifolds, and one [3] as a union of flats. Using techniques derived mostly from Gaussian Mixture Models in the former, and Grassmanian methods in the latter, they prove theoretical guarantees about when a point belongs to a maximal stratum, but they do not say much about the singularities. Other work [1] uses topological data analysis to make theoretically-backed inferences about the singularities themselves; however, the algorithms are too slow to be practical."},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Our experiments cover various types of adversarial attacks applied to different network architectures and datasets.When network models are tampered with backdoor or error-injection attacks, our results demonstrate that the path connection learned using limited amount of bonafide data can effectively mitigate adversarial effects while maintaining the original accuracy on clean data.Therefore, mode connectivity provides users with the power to repair backdoored or error-injected models.  We also use mode connectivity to investigate the loss landscapes of regular and robust models against evasion attacks.Experiments show that there exists a barrier in adversarial robustness loss on the path connecting regular and adversarially-trained models.  A high correlation is observed between the adversarial robustness loss and the largest eigenvalue of the input Hessian matrix, for which theoretical justifications are provided.  Our results suggest that mode connectivity offers a holistic tool and practical means for evaluating and improving adversarial robustness.Recent studies on mode connectivity show that two independently trained deep neural network (DNN) models with the same architecture and loss function can be connected on their loss landscape using a high-accuracy/low-loss path characterized by a simple curve (Garipov et al., 2018; Gotmare et al., 2018; Draxler et al., 2018) .This insight on the loss landscape geometry provides us with easy access to a large number of similar-performing models on the low-loss path between two given models, and Garipov et al. (2018) use this to devise a new model ensembling method.Another line of recent research reveals interesting geometric properties relating to adversarial robustness of DNNs (Fawzi et al., 2017; 2018; Wang et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2018 ).An adversarial data or model is defined to be one that is close to a bonafide data or model in some space, but exhibits unwanted or malicious behavior.Motivated by these geometric perspectives, in this study, we propose to employ mode connectivity to study and improve adversarial robustness of DNNs against different types of threats.A DNN can be possibly tampered by an adversary during different phases in its life cycle.For example, during the training phase, the training data can be corrupted with a designated trigger pattern associated with a target label to implant a backdoor for trojan attack on DNNs (Gu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018) .During the inference phase when a trained model is deployed for task-solving, prediction-evasive attacks are plausible (Biggio & Roli, 2018; Goodfellow et al., 2015) , even when the model internal details are unknown to an attacker (Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018) .In this research, we will demonstrate that by using mode connectivity in loss landscapes, we can repair backdoored or error-injected DNNs.We also show that mode connectivity analysis reveals the existence of a robustness loss barrier on the path connecting regular and adversarially-trained models.We motivate the novelty and benefit of using mode connectivity for mitigating training-phase adversarial threats through the following practical scenario: as training DNNs is both time-and resource-consuming, it has become a common trend for users to leverage pre-trained models released in the public domain 1 .Users may then perform model fine-tuning or transfer learning with a small set of bonafide data that they have.However, publicly available pre-trained models may carry an unknown but significant risk of tampering by an adversary.It can also be challenging to detect this tampering, as in the case of a backdoor attack 2 , since a backdoored model will behave like a regular model in the absence of the embedded trigger.Therefore, it is practically helpful to provide tools to users who wish to utilize pre-trained models while mitigating such adversarial threats.We show that our proposed method using mode connectivity with limited amount of bonafide data can repair backdoored or error-injected DNNs, while greatly countering their adversarial effects.Our main contributions are summarized as follows:• For backdoor and error-injection attacks, we show that the path trained using limited bonafide data connecting two tampered models can be used to repair and redeem the attacked models, thereby resulting in high-accuracy and low-risk models.The performance of mode connectivity is significantly better than several baselines including fine-tuning, training from scratch, pruning, and random weight perturbations.We also provide technical explanations for the effectiveness of our path connection method based on model weight space exploration and similarity analysis of input gradients for clean and tampered data.• For evasion attacks, we use mode connectivity to study standard and adversarial-robustness loss landscapes.We find that between a regular and an adversarially-trained model, training a path with standard loss reveals no barrier, whereas the robustness loss on the same path reveals a barrier.This insight provides a geometric interpretation of the \\"no free lunch\\" hypothesis in adversarial robustness (Tsipras et al., 2019; Dohmatob, 2018; Bubeck et al., 2019) .We also provide technical explanations for the high correlation observed between the robustness loss and the largest eigenvalue of the input Hessian matrix on the path.• Our experimental results on different DNN architectures (ResNet and VGG) and datasets (CIFAR-10 and SVHN) corroborate the effectiveness of using mode connectivity in loss landscapes to understand and improve adversarial robustness.We also show that our path connection is resilient to the considered adaptive attacks that are aware of our defense.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes using mode connectivity approaches for adversarial robustness.2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKThis paper provides novel insights on adversarial robustness of deep neural networks through the lens of mode connectivity in loss landscapes.Leveraging mode connectivity between model optima, we show that path connection trained by a limited number of clean data can successfully repair backdoored or error-injected models and significantly outperforms several baseline methods.Moreover, we use mode connectivity to uncover the existence of robustness loss barrier on the path trained by standard loss against evasion attacks.We also provide technical explanations for the effectiveness of our proposed approach and theoretically justify the empirically observed high correlation between robustness loss and the largest eigenvalue of input Hessian.Our findings are consistent and validated on different network architectures and datasets.The performance of regular path connection of untampered models on SVHN with ResNet is presented in Figure A1 .Inference on training set Inference on test set Legend Figure A1 : Loss and error rate on the path connecting two untampered ResNet models trained on SVHN.The path connection is trained using different settings as indicated by the curve colors.The inference results on test set are evaluated using 5000 samples, which are separate from what are used for path connection.","answer":"A novel approach using mode connectivity in loss landscapes to mitigate adversarial effects, repair tampered models and evaluate adversarial robustness"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The in vitro transendothelial migration of circulating filarial antigen-specific T-cells was examined in Wuchereria banerofti infection. Circulating T-cells from individuals with filaria-induced lymphatic pathology (LP) had significantly greater migration through unstimulated HUVEC monolayers than did T-cells from asymptomatic infected (MF) individuals (P = 0. 04). In contrast to the MF individuals where no effect was seen, transendothelial migration of 48-hr filarial antigen stimulated T-cells from LP individuals was significantly (P = 0. 01) greater than migration of 48-hr media-stimulated T-cells. In six of seven patients examined, inhibition of the VLA-4 / VCAM-1 pathway resulted in greater than 50% inhibition of transendothelial migration of T-cells.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"T - cells\\", \\"HUVEC monolayers\\", \\"circulating filarial antigen - specific T - cells\\", \\"filarial antigen stimulated T - cells\\", \\"T - lymphocytes\\", \\"Circulating T - cells\\", \\"media - stimulated T - cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"VCAM - 1\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Hydrogermylation<p>The addition of hydrogermanes across multiple carboncarbon bonds typically relies on the activation of the Ge-H bond by transition metal complexes (mainly Pd, Ru, Rh, and Pt) 1 or radical initiators such as Et3B/O2 and AIBN. 2 Recently, a new generation of catalysts based on earth-abundant first-row transition metal carbonyl complexes of Fe, 3 Mn 4 , and Co 5 have also attracted considerable attention. Moreover, hydrogermylation of alkynes 6 as well as transfer hydrogermylation of alkenes 7 have been successfully achieved using transition metal-free, boron-containing catalyst: B(C6F5)3. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no report on the use of commercially available alkali metal trialkylborohydrides in this process. The position of germanium between silicon and tin in group 14 of the periodic table causes organogermanium compounds to exhibit properties similar to those of organosilicon and organotin compounds, however, the synthetic chemistry of this element is still in its infancy, and therefore, organogermanes have not received significant attention. 8 On the other hand, organogermanes have found use as essential cross-coupling partners in selective carbon−carbon bond formation reactions to circumvent the limitations of traditional organometallic reagents. Recent progress in the application of organogermanes has been outlined in the work of Schoenebeck and Fricke, who have shown that organogermanium compounds possess unique and complementary reactivity in relation to that of other organometallic coupling agents, paving the way for their further interesting applications in organic synthesis. 9 We have already reported that NaHBEt3 can be used as a catalyst for Markovnikov selective hydrosilylation of aromatic alkenes 10,11 and dehydrogenative silylation of terminal alkynes. 12 NaHBEt3 has also been demonstrated by Thomas and coworkers to catalyze hydroboration of phenylacetylene with pinacolborane to give (E)-styryl boronic ester. 13 Given the growing interest in application of organogermanes in organic synthesis and the mechanistic similarity of the hydrosilylation and hydroboration to already known occurrences of hydrogermylation, we decided to study the reactivity of alkali metal triethylborohydrides in the presence of aromatic alkenes and primary and secondary germanes to examine the impact of these commonly used reductants on the course of the hydrogermylation process. Driven by previous successful experiments in hydrosilylation, we initialized the research on hydrogermylation by screening the catalytic activity of different trialkylborohydrides in a reaction of diphenylgermane with styrene. Also as previously, toluene has been used as a solvent and reactions were carried out for 20 hours at 100 °C. The first experiments unfolded unexpectedly, producing diphenyl (2phenylethyl) germane exclusively, a product of opposite regioselectivity compared to hydrosilylation (Scheme 2). Scheme 2. Opposite selectivity of hydrosilylation and hydrogermylation under the same conditions.</p><p>Out of several commercially available trialkylborohydrides, i.e. LiHBEt3, NaHBEt3, NaH(sec-Bu)3, and KHBEt3, it was the third one that exhibited the best selectivity and reactivity. As observed also in other research, lithium triethylborohydride turned out to promote unwanted side reactions, whereas its potassium congener led to formation of heavier products of consequent hydrogermylation (higher-order products). Decreasing the amount of sodium tri(sec-butyl)borohydride resulted in a decrease in conversion of diphenylgermane, and thus a loading of 10% has been maintained in the subsequent experiments. Several conjugated aromatic alkenes were hydrogermylated by phenyl-and diphenylgermane, as shown in the Chart 1. It is worth noting that tri(n-butyl)germane was inactive under the conditions used in this research. The isolation of adducts of phenylgermane turned out to be challenging. The instability of PhGeRH2 towards hydrolysis precluded chromatographic purification methods, as most of these products could not be retrieved from the chromatography column, even when silanised silica was used as a stationary phase. These compounds were identified only by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It was, however, possible to purify six exemplary compounds, whose analysis further confirmed that hydrogermylation aided by tri(sec-butyl)borohydride yields products with anti-Markovnikov selectivity. Among those was the product of hydrogermylation of 2-vinylnaphthalene with phenylgermane, 6. To better explain these findings, we turned to the theoretical simulation of possible reaction pathways by means of DFT methods. ‡ It appeared natural to begin the theoretical investigation with an approach described in our previous research. 11 After initial calculations (for details, see SI), the conclusion was drawn that regardless of the final regioselectivity, the reaction was initiated by a nucleophilic attack of a NaHBMe3 hydride anion on the terminal carbon atom of styrene (Chart 2, M superscript), which is preferred over the attack at the benzylic carbon (aM superscript). The observations for phenylgermane are almost identical as for phenylsilane.</p><p>Chart 1. Products of NaHB(s-Bu)3 assisted hydrogermylation.</p><p>the methodology applied in this study. Despite its coherency, this mechanism cannot be applied to hydrogermylation since its occurrence would result in the formation of Markovnikov products. Instead, the reaction pathway that should be discussed (Chart 3), proceeds after sodium dihydro(phenyl)germanide VII is formed. This species attacks a styrene molecule at the terminal carbon atom and produces a carbanion (IX-XI). The latter is again a secondary, resonance-stabilized one. This time, however, the germanium atom is at the anti-Markovnikov position. The final product XV is released after this carbanion abstracts a hydrogen cation from phenylgermane (XII-XIV) and regenerates sodium dihydro(phenyl)germanide for the next cycle. The analysis of Chart 3 delivers a precise explanation for the anti-Markovnikov mode of reaction between phenylgermane and styrene. Starting from V, a barrier of only ca. 11.5 kcal/mol (VI) has to be overcome to generate NaPhGeH2 (VII). This step can be seen as essentially irreversible as the reverse reaction would require ca. 30 kcal/mol. The cycle itself includes two transition states: a relative 16.5 kcal/mol one of styrene activation X, and a 13 kcal/mol one of sodium dihydro(phenyl)germanide regeneration XIII. the former is much lower than activation of styrene by NaHBMe3 (23 kcal/mol) and provides a convincing explanation for the anti-Markovnikov mode of reaction. Gibbs free energy profiles display similar features for diphenylgermane (for details, see SI). The mode of initial generation of the essential sodium dihydro(phenyl)germanide has found further support in an experiment showing that increase in the amount of NaHB(sec-Bu)3 resulted in proportional increase of the amount of ethylbenzene formed.</p><p>Chart 2. Energy profiles calculated for possible hydrogermylation pathways analogous to already published hydrosilylation mechanism.</p>","answer":"Sodium trialkylborohydrides were found to be selective catalysts for the hydrogermylation of aromatic alkenes. Addition of phenylgermane and diphenylgermane in the presence of 10 mol% of NaHB(sec-Bu)3 proceeded in a highly selective manner to givein contrast to the analogous hydrosilylation process -β-germylated products. The nature of this process was explained with the aid of DFT calculations and it was proposed that the mechanism proceeds via a trisubstituted germanide anion whose attack on the terminal vinyl carbon is the source of selectivity.Hydrogermylation of terminal alkenes and alkynes (Scheme 1) is a powerful transformation for catalytic synthesis of organogermanes.Chart 3. DFT energy calculation of the most possible pathway of anti-Markovnikov hydrogermylation in the presence of alkali metal trialkylborohydrides.Altogether, we have demonstrated that sodium tri(sec-butyl)borohydride is a good initiator of anti-Markovnikov selective hydrogermylation of conjugated aromatic alkenes. It is not, however, a catalyst of this process, since the reaction proceeds via a germanide anion, which is regenerated in the last step, and no borohydride moiety is further needed. This can result in the conclusion that hydrogermylation in this reaction system can be seen as a 'living' process.Scheme 3.

(2006) .A subsequent result of this theory is that the set of functions generated by a Gaussian process regression with an appropriate kernel can approximate any continuous function over a hypercube with arbitrary precision.Although multivariate polynomials and Gaussian processes also have this approximation property, each has practical limitations that cause neural networks to be used more often in practice compared to these approaches.For instance, polynomial interpolations may result a model that overfits to the data and suffers from a poor generalization, and Gaussian processes often become computationally intractable for a large number of training data Bernardo et al..Neural networks, with an efficient structure for gradient computation using backpropagation, can be trained using gradient based optimization for large datasets in a tractable time.Moreover, in contrast to existing polynomial interpolations, neural networks generalize well in practice.Theoretical and empirical understanding of the generalization power of neural networks is an ongoing research Novak et al. (2018) ; Neyshabur et al. (2017) .Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a geometric approach for data analysis, is a growing field which provides statistical and algorithmic methods to analyze the topological structures of data often referred to as point clouds.TDA methods mainly relied on deterministic methods until recently where w l,0 w l,1 ...... statistical approaches were proposed for this purpose Carriere et al. (2017); Chazal & Michel (2017) .In general, TDA methods assume a point cloud in a metric space with an inducing distance (e.g. Euclidean, Hausdorff, or Wasserstein distance) between samples and build a topological structure upon point clouds.The topological structure is then used to extract geometric information from data Chazal & Michel (2017) .These models are not trained with gradient based approaches and they are generally limited to predetermined algorithms whose application to high dimensional spaces may be challenging Chazal (2016) .In this work, by leveraging geometrical perspective of TDA, we provide a class of restricted neural networks that preserve the universal approximation property and can be trained using a forward pass and the backpropagation algorithm.Motivated by the approximation theorem used to develop our method, Simplicial Complex Network (SCN) is chosen to refer these models.SCNs do not require an activation function and architecture search in the way that conventional neural networks do.Their hidden units are conceptually well defined, in contrast to feed-forward neural networks for which the role of a hidden unit is yet an ongoing problem.SCNs are discussed in more details in later sections.Our contribution can be summarized in building a novel class of neural networks which we believe can be used in the future for developing deep models that are interpretable, and robust to perturbations.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is specified for the explanation of SCNs and their training procedure.In section 3, related works are explained.Sections 4, 5, and 6 are specified to experiments, limitations, and conclusion.In this work, we have used techniques from topological data analysis to build a class of neural network architectures with the universal approximation property which can be trained using the common neural network training framework.Topological data analysis methods are based on the geometrical structure of the data and have strong theoretical analysis.SCNs are made using the geometrical view of TDA and we believe that they can be used as a step towards building interpretable deep learning models.Most of the experiments in the paper are synthetic.More practical applications of the paper is considered as an immediate continual work.Moreover, throughout this work, bias functions of the simplest kinds (constant parameters) were used.We mentioned earlier that a bias function may be an arbitrary function of its input to keep the universal approximation property of SCNs.A natural idea is to use common neural network architectures as the bias function.In this case, backpropagation can be continued to the bias function parameters as well.This is also considered as another continuation of this work.","answer":"A novel method for supervised learning through subdivisioning the input space along with function approximation."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is overexpressed in cancer cells and is therefore a putative cancer target. Inhibition of this enzyme is considered an important strategy for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents with a specific mechanism of action. Organotin compounds have been described as experimental antitumor agents, yet their mechanism of action remains largely unknown. Based on the outcome of a virtual screening study, various di- and tri-n-butyltin(IV) carboxylates were synthesized, and their biological properties were evaluated. All synthesized compounds were able to inhibit TrxR selectively within the micromolar range and showed potent antitumor activity against HT-29 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines. Moreover, tin(IV) organometallics were found to strongly induce apoptosis in the BJAB lymphoma cell line. Mass spectrometry and atomic absorption spectroscopy experiments revealed metal binding to proteins, and efficient cellular uptake was observed using a di-n-butyltin(IV) complex as an example.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"tin(IV)\\", \\"di- and tri-n-butyltin(IV) carboxylates\\", \\"di-n-butyltin(IV)\\", \\"Butyltin(IV) benzoates\\", \\"Organotin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Establishment of an accurate and easy method for detection of these viruses is essential for the prevention and treatment of associated infectious diseases. Currently, ELISA and IFA are the methods which are clinically-available for the detection of encephalitis viral antigens, but they could only detect one pathogen in one assay [2, 3] . There are a variety of different methods available for identifying multiple antigens in one sample simultaneously, such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , protein chip, mass spectrometry, and suspension array technology [4] [5] [6] . However, the application of these techniques on pathogen detection is still in an early phase, perhaps due to the complicated use and high cost. Antibody arrays for simultaneous multiple antigen quantification are considered the most accurate methods [7] [8] [9] [10] . Liew [11] validated one multiplex ELISA for the detection of 9 antigens; Anderson [12] used microarray ELISA for multiplex detection of antibodies to tumor antigens in breast cancer, and demonstrated that ELISA-based array assays had the broadest dynamic range and lowest sample volume requirements compared with the other assays. However, the application of ELISA-based arrays is currently limited to detection of cancer markers or interleukins; no detection of pathogens has been reported. In this study, we developed an ELISA-based array for the simultaneous detection of five encephalitis viruses. Seven specific monoclonal antibodies were prepared against five encephalitis viruses and used to establish an ELISA-array assay. The assay was validated using cultured viruses and inoculated chicken eggs with patient sera. The results demonstrated that this method combined the advantage of ELISA and protein array (multiplex and ease of use) and has potential for the identification of clinical encephalitis virus. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared from hybridoma cell lines constructed by Prof. Zhu et al. Purification was conducted by immunoaffinity chromatography on protein G affinity sepharose [13] . Specific monoclonal antibodies (4D5 against JEV, 2B5 against TBEV, 1F1 against SV, 2B8 against serotype 2 DV, 4F9 against serotype 4 DV, 4E11 against EEEV, and 2A10 against Flavivirus) were selected for this study. All of the antibodies were raised according to standard procedures. Using 4D5, 2B5, 1F1, 2B8, 4F9, and 4E11 as capture antibodies, detection antibodies (2A10, 1 F1, and 4E11) were coupled to biotin-NHS ester(Pierce, Germany) at 4°C for 3 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated biotin was removed by Desalt spin column (Pierce). Immunologic reactions were reported by Streptavidin-HRP (CWBIO, Beijing, China) and Super Signal ELISA Femto Maximum sensitive substrate. Purified goat-anti mouse antibody was used as a positive control. JEV and DV were cultured in C6/36 cells; SV, TBEV, and EEEV were cultured in BHK-21 cells. The culture of TBEV and EEEV was conducted in biosafety level 3 facility, however, JEV, DV and SV were conducted in biosafety level 2 facility. Viral titers were determined by the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) method. All the cultures were inactivated by 0.025% β-propionolactone at 4°C overnight, then 37°C for 1 h to decompose β-propionolactone. Antibodies were spotted using a BIODOT machine (BD6000;California, USA) on ELISA plates (30 nl/dot). The plates were blocked with 3% BSA-PBS in 37°C for 1 h, followed by washing 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 2 min each. Then, the plates were dried, sealed, and stored at 4°C before use [11] . When spotting, different spotting buffers and concentrations of capture monoclonal antibodies were evaluated to optimize the ELISA-array assay. The optimization was evaluated by dot morphology and signal intensity. The tested spotting buffers included 1 × phosphate buffer saline (PBS), PBS +20% glycerol, and 1 × PBS + 20% glycerol+0.004% Triton-X100. A range of monoclonal antibody concentrations (0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml) were compared. Following a double antibody sandwich format, printed plates were incubated sequentially with inactivated viral cultures, biotin-labeled detecting antibody, HPR-labeled avidin, and substrate, followed by signal evaluation. Antigen binding was performed in PBS(containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% FCS) at 37°C for 2 h, followed by washing 3 times(1 × PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20). Incubation of ELISA plates with biotinylated detecting antibody cocktails was performed in PBS (containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% FCS) at 37°C for 2 h. After washing, specific binding of the detecting antibodies was reported by streptavidin-HRP and stained with Super Signal ELISA Femto Maximum sensitive substrate (Thermo scientific, Rockford, USA) [11, 14, 15] . Visualization of the plate was performed in AE 1000 cool CCD image analyzer(Beijing BGI GBI Biotech Company., LTD, China). The signal intensity and background of each spot was read out and recorded with \\"Monster\\"software. The positive signals were defined as a signal value > 400 and a signal value (sample)/signal value (negative) > 2. The identical antibodies used in the ELISA-array format were also tested in a conventional ELISA format to determine the difference in sensitivity and specificity of the two methods. The conventional ELISAs were performed at the same time as the ELISA-array assays to ensure similar reaction conditions. The conventional ELISAs were performed in an identical maner to the ELISA-array, except that antibodies were coated at a concentration of 2 μg/mL in PBS (pH 7.4), and substrate TMB was used instead of Super Signal ELISA Femto Maximum sensitive substrate [16, 17] . Three serum samples were collected from patients with nervous system symptoms and histories of tick bites. The serum samples were treated with penicillin and streptomycin, then inoculated into the allantoic cavities of chicken eggs. 3 days later, the liquid was collected and divided into two portions (one for inactivation and one for RNA extraction). The RNA and inactivated samples were stored at -70°C before use. RNA was extracted from the inoculated chicken eggs using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All RNA extraction procedures were conducted at BSL-3 facilities. The primers and probes were used as previously described [18] . The real-time RT-PCR was conducted with a Quti-teck q-RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen Inc,). The reaction consisted of 10 μL of 2 × reaction buffer (0.2 μL reverse transcription enzyme, and 250 nmol/l primers and probes). RNA and deionized water were added to a final volume of 20 μl. PCR was performed with a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche, Switzerland) [19] . Optimization of the ELISA-array assayThe spotted array layout is depicted in Figure 1 and the efficacy of three different spotting buffers on the quality of the printed ELISA-arrays were investigated by spot morphology observation and signal intensity comparison. The spotting concentration of the capture antibodies varied from 0.2 to 0.0125 mg/ml (each was serially diluted 2-fold). The efficacy of the spotting concentration of the capture antibodies was evaluated by virus culture detection, the proper spotting concentration was determined by a combination of minimized cross reaction and higher signal intensity. Figure 1 illustrates the array layout and Figure 2 demonstrates the result of the three spotting buffers and spot concentration of antibody 2B5 by TBE virus culture detection. Cross reaction detection was also conducted by applying JEV, YF, and DV cultures. Spot morphology observation (Figures 2a, b , and 2c) demonstrated that spotting buffer containing PBS with 20% glycerol produced tailed spot morphology; buffers containing PBS alone and PBS with 20% glycerol +0.004% Triton-X100 gave good spot morphology (round and full). Buffers containing PBS with 20% glycerol and PBS with 20% glycerol+0.004% Triton-X100 produced higher signal intensities than PBS alone. Thus, PBS with 20% glycerol+0.004% Triton-X100 was adopted as the optimized spotting buffer for subsequent experiments. Simultaneously, the spot concentration evaluation suggested that 0.05 mg/ml was optimal. At this concentration, the signal intensity was higher and the cross-reaction did not appear (Figure 2d ). Consequently, spotting concentration optimization of other capture antibodies (4D5, 1F1, 4E11, and 2B8) demonstrated that 0.05 mg/ml was also suitable(data not shown). The optimized ELISA array layout is shown in Figure  3 , which was applied in the following experiments. Successful detection of viral pathogens requires a test with high sensitivity and specificity. To evaluate the performance of the designed antibody arrays, the specificity and sensitivity of the individual analytes were examined. By testing serially-diluted viral cultures, including DV-2, DV-4, JEV, TBE, SV, and EEEV, the sensitivity of ELISAarray and the identical conventional ELISA were compared ( Table 1 ). The detection limit of the two methods was compared and demonstrated. The cross-reactivity test was conducted using BHK-21 and vero cell lysate, Yellow fever virus (YFV) cultures (5 × 10 5 TCID 50 /ml, West Nile virus(WNV) cultures(2 × 10 6 TCID 50 /ml), and Western equine encephalitis virus(1 × 10 7 TCID 50 /ml). The results demonstrated that neither the ELISA-array nor traditional ELISA displayed cross-reactivity. Equal volumes of cultured TBEV, JEV, DV-2, DV-4, SV, and EEEV were prepared for single sample detection; two or three of the cultures were mixed for multiplex detection. A cocktail of biotin conjugated antibody (2A10, 4E11, and 1F1) was used in all tests. The results demonstrated that for all virus combinations, each virus was detected specifically, with no false-positive or-negative results (Figures 4 and 5) . Chicken eggs inoculated with infected human serum were used for validation of the ELISA-array assay. All samples showed high reaction signals with capture antibody 2B5, which was specific for TBEV ( Figure 6b ). The ELISA-array assay suggested that the three patients were all infected with TBEV. To verify the results tested by ELISA-array, RNA extracted from chicken eggs was applied to a real time-RT-PCR assay using primers and probes targeting TBEV. The results were also positive (Figure 6a) . The consensus detection results confirmed that the ELISAarray assay was reliable. To be widely used in the clinical setting, the detection system should be easy to use and can be performed by untrained staff with little laboratory and experimental experience. Moreover, when the volume of the clinical samples is limited and an increasing number of pathogens per sample needs to be tested, the detecting system should be high-throughput to allow detection of multiple pathogens simultaneously [6, 20, 21] . Multiple detection, easy to use, and affordability are requirements for detection methods in the clinical setting. Thus, an ELISA-array, which combines the advantages of ELISA and protein array, meets the above requirements. It has been reported that an ELISA-array has been used in the diagnosis of cancer and auto-allergic disease [7, 12] ; however, No study has reported the detection of viral pathogens. In this study, we developed a multiplex ELISA-based method in a double-antibody sandwich format for the simultaneous detection of five encephalitis-associated viral pathogens. The production of a reliable antibody chip for identification of microorganisms requires careful screening of capture of antibodies [14] . Cross-reactivity must be minimized and the affinity of the antibody is as important as the specificity. First, we prepared and screened 23 monoclonal antibodies against eight viruses and verified the specificity and affinity to the target viruses by an immunofluorescence assay. Then, the antibodies were screened by an ELISA-array with a double-antibody sandwich ELISA format. The antibodies which produced cross-reactivity and low-positive signals were excluded. Finally, six antibodies were selected as capture antibodies. Another monoclonal antibody, 2A10, which could specifically react with all viruses in the genus Flavivirus was used for detecting antibody against DV, JEV, and TBEV. For the detection of EEEV and SV, although the detecting and trapping antibodies were the same (1F1 and 4E11, respectively), the antibodies produced excellent positive signals. The epitope was not defined; however, we suspect that the antibodies both target the surface of the virions. As one virion exits as, many with the same epitope appear, thus no interference occurred using the same antibody in the double-antibody sandwich format assay. Currently, the availability of antibodies suitable for an array format diagnostic assay is a major problem. In the ELISA-array assay, this problem exists as well. Because of the limitation of available antibodies, this assay could only detect 5 pathogens. In the future, with increasing numbers of suitable antibodies, especially specific antibodies against Flavivirus, this ELISAarray might be able to test more pathogens and be of greater potential use. To make the assay more amenable to multiple virus detection, the assay protocol was optimized. In addition to the dotting buffer, the capture antibody concentration and the different virus inactivation methods (heating and β-propiolactone) were also compared and evaluated.Question: What kinds of viruses are Japanese encephalitis virus(JEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus(TBEV), eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), sindbis virus(SV), and dengue virus(DV)?","answer":"arboviruses"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMO1, a high mobility group B (HMGB) protein, associates with the rRNA locus and with the promoters of many ribosomal protein genes (RPGs). Here, the Sos recruitment system was used to show that HMO1 interacts with TBP and the N-terminal domain (TAND) of TAF1, which are integral components of TFIID. Biochemical studies revealed that HMO1 copurifies with TFIID and directly interacts with TBP but not with TAND. Deletion of HMO1 (Deltahmo1) causes a severe cold-sensitive growth defect and decreases transcription of some TAND-dependent genes. Deltahmo1 also affects TFIID occupancy at some RPG promoters in a promoter-specific manner. Interestingly, over-expression of HMO1 delays colony formation of taf1 mutants lacking TAND (taf1DeltaTAND), but not of the wild-type strain, indicating a functional link between HMO1 and TAND. Furthermore, Deltahmo1 exhibits synthetic growth defects in some spt15 (TBP) and toa1 (TFIIA) mutants while it rescues growth defects of some sua7 (TFIIB) mutants. Importantly, Deltahmo1 causes an upstream shift in transcriptional start sites of RPS5, RPS16A, RPL23B, RPL27B and RPL32, but not of RPS31, RPL10, TEF2 and ADH1, indicating that HMO1 may participate in start site selection of a subset of class II genes presumably via its interaction with TFIID.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"TAF1\\", \\"RPS31\\", \\"RPL27B\\", \\"ADH1\\", \\"TFIIB\\", \\"RPG\\", \\"RPL23B\\", \\"Sos\\", \\"TBP\\", \\"RPL32\\", \\"RPGs\\", \\"TAND\\", \\"taf1\\", \\"RPS16A\\", \\"RNA polymerase II\\", \\"RPS5\\", \\"hmo1\\", \\"RPL10\\", \\"sua7\\", \\"HMO1\\", \\"the N-terminal domain\\", \\"toa1\\", \\"spt15\\", \\"ribosomal protein genes\\", \\"TFIIA\\", \\"TEF2\\", \\"high mobility group B (HMGB) protein\\", \\"TFIID\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The connector is for receiving the edge of a printed circuit board and making contact with the pads along the edge thereof. The connector has a body in which is positioned a plurality of longitudinally arranged U-shaped sockets which receive the edge of the board. Formed points are located in the sockets at a different distance from the bottom of the socket. These points are spaced so that the board may slide therebetween and then, as the board is turned in the socket, it engages the points to make assured contact. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  A barrier to the widespread adoption of learning-based network intrusion detection tools is the in-situ training requirements for effective discrimination of malicious traffic. Supervised learning techniques necessitate a quantity of labeled examples that is often intractable, and at best cost-prohibitive. Recent advances in semi-supervised techniques have demonstrated the ability to generalize well based on a significantly smaller set of labeled samples. In network intrusion detection, placing reasonable requirements on the number of training examples provides realistic expectations that a learning-based system can be trained in the environment where it will be deployed. This in-situ training is necessary to ensure that the assumptions associated with the learning process hold, and thereby support a reasonable belief in the generalization ability of the resulting model. In this paper, we describe the application of a carefully selected nonparametric, semi-supervised learning algorithm to the network intrusion problem, and compare the performance to other model types using feature-based data derived from an operational network. We demonstrate dramatic performance improvements over supervised learning and anomaly detection in discriminating real, previously unseen, malicious network traffic while generating an order of magnitude fewer false alerts than any alternative, including a signature IDS tool deployed on the same network. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  A reasonable definition of intrusion is: entering a community to which one does not belong. This suggests that in a network, intrusion attempts may be detected by looking for communication that does not respect community boundaries. In this paper, we examine the utility of this concept for identifying malicious network sources. In particular, our goal is to explore whether this concept allows a core-network operator using flow data to augment signature-based systems located at network edges. We show that simple measures of communities can be defined for flow data that allow a remarkably effective level of intrusion detection simply by looking for flows that do not respect those communities. We validate our approach using labeled intrusion attempt data collected at a large number of edge networks. Our results suggest that community-based methods can offer an important additional dimension for intrusion detection systems. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Online reviews play a crucial role in today's electronic commerce. It is desirable for a customer to read reviews of products or stores before making the decision of what or from where to buy. Due to the pervasive spam reviews, customers can be misled to buy low-quality products, while decent stores can be defamed by malicious reviews. We observe that, in reality, a great portion (> 90% in the data we study) of the reviewers write only one review (singleton review). These reviews are so enormous in number that they can almost determine a store's rating and impression. However, existing methods did not examine this larger part of the reviews. Are most of these singleton reviews truthful ones? If not, how to detect spam reviews in singleton reviews? We call this problem singleton review spam detection. To address this problem, we observe that the normal reviewers' arrival pattern is stable and uncorrelated to their rating pattern temporally. In contrast, spam attacks are usually bursty and either positively or negatively correlated to the rating. Thus, we propose to detect such attacks via unusually correlated temporal patterns. We identify and construct multidimensional time series based on aggregate statistics, in order to depict and mine such correlations. In this way, the singleton review spam detection problem is mapped to a abnormally correlated pattern detection problem. We propose a hierarchical algorithm to robustly detect the time windows where such attacks are likely to have happened. The algorithm also pinpoints such windows in different time resolutions to facilitate faster human inspection. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting singleton review attacks. We discover that singleton review is a significant source of spam reviews and largely affects the ratings of online stores. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  Detection methods based on n-gram models have been widely studied for the identification of attacks and malicious software. These methods usually build on one of two learning schemes: anomaly detection, where a model of normality is constructed from n-grams, or classification, where a discrimination between benign and malicious n-grams is learned. Although successful in many security domains, previous work falls short of explaining why a particular scheme is used and more importantly what renders one favorable over the other for a given type of data. In this paper we provide a close look on n-gram models for intrusion detection. We specifically study anomaly detection and classification using n-grams and develop criteria for data being used in one or the other scheme. Furthermore, we apply these criteria in the scope of web intrusion detection and empirically validate their effectiveness with different learning-based detection methods for client-side and service-side attacks. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  To address this issue we present a technique and implemented system, Fortuna, for obtaining probabilistic bounds on false positive rates for anomaly detectors that process Internet data. Using a probability distribution based on PageRank and an efficient algorithm to draw samples from the distribution, Fortuna computes an estimated false positive rate and a probabilistic bound on the estimate’s accuracy. By drawing test samples from a well defined distribution that correlates well with data seen in practice, Fortuna improves on ad hoc methods for estimating false positive rate, giving bounds that are reproducible, comparable across different anomaly detectors, and theoretically sound. Experimental evaluations of three anomaly detectors (SIFT, SOAP, and JSAND) show that Fortuna is efficient enough to use in practice — it can sample enough inputs to obtain tight false positive rate bounds in less than 10 hours for all three detectors. These results indicate that Fortuna can, in practice, help place anomaly detection on a stronger theoretical foundation and help practitioners better understand the behavior and consequences of the anomaly detectors that they deploy. As part of our work, we obtain a theoretical result that may be of independent interest: We give a simple analysis of the convergence rate of the random surfer process defining PageRank that guarantees the same rate as the standard, second-eigenvalue analysis, but does not rely on any assumptions about the link structure of the web. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  The analysis of large scale data logged from complex cyber-physical systems, such as microgrids, often entails the discovery of invariants capturing functional as well as operational relationships underlying such large systems. We describe a latent factor approach to infer invariants underlying system variables and how we can leverage these relationships to monitor a cyber-physical system. In particular we illustrate how this approach helps rapidly identify outliers during system operation.Literature Review:","answer":"From feature sets to algorithms and systems, IDS has been extensively studied. However, as BIB003 cautioned, ML can be easily conflated with anomaly detection. While both are applied to build IDS, important difference is that ML aims to generalize expert-defined distinctions, but anomaly detection focuses on finding unusual patterns, while attacks are not necessarily anomalous. For example, BIB006 distinguished n-gram model's different use cases: anomaly detection uses it to construct normality(hence more appropriate when no attack is available for learning), and ML classifiers learn to discriminate between benign and malicious n-grams(hence more appropriate when more labeled data is present). Since 2008, works at top venues have added to the rigor for ML applications in IDS. For example, a common assumption of IDS is: Anomalous or malicious behaviors or traffic flows are fundamentally different from normal ones, but BIB003 challenges the assumption by studying low-cardinality intrusions where attackers don't send a large number of probes. To address adversarial learning environment and minimal labels in training data, semisupervised paradigms, especially active learning, are also used BIB003 BIB002 . Heterogeneous designs of IDS in different use cases give rise to many ad-hoc evaluations in research works, and a reproducibility and comparison framework was proposed to address the issue BIB007 . Meanwhile, techniques such as graph-based community detection BIB004 , time series-based methods BIB005 BIB008 , and generalized support vector data description in cyber-physical system and adversarial environment for auto-feature selection BIB001 , have also emerged. Although they carry different assumptions of normality and feature representations, the supervised ML system design remains largely the same. Besides the fact the more techniques and use cases have been proposed, the focus of research in IDS had evolved from discovering new techniques and use cases, to rigorously evaluating fundamental assumptions and workflows of IDS. For example, while feature selection has stayed as a major component, there are re-examination of assumptions and measurements on what constitutes normality and abnormality BIB004 , alternative to more easily acquire data and use low-confidence data for ML systems BIB002 , and proposal on validating reproducibility of results from different settings BIB007 ."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

The protocol incorporated an integral biofeedback, guided imagery, and visualization/relaxation component in order to assess the influence of psychophysiological factors on the healing process. Biopsies were performed on the lateral deltoid in healthy subjects and assessed by two independent physicians for the rate of reepithelialization at day 5 and day 10. Subjects met as a group on odd numbered days for a one hour visualization/relaxation session which incorporated guided imagery with either a specific intent to heal their biopsy wound or a specific intent to relax. Treatment intervention included two NCTT healers or two mimic practitioners who worked in-person for a duration of 6 minutes per subject. LeShan and Intercessory Prayer healers worked at a distance and a Reiki healer worked in-person with the NCTT healers. On even numbered days, subjects were trained in hand temperature biofeedback with either a specific intent to heal or a specific intent to relax. Results showed significance for the treated versus the control group but in the opposite direction from that expected. Several factors could have contributed to the nonsignificance obtained including: (a) the natural healing ability of the two mimic practitioners; (b) the subjects' increased proficiency with the self-regulatory techniques; and (c) a carryover effect from the two NCTT healers and/or the Reiki, LeShan, or Intercessory Prayer healers.","answer":"There is no robust evidence that TT promotes healing of acute wounds."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

This study assessed the ability of various schedules of recombinant human thrombopoietin ( rhTPO ) to enhance mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells ( PBPCs ) in 134 patients with cancer undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBPC transplantation . Patients received the study drug on days 1 , 3 , and 5 before initiation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) 10 microg/kg/day on day 5 and pheresis starting on day 9 . Randomly assigned treatments on days 1 , 3 , and 5 were : group 1 ( n=27 ) placebo , placebo , rhTPO 1.5 microg/kg ; group 2 ( n=27 ) rhTPO 1.5 microg/kg , placebo , placebo ; groups 3 ( n=28 ) and 4 ( n=22 ) rhTPO 0.5 microg/kg on all 3 treatment days ; and group 5 ( n=30 ) placebo on all 3 treatment days . After high-dose chemotherapy and PBPC transplantation , groups 1 through 4 received rhTPO 1.5 microg/kg days 0 , +2 , +4 , and +6 with either G-CSF 5 microg/kg/day ( groups 1-3 ) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 250 microg/m ( 2 ) /day ( group 4 ) . Group 5 received placebo plus G-CSF 5 microg/kg/day . The addition of rhTPO to G-CSF increased median CD34+ cell yield/pheresis in cohorts in which rhTPO was started before day 5 , with higher yields in groups 2 ( 2.67 x 10 ( 6 ) /kg ) and groups 3 and 4 ( 3.10 x 10 ( 6 ) /kg ) than in group 1 ( 1.86 x 10 ( 6 ) /kg ) or group 5 ( 1.65 x 10 ( 6 ) /kg ) ( P=.006 across groups ) .

One mechanism that induces cells to correlate their motions is contact inhibition of locomotion, by which cells migrating away from the contact site. Here, we report that tail-following behavior at the contact site, termed contact following locomotion( CFL), can induce a non-trivial collective behavior in migrating cells. We show the emergence of a traveling band showing polar order in a mutant Dictyostelium cell that lacks chemotactic activity. We find that CFL is the cell–cell interaction underlying this phenomenon, enabling a theoretical description of how this traveling band forms. We further show that the polar order phase consists of subpopulations that exhibit characteristic transversal motions with respect to the direction of band propagation. These findings describe a novel mechanism of collective cell migration involving cell–cell interactions capable of inducing traveling band with polar order.Introduction:The collective migration of eukaryotic cells plays crucial roles in processes such as wound healing, tumor progression, and morphogenesis, and has been the focus of extensive study( Haeger et al., 2015). The collective effects are typically associated with cell–cell interactions, such as long-range interaction mediated by secreted chemicals or short-range stable cohesive interaction mediated by adhesion molecules. However, the study of self-propelled particles in physics has revealed that motile elements which lack such activities may nonetheless give rise to dynamic collective motion, such as a traveling band( Chaté et al., 2008; Ginelli et al., 2010; Ohta and Yamanaka, 2014; Solon et al., 2015), mediated by a relatively simple transient short-range interaction, such as alignment interaction( Marchetti et al., 2013; Vicsek et al., 1995; Vicsek and Zafeiris, 2012). The emergence of such collective motions of self-propelled particles, such as formations of clusters and traveling bands, has been observed in a wide variety of systems, ranging from animal flocks( Ballerini et al., 2008), bacteria swarms( Wioland et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010), and cell assemblies( Szabó et al., 2006) to biopolymers and molecular motors( Butt et al., 2010; Schaller et al., 2010; Sumino et al., 2012). For cell assemblies of eukaryotic cells, higher order organized movements have been also reported for migrating cells confined in circular micropatterns( Doxzen et al., 2013; Segerer et al., 2015; Wan et al., 2011) or spheroids( Chin et al., 2018). For some of these systems, the connection between a macroscopic collective behavior and the microscopic dynamics of its constituents has been established. For the traveling band formation of biopolymers and molecular motors, local physical interactions among constituent elements effectively works as an alignment interaction, which induce the collective motion( Schaller et al., 2010; Sumino et al., 2012; Suzuki et al., 2015). In the case of eukaryotic cells, however, the connection between macroscopic traveling band formation( Kuwayama and Ishida, 2013) and microscopic short-range cell–cell interactions remains unclear. In particular, quantitative characterization of the traveling band formation and genetic analysis to reveal responsible cell-cell interaction have not been performed yet. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a model organism for the study of collective cell migration. The coordinated movement of cell population is achieved by individual chemotactic motion to the cAMP gradient, which is formed in a self-organized way. However, a mutant cell that lacks chemotactic activity to cAMP still exhibits an organized coordinated motion that is probably mediated by cell-cell contacts( Kuwayama and Ishida, 2013). Here, we demonstrate that this coordinated motion is a spontaneous polar order formation which phase-separates with a disordered background. We further show that this polar order formation is attributable to the tail-following behavior among the migrating cells, called contact following locomotion( CFL). We find that the polar ordered phase caused by CFL has an internal structure. An agent-based model with CFL further reveals that this internal structure is characteristic of the CFL-induced polar order formation. Thus, we establish the link between the collective behavior and the cell-cell interactions. Our findings open new possibilities that the concept of self-propelled particles contributes to the understanding of a highly orchestrated biological event of migrating cells in multicellular systems.Discussion:In this study, we report that a mutant of Dictyostelium cell that lacks all chemotactic activity exhibits spontaneous segregation into polar ordered solitary band( Kuwayama and Ishida, 2013). This pattern formation is attributable to the cell-cell interaction called contact following locomotion( CFL)( Figure 4). The agent-based model that includes CFL reproduces the observed macroscopic behaviors( Figure 3g). Thus, we establish a link between the microscopic cell-cell interactions and the macroscopic polar pattern formation. We showed that the width of band is distributed widely from W=200 µm to 700 µm( Figure 1—figure supplement 1b), and found the positive correlation between the width and the order parameter within the band( Figure 3b). The local cell density within the band is similar across different samples( Figure 1—figure supplement 1c), suggesting that the local cell density may not be a relevant factor for the increase in the order parameter. We speculate that if the correlation in the migration direction is gradually decorrelated from the front to the end of the band, bands with lower order parameters will be more prone to larger decorrelation in the migration direction. Consequently, we expect that the stronger the polar order, the wider the band width W. One characteristic behavior of the present polar pattern formation is the formation of internal structure, which consists of subpopulations with transversal motions( Figure 3c, d, f. From the numerical simulation result, this formation of subpopulation was not seen in the model without CFL( Figure 3—figure supplement 3d, e). Thus, the internal structure is a characteristic of CFL induced polar pattern formation. A population of cells enters the band at its front with directional alignment induced by CFL in random direction. During the relative movement of these cells from the front to the end of band, the migration direction may not be dampened completely to the direction of band propagation probably due to the directional persistence induced by CFL. In this way, subpopulations with respect to the migration direction are formed when CFL is present. A full analysis of this mechanism remains to be a future topic. In this paper, we mainly focused on the behavior of single solitary band. We studied the traveling band, which was well separated from other bands. Thus, all properties of single solitary band studied in this paper is independent of interaction between different bands. In some area, the traveling bands are arranged almost periodically in space with a spatial interval of about 1 mm( Figure 1b). How bands interact with each other to reach a periodic spacing and whether the interval is independent of band width W are to be investigated. Wildtype Dictyostelium discoideum usually aggregates through chemotaxis to form a hemispherical mound with a central tip region that regulates the formation of slug-like multicellular structure( Williams, 2010). It has been suggested, however, that other mechanism also involves in the formation of aggregate, such as contact following( Dormann et al., 2002; Fujimori et al., 2019; Shaffer, 1962; Umeda and Inouye, 2002). In fact, whereas the KI cell alone does not form the multicellular structure, KI cells are able to spontaneously migrate to the central tip region transplanted from a wildtype slug and undergo normal morphogenesis and cell differentiation; this is not observed in mutant KI cells lacking TgrB1( Kida et al., 2019), suggesting that TgrB1-dependent CFL without chemotaxis allows KI cells to spontaneously migrate in slug. Furthermore, in wildtype cells, the chemical guidance cue has been shown to cease during the multicellular phase, which suggests that an alternative mechanism induces collective cell migration in the multicellular body( Hashimura et al., 2019). We propose that polar order formation induced by CFL plays an important role in late-stage morphogenesis in this organism. Contact following locomotion, or chain migration, have been reported in other cell types( Li and Wang, 2018). The macroscopic behaviors reported in this paper may thus be found in other systems as well.","answer":"The cells of animals and many other living things are able to migrate together in groups .

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Skewed distributions appear very often in practice. Unfortunately, the traditional Zipf distribution often fails to model them well. In this paper, we propose a new probability distribution, the Discrete Gaussian Exponential (DGX), to achieve excellent fits in a wide variety of settings; our new distribution includes the Zipf distribution as a special case. We present a statistically sound method for estimating the DGX parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We applied DGX to a wide variety of real world data sets, such as sales data from a large retailer chain, us-age data from ATT in all cases, DGX fits these distributions very well, with almost a 99% correlation coefficient in quantile-quantile plots. Our algorithm also scales very well because it requires only a single pass over the data. Finally, we illustrate the power of DGX as a new tool for data mining tasks, such as outlier detection. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  An input/output port address selection circuit for a device that couples to a local bus of a computer operates in two modes. In a first mode, the I/O port address is maintained as the last I/O port address saved. In the second mode, the selection circuit changes the I/O port address and saves the change when the circuit is reset. A computer user resolves I/O port address conflicts by placing the selection circuit in the second mode then resetting the system until the conflict is resolved and the system works properly. The selection circuit is then placed and left in the first mode so that the non-conflicting address is reused. Non-volatile memory, an electrically erasable-programmable read-only memory, is used for saving an index which indicates the last I/O port address set. The non-volatile memory is changed when the selection circuit is operated in the second mode. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  The Pareto-positive stable (PPS) distribution is introduced as a new model for describing city size data in a country. The PPS distribution provides a flexible model for fitting the entire range of a set of city size data, where zero and unimodality are possible, and the classical Pareto and Zipf distributions are included as a particular case. Expressions for the shape, moments and other descriptive probabilistic measures are given. Estimation methods are discussed and a simple graphical method for studying the adequacy of the data to model is given. Finally, we consider city size data for Spain for several different years. The new distribution is compared with three classical models: Pareto, lognormal and Tsallis distributions. In all the data sets considered, the PPS distribution outperforms the fits of these three previous distributions. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  We present an application of a growth model for a system of cities. This computer model simulates the evolution of systems with measurable entities (e.g. city size), and takes into account the growth of the entities in terms of size and number. It includes a random multiplicative process for the growth of individual entities and for the creation of new ones. We use a new mathematical expression with a positive exponent α (which we call the ‘shape exponent’) and additional three parameters, to describe the dynamics of the systems’ size distributions through time. We compare the changes of a real system of cities and the model’s results quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings suggest that there is a good agreement at the macro level between the model and the real data. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  Using un-truncated settlement size data from eight countries, we show that the \\"double Pareto lognormal\\" (DPLN) distribution provides a better fit to actual city sizes than the simple lognormal (LN) distribution. The DPLN has a lognormal body and features a power law in both the lower and the upper tail. It emerges in the steady-state of a stochastic urban growth process with random city formation. Our findings reconcile a recent debate on the Zipfian rank-size rule for city sizes.Literature Review:","answer":"Warren BIB003 showed that lognormal and Pareto distributions were insufficient to model city sizes. He argued that there should be two distinct Pareto distributions, one for modeling the largest city sizes and another for modeling smaller cities. Meanwhile, other distributions to model city sizes were proposed in the literature. In 2001, Bi et al. BIB002 , proposed the discrete Gaussian exponential (DGX) distribution for mining, massive skewed data. A random variable with DGX distribution is a lognormal random variable digitized to the nearest integer. If the lognormal random variable becomes zero after the rounding, then it is omitted. The Pareto law was included as a special case of the DGX. Authors applied DGX to distinct data sets, a text from the Bible, clickstream data, sales data and telecommunication data. In all cases, the DGX fitted well the data. Sarabia and Prieto BIB004 introduced the Pareto-positive stable (PPS) distribution as a new model for city size distribution. Pareto and Zipf distributions were included as particular cases. PPS distribution could be obtained by a monotonic transformation of the classical Weibull distribution, or by mixing the shape parameter a of the classical Pareto distribution with a positive stable law. Authors compared their results on data from population of Spanish cities from 1998 up to 2007, with Pareto, lognormal and Tsallis BIB001 distributions, and PPS provided better fits than the three previous distributions. Benguigui and Blumenfeld-Lieberthal BIB005 proposed a dynamical growth model for cities. The model simulated the evolution, over time, of measurable entities, such as city size. They computed both size and number for each entity. Authors validated data from the model with real city size data from the Israeli system of cities, from 1961 to 2006. Israel was an example of a country in which cities grew in size and in number, over time. They concluded that there was a good correspondence between simulated and real data. Changes in the values of the Pareto coefficient were observed and were justified by the variation of the number of entities with time. Giesen et al. BIB006 introduced the Double Pareto lognormal distribution (DPLN) to model city sizes. They used data from eight countries and their results showed that DPLN was a good fit for cities of all sizes. It was compatible with Zipf's law among large cities and followed a lognormal shape for other cases."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

These diseases represent a serious and widespread health problem in the Western world; however the underlying molecular basis is not clear. ATF3 is an ' immediate early' gene whose expression is highly and transiently induced in response to multiple stressors such as metabolic, oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum and inflammation, stressors that are involved in T2D cardiomyopathy. The role of ATF3 in diabetic cardiomyopathy is currently unknown. Our research has aimed to study the effect of ATF3 expression on cardiomyocytes, heart function and glucose homeostasis in an obesity - induced T2D mouse model. We used wild type mice (WT) as well as mutant mice with a cardiac - specific ATF3 deficiency (ATF3-cKO). Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 15 weeks. HFD induced high ATF3 expression in cardiomyocytes. Mice were examined for cardiac remodeling processes and the diabetic state was assessed. HFD -fed ATF3-cKO mice exhibited severe cardiac fibrosis, higher levels of heart hypertrophic markers, increased inflammation and worse cardiac function, as compared to WT mice. Interestingly, HFD -fed ATF3-cKO mice display increased hyperglycemia and reduced glucose tolerance, despite higher blood insulin levels, as compared to HFD -fed WT mice. Elevated levels of the cardiac inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα leading to impaired insulin signalling may partially explain the peripheral glucose intolerance. Cardiac ATF3 has a protective role in dampening the HFD - induced cardiac remodeling processes. ATF3 exerts both local and systemic effects related to T2D -induced cardiomyopathy. This study provides a strong relationship between heart remodeling processes and blood glucose homeostasis.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"ATF3\\", \\"heart\\", \\"cardiomyocytes\\", \\"immediate earlyu0027 gene\\", \\"Cardiac\\", \\"cardiac\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"heart remodeling processes\\", \\"stress\\", \\"inflammation\\", \\"glucose homeostasis\\", \\"cardiac remodeling processes\\", \\"endoplasmic reticulum\\", \\"heart hypertrophic\\", \\"expression\\", \\"obesity\\", \\"response\\", \\"homeostasis\\", \\"cardiac fibrosis\\", \\"cardiac remodeling process\\", \\"hyperglycemia\\", \\"type 2 diabetes\\", \\"diseases\\", \\"diabetic cardiomyopathy\\", \\"oxidative\\", \\"heart function\\", \\"cardiac function\\", \\"T2D\\", \\"Obesity\\", \\"insulin signalling\\", \\"diabetic state\\", \\"cardiomyopathy\\", \\"glucose homeostasis.\\", \\"mouse model\\", \\"exerts\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"blood\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"inflammatory cytokines\\", \\"ATF3\\", \\"TNFu03b1\\", \\"IL-6\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"markers\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"wild type mice\\", \\"ATF3-cKO\\", \\"WT mice.\\", \\"mutant mice\\", \\"ATF3-cKO mice\\", \\"WT mice\\", \\"Mice\\", \\"WT\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"higher blood insulin levels\\", \\"worse\\", \\"examined\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"HFD\\", \\"high-fat diet\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"assessed\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"research\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"widespread\\", \\"peripheral\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Despite excellent responses to imatinib mesylate (IM), patients are relapsing. We developed an IM-resistant GIST cell line (GIST-R) from the IM-sensitive GIST882 cell line (GIST-S) by growing these cells in IM. Gene expression profiling (GEP) of GIST-S, GIST-R cells and two IM resistant GIST patients demonstrated that KIT is downregulated implying a major role in IM resistance. Instead, GIST-R cells have acquired IM resistance by overexpressing the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase - AXL - in a 'kinase switch'. Further, the two IM resistant GIST patients express AXL and not c-Kit, seen by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting of the GIST-S and GIST-R cells confirmed the switch from Kit to AXL. In GIST-R, AXL is tyrosine phosphorylated and its ligand growth-arrest-specific gene 6 is overexpressed implying autocrine activation. The kinase switch is associated with a morphological change from spindle to epithelioid. Molecular modeling of the kinase domain of mutant c-Kit (V654A) and AXL showed no binding to IM but efficient binding to MP470, a novel c-Kit/AXL kinase inhibitor. MP470 synergizes with docetaxel (taxotere) and is cytotoxic to GIST cells.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"imatinib\\", \\"tyrosine\\", \\"MP470\\", \\"IM\\", \\"docetaxel\\", \\"taxotere\\", \\"imatinib mesylate\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"V654A\\", \\"oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase\\", \\"kinase\\", \\"Kit\\", \\"alpha-PDGFR\\", \\"kinase domain\\", \\"alpha-platelet-derived growth factor receptor\\", \\"c-Kit\\", \\"KIT\\", \\"tyrosine kinase\\", \\"AXL\\", \\"growth-arrest-specific gene 6\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

PURPOSE. The authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram (ERG) in a boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ERGs in five boys with DMD. The authors wanted to determined whether there were similar ERG findings in an animal model for DMD, the mdx mouse. METHODS. Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded in five boys with DMD after a complete ophthalmic examination. The dystrophin gene was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. ERGs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified Grass photostimulator (Grass Instrument Company, Quincy, MA). RESULTS. Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings, yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject. The subjects gene deletions were variable, ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions. The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice. CONCLUSIONS. The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity. The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons, including milder effects of the mouse gene defect, differences in muscle and retinal gene product, or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin. The ERG shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DMD and its milder allelic forms..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"DMD\\", \\"Duchenne muscular dystrophy\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

This setting is considered shallow in the era of deep learning. In this paper, we present a new deep multi-task representation learning framework that learns cross-task sharing structure at every layer in a deep network. Our approach is based on generalising the matrix factorisation techniques explicitly or implicitly used by many conventional MTL algorithms to tensor factorisation, to realise automatic learning of end-to-end knowledge sharing in deep networks. This is in contrast to existing deep learning approaches that need a user-defined multi-task sharing strategy. Our approach applies to both homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our deep multi-task representation learning in terms of both higher accuracy and fewer design choices.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The model for three-mode factor analysis is discussed in terms of newer applications of mathematical processes including a type of matrix process termed the Kronecker product and the definition of combination variables. Three methods of analysis to a type of extension of principal components analysis are discussed. Methods II and III are applicable to analysis of data collected for a large sample of individuals. An extension of the model is described in which allowance is made for unique variance for each combination variable when the data are collected for a large sample of individuals.","answer":"Our MTL approach is a , in that DNN weights are dynamically generated given some side information -- in the case of MTL, given the task identity. In a related example of speaker-adaptive speech recognition there may be several clusters in the data (e.g., gender, acoustic conditions), and each speaker's model could be a linear combination of these latent task clusters' models. They model each speaker @math 's weight matrix @math as a sum of @math base models @math , i.e., @math . The difference between speakers tasks comes from @math and the base models are shared. An advantage of this is that, when new data come, one can choose to re-train @math parameters only, and keep @math fixed. This will significantly reduce the number of parameters to learn, and consequently the required training data.

OBJECTIVE: Leukotriene antagonists are increasingly used in asthma management. Pranlukast is a new, orally active, selective inhibitor of CysLt1 leukotriene receptor. The present clinical trial was performed to study the effect and safety of pranlukast in mild-to-moderate asthma. METHODOLOGY: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was performed in eight medical centres in Korea. Mild-to-moderate asthma patients who had been treated with beta2-agonists and/or inhaled corticosteroids were studied. The patients ' symptoms were evaluated by asthma diary and twice-daily peak flow monitoring. RESULTS: Of the 206 patients enrolled, 197 were eligible for analysis. The pranlukast group (n = 98) showed statistically significant improvement in asthma symptoms, including asthma attack rate, daily living score, and morning and evening asthma scores. Pranlukast significantly reduced the consumption of beta2-agonist. Compared with the placebo group, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were not significantly higher in the pranlukast group. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) were significantly increased after pranlukast treatment at weeks 2 and 4 (380.8 + /- 10.1 L/min at baseline, 394.5 + /- 10.1 at week 2, 396.3 + /- 10.4 at week 4). There were no serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Pranlukast, an oral leukotriene antagonist, was well tolerated and was effective for the management of mild-to-moderate asthma.","answer":"[[\\"leukotriene\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"CysLt1\\"], [\\"pranlukast\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"leukotriene receptor\\"], [\\"leukotriene\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"leukotriene receptor\\"], [\\"Pranlukast\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"CysLt1\\"], [\\"Pranlukast\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"leukotriene receptor\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

Treatment of PD consists of symptomatic therapies while neuroprotective strategies have remained elusive. Rasagiline is a novel, potent, and irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor which has been approved for treatment of PD. Rasagiline inhibits MAO-B more potently than selegiline and has the advantage of once-daily dosing. In several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, rasagiline has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive therapy in advanced PD. In addition, rasagiline has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo studies. The recently completed delayed-start ADAGIO (Attenuation of Disease Progression with Azilect Given Once-daily) trial suggests a potential disease-modifying effect for rasagiline 1 mg/day, though the clinical import of this finding has yet to be established.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Rasagiline\\", \\"rasagiline\\", \\"monoamine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"monoamine oxidase type B\\", \\"MAO-B\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

The role of these micro-data centers is twofold. On the one hand, they act as intermediaries between cloud services and clients, improving availability in the case of network or power outages. On the other hand, they run community-based services on local infrastructure. We illustrate how to build such a system without incurring high costs, high power consumption, or single points of failure. Additionally, we opt for a system that is extendable and scalable as well as easy to deploy, relying on an open design.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The unparalleled success of mobile technologies, the emergence of new modes of software and hardware production, and the free circulation of shared knowledge in the Web 2.0 have enabled a new generation of bottom-up, community-based, cost-effective telecommunications initiatives and projects. While these endeavours find their roots in previous hobbyists' movements (i.e. amateur radio, software hackers, do-it-yourself communities) today's' initiatives are able to connect, co-produce and share knowledge with world-wide communities, engaging new participants both at the local and the global level. This article reviews recent developments that aim to provide free or low-cost access to telecommunication services in different areas. From Do-It-Yourself (DIY) satellites to mesh networks, these projects tap into the wisdom and resources of communities to offer non-commercial alternatives to present telecommunications services. The technology, organisational, and regulatory challenges they also face cannot be underestimated either. However, in their struggle to find and consolidate new markets, affordable telecommunications reveal that a new digital economy based on co-production could be under way.[2]: This book provides policymakers and regulators with the frameworks and ideas to help them design strategies and policies to support the growth of the broadband ecosystem in their countries.[3]: The development towards ubiquitous network access requires innovative solutions to get remote areas included, especially rural areas of developing regions. We report on recent progress in the Serengeti Broadband Network, one of the first pilots established in the Tanzania ICT for Rural Development programme with the mission to design and validate a method to establish sustainable broadband markets in under-served areas. The challenges include ownership and leadership, sustainable business models, robustness of network components and poor or non-existent supply chains, including power supply.[4]: [5]: Advancement in mobile broadband communication enables to effectively communicate anywhere at any time. More specifically, for people who live in rural areas of developing countries it is the best means to communicate with the rest of the world. This has prodigious potential of enabling new opportunities in their live. The appearance of cloud computing, the recent improvements in communication networks, and the mobile phone market penetration allow a large number of users to access remote computing systems using their mobile devices.[6]: Connecting the unconnected world is a challenging task not only in technological perspective but also economically. Providing a viable solution for a communication network in large rural areas such as parts of Africa or remote Lapland in Northern Finland, surprisingly, share similar challenges. The main criteria for such a network are energy-efficient, robust, and reliable operation even in harsh environment. Important aspects are also low-cost and easy deployment of such a network. Developing a network that would meet all the criteria requires theoretical studies as well as real-world testing and implementations. In this paper, we will present some early results and design highlights of a wireless mesh network testbed deployment that can be used to foster the research work. We also envision it as a base for an actual solution. We introduce some of the concepts and objectives behind the testbed and describe and rationalize the chosen hardware and architecture choices.[7]: DakNet provides extraordinarily low-cost digital communication, letting remote villages leapfrog past the expense of traditional connectivity solutions and begin development of a full-coverage broadband wireless infrastructure. What is the basis for a progressive, market-driven migration from e-governance to universal broadband connectivity that local users will pay for? DakNet, an ad hoc network that uses wireless technology to provide asynchronous digital connectivity, is evidence that the marriage of wireless and asynchronous service may indeed be the beginning of a road to universal broadband connectivity. DakNet has been successfully deployed in remote parts of both India and Cambodia at a cost two orders of magnitude less than that of traditional landline solutions.","answer":"There are numerous publications on connectivity, communications networks, and bandwidth, see [2]9 [2] [3] [2]7 [1] [2]2 for a few examples. While the networking aspect is very important, the storage and computational aspects should not be neglected; especially since getting the infrastructure for widespread broadband connectivity into place will still take considerable time. Consequently, there is a need for local data centers that can bridge the communication gaps. propose a cloudlet-based approach to tackle network issues in emerging regions, but do so very briefly on a very abstract level, identifying research challenges, but not proposing any implementation [5] ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

In admixed populations, linkage disequilibrium( LD) exists both at a fine scale in ancestral populations and at a coarse scale( admixture-LD) due to chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry. Disease association statistics in admixed populations have previously considered SNP association( LD mapping) or admixture association( mapping by admixture-LD), but not both. Here, we introduce a new statistical framework for combining SNP and admixture association in case-control studies, as well as methods for local ancestry-aware imputation. We illustrate the gain in statistical power achieved by these methods by analyzing data of 6, 209 unrelated African Americans from the CARe project genotyped on the Affymetrix 6. 0 chip, in conjunction with both simulated and real phenotypes, as well as by analyzing the FGFR2 locus using breast cancer GWAS data from 5, 761 African-American women. We show that, at typed SNPs, our method yields an 8% increase in statistical power for finding disease risk loci compared to the power achieved by standard methods in case-control studies. At imputed SNPs, we observe an 11% increase in statistical power for mapping disease loci when our local ancestry-aware imputation framework and the new scoring statistic are jointly employed. Finally, we show that our method increases statistical power in regions harboring the causal SNP in the case when the causal SNP is untyped and cannot be imputed. Our methods and our publicly available software are broadly applicable to GWAS in admixed populations.Introduction:Genome-wide association studies( GWAS) are the currently prevailing approach for identifying genetic variants with a modest effect on the risk of common disease, and have identified hundreds of common risk variants for a wide range of diseases and phenotypes[1],[2]. Although GWAS have initially focused on populations of European ancestry, studies of other populations will capture additional genetic diversity that may be absent or present only at low frequency in Europeans. GWAS in non-Europeans will often involve admixed populations, such as African Americans and Latinos, with recent ancestry from two or more ancestral populations[3],[4]. GWAS disease mapping in homogeneous populations relies on linkage disequilibrium( LD) between nearby markers to identify SNP association[5]. Admixed populations exhibit another form of LD at a coarse scale( admixture-LD) due to chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry[6]. This enables admixture mapping( mapping by admixture-LD) to be an effective approach for identifying disease genes in admixed populations[7]–[14]. As genotyping costs have decreased, however, GWAS have become an increasingly appealing alternative. Although GWAS and admixture mapping have historically been viewed as distinct approaches, GWAS in admixed populations can in theory capture both SNP and admixture association signals, which have been shown to contain independent information[15]. To date, GWAS in such populations have either considered SNP association only[3],[16],[17], or SNP and admixture association separately[4]. We show below that combining these signals leads to increased statistical power because case-only admixture association statistics contain information independent from case-control SNP association statistics. It is important to complement theoretical methods development with empirical evaluation on large real data sets. To this end, we have evaluated our methods using 6, 209 unrelated African Americans from the CARe cardiovascular consortium as well as 5761 unrelated African-American women from a GWAS for breast cancer. We ran comprehensive simulations based on real genotypes and phenotypes simulated under a variety of assumptions. Our main focus was on case-control phenotypes, in which case-only admixture association is particularly valuable. Our analysis of simulated and real( coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and breast cancer) case-control phenotypes shows that our combined SNP and admixture association approach attains significantly greater statistical power than can be achieved by applying either approach separately. Although our main focus is on case-control phenotypes, we also provide a detailed evaluation of association statistics for quantitative phenotypes, using simulated and real( LDL and HDL cholesterol) phenotypes. Since the general assumption in GWAS is that the causal SNP is not directly typed in the study, it is important to assess how the newly introduced scores perform in the context of genotype imputation. First, we show that imputation accuracy is marginally improved when local ancestry is taken into account in the imputation procedure. Second, our analysis in African Americans shows that for case-control studies our methods for combining SNP and admixture association outperform other approaches even in the presence of imputation. Finally, we show that when the causal SNP is not typed and cannot be reliably imputed our methods yield higher statistical power at finding the region harboring the causal variant when compared to previous approaches. Based on these findings we provide recommendations for the use of our combined approach in GWAS of admixed populations.Discussion:Incorporating admixture association signals into GWAS of admixed populations is likely to be particularly informative for diseases for which risk differs depending on ancestry. Cardiovascular disease( CVD) is a prime example, as African ancestry is associated to higher CVD mortality and to CVD risk factors such as hypertension, serum lipid levels and left ventricular hypertrophy[39]–[41]. Other diseases for which African ancestry is a risk factor include prostate cancer, diabetic retinopathy, lupus and uterine fibroids[42]–[45]. Although we have focused here on African Americans, our methods are broadly applicable to other admixed populations. By analyzing real and simulated case-control phenotypes, we have shown that the MIX score, which incorporates both SNP and admixture association signals, yields a significant increase in statistical power over commonly used scores such as the Armitage trend test with correction for global ancestry. For randomly ascertained quantitative traits, in contrast to case-control phenotypes there is no case-only admixture score and thus no benefit from joint modeling of admixture and SNP association. Thus, for quantitative phenotypes, in general, the QATT score yields higher statistical power than other compared scores. Therefore, we recommend the use of MIX and QATT scores for dichotomous and quantitative traits, respectively, in future GWAS in admixed populations. However, we note that in various scenarios( e. g., multiple causal variants, heterogeneous effects, absence of the causal variant from the typed or imputed markers) assumptions made by the MIX and QATT may be invalid and using them can lead to poor performance. To this extent, we recommend that special consideration be given to regions with high signals of admixture association, in which the SUM and QSUM scores may produce higher association signals than MIX and QATT. As a future direction, we note that an improved score for non-randomly ascertained quantitative traits could potentially be developed, which would generalize both the MIX score for dichotomous traits and the QATT score for randomly ascertained quantitative traits. As GWAS in European populations have demonstrated, association statistics need not be limited to SNPs that have been genotyped, because imputation algorithms that we and others have developed can be used to infer the genotypes of untyped SNPs by making use of haplotype information from HapMap. Our methods also perform well in the setting of imputation, when the causal SNP is not genotyped. As future work we consider the extension of our likelihood based scores to fully account for imputation uncertainty, where a promising direction is to define the likelihood as a full integration over the missing data given the observed data and the parameters of the model[46],[47]. Our results using simulated phenotypes show that, although benefiting from a reduced multiple-hypothesis testing burden, the admixture scoring yields lower power for finding associations when compared to SNP association scoring. An explanation is the limited number of SNPs that show high allelic differentiation among the ancestral populations( e. g., in our simulations only 7. 6% of the SNPs have an allelic differentiation greater than 0. 4 between Europeans and Africans). However, we note that the question of whether there exists a combined SNP and admixture score that benefits from reduced multiple hypothesis testing for the admixture component of the score is an important open question that requires further consideration. While this paper focuses on frequentist approaches for disease scoring in admixed populations, we mention that joint modeling of admixture and SNP association signals could be developed in a Bayesian framework[48]. For example, SNPs that lie in regions of high admixture signals could be given a higher prior of association with phenotype. We expect this type of approach to provide added value especially in regions with multiple independent causal variants in which region-based scores could yield increased signal over marginal SNP scores. Although in this work we have focused on African Americans, in theory our approaches can be extended to other admixed populations such as Latino populations, which inherit ancestry from up to three continental ancestral( European, Native American and African) populations. The approaches presented in this work can be extended to three-way admixed populations either by considering one ancestry versus the rest strategy or by jointly modeling the three ancestry odds ratios so that a single SNP odds ratio would lead to implied ancestry odds ratios for each ancestry. However, we caution that in the context of Latino populations, more work is needed to assess the performance and possible biases of the local ancestry estimates and its potential effects on methods that incorporate admixture and case-control signals into disease scoring statistics. A final consideration is in fine-mapping causal loci. Here the availability of samples—or chromosomal segments—of distinct ancestry is valuable[38] for localization of the causal variant. We note that the HET score could be used in localizing the causal variant under the hypothesis of no heterogeneity across populations; recent studies have provided empirical support for this hypothesis[49]. Importantly, by comparing MIX and SUM score the question whether the admixture signal is fully explained by the SNP odds ratio can be assessed. An important open question and future research direction is designing optimal algorithms for cross-population fine mapping that leverage the different LD patterns among the chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry.","answer":"This paper presents improved methodologies for the analysis of genome-wide association studies in admixed populations , which are populations that came about by the mixing of two or more distant continental populations over a few hundred years ( e . g . , African Americans or Latinos ) .

It was discovered recently, that exploiting the sparsity of sources in an appropriate representation according to some signal dictionary, dramatically improves the quality of separation. In this work we use the property of multi scale transforms, such as wavelet or wavelet packets, to decompose signals into sets of local features with various degrees of sparsity. We use this intrinsic property for selecting the best (most sparse) subsets of features for further separation. The performance of the algorithm is verified on noise-free and noisy data. Experiments with simulated signals, musical sounds and images demonstrate significant improvement of separation quality over previously reported results.","answer":"[[\\"wavelet or wavelet packets\\", \\"multi scale transforms\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"simulated signals\\", \\"separation quality\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"images\\", \\"separation quality\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"simulated signals\\", \\"musical sounds\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"musical sounds\\", \\"separation quality\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"instantaneous linear mixtures\\", \\"blind source separation\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"quality of separation\\", \\"sparsity of sources\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"musical sounds\\", \\"images\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"noise-free and noisy data\\", \\"algorithm\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"signal dictionary\\", \\"sparsity of sources\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

RNA was obtained from purified, biologically paired MK and EB cultures and compared using cDNA microarrays. Bioinformatical analysis of MK-up-regulated genes identified 151 transcripts encoding transmembrane domain-containing proteins. Although many of these were known platelet genes, a number of previously unidentified or poorly characterized transcripts were also detected. Many of these transcripts, including G6b, G6f, LRRC32, LAT2, and the G protein-coupled receptor SUCNR1, encode proteins with structural features or functions that suggest they may be involved in the modulation of platelet function. Immunoblotting on platelets confirmed the presence of the encoded proteins, and flow cytometric analysis confirmed the expression of G6b, G6f, and LRRC32 on the surface of platelets. Through comparative analysis of expression in platelets and other blood cells we demonstrated that G6b, G6f, and LRRC32 are restricted to the platelet lineage, whereas LAT2 and SUCNR1 were also detected in other blood cells. The identification of the succinate receptor SUCNR1 in platelets is of particular interest, because physiologically relevant concentrations of succinate were shown to potentiate the effect of low doses of a variety of platelet agonists.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"succinate\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"succinate receptor\\", \\"G6b\\", \\"platelet receptors\\", \\"G6f\\", \\"LRRC32\\", \\"LAT2\\", \\"SUCNR1\\", \\"G protein-coupled receptor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS: Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for >/=15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). CONCLUSION: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results.","answer":"[\\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a spontaneous, X-linked, progressively fatal disease of dogs and is also a homologue of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Two-thirds of DMD patients carry detectable deletions in their dystrophin gene. The defect underlying the remaining one-third of DMD patients is undetermined. Analysis of the canine dystrophin gene in normal and GRMD dogs has failed to demonstrate any detectable loss of exons. Here, we have demonstrated a RNA processing error in GRMD that results from a single base change in the 3 consensus splice site of intron 6. The seventh exon is then skipped, which predicts a termination of the dystrophin reading frame within its N-terminal domain in exon 8.

point '' correlator : @xmath3 one immediate problem with those definitions is that these are not strictly speaking a two  point functions .the distance @xmath4 depends on the geometry contrary to the usual fixed lattice case and it can not be pulled out of the average .this leaves us with the average of a very non - local object .the next problem is the definition of the connected correlation functions .the straightforward standard substraction fails as was shown in @xcite .the authors of @xcite propose instead : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the average of the observable @xmath7 over the spherical shells of radius @xmath8 .this definition has nice properties , namely it vanishes with increasing @xmath8 as we would expect for a correlation fuction .but it does not integrate to a susceptibility . a definition which does integrate to a susceptibility was proposed in @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the usual average of @xmath7 over all the points of the lattice .    in the case of the fixed geometry @xmath11 and both definitions give indentical resultsthis is not so for fluctuating geometries .we plotted the two definitions with the observable being regge curvature in simplicial 4d gravity in figure  [ f1 ] .they differ quite distinctly .the short distance behavior it totally different . for the large distancesone can see that the definition ( [ def2 ] ) begins to deviate from zero , and as we will show later this is not due to errors but it is an intrinsic property of this function .as to get some idea as to what causes those differences we can look at those function from the point of view of probability theory .    let s suppose that we make list of all pairs of points separated by the distance @xmath8 on all configurations . to each pairwe assign a weight equal to the weight of the configuration times the volume elements of each point .we pick up a pair at random from this weighted list .the values of observable @xmath7 at each point of the pair will then define two random variables : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .then @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the expectation value of the operator @xmath7 .the expression on the right hand side of this equation is zero if and only if the two variables are independent , so the definition ( [ def1 ] ) provides a direct measure of the degree of correlation between the values of observable @xmath7 in points at the distance @xmath8 apart .    to interpret the definition ( [ def2 ] ) we have to proceed a little differently .we make up a list of all points on all configurations . to every pointwe asign the weight of the configuration times its volume element .we pick up the random point @xmath16 from the list .we define now two random variables : @xmath17 the value of observable @xmath7 at the point and @xmath18 the volume of the spherical shell of radius @xmath8 around this point. then @xmath19 it easy to check that the square of the expresion on the left - hand side of the above equation is the difference between the definitions ( [ def1 ] ) and ( [ def2 ] ) .so the definition ( [ def2 ] ) mixes in also the correlations between the value of an observable and the volume of spherical shell around it .to study these issues in more detail than permitted by todays status of the simplicial gravity simulations one can use other models of random geometry .one of such models is the branched polymer@xcite .this model can be solved and correlation functions can be calculated for operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath20 is the number of branches of vertex @xmath16 @xcite .interesting features of this particular model are that it describes the elongated phase of 4d simplicial gravity @xcite , and that it exibits a phase transition between a \`\` short '' and a \`\` long '' phase reminiscent of the transition in 4d simplicial gravity@xcite .the results from this model for the function ( [ def1 ] ) are the following : + i ) in the grand canonical ensemble this function is zero for positve values of @xmath8 .this in a sense is a defining feature of the model : the branching probabilities are independent .+ ii ) in the canonical ensemble this function in the thermodynamical limit is power  like : @xmath22 the correlations appear because the number of vertices is fixed .this is to be expected , but what is unusual is that those correlation persist even when the number of vertices grows to infinity. a possible mechanism could be the following : if we know that a vertex has one branch then its unique neighbour must have more than one branch , this introduces a correlation between nearest neighbour vertices which does not depend on the number of vertices .we believe that this effect is propagated to longer distances .+ iii ) finite size effects alter this behaviour with the net effect of flattening the function at large @xmath8 .    in figure [ f2 ]we have ploted the results of mc simulations in the elongated phase of 4d simplicial gravity .the effects described above are clearly visible : the functions are power like at short distances ( with power exponent equal to 2.0 within errors ) and then flatten due to the finite size with very good accord to the bp predictions .    for the definition ( [ def2 ] ) the results from bp are :+ i ) this function is not zero in the grand canonical ensemble . althought the formula ( [ pb2 ] ) is not valid in this ensemble a similar interpretation exists .this shows that this function contains also the correlations between the number of vertices at some distance from the point , and the number of branches of this point .those are clearly dependent even in the grand canonical ensemble .+ ii ) in the canonical ensemble this definition is zero in thermodynamical limit ( @xmath23 ) .this implies a strong relation between branch - branch and branch - volume correlation , which is probably specific to the bp model .+ iii ) the convergence to the thermodynamical limit is not uniform . in particular the function will tend away from zero for @xmath24 for any finite volume .these results are illustrated in the figure  [ f3 ] .it shows the @xmath25 correlation functions for branched polymers of various sizes .as the size increases the functions go to zero for any fixed @xmath8 .however for each fixed size if we increase @xmath8 the functions will eventually go away from zero .we also see that this behavior agrees qualitatively with the results of mc simulations shown on figure  [ f1 ] .we have compared two definitions of connected correlation functions on the fluctuating geometries .both were introduced in the context of simplicial gravity , each with a different goal in mind . to really compare and understand them we need a more profound understanding of the theory that we have now .one way to proceed is to study finite size scaling .this was the way proposed in @xcite .the other way is to study the interaction of particles in the theory , this is in the spirit of @xcite .it may happen that the functions describing the finite size scaling and the interaction potential are different .both goals are still to be attained , and are quite difficult to pursue due to the enormous time required by simulations and very few theorethical results .that is why we propose the bp model as a very promising tool for gaining insight into these issues .as shown above this model provides an excellent description of the elongated phase of simplicial 4d gravity . in view of results from @xcite it canhopefully also provide information about the critical region .i would like to thank z.  burda , b.  petersson and j.  smit for many helpful comments and discussions .the simulations were done on the sp2 computer at sara .this work was supported by stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom ) and partially by kbn ( grant 2p03b 196 02 ) .99 b.  de  bakker , j.  smit , nucl . phys .* b454 * ( 1995 ) 343 .p.  bialas , z.  burda , a.  krzywicki , b.  petersson nucl .b472 * ( 1996 ) 293 .j.  ambjrn , b.  durhuus , j.  frhlich , p.  orland nucl . phys .* b270 * ( 1986 ) 457 .p.  bialas , phys . lett .* b373 * ( 1996 ) 289 .j.  ambjrn , j.  jurkiewicz , nucl . phys .* b541 * ( 1995 ) 643 .p.  bialas , z.  burda _ phase transition in fluctuating branched geometry _hep -

BACKGROUND: Anthropogenic activities cause metal pollution worldwide. Plants can absorb and accumulate these metals through their root system, inducing stress as a result of excess metal concentrations inside the plant. Ethylene is a regulator of multiple plant processes, and is affected by many biotic and abiotic stresses. Increased ethylene levels have been observed after exposure to excess metals but it remains unclear how the increased ethylene levels are achieved at the molecular level. In this study, the effects of cadmium (Cd) exposure on the production of ethylene and its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), and on the expression of the ACC Synthase (ACS) and ACC Oxidase (ACO) multigene families were investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS: Increased ethylene release after Cd exposure was directly measurable in a system using rockwool-cultivated plants; enhanced levels of the ethylene precursor ACC together with higher mRNA levels of ethylene responsive genes: ACO2, ETR2 and ERF1 also indicated increased ethylene production in hydroponic culture. Regarding underlying mechanisms, it was found that the transcript levels of ACO2 and ACO4, the most abundantly expressed members of the ACO multigene family, were increased upon Cd exposure. ACC synthesis is the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis, and transcript levels of both ACS2 and ACS6 showed the highest increase and became the most abundant isoforms after Cd exposure, suggesting their importance in the Cd-induced increase of ethylene production. CONCLUSIONS: Cadmium induced the biosynthesis of ACC and ethylene in Arabidopsis thaliana plants mainly via the increased expression of ACS2 and ACS6. This was confirmed in the acs2-1acs6-1 double knockout mutants, which showed a decreased ethylene production, positively affecting leaf biomass and resulting in a delayed induction of ethylene responsive gene expressions without significant differences in Cd contents between wild-type and mutant plants.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"ACC Synthase\\", \\"ETR2\\", \\"ACO2\\", \\"ERF1\\", \\"ACC Oxidase\\", \\"acs2\\", \\"acs6\\", \\"ACO\\", \\"ACS\\", \\"ACO4\\", \\"ACS2\\", \\"ACS6\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Previous studies have shown that retinoic acid (RA), similar to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), can act as a bifunctional regulator of the growth of bone marrow progenitors, in that it can stimulate granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) -or interleukin-3 (IL-3) -induced GM colony formation, but potently inhibit G-CSF-induced growth. The present study, using highly enriched human CD34 + as well as Lin-murine bone marrow progenitor cells, demonstrates a potent inhibitory effect of 9-cis-RA on burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colony formation regardless of the cytokine stimulating growth. Specifically, 9-cis-RA potently inhibited the growth of BFU-E response to erythropoietin (Epo) (100%), stem cell factor (SCF) + Epo (92%), IL-3 + Epo (97%), IL-4 + Epo (88%), and IL-9 + Epo (100%). Erythroid colony growth was also inhibited when CD34 + progenitors were seeded at one cell per well, suggesting a direct action of RA. Using synthetic ligands to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) that selectively bind and activate RAR-RXR or RXR-RXR dimers, respectively, we dissected the involvement of the two retinoid response pathways in the regulation of normal myeloid and erythroid progenitor cell growth. Transactivation studies showed that both the RAR (Ro 13-7410) and RXR (Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386) ligands were highly selective at 100 nmol / L. At this concentration, Ro 13-7410 potently inhibited G-CSF-stimulated myeloid as well as SCF + Epo-induced erythroid colony growth. At the same concentration, Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 had little or no effect on G-CSF-induced colony formation, whereas they inhibited 75% and 53%, respectively, of SCF + Epo-stimulated BFU-E colony growth. Thus, the RAR-RXR response pathway can signal growth inhibition of normal bone marrow myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells. In addition, we demonstrate a unique involvement of the RXR-RXR pathway in mediating growth inhibition of erythroid but not myeloid progenitor cells.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"Lin -  murine bone marrow progenitor\\", \\"human CD34 + erythroid progenitor cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"myeloid progenitor cells\\", \\"CD34 + progenitors\\", \\"normal bone marrow myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells\\", \\"erythroid\\", \\"bone marrow progenitors\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Epo\\", \\"RAR\\", \\"TNF - alpha\\", \\"RAR - RXR\\", \\"IL - 3\\", \\"SCF\\", \\"G - CSF\\", \\"the\\", \\"RXR - RXR\\", \\"RARs\\", \\"erythropoietin\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor - alpha\\", \\"RXRs\\", \\"IL - 9\\", \\"retinoic acid receptors\\", \\"IL - 4\\", \\"retinoid X receptors\\", \\"human CD34 +\\", \\"stem cell factor\\", \\"RXR\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Interactions between treatments with coumaphos, bishydroxycoumarin (an anticoagulant), trichlorfon (an organophosphorous compound), and phenobarbital sodium (an inducer of microsomal enzymes) were investigated in sheep. A daily dose of 2 mg of coumaphos/kg of body weight for 6 days did not affect the plasma enzymes or the antiprothrombinemic effect of bishydroxy-coumarin in wethers. The treatment of ewes with an intravenous (IV) injection of trichlorfon, insufficient to produce significant inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, appeared to produce additive effects with those produced by subsequent treatment with 4 mg of coumaphos/kg/day. In ewes given 40 mg of phenobarbital sodium/kg for 5 days intraperitoneally (IP), the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of coumaphos/kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present. Treatment with daily doses of 2 mg of coumaphos/kg for 6 days did not modify the anticholinesterase effect of a 2nd series of treatments given 6 weeks later.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"phenobarbital sodium\\", \\"bishydroxy-coumarin\\", \\"bishydroxycoumarin\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"organophosphorous compound\\", \\"anticoagulant\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": [\\"trichlorfon\\", \\"coumaphos\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Design : Prospect i ve cohort study ( Whitehall II study ) . At the first phase of the study ( 1985–1988 ) , data on self reported psychosocial work characteristics were collected from all participants . Participants were followed up until the end of phase 5 ( 1997–2000 ) , with mean length of follow up of 11 years . Setting : London based office staff in 20 civil service departments . Participants : 6895 male and 3413 female civil servants aged 35–55 . Outcome measures : Incident vali date d CHD . Main results : People with concurrent low decision latitude and high dem and s ( job strain ) were at the highest risk for CHD . High job dem and s , and , less consistently , low decision latitude , predicted CHD incidence . The effect of job strain on CHD incidence was strongest among younger workers , but there was no effect modification by social support at work , or employment grade . Conclusions : Job strain , high job dem and s , and , to some extent , low decision latitude , are associated with an increased risk of CHD among British civil servantsTitle 2:Work characteristics predict psychiatric disorder: prospective results from the Whitehall II Study.Abstract 2:OBJECTIVES : The impact of work on the risk of future  psychiatric disorder has been examined in few longitudinal studies . This was examined prospect ively in a large epidemiological study of civil servants . METHODS : In the Whitehall II study , a longitudinal , prospect i ve cohort study of 6895 male and 3413 female London based civil servants , work characteristics measured at baseline ( phase 1 : 1985 - 8 ) and first follow up ( phase 2 : 1989 ) were used to predict psychiatric disorder measured by a 30 item  general health question naire ( GHQ )  at phase 2 and phase 3 follow up ( phase 3 : 1991 - 3 ) .  Work characteristics and GHQ  were measured at all three phases . RESULTS : Low social support at work and low decision authority , high job dem and s and effort-reward imbalance were associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorder as assessed by the GHQ at follow up adjusting for age , employment grade , and baseline GHQ score . CONCLUSIONS : Social support and control at work protect mental health while high job dem and s and effort-reward imbalance are risk factors for future psychiatric disorder . Intervention at the level of work design , organisation , and management might have positive effects on mental health in working populationTitle 3:Low job control and risk of coronary heart disease in whitehall ii (prospective cohort) studyAbstract 3:Abstract Objective : To determine the association between adverse psychosocial characteristics at work and risk of coronary heart disease among male and female civil servants . Design : Prospect i ve cohort study ( Whitehall II study ) . At the baseline examination ( 1985 - 8 ) and twice during follow up a self report question naire provided information on psychosocial factors of the work environment and coronary heart disease . Independent assessment s of the work environment were obtained from personnel managers at baseline . Mean length of follow up was 5.3 years . Setting : London based office staff in 20 civil service departments . Subjects : 10 308 civil servants aged 35 - 55 were examined-6895 men ( 67 % ) and 3413 women ( 33 % ) . Main outcome measures : New cases of angina ( Rose question naire ) , severe pain across the chest , diagnosed ischaemic heart disease , and any coronary event . Results : Men and women with low job control , either self reported or independently assessed , had a higher risk of newly reported coronary heart disease during follow up . Job control assessed on two occasions three years apart , although intercorrelated , had cumulative effects on newly reported disease . Subjects with low job control on both occasions had an odds ratio for any subsequent coronary event of 1.93 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.34 to 2.77 ) compared with subjects with high job control at both occasions . This association could not be explained by employment grade , negative affectivity , or classic coronary risk factors . Job dem and s and social support at work were not related to the risk of coronary heart disease . Conclusions : Low control in the work environment is associated with an increased risk of future coronary heart disease  among men and women employed in government offices . The cumulative effect of low job control assessed on two occasions indicates that giving employees more variety in tasks and a stronger say in decisions about work may decrease the risk of coronary heart disease . Key messages Low job control in the work environment contributes to the development of coronary heart disease among British male and female civil servants The risk of heart disease is associated with both objective low job control and perceived low job control . Increase in job control over time decreases the risk of coronary heart disease . This suggests that policies giving people a stronger say in decisions about their work or providing them with more variety in work tasks may contribute to better cardiovascularTitle 4:Effects of a Dutch work-site wellness-health program: the Brabantia Project.Abstract 4:OBJECTIVES This study examined a project design ed to improve the health and wellness of employees of Brabantia , a Dutch manufacturer of household goods , by means of lifestyle changes and changes in working conditions . METHODS The workers at one Brabantia site constituted the experimental group , and the workers from two other sites formed the  control group .  Biomedical variables , lifestyles , general stress reactions , and quality of work were measured identically in both groups at baseline and 1 , 2 , and 3 years later . During this period , there was continuous registration of absenteeism . RESULTS The interventions brought about favorable short-term changes in terms of health risks , and there were stable effects on working conditions ( especially decision latitude ) and absenteeism . CONCLUSIONS A combination of interventions directed at both lifestyles and the work environment can produce extensive and stable effects on health-related variables , wellness , and absenteeismTitle 5:Job decision latitude, job demands, and cardiovascular disease: a prospective study of Swedish men.Abstract 5:The association between specific job characteristics and subsequent cardiovascular disease was tested using a large r and om sample of the male working Swedish population . The prospect i ve development of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) symptoms and signs was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression technique . Additionally , a case-controlled study was used to analyze all cardiovascular-cerebrovascular ( CHD-CVD ) deaths during a six-year follow-up . The indicator of CHD symptoms and signs was vali date d in a six-year prospect i ve study of CHD deaths ( st and ardized mortality ratio 5.0 ; p less than or equal to .001 ) . A hectic and psychologically dem and ing job increases the risk of developing CHD symptoms and signs ( st and ardized odds ratio 1.29 , p less than 0.25 ) and premature CHD-CVD death ( relative risk 4.0 , p less than .01 ) . Low decision latitude-expressed as low intellectual discretion and low personal schedule freedom-is also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease . Low intellectual discretion predicts the development of CHD symptoms and signs ( SOR 1.44 , p less than .01 ) , while low personal schedule freedom among the majority of workers with the minimum statutory education increases the risk of CHD-CVD death ( RR 6.6 , p less than .0002 ) . The associations exist after controlling for age , education , smoking , and overweightTitle 6:Effects of work-related stress reduction on depressive symptoms among Japanese blue-collar workers.Abstract 6:OBJECTIVES The effects of a stress reduction program on Japanese blue-collar workers were investigated using a controlled trial design . METHODS Two blue-collar worksites that showed higher depression scores ( Zung self-rating depression score ) were selected for the  intervention  group , after a survey of a large electric company in 1985 . Three blue-collar worksites were selected as a reference group whose workers were matched with the workers of the interventive worksites by mean age , worksite size and mean depression scores . A 1-year stress reduction program was conducted in the intervention group from 1986 to 1987 by worksite supervisors . Effects of the stress reduction program were assessed by comparing the initial depression scores , length of sick leave , and systolic and diastolic blood pressures with those after the follow-up . RESULTS The depression scores decreased during the follow-up in the intervention group , while the scores were almost the same in the reference group . An analysis of covariance with repeated measurements indicated a statistically significant intervention ( group x time interaction ) effect after control for gender and age ( P = 0.035 ) . Sick leave in the past year decreased in 1988 only in the intervention group ; generalized logit analysis with repeated measurements indicated a statistically significant intervention effect after control for gender and age ( P = 0.034 ) . No statistically significant intervention effects were observed on systolic and diastolic blood pressures or selected work stressors . CONCLUSIONS A stress reduction program directed towards worksite supervisors can be used to reduce depressive symptoms and sick leave among Japanese blue-collar workers","answer":"Changes to the psychosocial work environment were found to have important and generally beneficial effects on health ."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

This process, known as inversion, has recently drawn considerable attention for GANs, e.g., zhu2016generative ; abdal2019image2stylegan ; alaluf2022hyperstyle ; roich2021pivotal ; zhu2020domain ; tov2021designing ; Wang2021HighFidelityGI ; xia2021gan , but has not yet been fully addressed for text-guided diffusion models. Our key observation is that the structure and appearances of the generated image depend not only on the random seed, but also on the interaction between the pixels to the text embedding through the diffusion process.

to - profound hearing loss .ci indications have expanded to allow for the restoration of moderate - to - severe hearing loss . for this purpose ,preservation of the cochlear architecture is essential.1   von ilberg et al2 first described a cochlear surgery that preserved residual hearing .substantial progress has been made in cochlear surgical techniques , including the development of atraumatic cochleostomy and round window electrode insertion and the use of intraoperative lubricant solutions , which improved the ability to slide the electrode into the cochlea .additionally , new implants are continuously being developed , and the improvements in electrode design have facilitated atraumatic surgery with the aim of preserving residual hearing.1 skarzynski et al3 and bento et al4 have demonstrated that residual hearing can be preserved during ci surgery .progress in cochlear implant surgical techniques and technology have brought a new interest in bimodal stimulation .the bimodal stimulation results in less noise and improved musical perception.5   intralabyrinthine schwannomas ( ils ) are tumors that primarily arise from within the membranous labyrinth ( the cochlea , vestibule , and semi - circular canals ) .to date , only 137 cases have been reported.6 salzman et al presented an anatomically based classification system for ils , including intravestibular , intracochlear , vestibulocochlear , transmodiolar , transmacular , and transotic .intracochlear schwannomas ( ics ) are the dominant ils type according to this classification system .the treatment of ics depends on tumor size and growth.6 the degree of hearing loss , the presence of vestibular symptoms , and the pathologic diagnosis must also be considered.7   hearing preservation has not yet been reported in patients undergoing resection of intracochlear schwannomas .anacusis often occurs as a result of the natural history of the tumor or after surgical removal.8   this study describes a minimally invasive procedure for intracochlear schwannoma resection with simultaneous cochlear implantation that resulted in good hearing . to our knowledge , we are the first to report an ics with a ci during the same surgery procedure and that is our report 's main contribution .kronenberg et al do report an ics with a ci , but their ics was incidentally discovered during surgery and the ci performed three years later , whereas ours was previously diagnosed and planned to perform during the same surgery .the score was 100% in closed set and 30% in open set presentation of topic -

unrecognized complication of intravenous drug abuse this painless syndrome appears during or after a long period of drug addiction it involves the hands and sometimes the forearms and may cause functional aesthetic and social disturbances when the hand volume is important physiopathological mechanisms of the puffy hand syndrome are unclear and include venous and lymphatic insufficiencies infectious complications and direct toxicity of injected drugs and their adulterants low stretch bandage and elastic garment usually used in lymphedema treatment are proposed to treat the puffy hand syndrome.we studied the pathogenesis of puffy hand syndrome of intravenous drug use we hypothesized that injections of high dose sublingual buprenorphine instead of the recommended sublingual administration could play an important role in lymphatic obstruction and destruction we set up a case control study in substitution centres recruiting intravenous drug addicts with and without puffy hands respectively the subjects were asked to answer anonymously a questionnaire of 40 items comprising social and demographic status history of illicit drugs use buprenorphine misuse and injection practices we included 33 cases and 33 controls mean age of 34 years they were past heroin users mainly methadone substituted in multivariate analysis sex women or 8 9 p 0 03 injections in the hands or 5 9 p 0 03 injections in the feet or 6 5 p 0 01 and the absence of tourniquet or 7 0 p 0 02 were significant risk factors for puffy hand syndrome in 69 7 of the cases and 59 4 of the controls respectively there was a high dose sublingual buprenorphine misuse although it appeared not to be a significant risk factor for puffy hand syndrome injection practices are likely to cause puffy hands syndrome but buprenorphine misuse should not be considered as a significant risk factor however intravenous drug users must still be warned of local and systemic complications of intravenous drug misuse.puffy hand in long term intravenous drug usersnarcotic addiction may induce systemic and local complications intravenous injections of drugs can cause venous thrombosis and septic or embolic complications the puffy hand sign is a more uncommon complication of hard core injection addicts three long term intravenous drug users two males one female mean age 30 6 years 26 37 presented puffy hands these patients had been drug addicts for four to twelve years mean duration 7 3 years and had stopped heroin injections for 3 5 years mean 4 6 participating in a buprenorphine substitution program the edema appeared several years after drug cessation 1 5 5 mean 2 3 typically the puffiness was bilateral the hands swollen from the proximal segments of the fingers to the wrist in one patient the edema was localized both in the hands and in the feet the edema was not pitting and unaffected by elevation duplex ultrasound examination of the extremities was normal lymphangiography performed in one patient was consistent with deep lymphatic destruction puffy hand syndrome appears to be the end result of lymphatic obstruction repeated injections of drugs in or outside the veins destroy the lymphatics buprenorphine may play an important role in the puffy hand sign although it is supposed to be administered orally many drug addicts use it as an i v solution because buprenorphine is poorly soluble it causes lymphatic obstruction this type of hand for which no therapy exists must be differentiated from deep palmar space infection with dorsal edema which requires incision and drainage.puffy hand syndrome is a complication of intravenous drug abuse which has no current available treatment arm and forearm edema are voluminous and cause functional and aesthetic disturbances we report two cases successfully treated by low stretch bandages a 40 year old man and a 34 year old woman both intravenous drug users with puffy hand syndrome were hospitalized for 11 days treatment included daily multilayer bandaging lymphedema volumes calculated by utilizing the formula for a truncated cone decreased by 16 on the left side and 12 on the right side for the first patient and 31 and 17 for the second hand circumference decreased 4 3 cm on the left side and 3 2 cm on the right side in case 1 and 2 5 cm and 1 9 cm respectively for case 2 the patients were taught self bandaging techniques during their hospital stays elastic gloves were fitted at the end of treatment reduction of lymphedema volume remained stable after 18 months in one patient while for the second patient further treatment and hospitalization were required due to poor compliance the pathogenesis of this edema is probably multifactorial venous lymphatic insufficiency and the direct toxicity of injected drugs lymphedema treatment currently consists of low stretch bandaging and wearing elastic garments which is effective in decreasing the volume of puffy hand syndrome.the incidence of vascular complications due to drug abuse is at present increasing due to new types of drugs and to the different ways of intake of such substances the vascular complications related to drug abuse may affect venous arterious and lymphatic districts and in particular ischemia following intra arterial injections arterious and venous pseudoaneurysm vasculitis aneurysms aortic dissections abscesses complicated by erosions of vessels arteriovenous fistulas compartment syndrome superficial and deep venous thrombosis septic trombophlebitis puffy hand syndrome the scientific knowledge in this matter is incomplete because of the new pathological cases and the lack of information regarding the efficacy of different treatments the authors report four patients affected by vascular pathologies due to drug abuse in one case a heroin addict has undergone multiple fasciotomies for compartimental syndrome arising because the patient maintained an innatural posture for several hours during an overdose coma in a second case a segmental right subclavear deep venous thrombosis has been treated by pharmacological therapy with satisfactory functional recovery of the arm a third patient has been successfully submitted to intra arterial pharmacological vasodilatation for generalised lower limbs vasospasm caused by drug abuse in the last case the voluntary swallowing of a great dose of cocaine caused the patient s death after multiple ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebral episodes after the description of these cases a review of the recent literature and some observations on this topic are presented a better knowledge of vascular complications due to drug abuse should improve the therapeutical approach of these patients.intravenous drug addiction is responsible for many complications especially cutaneous and infectious there is a syndrome rarely observed in rheumatology resulting in puffy hands the puffy hand syndrome we report two cases of this condition from our rheumatologic consultation our two patients had intravenous drug addiction they presented with an edema of the hands bilateral painless no pitting occurring in one of our patient during heroin intoxication and in the other 2 years after stopping injections in our two patients additional investigations biological radiological ultrasound were unremarkable which helped us in the context to put the diagnosis of puffy hand syndrome the pathophysiology still unclear is based in part on a lymphatic toxicity of drugs and their excipients there is no etiological treatment but elastic compression by night has improved edema of the hands in one of our patients.puffy hand syndrome develops after long term intravenous drug addiction it is characterized by a nonpitting edema affecting the dorsal side of fingers and hands with puffy aspect frequency and severity of the complications of this syndrome are rarely reported local infectious complications such as cellulitis can be severe and can enable the diagnosis herein we report the case of a 41 year old man who went to the emergency department for abdominal pain fever and bullous lesions of legs and arms with edema bacteriologic examination of a closed bullous lesion evidenced a methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus the abdomen computed tomography excluded deep infections and peritoneal effusion the patient was successfully treated by intravenous oxacillin and clindamycin he had a previous history of intravenous heroin addiction we retained the diagnosis of puffy hand syndrome revealed by a severe staphylococcal infection with toxic involvement mimicking a four limbs cellulitis puffy hand syndrome apart from the chronic lymphedema treatment has no specific medication available

Radicals are involved in many enzymatic reactions. Also, oxidative damage to proteins is generally initiated by radicals. For both, knowledge of reliable X−H bond dissociation energies (BDEs, X = C, N, O, S) for amino acids in proteins is important. X−H BDEs allow to predict which hydrogen atom abstractions will be thermodynamically possible, and which lesion sites can be repaired by cellular antioxidants. Preferred sites of radical attack and hydrogen atom abstraction are those associated with the lowest energy barriers, and, according to the Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle, 1,2 these reactions are typically the most exothermic. Therefore, X−H BDEs can also provide a valuable input for machine learning models for the elucidation of the kinetics and mechanisms of radical reactions in proteins.</p><p>The BDE is defined as the enthalpy required to homolytically cleave a given bond X−Y: 3</p><p>Instead of computing BDEs directly using Equation 1, BDEs can also be calculated using the isodesmic reaction method. 4 An isodesmic reaction is a reaction in which the number of bonds of each bond type is preserved. If an experimental BDE of a reference compound Y−H, BDE(Y−H) exp , is known, one can compute the enthalpy change associated with an isodesmic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a compound of interest X−H to that reference energies for C α −H abstraction in amino acids by HO • it showed the best performance out of the tested methods. 12 This study builds upon and extends previous results in four aspects: (1) by choosing a level of theory that is very well suited for the treatment of radical reactions, (2) by using a set of reference compounds which correspond better to the local environment in proteins by including more neighbors of the radical center, (3) by using model peptides with C and N termini extended by the next two atoms in the protein backbone, thereby directly modeling the local environment of the amino acid in a protein, and (4) by including BDEs for aspartate, glutamate, dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, an acetylated N terminus, and an anionic or amidated C terminus, as well as for the lowest-lying tautomer of arginine. The resulting dataset, being both reliable and comprehensive, can provide the basis for computationally studying the rich radical chemistry of proteins.</p>H<p>Fig. 1 Reference compounds used to compute BDEs using the isodesmic reaction method. Reference bonds are highlighted and numbered.</p><p>BDEs in this work were mainly calculated using the hybrid BMK functional 7 with the 6-31+G(2df,p) basis set. For smaller amino acids, BDEs were also computed at the G4(MP2)-6X 8 level of theory. Additionally, calculations were performed using B3LYP/6-31G(d) to compare to previous literature results.</p><p>Reference compounds and bonds used in the isodesmic reaction method are depicted in Figure 1. Experimental BDEs were taken from Luo, 13 except for alanine, for which no experimental BDE is available. Instead, the BDE was computed directly using G4(MP2)-6X. Including alanine as a reference compound seemed preferable to the use of another compound because C α radicals are captodatively stabilized, 14 and a reference compound should include this special electronic stabilization if compensation of systematic errors is desired. BDEs of reference bonds computed at the G4(MP2)-6X and BMK/6-31+G(2df,p) levels of theory agree well with experimental values 13 (Table SI.1). The mean absolute errors (MAEs) are 6.2 kJ/mol and 8.6 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition to BDEs, bond dissociation free energies (BDFEs) are reported as well. BDFEs were calculated directly, i.e. analogously to Equation 1. Further experimental details are given in the SI. Optimized structures and results of the calculations can be found in the ESI.</p>Results and discussion<p>The electronic structure of the amino acids and thereby the BDEs are sensitive to their chemical surrounding. Hence, for proteins, adequate capping groups at the N and C termini that model the influence of the protein backbone must be used.</p><p>To assess to what extent the way the protein backbone is modeled influences the computed BDEs, we compared BDEs of the C α atom with varying capping groups. The way the protein backbone is modelled can be expected to have a particularly strong influence on the C α −H BDEs, not only because of the close proximity of the C α −H bond to the capping groups, but also because its radical is captodatively stabilized by the backbone amide groups. C α −H BDEs of glycine and alanine without and with capping groups corresponding to the next or the next two atoms along the peptide backbone were computed at the BMK/6-31+G(2df,p), B3LYP/6-31G(d), and G4(MP2)-6X level of theory. G4(MP2)-6X BDEs were computed directly, density functional theory (DFT) BDEs were obtained directly and using the isodesmic reaction method. The results are shown in Figure 2.</p><p>Capping alanine with a formyl and an amino group raises the C α −H BDE by around 30 kJ/mol compared to the free amino acid, indicating a significant influence of the protein backbone on BDEs. Calculations at the G4(MP2)-6X level of theory further show that, although the C α −H BDE of alanine as a free amino acid is lower than that of glycine as a free amino acid, already when considering the next atoms along the peptide backbone the relative order is reversed. The difference between the two BDEs becomes larger if one includes the next two atoms. This is in agreement with previous calculations at the G3(MP2)-RAD level of theory, 15 and can be rationalized by increased steric interactions for the C α alanine dipeptide radical that outcompete the inductive stabilization. 16 Therefore, both composite methods come to the conclusion that the C α −H BDE of glycine in a protein</p><p>His (N 3 -H) should be lower than that of alanine. At the BMK/6-31+G(2df,p) level of theory, this is reproduced for the acetyl and N-methyl capping groups. Hence, all X−H BDEs in this work were computed using these capping groups. The resulting peptide models are shown in Figure 3. At the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, the BDE of the alanine dipeptide remains higher than that of the glycine dipeptide even if acetyl and N-methyl capping groups are used, although the exact values are closer to the G4(MP2)-6X results than at the BMK/6-31+G(2df,p) level of theory. Consequently, if one were to use B3LYP, at least the next three atoms along the protein backbone would have to be included.</p><p>Compared to literature results computed with other composite methods using the isodesmic reaction method, G4(MP2)-6X seems to underestimate C α −H BDEs, but BMK C α −H BDEs computed using the isodesmic reaction method agree very well with composite level literature results (Table SI.2). BMK BDEs are also closer to high-level composite methods than DSD-PBE-P86/aug'cc-pVTZ+d BDEs reported by Chan et al. 12 . DFT, especially B3LYP, underestimates BDEs compared to G4(MP2)-6X if they are computed directly. Using the isodesmic reaction method, a large part of this deviation vanishes. This highlights the error-canceling power of the isodesmic reaction method.</p><p>We note that we were not able to reproduce the C α −H BDEs of glycine and alanine dipeptides reported by Moore et al., 5 or the BDEs of their reference compounds, although our calculations agree well with previous literature results. [17][18][19] Their reported BDEs also differ from previous literature results at the same level of theory and using the same reference compounds by as much as 9 kJ/mol, 18 and by over 30 kJ/mol compared to a study that uses glycine as a reference compound instead of alanine. 19 Importantly, we and others, 15 using composite methods or the BMK functional and the isodesmic reaction method, find the C α −H BDE of the glycine dipeptide to be lower than that of the alanine dipeptide, in contrast to Moore et al. who also report overall much lower BDEs for these two radicals. BMK BDEs are given in Table 1. G4(MP2)-6X BDEs of smaller amino acids can be found in Table 2. In general, BDEs at the BMK/6-31+G(2df,p) level of theory agree well with BDEs at G4(MP2)-6X level of theory (coefficient of determination of the linear fit, R 2 = 0.997, mean absolute deviation, MAD = 4.7 kJ/mol, Figure 4). Some X−H BDEs were also computed for model peptides with formyl and amino capping groups.    The BDEs for model peptides with larger and smaller capping groups correlate well with R 2 = 0.981 (Figure SI.1). C α −H BDEs, however, deviate unsystematically from the linear correlation, as also discussed above (see also Figure 2).</p><p>For the BDEs given in Table 1, peptides were modeled in a fully extended trans geometry (ω ≈ 180 • ), except for proline and hydroxyproline, where both cis and trans conformers were modeled by setting ω, φ , ψ, and ω ′ going from the N to the C terminus to approximately 0 • , −75 • , 160 • , 180 • , and 180 • , −75 • , 150 • , 180 • , respectively. 20 Where applicable, amino acids were considered in their charged and neutral forms. For histidine, the neutral N 1 −H and N 3 −H tautomers were considered. In the gas phase, the N 3 −H tautomer is more stable by 4.9 kJ/mol. For arginine, in agreement with previous investigations, 21 out of the five possible neutral tautomers, the one in which the two terminal N atoms are doubly protonated was found to be most stable, and so this tautomer was considered.</p><p>In some cases, initial geometry optimizations resulted in hydrogen bonding between the amino acid side chain and backbone to different extent in radical and non-radical structures. This intramolecular hydrogen bonding is well known, and has also been found in a comprehensive study of the conformational landscape of amino acid dipeptides. 22 For the computation of BDEs, this would lead to energetic artifacts. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding is unlikely to occur in proteins, since the backbone amide groups are involved in secondary structure formation. In aqueous solution, polar side chain groups will also be hydrogen-bonded to water molecules or coordinated to metal ions. Therefore, we aimed at minimizing intramolecular hydrogen bonding and changes in hydrogen bonding pattern. To this end, the same initial structure was used for geometry optimizations of both dipeptides and dipeptide radicals to reflect the potential structural constraints imposed by the protein that would make large conformational changes unlikely. Further efforts to this end are described in the SI. Yet, in some cases, significant changes in hydrogen bonding strength or pattern were observed, as specified in further detail in Table 1. B3LYP BDEs by Moore et al. 5 SI.3). Deviations from the BDEs reported by Zipse and colleagues 16,23 can be attributed to the fact that they use Boltzmann averages. The resulting difference is small for the BDEs in tyrosine, proline, and phenylalanine, since these amino acids have less conformationally flexible side chains, but becomes apparent for the BDEs in cysteine, where the side chain is more flexible. Deviations from the BDEs reported by Chan et al. 12 for amino acids with polar side chains come from the fact that they have used the lowest energy conformations of the peptides, which involve hydrogen bonding for those amino acids. In this work, hydrogen bonding in general and in particular changes in hydrogen bonding pattern between peptides and peptide radicals were avoided, and by design of our protocol the resulting conformers do not necessarily represent the most stable conformer.</p><p>Having a comprehensive dataset of BDEs at hand, we analyzed trends in the BDEs across the chemical space covered by the amino acids. The distribution of X−H BDEs for amino acids in proteins is shown in Figure 5. BDEs are grouped and colored according to the reference compound used in the isodesmic reaction. Since the reference compounds were chosen to correspond to the local chemical environment of the radical, Figure 5</p>Conclusion<p>BDEs of all X−H bonds in amino acids were computed using the isodesmic reaction method at the BMK/6-31+G(2df,p) and G4(MP2)-6X levels of theory. The BDE values agree well with high-level calculations, and improve upon previous literature results by using a more appropriate level of theory, reference compounds, and peptide model systems.</p>","answer":"Knowledge of reliable X−H bond dissociation energies (X = C, N, O, S) for amino acids in proteins is key for studying the radical chemistry of proteins.

The target of one inhibitor peptide, Pep80, identified in this screen was determined to be Snapin, a protein associated with the soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor adaptor protein receptor (SNARE) complex that is critical for calcium-dependent exocytosis during neurotransmission.Use of the genetically selected intracellular aptamer inhibitors allowed us to define unique mechanisms important to HIV-1 replication and T cell biology.This review will describe pre-clinical and clinical data of four major classes of TGF-β inhibitor, namely i) ligand traps, ii) antisense oligonucleotides, iii) receptor kinase inhibitors and iv) peptide aptamers.A peptide aptamer (ID1/3-PA7) has been designed to prevent this interaction and thereby leading to the transcription of p16(INK4a).A peptide kinase inhibitor (IP(20)) was used as the aptameric peptidePeptide aptamer mimicking RAD51-binding domain of BRCA2 inhibits DNA damage repair and survival in Trypanosoma brucei.peptide aptamer, Id1/3-PA7, targeting Id1 and Id3,Targeting Id1 and Id3 by a specific peptide aptamer induces E-box promoter activity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.Aptamer-derived peptides as potent inhibitors of the oncogenic RhoGEF Tgat.Our approach thus demonstrates that peptide aptamers are potent inhibitors that can be used to interfere with RhoGEF functions in vivo.Development of systemic in vitro evolution and its application to generation of peptide-aptamer-based inhibitors of cathepsin E.he fusion peptide, TA aptamer, was observed within PC12 cytoplasm and maintained both Abeta-binding ability and antioxygenic property similar to TRX.Stable expression of a novel fusion peptide of thioredoxin-1 and ABAD-inhibiting peptide protects PC12 cells from intracellular amyloid-beta.In order to efficiently select aptamers that bind to and inhibit proteins,Aptamer selection based on inhibitory activity using an evolution-mimicking algorithm.This demonstrates the utility of this strategy for screening aptamers based on their inhibitory actions.Intracellular expression of the DRD-binding peptide aptamer specifically suppressed receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis but not intrinsic pathway, which was recapitulated by the antisense oligonucleotides for FLASH.Peptide aptamers are peptides constrained and presented by a scaffold protein that are used to study protein function in cells. They are able to disrupt protein-protein interactionsHere we have used a genetic screen in yeast to select in vivo peptides coupled to thioredoxin, called aptamers, that could inhibit GEFD2 activity. One aptamer, TRIAPalpha (TRio Inhibitory APtamer), specifically blocks GEFD2-exchange activity on RhoA in vitro.These results show that cell proliferation can be inhibited using genetically-selected synthetic peptides that specifically target protein-protein interaction motifs within cell cycle regulators.These data highlight the utility of peptide aptamers to identify novel binding interfaces and highlight a role for MAP1B in DAPK-1-dependent signaling in autophagy and membrane blebbing.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

The combination of paclitaxel and doxorubicin yielded response rates between 63% and 93% in phase I/II studies. In these studies, however, the investigators reported severe cardiac toxic events. The rationale for the current study was therefore to evaluate the combination of paclitaxel/epirubicin, focusing mainly on cardiac toxicity. In two groups, 85 patients with metastatic breast cancer entered the study. Approximately 20% of the patients had primary metastatic breast cancer with large tumors at the primary site. Half of the patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy. Study medication in group A consisted of epirubicin 60 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 hour, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion after premedication with steroids, antihistamines, and H2-blockers. In group B , epirubicin 90 mg/m2 was combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 , given in the same manner as in group A. Dose escalation to 225 mg/m2 paclitaxel was planned in both groups. The main toxicity in both groups was neutropenia (73% World Health Organization grade 3/4 in group A and 93% in group B). Other hematologic side effects were rare. No febrile neutropenia was reported in group A, but two episodes occurred in group B. Peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia, and myalgia were mild (only World Health Organization grades 1 and 2). Alopecia was universal. In group A, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in 15 patients and to 225 mg/m2 in seven patients. Dose reduction due to severe neutropenia was necessary in 11 patients. No cardiac events were reported in group A. In group B, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in only one patient, and no patient reached 225 mg/m2. Three patients needed a dose reduction. In this group, one patient had a greater than 10% decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction with no clinical signs. In group A, 43 patients were evaluable for response; in group B, 25 patients were evaluable. Thirteen patients were out of protocol with only bone metastasis, and two patients had more than one prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The response rate was identical in both groups, with five complete remissions and 24 partial remissions in group A and three complete responses and 14 partial remissions in group B. The duration of response was 8.2 months in both groups. The median cumulative epirubicin dose was 420 mg/m2 in group A and 630 mg/m2 in group B. The combination of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and epirubicin 60 or 90 mg/m2 can be administered safely to patients with metastatic breast cancer. Although response was not the primary end point of this trial, the response data are nonetheless encouraging and suggest that further evaluation of this combination-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer is warranted.sentence: In group B , epirubicin 90 mg/m2 was combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 , given in the same manner as in group A.","answer":"[[\\"epirubicin\\", \\"paclitaxel\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

clinical trial , parallel design , was conducted at the faculty of dentistry of al - azhar university in egypt during 12 months ( december 2014 to november 2015 ) .this study was approved by the dental health department of the faculty of applied medical sciences , al baha university .the right of the participants to withdraw at any time was explained and preserved during the study .the study was registered in the international standard randomized controlled trials number ( isrctn ) registry with study i d ( isrctn94238244 ) .after exclusion of ineligible patients for whom the anterior - posterior dimensional measurements could not be standardized , the patients were distributed randomly using random tables .the three groups received complete dentures fabricated by one of the following base materials ( heat cure acrylic resin with conventional technique , heat cure acrylic resin with injection moulding technique , and cobalt chrome metallic ) .the first group received complete denture fabricated by heat cure acrylic resin with conventional technique ( meliodent , bayer dental , germany , batch number 54105l-2 ) curing cycles in acrylic furnace , at 165f for 9 ( acrylic furnace bego sommer , germany , batch 226 - 433 ) , the second group received complete denture fabricated by injection moulding technique of heat curing acrylic resin ( vertex thermosens , rigid , batch noxu373802 , usa ) , and the third group received complete denture fabricated by cobalt chrome metallic denture base ( bego metal denture base , germany , batch 233 - 42 ) , using the burnout furnace controlled electronically at ( 9501200)c fasting furnace ( bego , germany , batch 239270 ) .figure 1 shows the points used for distance measurement on dentures made of heat cure acrylic resin with conventional technique ( a ) , heat cure acrylic resin with injection moulding technique ( b ) , and cobalt chrome metallic material ( c ) .the commonly used method of assessing accuracy of denture dimension included measuring between set points on the denture base using caliper . during the last three decades, it was found that 60% of papers tackling dimensional stability of denture bases materials used microscopy and 25% utilized calipers instrument .furthermore , the use of calipers was proved to be a highly reliable instrument to assess oral vertical dimension .for all the patients , the construction of complete dentures started by primary impression that was taken by alginate .then , in the second visit secondary impression was taken by rubber base ( coltne swiss quality for dentistry , batch 4160 ) . in the third visit ,the jaw relationship was recorded , and in the fourth visit a try in the waxed denture ( cavex , holland , batch z.a 990.01 ) was obtained , followed by construction of denture base in the lab . to assess the anterior - posterior dimensional changes ,two different points are prepared in the fitting surface of the waxed denture ( first point in the incisive papilla and second point in mid line of the postdam ) .small crosses were marked with a carver on center of incisive papilla ( point a ) , and the second point ( b ) was marked by small crosses in midline of the postdam ( figure 1 ) .the length between a and b points was standardized in all dentures by using metallic bar .therefore , in some cases the b point was located just anterior to the postdam , and when b point located outside the postdam , as indicated by metallic bar , the patient was excluded from this study .the distance between two points in the fitting surface was measured by dial caliper ( brand name : mitutoy , model number : us_ms00_13 , model : 500 series , and place of origin : japan ) step measurement : a caliper with two jaws where one is fixed and the other is movable . move the sliding jaw by pressing the thumb on the bump on the bottom . the caliper is used for reading of the distance between centers of the two points ( unit of measurement is the millimeter with precision of 0.01 ) .all groups with complete dentures were evaluated at baseline directly after insertion , and then they were evaluated after 4 months , 8 months , and lastly 12 months of clinical use .measurement of dimensional change was calculated by subtracting distance between a and p points at baseline assessment from those at follow - up sessions .measurement of dimensional changes due to altered mouth temperature was taken at normal patient mouth temperature , after drinking hot tea at 45c and after taking cold drink at 5c .this measurement was taken only once at separate follow - up session after 1 month of clinical use .every patient was given one minute to drink cold beverage and 2 minutes to drink hot one .the temperature of the lab was set to 25c and the measurement of dimensional change was taken directly after patients have finished drinking the beverage .the time span between hot and cold beverage was about one hour to allow for sufficient wash - out period .the thickness of 1.52  mm was adopted in all acrylic resin dentures and the thickness of 2  mm was used in all cobalt chromes dentures .the data were collected using data collection sheet containing general patient information and measurements throughout a year of patients ' follow - up .the data were then analyzed by computerized method ( statistical package for social sciences ) ( spss version 20 ) . the chi - square test was used to test differences in patients ' categorical characteristics between the three groups .the paired t - test was used to detect differences between two acrylic resin groups and the control group of cobalt chrome regarding dimensional change in the same mouth temperature .then anova test followed by ad hoc tukey 's test was used to identify significant differences between the three groups for thermal changes .all values were tabulated as average of millimeter ( mean ) with standard deviation ( sd ) .ninety patients were recruited in this study ; during the follow - up period 4 patients complained of pain and discomfort which had been released by little adjustment of the dentures . only one patient was subjected to denture fracture in right molar area which has been repaired in the lab .the fracture line was so far from midline and assumed not to affect the measurement of dimensional accuracy .the study participants were homogeneous in the demographic characteristics such as age and gender distribution .the differences between study groups regarding demographic characteristics were not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 1 ) .there were no significant differences between anterior - posterior lengths in all groups at the base line assessment session , since they were constructed to be similar in all groups .regarding dimensional changes , the group with cobalt chrome denture base was considered as control group because metallic bases are known to be dimensionally stable in the constant mouth temperature .dimensional expansions have occurred in both acrylic resin groups in comparison to cobalt chrome control group which remain dimensionally stable throughout one year of clinical use .denture bases fabricated of heat curing acrylic resin by injection moulding technique were subjected to higher dimensional expansions than those fabricated by conventional technique . in comparison with cobalt chrome control group ,the dimensional changes were always significantly higher in denture bases constructed by injection moulding technique after 4 , 8 , and 12 months of clinical use , while the dimensional changes which affected denture bases constructed by conventional technique show no statistically significant difference until the 12 months of clinical use ( table 2 ) .concerning dimensional changes that followed altered mouth temperature , denture bases fabricated of heat curing acrylic resin by conventional technique show dimensional stability during thermal changes applied in follow - up sessions , while cobalt chrome denture bases showed significantly higher dimensional changes when compared to both types of heat curing acrylic resin . as a metallic material , it shrinks on cold temperature and expands with hot temperature .denture bases made of acrylic resin by injection moulding technique showed insignificant slight shrinkage with cold drink ( table 3 ) .the dimensional changes of the three denture base materials were varied , since heat curing acrylic resin fabricated by injection moulding technique was with low dimensional stability , while the cobalt chrome metallic denture base was dimensionally stable over one year of clinical service ( 4 , 8 , and 12 months ) .furthermore , the study reported that the changes of mouth temperature have an effect on the denture base dimensions on cobalt chrome denture base .the cobalt chrome denture bases were more subjected to dimensional changes due to altered mouth temperature than acrylic resin denture bases .this study was a clinical trial aimed at assessing the dimensional stability of denture bases in intraoral environment over one year of clinical service , unlike the majority of previous studies that compared dimensional stability of denture base materials in laboratory setting .effects of saliva and forces of mastication on dimensions of denture bases rather than the effect of polymerization shrinkage were mainly assessed over time in this study .kim conducted a study to compare the effect of processing and immersion in artificial saliva on different denture base materials .they found that conventional resin group showed significantly largest dimensional changes after processing and immersion in artificial saliva for several weeks , while metallic base group showed significantly the smallest dimensional changes .the dimensional expansion affecting acrylic resins during intraoral use could be attributed to known property of water sorption found in both types of acrylic resin [ 12 , 13 ] . in laboratorysetting , young found the conventional technique more dimensionally accurate than injecting moulding technique using cobalt chrome as gold standard for comparisons .these findings were in agreement with the findings found by the current clinical study . in another hand , a study conducted by keenan et al .showed different findings , although it aimed to identify the dimensional changes related to heat curing techniques .the denture bases fabricated by injection moulding technique were found to have more expansion in vertical dimension than conventional heat curing technique . but this dimension was not assessed in the current study where only anterior - posterior dimensional changes were assessed .also a laboratory study conducted by nogueira et al . found no significant horizontal dimensional changes between conventionally fabricated acrylic resin and those constructed by injecting moulding technique .however , they found significant dimensional changes at vertical dimensions caused mainly by polymerization shrinkage . a clinical evaluation study conducted by polychronakis et al .aimed to determine the dimensional changes on construction and in 5-year clinical service of acrylic resin complete dentures .they found initial shrinkage during insertion of dentures followed by compensation of this shrinkage during the first 3 months of clinical use .after that , expansion started to happen in the denture base of acrylic resin increasing with duration of clinical service .these findings were in agreement with the current study that found gradual expansion affecting acrylic resin base materials starting from 4-month follow - up period till one year of follow - up .the anterior - posterior length is an important confounding factor in studies which aim to assess dimensional accuracy [ 11 , 12 ] .therefore , to adjust for confounding effect in this study , the length of distance between a and b points was made equal in all studied dentures .the thickness of denture base was also standardized to be 1.52  mm in acrylic resin dentures and 2  mm in cobalt chrome dentures . the major limitation of this study is time of follow - up , since one year is considered as short follow - up period for complete denture wearers who are usually wearing dentures for several years .the dimensional changes in mesiolingual and vertical directions were not assessed in this study which was able to generate more comprehensive understanding for dimensional stability of studied denture base materials .dimensional expansions have occurred in both types of acrylic resin denture bases especially denture bases fabricated by injection moulding technique , while cobalt chrome control group remains dimensionally stable .the change of mouth temperature was more tolerated by dentures produced from acrylic resin denture bases especially those fabricated by conventional technique .","answer":"background .  type of materials used in fabrication of denture base has an effect on dimension during denture base material processing and other factors related to clinical use .  objective .  the study aims were to assess the dimensional stability including thermal changes of three different denture base materials .  methods .  ninety patients were selected to construct complete dentures with different denture base materials .  they were randomly divided into three groups : group 1 , patients with cobalt chrome metallic base ; group 2 , patients with heat curing acrylic resin fabricated by injection moulding technique ; and group 3 , patients with denture bases fabricated by conventional heat curing acrylic resin .  the dimensional changes were assessed using digital caliper . results .  after the twelfth month , injection moulding acrylic resin had significantly the highest dimensional change followed by the conventional heat curing acrylic resin .  there were no significant differences in the dimensions between the three types of denture base materials at normal mouth temperature , while , after hot tea drinking at 45c , the dimensional change was significantly the highest in cobalt chrome metallic denture base group .  conclusion .  cobalt chrome metallic denture base has stable dimension compared to denture bases fabricated of acrylic resin but it was more affected by altered mouth temperature .  the study was registered in the international standard randomized controlled trials number ( isrctn ) registry with study i d ( isrctn94238244 ) ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

abdominal pressure and improve low back pain by altering the muscles  around the trunk and abdomen .rigid orthoses are made from polyethylene and are prescribed  to limit movement of the spine locally or segmentally12 , 13 .therefore , the aim of this study was to  investigate how application of these two types of lumbosacral orthoses to patients with  chronic low back pain affects postural control and low back pain .the institutional review board of sehan university approved the research ethics of this  research as a clinical trial ( document number 2016 -

orthosis can increase location awareness of the vertebral joint or  proprioception , in improve balance and walking quality , and decrease low back pain by  increasing the strength of the back extensor muscle patients with osteoporosis - kyphosis over  60  years old and at risk of falls .the present study supported advanced research through the  result that pain decreased in both groups , i.e. , the soft lumbosacral orthoses and rigid  lumbosacral orthoses groups .it is considered that the mechanical characteristics of  lumbosacral orthoses decrease pain by increasing the stability of the spine and pelvis .vogt  et al.18 showed that lumbosacral orthoses  can increase joint position sense by increasing afferent proprioceptive inputs through  mechanoreceptors of the skin and facilitate voluntary extension of the spine , improve  posture , and decrease lordosis of the spine effectively by providing presentment about  proper skill of movement and that it can help to maintain proper posture in the lumbar  vertebrae via the three - point pressure principle .kawaguchi et al.19 reported that a lumbar orthosis increased the muscle  strength of the back and abdomen and decreased muscle activity in their study of 31 men .it  is said that a lumbar orthosis can enable muscles to work effectively to perform a task . ivanic et al.20 reported that the soft  spine orthosis , as a corset type , is designed to increase passive stability and uprightness  of the waist compared with those resulting from use of a rigid spine orthosis .they also  said that soft lumbosacral orthoses are more effective than rigid lumbosacral orthoses .the  present study showed that obi , api and mbi decreased meaningfully between before and after  the experiment in the soft orthoses group but that there were meaningful differences in only  obi and mbi in the rigid orthoses group .these result showed that the soft orthoses were  more effective than the rigid orthoses in the present study .this supports the findings of  previous studies indicating that orthoses do not affect the activity of the abdominal  muscles or the ability of the lumbar vertebrae joints in spite of the fact that they became  the cause of a decrease in muscle activities or the cause of stiffness in the waste20 , 21 .rigid orthoses are mainly prescribed to protect the spine or facilitate healing and  to limit movement of the spine locally or segmentally13 .it has also been reported that spinal orthoses affect erector  spinae muscle more than abdominal muscles21. a rigid orthosis limits the movement of the spine by more than a  soft orthosis .so , it is considered that a rigid orthosis affects a change in postural  control in the sagittal plane by decreasing the activities of muscles surrounding the waste . these result will help to prepare baseline data providing related information with proper  mediation about wearing lumbosacral orthoses rightly .the limitations of this study included  that there was no control group and a lack of diversity with respect to the experiment  period .also , the duration the subjects wore the orthoses was not controlled exactly , and it  was difficult to generalize . it is considered that prospective studies controlling the study  period and duration the orthoses are worn exactly and including a control group will be  needed on the utility of orthoses prescribed as a therapy method for patients with low back  pain .","answer":"[ purpose ] this study investigated how types of lumbosacral orthoses applied to patients  with chronic lumbar pain affect postural control and low back pain .

Initial retrospective studies emerging from China and France, as well as case reports from different parts of the world revealed a spectrum of neurological symptoms ranging from a simple headache to more serious encephalitis and dysexecutive syndromes. Authors have tried to explain this neurotropism of the virus by comparing invasion mechanisms with prior epidemic coronavirus like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Concrete evidence on those viruses has been limited. This review attempts to discuss various pathophysiological mechanisms as it relates to neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2.

The aaRSs are divided between classes I and II, each of which is characterized by a core catalytic domain responsible for ATP-dependent acyl-adenylate synthesis2. These core domains recognize and activate specific amino acids, which are transferred to the 3' end of tRNA. AaRSs are highly modular and contain domains appended to the catalytic core that assist in RNA binding and recognition, and in proofreading of incorrect aminoacylation products3. In addition to the canonical enzymes required for translation, the aaRS superfamily contains paralogs that recapitulate either the core or the appended domains of aaRSs4. AaRS paralogs generally retain some degree of specificity for canonical protein synthesis substrates, amino acid or tRNA, whether or not they function inside or outside translation5. One notable exception is PoxA, a paralog of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), which does not recognize tRNA but instead post-translationally modifies elongation factor P (EF-P), a protein that mimics tRNA in both shape and size6–8. EF-P modification leads to specific alterations in the proteome and is required for virulence in Salmonella, but exactly how PoxA modifies EF-P to elicit these changes is unknown7.</p><p>Structural studies suggest PoxA recognizes EF-P in a similar manner to that by which LysRS binds tRNALys 7,8. Aminoacylation assays show the KM of PoxA for EF-P (3.2 µM) is similar to values determined for bacterial class II-type LysRS with tRNALys (1–2 µM9,10). PoxA cannot aminoacylate tRNALys, indicating that while it is structurally similar to LysRS its activity is different from that of a canonical aaRS11. The amino acid binding pockets of PoxA and LysRS also appear highly similar and super positioning of the α-carbons within the active sites shows an RMSD of 1.1 Å (Fig. 1a). Using the LysRS co-crystal structure, lysyl-adenylate can be docked into the active site of PoxA, consistent with previous findings that lysine is a substrate for EF-P modification in vitro7. While lysine was a substrate for PoxA, the reaction was extremely inefficient compared to amino acid activation by LysRS (Supplementary Methods, Table 1). Characterization of amino acid activation by PoxA under a variety of conditions did not lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of the reaction (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting that lysine may not be the cognate substrate. This was supported by comparing the PoxA and LysRS active sites, which indicated divergence of two conserved residues predicted to impact substrate specificity, Ser76 and Ala294 (Fig. 1a; Escherichia coli PoxA numbering). The effect of reverting these PoxA residues to their conserved LysRS identities was investigated by comparing the apparent amino acid binding affinities of the S76A and A294G variants to wild-type. The S76A mutation abolished all activity, while A294G showed a 25-fold decrease in the KM for lysine compared to wild-type (Table 1). These data indicate PoxA is not optimized to use lysine as its preferred substrate, but has instead evolved amino acid specificity divergent from that of LysRS.</p><p>Previous studies show different LysRSs preferentially recognize particular non-cognate amino acids12, and the specificity of PoxA was similarly tested (Fig. 1b). PoxA did not activate either other non-cognate genetically encoded amino acids or various commercially available analogs more efficiently than lysine. This raised the possibility that another amino acid was the preferred substrate of PoxA in vivo. E. coli cell-free extracts showed significantly higher stimulation of ATP / PPi exchange activity than expected based solely upon their lysine content, suggesting the presence of a second, more efficient, substrate (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Cell-free extracts were fractionated and the resulting samples tested for ATP / PPi exchange activity using LysRS and PoxA (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Optimal activities for LysRS and PoxA did not co-fractionate during purification, supporting the idea that E. coli cell-free extracts contained a substrate for EF-P modification distinct from lysine (Fig. 1c). The identity of the amino acid attached by PoxA in vivo was investigated by mass spectroscopy of both affinity purified EF-P, and of EF-P modified in vitro using enriched cell-free extracts. In both cases EF-P was site-specifically modified at Lys34 by a mass consistent with the attachment of lysine (Supplementary Fig. 3). These data showed that while the genetically encoded amino acid α-lysine was not the optimal substrate for PoxA, EF-P is nevertheless modified by a compound with the mass of lysine, consistent with previous reports8,13.</p><p>Genomic and phylogenetic studies predict that β-lysine might be the natural substrate for PoxA6,7, consistent with the mass observed for modified EF-P and with the detection in vivo of a substrate distinct from α-lysine. (R)-β-lysine was 100-fold more efficient as a substrate than either (S)-β-lysine or α-lysine (Fig. 2a), suggesting that (R)-β-lysine is the cognate substrate for EF-P modification (Table 1). In contrast, (R)-β-lysine was a poor substrate compared to α-lysine for LysRS (Supplementary Fig. 4a) indicating that the amino acid substrate specificity of PoxA is different to that of the ancestral aaRS from which it evolved. The ability of PoxA to post-translationally modify EF-P with β-lysine was examined in vitro and found to be considerably more efficient than modification with α-lysine (Fig. 2b). β-lysine was also a potent inhibitor of α-lysine modification of EF-P, consistent with this reaction being orthogonal to tRNA aminoacylation by LysRS (Supplementary Fig. 4b).</p><p>Previous studies established that EF-P, PoxA and the 2,3-β-lysine aminomutase encoded by yjeK8,14 act together in vivo to establish virulence in Salmonella, and are important for maintenance of stress resistance phenotypes including resistance to gentamicin and growth on AB2 media7,15. The latter phenotype was used to assess how modification with β-lysine affects the functional activity of EF-P in vivo. Complementation of a poxA yjeK double knockout strain showed that neither wild-type PoxA nor the A298G variant could restore normal growth on AB2 media, suggesting that lysylation alone (as opposed to β-lysylation) is not sufficient to create functional EF-P (Supplementary Fig. 5). To more directly investigate the role of β-lysylation of EF-P in vivo, we attempted to restore the growth of the yjeK mutant on gentamicin by supplementation with different forms of lysine. β-lysine, but not α-lysine, was able to restore growth of the yjeK mutant in the presence of gentamicin (Fig. 2c). These data show that functional EF-P is dependent on post-translational modification by PoxA specifically with β-lysine, and that synthesis of β-lysine by YjeK occurs prior to addition rather than by a post-addition rearrangement of α-lysine.</p><p>Perturbation of the post-translational modification of EF-P by PoxA gives rise to changes in translation that attenuate Salmonella virulence7,15,16. The chemical nature of this novel modification is a critical determinant of EF-P activity; while both α- and β-lysine are substrates for PoxA, only the latter amino acid generates the biologically active form of EF-P. What remains unclear is how attachment of β-lysine changes the activity of EF-P. One possibility is that β-lysine acts as a recognition element for ribosome binding, although this may not be a universal role as unmodified isoforms of EF-P can also bind to bacterial ribosomes17 and a number of bacteria encode EF-P but not PoxA or YjeK6. Comparisons to the eukaryotic homolog eIF5a18 suggest that addition of β-lysine may contribute to the ability of EF-P to promote translation initiation and /or elongation13,19. The modification of eIF5a with hypusine, by an unrelated pathway, is required for its stimulatory effect on translation20, and the availability of a defined in vitro modification system will now allow similar effects to be tested for with EF-P. The availability of a defined modification system in vivo will in addition facilitate investigation of the proposal that EF-P stimulates translation of specific messages7,16, a role also proposed for eIF5a but for which there is no known mechanism18.</p><p>Post-translational modification of EF-P is based on molecular mimicry of a pathway hijacked from the translation machinery. To achieve the substrate specificity necessary to modify EF-P with β-lysine, PoxA evolved two specificities orthogonal to those of the protein from which it is derived, the class II-type LysRS. Elimination of the amino-terminal anticodon-binding domain of LysRS would have substantially reduced affinity for tRNA10, and allowed PoxA to evolve the protein-protein interactions that permit it to specifically recognize the tRNA-mimic EF-P8 but not tRNALys. The evolution of amino acid specificity in PoxA appears to have been primarily driven by selection for β-lysine as a substrate, and may have been facilitated by the lack of selection to maintain a high turnover rate. The biological role of LysRS, providing Lys-tRNALys for protein synthesis, requires a high rate of product synthesis whereas PoxA would be required to have a far lower turnover rate. As a result, only very few active site replacements compared to LysRS are sufficient to provide PoxA with useful β-lysine specificity, since any accompanying loss in turnover number is still compatible with a biologically relevant rate of EF-P modification.</p><p>Many aaRS paralogs have been sequenced and annotated, but to date functions have only been assigned to a small fraction4,21,22. The relative ease with which PoxA apparently acquired new substrate specificities suggests that alternative mechanisms of post-translational modification, and amino acid-dependent transformations, may be associated with other aaRS paralogs. The substrate specificity of PoxA also opens up the possibility that aaRS paralogs could provide the basis for new tools for protein design and engineering. The orthogonality of PoxA to the translation machinery mirrors that of systems developed for co-translational insertion of unnatural amino acids23, suggesting that similar approaches could be developed in the future to evolve new post-translational protein modification activities.</p>","answer":"The lysyl-tRNA synthetase paralog PoxA modifies elongation factor P (EF-P) with xcexb1-lysine at low efficiency.

In bacteria, however, there is commonly an excess of G( over C) and, to a lesser extent, T( over A) in the replicatory leading strand. The low G+C Firmicutes, such as Staphylococcus aureus, are unusual in displaying an excess of A over T on the leading strand. As mutation has been established as a major force in the generation of such skews across various bacterial taxa, this anomaly has been assumed to reflect unusual mutation biases in Firmicute genomes. Here we show that this is not the case and that mutation bias does not explain the atypical AT skew seen in S. aureus. First, recently arisen intergenic SNPs predict the classical replication-derived equilibrium enrichment of T relative to A, contrary to what is observed. Second, sites predicted to be under weak purifying selection display only weak AT skew. Third, AT skew is primarily associated with largely non-synonymous first and second codon sites and is seen with respect to their sense direction, not which replicating strand they lie on. The atypical AT skew we show to be a consequence of the strong bias for genes to be co-oriented with the replicating fork, coupled with the selective avoidance of both stop codons and costly amino acids, which tend to have T-rich codons. That intergenic sequence has more A than T, while at mutational equilibrium a preponderance of T is expected, points to a possible further unresolved selective source of skew.Introduction:Skews in nucleotide usage( compositional asymmetries) are of interest as they provide a window into fundamental processes operating within genomes. Under conditions of equal mutation bias and random gene orientation, the two complementary strands of a bacterial chromosome should be subject to the same sets of substitutions, and hence each should contain approximately equal amounts of a given base and its complement[1]. This condition, where A∼T and C∼G within a given strand, is known as the second parity rule and represents a null expectation of sequence evolution. The division of the replication fork into leading and lagging strands, however, has shaped bacterial sequence evolution contrary to this null, as each strand generally possesses an excess of one nucleotide over its complementary base( called GC and AT skews). Within bacterial genomes, nucleotide skews normally manifest as a richness of G over C and( with a lesser magnitude) T over A on the replicatory leading strand[2]–[5]. These genomic skews indicate some force, be it mutation or selection, is biasing substitutions between the two replicating strands. While it is acknowledged that, in theory, selection for genes to reside in the leading strand coupled with preferences for particular amino acids could result in chromosome-wide skews[2],[5]–[8], such a role for selection in generating large-scale compositional bias remains largely hypothetical and undescribed. Instead mutational biases between the two replicating strands are generally invoked as the cause of nucleotide skew[3],[8],[9]. Mutational differences between transcribed and non-transcribed strands have also been considered[10],[11], and these explanations incorporate a selective element as they require asymmetrically distributed genes between the replicating strands. It has been argued that strand-specific mutation biases might result from the different amounts of time spent by each strand exposed in the single-stranded state during continuous or discontinuous DNA replication. While cytosine deamination( C→T) in particular was long suspected to play a major role in creating the excess of G and T in the leading strand, it has been shown that similar compositional skews can result from a variety of mutational scenarios[12]. The observation that GC skews tend to be stronger than AT skews also points to contributions from multiple mutation types. As would be expected if they are primarily mutational in origin, detected skews are generally higher in nearly neutral sites such as intergenic regions and fourfold degenerate sites[2],[3],[10]. Staphylococcus aureus is an unusual case in that, like other Firmicutes, it displays an excess of A over T in the leading strand, or positive AT skew given as( A–T) /( A+T)[13]. Why does this AT skew run counter to that observed in most bacteria? One possibility is that unique selective processes might be avoiding T and preferring A in the leading strand. Genes predominately lie in the leading strand in S. aureus, a feature of bacterial chromosomes posited to result from selection to minimize impacts between DNA and RNA polymerases[14]( although the relevance of this mechanism remains unclear). Any pressure to underuse codons rich in T could then result in AT skews simply due to the differential coding content of these two strands. Gene orientation bias is particularly enhanced in low G+C Firmicutes, potentially on account of the replication fork asymmetry induced by the possession of separate α subunits for synthesis of the leading and lagging strands[15],[16]. Alternatively, S. aureus might display a mutational bias which produces AT skew opposite that of most other bacteria, pushing up A over T in the leading strand. Indeed, it was recently suggested that the DNA polymerase-α subunit that replicates the leading strand also determines the direction of AT skew[16]. However, this finding was not repeated in a subsequent study and a direct mutational effect on AT skew resulting from α-subunit possession was called into question[11]. Here we investigate whether mutation or selection best explains the unusual AT skew in S. aureus. Dividing the chromosome into coding and non-coding positions allowed us to assess whether skew is strongest in those sites which should be under weaker purifying selection, such as intergenic and fourfold degenerate sites, or whether skew is most prevalent in non-synonymous sites which are constrained by the need to code for amino acids. Moreover we make use of newly described, high resolution genome-wide SNP data representing a single widespread clone of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus( MRSA)[17]. As these isolates have diverged from a very recent common ancestor, over a period of 4-5 decades, the data provide an opportunity to infer mutational patterns in S. aureus and contrast AT skews expected under mutational equilibrium to the AT skews observed. Importantly, the false positive rate of SNP calling in these genomes is benchmarked to be less than 1 SNP per genome( Julian Parkhill, personal communication), making these an unprecedentedly high quality resource.Discussion:Recently an interest has emerged in whether certain sites in bacterial chromosomes commonly thought to be nearly neutral are in fact under selection as regards their nucleotide content. Two studies[23],[24] both used SNP profiles to estimate the GC content in possibly neutral sites at mutational equilibrium and showed the observed GC:AT bias greatly differs from that expected under the influence of mutation alone, consistent with previous reports of mutational pressure towards AT in E. coli[37]. What these studies were unable to explain, however, was what selective forces might be biasing nucleotide content at third codon and intergenic sites, leaving open the possibility that biased gene conversion and not selection might be acting. Here we also investigate a feature of bacterial chromosomes commonly presumed to be mutational, AT skew, and test whether mutation or selection is responsible for generating the unusual AT skews in S. aureus. Not only do we show that the atypical AT skew pattern in S. aureus is not due to mutational bias, but we are able to delineate to some degree what mode of selection is occurring( at least in terms of coding sequence), and to what end, in order to explain the observed skew pattern. We find the mutational effect on AT skew in S. aureus( and in another Firmicute, B. anthracis), as derived from intergenic SNPs some distance away from coding sequence, to be inconsistent with, and poorly explanatory of, the observed base composition. Fourfold degenerate sites and intergenic regions display little skew, and intergenic SNP profiles do not support a replication-induced mutational origin of AT skew. In addition to fourfold sites, intra-operonic intergenic regions also display very weak AT skews, and hence any transcriptional effect is likely to be weak. Instead our results support a selectionist basis for compositional bias in S. aureus in which AT skew, the majority of which is observable at first and second positions in the sense direction, results from selection at both the translational level and on gene position. The avoidance of stop codons and codons encoding costly amino acids accounts for a substantial proportion of the skew in first and second codon positions because the majority of genes are on the leading strand. However, we are unable to accurately quantify the contribution of the avoidance of costly amino-acids, because the cost estimates used[31] are only approximate. Nevertheless, we can describe a relationship between the intensity of selection against costly amino acids and the magnitude of skews( Figures S9, S10, and Table S9). Codons encoding more costly amino acids tend to be AT-rich[29] and we observe that, on average, AT-rich genomes encode more costly amino acids( Figure S9A). However, the average cost of amino acids in AT rich genomes while high, is not as high as expected given the AT pressure( Figure S9B). This we interpret as evidence for more efficient selection against costly amino acids in GC-poor strains, which in turn contributes to a higher AT skew( Figure S10). We further show a phylogenetically controlled positive association between the extent of gene strand bias and positive genomic AT skew across the Firmicutes, indicating that strand bias is likely responsible in part for the atypical AT skews seen across this phylum. Our failure to detect such a relationship in non-Firmicute phyla may in part be due to a lack of genomes in these phyla with very high strand bias, leaving only increases in strand bias of smaller magnitude to investigate and thus much noisier data sets( Figure 7). The pattern of Δgespi versus ΔATskew observed for the Firmicutes is similar to the patterns observed in other phyla when considering the region 0>x<10( Figure 7), meaning large differences in strand bias between terminal node pairs are required to be able to detect a relationship between the two quantities. This may be why we only see an effect in the Firmicutes, where strand bias is high enough to leave a clear impact upon the magnitudes of genomic AT skews. We conclude that if there is a relationship between gespi and AT skew in non-Firmicutes, our method is not sensitive enough to detect it. Our results leave several mysteries. First, why do species differ in the degree of strand bias and why is it so high in many Firmicutes? These issues remain enigmatic. A simple model supposes that in fast replicating species the chance of DNA and RNA polymerases colliding must be higher than in slow replicating species. There is, however, no correlation between growth rate and gene strand bias[38]. Rather the higher biases are typically found in chromosomes containing two different( possibly strand-dedicated) DNAP α-subunits at the replication fork which may render them more vulnerable to polymerase collisions[15]. It has also been suggested that strand bias reflects gene essentiality rather than the level of expression[39] although, again, this does not explain the unusually high level of strand bias in Firmicute chromosomes. Further, while both the observed AT skew in non-coding sites and the pattern of SNPs in intergenic sequence cannot explain the skew seen across the leading strands as a whole, the two approaches are also inconsistent with each other. The relative mutation rates calculated from intergenic SNPs indicate that mutation is acting to bias T over A in intergenic sites, which is the typical direction that AT skew takes in most( e. g. many non-Firmicute) bacteria, suggesting less variable skew-related mutational profiles among bacteria than is commonly assumed. However, intergenic sites on the leading strand have a weak bias in the opposite direction. Such a leading strand bias is consistent with leading strand coding sites also showing slightly higher bias than lagging strand coding sites( Table 1). What could account for the discrepancy between mutational biases and observed base frequencies at putatively neutral sites? One possibility is that these sites are not yet at mutational equilibrium. This could occur if, for example, there were until recently some unannotated small protein coding genes in the “intergene” spacer. These new pseudogenes would take an appreciable time to reach mutational equilibrium and could well leave a trace of A>T skew if they tended to be on the leading strand. However, in this case it is curious that intergenic skew, intra-operonic skew and skew at four-fold degenerate sites all show a weak A>T bias. An alternative is that the weakly positive intergenic AT skews could reflect ongoing selection. One possibility is that there exists unannotated coding sequence, which, if enriched on the leading strand, would contribute a net A>T skew. Neither missing gene model can explain why skew at four fold degenerate sites is of the same magnitude as in putative intergene spacer. In addition, if mutation alone dictated intergenic AT skews, leading intergenic spacers should skew to roughly-0. 4( Table 2) according to our estimates of mutational equilibria. Given that the average leading AT skew in S. aureus coding sequence is approximately 0. 1 across all three codon positions( Table 1), the vast majority of intergenic spacers would need to be unannotated protein-coding sequence in order for missing genes to be able to explain the observed leading intergenic AT skew of 0. 0276( Table 1), a highly untenable scenario. Removal of the few regions with outlier AT skew values does not substantially impact the intergenic AT skew( Figure S11), suggesting that even if we are missing some genes their contribution to skew cannot explain the overall bias. What exactly is generating weakly positive AT skews in leading intergenic regions remains a mystery, but this analysis adds weight to the growing evidence[see e. g. 19, 23, 24, 37, 40] that “neutral” sites in bacterial chromosomes may not be quite so neutral after all.","answer":"When considering a single strand of DNA , it is not necessarily the case that the frequency of each base should equal its complementary partner , such that A = T and G = C . For the leading strand , it is typically the case that Gs are more common than Cs , and Ts more common than As . This bias is widely thought to arise due to different mutational biases during replication . The Firmicutes exhibit an atypical preference for A over T on the leading strand , and here we show that selection , rather than mutation , can explain this exception . For those bases within coding regions , selection acts to inflate the frequency of A over T in order to avoid stop codons and to use metabolically cheap amino acids . Because genes are not orientated randomly , this manifests as an overall enrichment of A on the leading strand . Furthermore , a direct examination of mutational patterns is inconsistent with the observed enrichment of As . Curiously , our data also point to an unresolved source of selection on synonymous and intergenic sites , which are widely assumed to be neutral ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

threatening condition that requires rapid and appropriate management and antibiotic treatment if vision loss is to be prevented .mk caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa is commonly associated with contact lens wear ( table 1).121 predisposing risk factors for microbial keratitis can vary with geographical location and can depend on the penetration of contact lens wear .the differences may also be associated with the incidence of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in cytokine genes in different populations .recently , snps in the gene for interleukin ( il)-10 have been associated with severity of and predisposition to mk.22 in developing countries , trauma to the eye may be a predominant risk factor,23 whereas in developed countries , contact lens wear is often the most important risk factor.24 a study from malaysia suggested that as p. aeruginosa is also a common inhabitant of soil , water , and vegetation , it may also be the main pathogen following vegetation - related corneal injury in certain regions.15 the incidence of contact lens - related microbial keratitis has been estimated over the past 20 years , and has remained almost constant at 1/2500 contact lens wearers who wear lenses on a daily wear basis ( that is removing lenses each night and placing in disinfecting solution prior to re - wearing the lens the next day ) , or 1/500 wearers if the lenses are worn on a continuous or extended wear basis ( ie , the person wears lenses for 24 hours , sleeping in lenses overnight).25 it is now common for lens wearers to discard their lenses after 2 weeks or 1 month of wear.25 in a study from north america , it was found that the incidence of all ulcerative keratitis was 2.76 per 10,000 person - years ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] : 2.463.09 ) but the incidence of contact lens - associated keratitis was 13.04 per 10,000 person - years ( 95% ci : 11.1315.17 ) , with an adjusted relative risk of 9.31 ( 7.4211.7 ; p < 0.001 ) compared with non - contact lens wearers.1 another study put the incidence of mk at 1.1 per 10,000 persons / year in the us24 but a different study found an incidence of 79.9 per 10,000 persons / year in nepal.23 the risk with therapeutic contact lenses is higher at approximately 52/10,000 yearly.26 a study of armed forces of the uk evacuated because of keratitis from the middle east showed an incidence of mk of 35 per 10,000 ( with 74% being associated with soft contact lens wear).27 the percentage of microbial keratitis cases caused by pseudomonas species ( most likely p. aeruginosa ) is shown in table 2 for different geographical locations.113,1518,2844 whilst p. aeruginosa / pseudomonas sp .are usually a predominant causative agent , temperate zones tend to have a higher incidence of gram - positive bacteria causing the disease and less aggressive keratitis.44 in most studies , pseudomonas sp .are usually isolated in monoculture from cases of mk , however , a study from thailand demonstrated that in 46% of mk cases caused by pseudomonas sp .other gram - negative bacteria including escherichia coli , acinetobacter calcoaceticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , serratia marcescens , and enterobacter sp .could also be cultured.16 however , the predominance of p. aeruginosa during contact lens - associated mk is not always seen .for example , even though 29.4% of mk cases were associated with contact lens wear in a study from wellington , new zealand , no cultures of p. aeruginosa were reported.19 the predominant gram - negative bacteria isolated was moraxella sp .( 12.5% of all bacterial isolates),19 and this predominance of moraxella sp . from mk scrapes has been reported from a study in christchurch , new zealand.45 climate may also affect the incidence of p. aeruginosa keratitis . in australia ,the incidence of p. aeruginosa contact lens microbial keratitis ( clmk ) is increased in tropical compared to temperate zones , whereas the incidence of serratia marcescens clmk is higher in temperate zones.44 determinants of the clinical outcome of mk include distance of the ulcer from the limbus and the minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) of the first antimicrobial used or lowest mic if combination therapy was used.5 a large multicenter clinical trial with participants from india and the us has shown that p. aeruginosa ulcers were significantly worse for visual acuity than patients with other bacterial ulcers , but interestingly showed significantly more improvement in 3-month best - spectacle - corrected visual acuity than those with other bacterial ulcers.46  pseudomonas sp .are often associated with the largest ulcers.5 ideally , every case of presumed mk should be scraped for microbiological investigations , especially with the possibility of increasing isolation of antibiotic - resistant microbes .however , it must be borne in mind that there is often a small ulcer and so relatively little material might be obtained .corneal scrapings obtained with a surgical blade ( eg , bard - parker blade # 15 ) , kimura spatula , or 21-gauge disposable needle should be inoculated on chocolate agar , sheep blood agar , and into thioglycolate broth , and incubated at 35c .sabouraud s agar plates should also be used and these are maintained at 25c to enhance fungal growth .samples may also be inoculated onto non - nutrient agar and into brain heart infusion broth .scraping of small lesions ( smaller than 2.0 mm ) is probably not worthwhile , and patients with such lesions can be empirically treated .scrapes should not only be sent for microbial culture , but also smeared onto microscope slides and examined by gram stain ( and potassium hydroxide if fungal keratitis is suspected ) . however , as there is often only a small amount of material , cultures on agar plates for bacteria and fungi , as well as gram stain , are most often used .the following clinical parameters are useful in monitoring the clinical response to antibiotic therapy : blunting of the perimeter of the stromal infiltrate , decreased density of the stromal infiltrate , reduction of stromal edema and endothelial inflammatory plaque , reduction in anterior chamber inflammation , re - epithelialization , and cessation of corneal thinning .therapies used in different geographical locations are shown in table 3.4,5,8,9,12,16,31,39,42,4749 monotherapy with ciprofloxacin ( 0.3% ; or another fluoroquinolone ) is commonly used . in severe cases , subconjunctival injections of gentamicinmay be used.31 the combination of two fortified antibiotic preparations , 1.5% gentamicin and 5% cefuroxime , covers almost the entire range of common bacterial pathogens causing corneal ulcers .randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that monotherapy with fluoroquinolones has non - inferiority and fewer side effects compared with combination therapy.50,51 a study from iran recommended the concurrent use of ceftazidime and amikacin or ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin as the initial treatment based on antibiotic sensitivities of isolates , and as all p. aeruginosa isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol , trimethoprim , vancomycin , and cefazolin , these antibiotics should probably not be included in any empirical antibiotic regimen in that country.47 data from taiwan41 demonstrate that ciprofloxacin was statistically significantly more effective against p. aeruginosa than the combination of cefazolin and gentamicin . whilst therapy is most often ,if not always , commenced prior to results of cultures being obtained , a study from japan has shown that the therapeutic outcome was better when antimicrobial agents were selected based on culture results , thus reemphasizing the importance of culture studies.18 sometimes a combination of piperacillin / tazobactam might be effective with unresponsive p. aeruginosa mk.52 the use of steroids in conjunction with antibiotics has been a source of controversy for many years , despite the demonstration in an animal trial that the combination of tobramycin and dexamethasone was safe and resulted in the reduction of clinical scores and lower bacterial numbers in the cornea.53 however , a recent large scale multicenter clinical trial that enrolled subjects in india and us found that the use of moxifloxacin combined with prednisolone phosphate did not improve overall clinical outcome.46 sensitivity of pseudomonas sp . to antibiotics by geographical region is shown in table 4.2,7,8,16,20,21,2831,35,37,4042,47,54 generally p. aeruginosa is sensitive to fluoroquinolones , but there have been reports of multi - resistant p. aeruginosa strains , for example , from australia where the strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , tobramycin , and amikacin but was sensitive to ceftazidime , imipenem , meropenem , and timentin.55 recent data examining possible synergistic activity between different classes of antibiotics against p. aeruginosa has shown that a combination of meropenem / ciprofloxacin gave the lowest mean fractional inhibitory concentrations ( ie , best synergy ) for p. aeruginosa isolates , with 90% of isolates showing an additive or synergistic effect56 and so this may be a promising therapy for the more resistant strains .comparisons between tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that ciprofloxacin is the most commonly prescribed antibiotic to treat mk in iraq , however only 62% of pseudomonas sp .likewise for india , tobramycin is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics but only 30% of pseudomonas sp .this is different from all other most commonly prescribed treatments in other geographical locations which are > 95% effective .whilst there are no true cut - off points for sensitivity or resistance for topically applied antibiotics , it is perhaps important for those countries where there are high levels of apparently resistant strains of p. aeruginosa to monitor the clinical outcome of mk very carefully . in conclusion , pseudomonas sp .( predominantly p. aeruginosa ) is often isolated from cases of contact lens - induced microbial keratitis . the most commonly used therapies to treat this disease are either monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone or fortified aminoglycosides .strains of p. aeruginosa isolated from contact lens - induced mk are commonly still sensitive to these antibiotics , but geographic differences in sensitivity exist and should be taken into account when recommending treatment options .","answer":"pubmed and medline were searched for articles referring to pseudomonas keratitis between the years 2007 and 2012 to obtain an overview of the current state of this disease .  keyword searches used the terms  pseudomonas   +  keratitis  limit to  20072012  , and [  ulcerative  or  microbial  ] +  keratitis   +  contact lenses  limit to  20072012  .  these articles were then reviewed for information on the percentage of microbial keratitis cases associated with contact lens wear , the frequency of pseudomonas sp . as a causative agent of microbial keratitis around the world , the most common therapies to treat pseudomonas keratitis , and the sensitivity of isolates of pseudomonas to commonly prescribed antibiotics .  the percentage of microbial keratitis associated with contact lens wear ranged from 0% in a study from nepal to 54.5% from japan  . these differences may be due in part to different frequencies of contact lens wear . the frequency of pseudomonas sp . as a causative agent of keratitis ranged from 1% in japan to over 50% in studies from india , malaysia , and thailand .  the most commonly reported agents used to treat pseudomonas keratitis were either aminoglycoside ( usually gentamicin ) fortified with a cephalosporin , or monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone ( usually ciprofloxacin ) . in most geographical areas , most strains of pseudomonas sp .

BACKGROUND Pretreatment with statins has been shown to reduce brain injury in cerebral ischemia . In this controlled randomized study , we investigated the influence of statin pretreatment and its withdrawal on the outcome of acute ischemic stroke patients . METHODS From 215 patients admitted within 24 hours of a hemispheric ischemic stroke , 89 patients on chronic statin treatment were randomly assigned either to statin withdrawal for the first 3 days after admission ( n = 46 ) or to immediately receive atorvastatin 20 mg/day ( n = 43 ) . The primary outcome event was death or dependency ( modified Rankin Scale [ mRS ] score > 2 ) at 3 months . Early neurologic deterioration ( END ) and infarct volume at days 4 to 7 were secondary outcome variables . In a secondary analysis , outcome variables were compared with the nonrandomized patients without previous statin therapy ( n = 126 ) . RESULTS Patients with statin withdrawal showed a higher frequency of mRS score > 2 at the end of follow-up ( 60.0 % vs 39.0 % ; p = 0.043 ) , END ( 65.2 % vs 20.9 % ; p < 0.0001 ) , and greater infarct volume ( 74 [ 45 , 126 ] vs 26 [ 12 , 70 ] mL ; p = 0.002 ) compared with the non-statin-withdrawal group . Statin withdrawal was associated with a 4.66 ( 1.46 to 14.91 ) -fold increase in the risk of death or dependency , a 8.67 ( 3.05 to 24.63 ) -fold increase in the risk of END , and an increase in mean infarct volume of 37.63 mL ( SE 10.01 ; p < 0.001 ) after adjusting for age and baseline stroke severity . Compared with patients without previous treatment with statins , statin withdrawal was associated with a 19.01 ( 1.96 to 184.09 ) -fold increase in the risk of END and an increase in mean infarct volume of 43.51 mL ( SE 21.91 ; p = 0.048 ) . CONCLUSION Statin withdrawal is associated with increased risk of death or dependency at 90 days . Hence , this treatment should be continued in the acute phase of ischemic stroke .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"Statin treatment\\", \\"atorvastatin\\", \\"statin pretreatment\\", \\"Statin\\", \\"statin\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"death\\", \\"END\\", \\"Early neurologic deterioration ( END )\\", \\"mean infarct volume\\", \\"modified Rankin Scale [ mRS ]\\", \\"mRS score\\", \\"dependency\\", \\"infarct volume\\"], \\"Participant\\": []}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

To explore the effects of disclosing physician payment methods in HMOs, members of two similar HMO plans were randomized to intervention and control groups, and the experimental arm was told how the HMO paid their primary care physician. Separate disclosures were developed for each plan, one describing primarily capitation payment, and the other (mixed-incentive plan) describing fee-for-service payment with a bonus that rewards cost savings, satisfaction, and preventive services. The disclosures pointed out more of the positive than the negative features of these incentives. We found that the disclosures doubled the number of subjects with substantial knowledge of the physician incentives and halved the number with no knowledge. Nevertheless, the disclosures had no negative effects on trust of either physicians or insurers. The capitated plan disclosure had a small positive effect on trust of physicians. Disclosing the positive and negative features of incentives and increasing knowledge of these incentives does not, in the short term, reduce trust in physicians or insurers and may have a mild positive impact on physician trust, perhaps as a consequence of displaying candor and increasing understanding of positive features.Title 2:Further validation and reliability testing of the Trust in Physician Scale. The Stanford Trust Study Physicians.Abstract 2:To further validate and assess the reliability and validity of the Trust in Physician Scale.                Consecutive adult patients (n = 414) from 20 community-based, primary care practices were enrolled in a prospective, 6-month study. At enrollment, subjects completed the 11-item Trust in Physician Scale plus measures of demographics, preferences for care, and satisfaction with care received from the physician. Continuity, satisfaction with care, and self-reported adherence to treatment were measured at 6 months. Reliability, construct validity, and predictive validity were assessed using correlation coefficients and analysis of variance techniques.                The Trust in Physician Scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .89) and good 1-month test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .77). As expected, trust increased with the length of the relationship and was higher among patients who actively chose their physician, who preferred more physician involvement, and who expected their physician to care for a larger proportion of their problems (P < 0.001 for all associations). Baseline trust predicted continuity with the physician, self-reported adherence to medication, and satisfaction at 6 months after adjustment for gender, age, education, length of the relationship, active choice of the physician, and preferences for care. After additional adjustment for baseline satisfaction with physician care, trust remained a significant predictor of continuity, adherence, and satisfaction.                The Trust in Physician Scale has desirable psychometric characteristics and demonstrates construct and predictive validity. It appears to be related to, but still distinct from, patient satisfaction with the physician and, thus, provides a valuable additional measure for assessment of the quality of the patient-physician relationship.","answer":"Overall there remains insufficient evidence to conclude that any intervention may increase or decrease trust in doctors.

BACKGROUND Self-esteem is a major concern in mood disorders . Low self-esteem is a symptom of depressive disorders and is considered by some to be a predictor for relapse , whereas high self-esteem seems to buffer against depression . Recently , Competitive Memory Training ( COMET ) has shown to be effective for the enhancement of self-esteem in several psychopathological conditions . The current study assesses whether COMET is also an effective intervention for patients with depressive disorders . METHODS Sixty-one patients with depressive disorders who were already in therapy in an outpatient mental health institution were randomly assigned to either eight group sessions of COMET in addition to their regular therapy ( COMET + therapy as usual [ TAU ] : the experimental group ) or to 8 weeks of ongoing regular therapy ( TAU only : the control group ) . These latter ( control ) patients received COMET after their TAU only period . All patients in both groups that completed COMET were contacted 3 and 6 months later to assess whether the effects of COMET had remained stable . RESULTS Compared to the patients who received TAU only , patients in the COMET + TAU condition showed significant improvement with large effect sizes on indices of self-esteem , depression , and depressive rumination . The therapeutic effects of COMET + TAU remained stable after 3 and 6 months on all outcome measures or improved even further . CONCLUSION COMET for low self-esteem seems to be an efficacious trans-diagnostic intervention that can relatively easily be added to the regular treatment of patients with depressive disorders .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"Competitive Memory Training ( COMET )\\", \\"of\\", \\"COMET in addition to their regular therapy ( COMET + therapy as usual [ TAU ]\\", \\"COMET\\", \\"ongoing regular therapy ( TAU only\\", \\"TAU\\", \\"Competitive memory training ( COMET )\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"Competitive Memory Training ( COMET )\\", \\"significant improvement\\", \\"low self-esteem\\", \\"effects of COMET\\", \\"therapeutic effects\\", \\"large effect sizes on indices of self-esteem , depression , and depressive rumination .\\", \\"stable\\", \\"Low self-esteem\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"Sixty-one\\", \\"depressive disorders\\", \\"low self-esteem\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) increases pulmonary vascular resistance, causing right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and poor clinical outcome. Present studies test if the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator BAY 41-8543 reduces pulmonary vascular resistance and protects RV function. Experimental PE was induced in anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats by infusing 25 μm polystyrene microspheres (1.95 million/100 g body wt, right jugular vein) producing moderate PE. Pulmonary artery vascular resistance, estimated as RVPSP/CO, increased 3-fold after 5 h of PE. Treatment with BAY 41-8543 (50 μg/kg, I.V.; given at the time of PE induction) normalized this index by reducing RVPSP and markedly increasing CO, via preservation of heart rate and stroke volume. Ex vivo RV heart function showed minimal changes at 5 h of PE, but decreased significantly after 18 h of PE, including peak systolic pressure (PSP, Control 39 ± 1 mmHg vs. 19 ± 3 PE), +dP/dt (1192 ± 93 mmHg/s vs. 444 ± 64) and -dP/dt (-576 ± 60 mmHg/s vs. -278 ± 40). BAY 41-8543 significantly improved all three indices of RV heart function (PSP 35 ± 3.5, +dP/dt 1129 ± 100, -dP/dt -568 ± 87). Experimental PE produced increased PVR and RV dysfunction, which were ameliorated by treatment with BAY 41-8543. Thus, there is vasodilator reserve in this model of experimental PE that can be exploited to reduce the stress upon the heart and preserve RV contractile function.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"polystyrene\\", \\"BAY 41-8543\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

One strategy for reducing anthracycline-associated toxicity is packaging them in liposomes. Liposomes are closed vesicular structures that envelop water-soluble molecules. They may serve as vehicles for delivering cytotoxic agents more specifically to tumor, and limit exposure of normal tissues to the drug. Liposomal anthracyclines are more effective and less toxic in a number of preclinical models compared with conventional anthracyclines. Several liposomal anthracyclines have been extensively studied in humans with a variety of cancer types , including TLC D-99 ( Myocet ; The Liposome Company , Elan Corporation , Princeton , NJ ) , liposomal daunorubicin ( Daunoxome ; NeXstar Pharmaceuticals , Inc , San Dimas , CA ) , and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ; Alza Pharmaceuticals , Palo Alto , CA , Caelyx ; Schering Corporation , Kenilworth , NJ ) . Although none of these agents are currently approved for the treatment of breast cancer in the United States, the liposomal doxorubicin preparations seem to have comparable activity and less cardiac toxicity than conventional doxorubicin. Furthermore, they have been safely combined with other cytotoxic agents, including cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel. Further studies will be required do determine their role in the treatment of breast cancer.sentence: Several liposomal anthracyclines have been extensively studied in humans with a variety of cancer types , including TLC D-99 ( Myocet ; The Liposome Company , Elan Corporation , Princeton , NJ ) , liposomal daunorubicin ( Daunoxome ; NeXstar Pharmaceuticals , Inc , San Dimas , CA ) , and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ; Alza Pharmaceuticals , Palo Alto , CA , Caelyx ; Schering Corporation , Kenilworth , NJ ) .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The clinical attack rate of adults and children was estimated as 20% and 3%, respectively, 25% of cases were hospitalized. The ewe that had lambed as well as 25% of its herd tested positive for C. burnetii antibodies. CONCLUSION: Due to its size and point source nature this outbreak permitted assessment of fundamental, but seldom studied epidemiological parameters. As a consequence of this outbreak, it was recommended that pregnant sheep not be displayed in public during the 3(rd )trimester and to test animals in petting zoos regularly for C. burnetii. Text: Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii), a small, gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium. C. burnetii displays antigenic variation with an infectious phase I and less infectious phase II. The primary reservoir from which human infection occurs consists of sheep, goat and cattle . Although C. burnetii infections in animals are usually asymptomatic, they may cause abortions in sheep and goats [1] . High concentrations of C. burnetii can be found in birth products of infected mammals [2] . Humans frequently acquire infection through inhalation of contaminated aerosols from parturient fluids, placenta or wool [1] . Because the infectious dose is very low [3] and C. burnetii is able to survive in a spore-like state for months to years, outbreaks among humans have also occurred through contaminated dust carried by wind over large distances [4] [5] [6] . C. burnetii infection in humans is asymptomatic in approximately 50% of cases. Approximately 5% of cases are hospitalized, and fatal cases are rare [1] . The clinical presentation of acute Q fever is variable and can resemble many other infectious diseases [2] . However, the most frequent clinical manifestation of acute Q fever is a self-limited febrile illness associated with severe headache. Atypical pneumonia and hepatitis are the major clinical manifestations of more severe disease. Acute Q fever may be complicated by meningoencephalitis or myocarditis. Rarely a chronic form of Q fever develops months after the acute illness, most commonly in the form of endocarditis [1] . Children develop clinical disease less frequently [7, 8] . Because of its non-specific presentation Q fever can only be suspected on clinical grounds and requires serologic confirmation. While the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is considered to be the reference method, complement fixation (CF), ELISA and microagglutination (MA) can also be used [9] . Acute infections are diagnosed by elevated IgG and/or IgM anti-phase II antibodies, while raised anti-phase I IgG antibodies are characteristic for chronic infections [1] . In Germany, acute Q fever is a notifiable disease. Between 1991 and 2000 the annual number of cases varied from 46 to 273 cases per year [10] . In 2001 and 2002, 293 and 191 cases were notified, respectively [11, 12] . On May 26, 2003 the health department of Soest was informed by a local hospital of an unusually large number of patients with atypical pneumonia. Some patients reported having visited a farmers' market that took place on May 3 and 4, 2003 in a spa town near Soest. Since the etiology was unclear, pathogens such as SARS coronavirus were considered and strict infection control measures implemented until the diagnosis of Q fever was confirmed. An outbreak investigation team was formed and included public health professionals from the local health department, the local veterinary health department, the state health department, the National Consulting Laboratory (NCL) for Coxiellae and the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI), the federal public health institute. Because of the size and point source appearance of the outbreak the objective of the investigation was to identify etiologic factors relevant to the prevention and control of Q fever as well as to assess epidemiological parameters that can be rarely studied otherwise. On May 26 and 27, 2003 we conducted exploratory interviews with patients in Soest hospitalized due to atypical pneumonia. Attending physicians were requested to test serum of patients with atypical pneumonia for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza 1-3, Adenovirus and Enterovirus. Throat swabs were tested for Influenza virus, Adenovirus and SARS-Coronavirus. Laboratory confirmation of an acute Q fever infection was defined as the presence of IgM antibodies against phase II C. burnetii antigens (ELISA or IFA), a 4-fold increase in anti-phase II IgG antibody titer (ELISA or IFA) or in anti phase II antibody titer by CF between acute and convalescent sera. A chronic infection was confirmed when both anti-phase I IgG and anti-phase II IgG antibody titers were raised. Because patients with valvular heart defects and pregnant women are at high risk of developing chronic infection [13, 14] we alerted internists and gynaecologists through the journal of the German Medical Association and asked them to send serum samples to the NCL if they identified patients from these risk groups who had been at the farmers' market during the outbreak. The objective of the first case control study was to establish whether there was a link between the farmers' market and the outbreak and to identify other potential risk factors. We conducted telephone interviews using a standardised questionnaire that asked about attendance at the farmers' market, having been within 1 km distance of one of 6 sheep flocks in the area, tick bites and consumption of unpasteurized milk, sheep or goat cheese. For the purpose of CCS1 we defined a case (CCS1 case) as an adult resident of the town of Soest notified to the statutory sur-veillance system with Q fever, having symptom onset between May 4 and June 3, 2003. Exclusion criterion was a negative IgM-titer against phase II antigens. Two controls per case were recruited from Soest inhabitants by random digit dialing. We calculated the attributable fraction of cases exposed to the farmers' market on May 4 (AFE) as (OR-1)/OR and the attributable fraction for all cases due to this exposure as:The farmers' market was held in a spa town near Soest with many visitors from other areas of the state and even the entire country. To determine the outbreak size we therefore asked local public health departments in Germany to ascertain a possible link to the farmers' market in Soest for all patients notified with Q-fever. A case in this context (\\"notified case\\") was defined as any person with a clinical diagnosis compatible with Q fever with or without laboratory confirmation and history of exposure to the farmers' market. Local health departments also reported whether a notified case was hospitalized. To obtain an independent, second estimate of the proportion of hospitalizations among symptomatic patients beyond that reported through the statutory surveillance system we calculated the proportion of hospitalized patients among those persons fulfilling the clinical case definition (as used in the vendors' study (s.b.)) identified through random sampling of the Soest population (within CCS2 (s.b.)) as well as in two cohorts (vendors' study and the 9 sailor friends (see below)). The objective of CCS2 was to identify risk factors associated with attendance of the farmers' market on the second day. We used the same case definition as in CCS1, but included only persons that had visited the farmers' market on May 4, the second day of the market. We selected controls again randomly from the telephone registry of Soest and included only those persons who had visited the farmers' market on May 4 and had not been ill with fever afterwards. Potential controls who became ill were excluded for analysis in CCS2, but were still fully interviewed. This permitted calculation of the attack rate among visitors to the market (see below \\"Estimation of the overall attack rate\\") and gave an estimate of the proportion of clinically ill cases that were hospitalized (s.a.). In the vendors' study we investigated whether the distance of the vendor stands from the sheep pen or dispersion of C. burnetii by wind were relevant risk factors for acquiring Q fever. We obtained a list of all vendors including the approximate location of the stands from the organizer. In addition we asked the local weather station for the predominant wind direction on May 4, 2003. Telephone interviews were performed using standardized questionnaires. A case was defined as a person with onset of fever between May 4 and June 3, 2003 and at least three of the following symptoms: headache, cough, dyspnea, joint pain, muscle pain, weight loss of more than 2 kg, fatigue, nausea or vomiting. The relative distance of the stands to the sheep pen was estimated by counting the stands between the sheep pen and the stand in question. Each stand was considered to be one stand unit (approximately 3 meters). Larger stands were counted as 2 units. The direction of the wind in relation to the sheep pen was defined by dividing the wind rose (360°) in 4 equal parts of 90°. The predominant wind direction during the market was south-south-east ( Figure 1 ). For the purpose of the analysis we divided the market area into 4 sections with the sheep pen at its center. In section 1 the wind was blowing towards the sheep pen (plus minus 45°). Section 4 was on the opposite side, i.e. where the wind blew from the sheep pen towards the stands, and sections 2 and 3 were east and west with respect to the wind direction, respectively. Location of the stands in reference to the sheep pen was thus defined in two ways: as the absolute distance to the sheep pen (in stand units or meters) and in reference to the wind direction. We identified a small cohort of 9 sailor friends who visited the farmers' market on May 4, 2003. All of these were serologically tested independently of symptoms. We could therefore calculate the proportion of laboratory confirmed persons who met the clinical case definition (as defined in the cohort study on vendors). The overall attack rate among adults was estimated based on the following sources:(1) Interviews undertaken for recruitment of controls for CCS2 allowed the proportion of adults that acquired symptomatic Q fever among those who visited the farmers' market on the second day;Attributable fraction AFE Number of cases exposed All cases = *(2) Interviews of cases and controls in CCS2 yielded information about accompanying adults and how many of these became later \\"ill with fever\\";(3) Results of the small cohort of 9 sailor friends (s.a.);(4) Results from the cohort study on vendors. Local health departments that identified outbreak cases of Q fever (s.a. \\"determination of outbreak size and descriptive epidemiology\\") interviewed patients about the number of persons that had accompanied them to the farmers' market and whether any of these had become ill with fever afterwards. However, as there was no differentiation between adults and children, calculations to estimate the attack rate among adults were performed both with and without this source. To count cases in (1), (3) and (4) we used the clinical case definition as defined in the cohort study on vendors. For the calculation of the attack rate among children elicited in CCS2 was the same for all visitors. The number of children that visited the market could then be estimated from the total number of visitors as estimated by the organizers. We then estimated the number of symptomatic children (numerator). For this we assumed that the proportion of children with Q fever that were seen by physicians and were consequently notified was the same as that of adults. It was calculated as:Thus the true number of children with Q fever was estimated by the number of reported children divided by the estimated proportion reported. Then the attack rate among children could be estimated as follows:Because this calculation was based on several assumptions (number of visitors, proportion of adult visitors and clinical attack rate among adults) we performed a sensitivity analysis where the values of these variables varied. Serum was collected from all sheep and cows displayed in the farmers' market as well as from all sheep of the respective home flocks (70 animals). Samples of 25 sheep from five other flocks in the Soest area were also tested for C. burnetii. Tests were performed by ELISA with a phase I and phase II antigen mixture. We conducted statistical analysis with Epi Info, version 6.04 (CDC, Atlanta, USA). Dichotomous variables in the case control and cohort studies were compared using the Chi-Square test and numerical variables using the Kruskal-Wallis test. P-values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The outbreak investigation was conducted within the framework of the Communicable Diseases Law Reform Act of Germany. Mandatory regulations were observed. Patients at the local hospital in Soest reported that a farmers' market had taken place on May 3 and 4, 2003 in a spa town close to the town of Soest. It was located in a park along the main promenade, spanning a distance of approximately 500 meters. The market attracted mainly three groups of people: locals, inhabitants of the greater Soest region, patients from the spa sanatoria and their visiting family or friends. Initial interviewees mentioned also that they had spent time at the sheep pen watching new-born lambs that had been born in the early morning hours of May 4, 2003 . The ewe had eaten the placenta but the parturient fluid on the ground had merely been covered with fresh straw. Overall 171 (65%) of 263 serum samples submitted to the NCL were positive for IgM anti-phase II antibodies by ELISA. Results of throat swabs and serum were negative for other infectious agents. (Figure 2 ). If we assume that symptom onset in cases was normally distributed with a mean of 21 days, 95% of cases (mean +/-2 standard deviations) had their onset between day 10 and 31. The two notified cases with early onset on May 6 and 8, respectively, were laboratory confirmed and additional interviews did not reveal any additional risk factors. Of the 298 cases with known gender, 158 (53%) were male and 140 (47%) were female. Of the notified cases, 189 (63%) were from the county of Soest, 104 (35%) were Porportion reported number of notified adults number of vis = i iting adults attack rate among adults * Attack rate among children estimated true number of childr = e en with Q fever estimated number of children at the market from other counties in the same federal state (Northrhine Westphalia) and 6 (2%) were from five other federal states in Germany (Figure 3 ).

TAS-102 is a new oral anti-cancer drug preparation, composed of a 1:0.5 mixture (on a molar basis) of alpha, alpha, alpha-trifluorothymidine (FTD) and 5-chloro-6-[1- (2-iminopyrrolidinyl) methyl]-2,4 (1H,3H) -pyrimidinedione hydrochloride (TPI). TAS-102 currently undergoing clinical trials, has been demonstrated to have at least two mechanisms, inhibition of TS and incorporation into DNA. We hypothesized that the thymidine metabolism enzyme may be a crucial factor that affects the antitumor activity of TAS-102. In the present study, we measured the enzyme activity of thymidine kinase (TK), thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and thymidilate synthase (TS) in human cancer xenografts to investigate the contribution of these enzymes to the sensitivity of TAS-102. Antitumor activity of TAS-102 appears to be associated with TK, tumor growth and TS. However, the most related factors in this study were the TK and TP ratio. There was a significant correlation (p=0.04) between tumor growth inhibition and this ratio. These results suggested that the activation and degradation pattern of FTD plays an important role in the efficacy of TAS-102 and that it is possible to use the TK/TP ratio to predict response to TAS-102 therapy. We also studied the influence of TPI on the capacity of exogenous dThd to reverse FTD-dependent growth inhibition. Thymidine (dThd) levels rescued the effect of FTD in vitro and significantly increased in serum after administration of TAS-102 or TPI alone but not FTD alone. This may suggest the possibility of a decrease in antitumor effect. However, our study indicated that the therapeutic index was clearly increased by FTD combined with TPI, compared with FTD alone, suggesting FTD-induced toxicity to sensitive host tissue can be selectively reversed with dThd. In conclusion, TK and TPI effects on TP play important roles in the cytotoxic action of TAS-102, and it is possible to use the TK/TP ratio to predict more precisely individual resistance or sensitivity.","answer":"[[\\"TAS-102\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"thymidilate synthase\\"], [\\"TAS-102\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"thymidine kinase\\"], [\\"TAS-102\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"TS\\"], [\\"TPI\\", \\"COFACTOR\\", \\"TP\\"], [\\"TAS-102\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"thymidine phosphorylase\\"], [\\"TAS-102\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"TS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

An important problem an agent needs to solve is when to continue sampling data and when to stop gathering evidence. We examine whether and how the desire to hold a certain belief influences the amount of information participants require to form that belief. Participants completed a sequential sampling task in which they were incentivized to accurately judge whether they were in a desirable state, which was associated with greater rewards than losses, or an undesirable state, which was associated with greater losses than rewards. While one state was better than the other, participants had no control over which they were in, and to maximize rewards they had to maximize accuracy. Results show that participants’ judgments were biased towards believing they were in the desirable state. They required a smaller proportion of supporting evidence to reach that conclusion and ceased gathering samples earlier when reaching the desirable conclusion. The findings were replicated in an additional sample of participants. To examine how this behavior was generated we modeled the data using a drift-diffusion model. This enabled us to assess two potential mechanisms which could be underlying the behavior:( i) a valence-dependent response bias and/or( ii) a valence-dependent process bias. We found that a valence-dependent model, with both a response bias and a process bias, fit the data better than a range of other alternatives, including valence-independent models and models with only a response or process bias. Moreover, the valence-dependent model provided better out-of-sample prediction accuracy than the valence-independent model. Our results provide an account for how the motivation to hold a certain belief decreases the need for supporting evidence. The findings also highlight the advantage of incorporating valence into evidence accumulation models to better explain and predict behavior.Introduction:Judgments are formed over time as information is accumulated[1–3]. When given an opportunity to sample unlimited data an individual can decide to continue gathering evidence until a certain threshold is reached[4, 5]. This decision involves the trade-off between time and accuracy–an exchange that has been well-studied[6–8]. It seems probable, however, that the decision to stop gathering evidence would also be influenced by the desire to hold one belief over another[9, 10]. For example, people are less likely to seek a second medical opinion when the first physician delivers good news than when she delivered bad news[11]. The problem with such observations is that they often confound desirability with probability–a patient might seek a second opinion after receiving a dire diagnosis simply because the diagnosis is rare( and thus seems unlikely), not because it is undesirable. Here, we set out to empirically examine in a controlled laboratory setting whether and how the desire to hold a belief influences the amount of information required to reach it, when all else is held equal. Presently, we have limited understanding if and how motivation alters evidence accumulation, despite the potential for such effects to dramatically impact people’s decisions in domains ranging from finance to politics and health[9–11]. To gain insight into the underlying process we tease apart the computational elements that may be influenced by motivation. Specifically, we hypothesized that the desire to hold one judgment over another could alter information accumulation in at least two ways. First, people may be predisposed towards desired judgments before observing any evidence at all( for example, one may believe it will be a nice day before checking the weather or glancing outside)[12]. A second, not mutually exclusive possibility is that a desirable piece of evidence( e. g., a ray of sunlight) drives beliefs towards a desirable judgment( ‘it will be a nice day’), more so than an undesirable piece of evidence( e. g., the sound of rain) towards an undesirable judgment( ‘it will be a grey day’)[13]. These two distinct mechanisms will result in the same observable behavior. In particular, less information will be gathered to support desirable judgments than undesirable, such that the former would be reached faster. To dissociate these mechanisms, we use a computational approach. We adopt a sequential sampling model to model noisy evidence accumulation towards either of two decision thresholds[1, 14, 15]. The model allows estimating both( i) the starting point and( ii) rate of evidence accumulation, reflecting the quality of information processing[14]. This enables us to ask if either of these factors, or both, are influenced by motivation. In our task participants witness various events that are contingent upon which one of two hidden states they are in. One state was associated with greater rewards than losses( desirable state) and the other with greater losses than rewards( undesirable state). The participants had no control over which state they were in; their task was simply to judge the state, gaining additional rewards for accurate judgments and losing rewards for inaccurate judgments. Thus, it is in participants’ best interest to be as accurate as possible and they were allowed to accumulate as much evidence as they wish before making a judgment. We examine whether and how the accumulation process is sensitive to participants’ motivation to believe that they are in one state and not the other.Discussion:The findings show that motivation has a profound effect on the process by which evidence is accumulated. On trials in which participants indicated they believed the state was desirable, they ceased gathering data earlier and required a smaller proportion of samples to be consistent with that conclusion. We used a computational model to characterize the underlying factors that may generate this behavior. The model revealed two factors; first, participants began the process of evidence accumulation with a biased starting point towards the desired belief. Thus, they required less evidence to reach that boundary. Second, the drift rate–the rate of information accumulation[14]–was greater on trials in which participants were in the desirable state than the undesirable state. If only a bias starting point was observed, this would have indicated that people might make fast errors, but with time/evidence would have corrected their initial biases. The existence of a process bias, however, makes correction more difficult. While participants incorporate both desirable and undesirable evidence into judgments, the larger weight assigned to desirable evidence means that biases could increase over time with more evidence accumulation. These results indicate that the temporal evolution of beliefs is influenced by what people wish to be true and that evidence accumulation is valence dependent. That is, the rules of accumulation depend on whether the data is favorable or unfavorable. Most learning models[17–19] assume that agents learn from information they encounter, but that the learning process itself is not influenced by whether the evidence supports a desired or undesired conclusion. This study suggests this assumption is likely false. By allowing the parameters of a standard evidence accumulation model to vary as a function of the desirability of the evidence we were able to better explain and predict participants’ behavior. We chose to model the data with a drift-diffusion model because its components mapped onto the two alternatives of desirability bias in judgment. These components have been increasingly validated through targeted manipulations[20] and associated with specific neural and physiological correlates[21–25]. The good fit of the model to our data, as well as the alignment of the model results with the behavioral analyses vindicates the choice. We speculate that incorporating valence into other classes of learning models will also increase their predictive accuracy. Our findings are in accord with previous suggestions that people hold positively biased priors[12] and update their beliefs more in response to good than bad news[13, 26–29]. We speculate that biased evidence accumulation could be due to biases in perception[30, 31], attention[32, 33] and/or working memory[34, 35]. For example, participants may have attended to desirable stimulus to a greater extent than the undesirable stimulus, such that the former were assigned greater weight when forming beliefs. Such stimulus could also be maintained in working memory longer. These biases are thought to be automatic and do not require large cognitive resources[31, 36]. Here, we show such biases manifest into differential patterns of evidence sampling and accumulation. Our results also support a previous demonstration that people need less evidence to reach desirable conclusions in the domains of health and social interaction[9]. We go further in evidencing this in a situation where( i) participants are incentivized for accuracy,( ii) the desirable and undesirable conditions differ only on desirability and( iii) we provide insight to the underlying computations. In sum, the current study describes how the motivation to hold a certain belief over another can decrease the need for supporting evidence. The implication is that people may be quick to respond to signs of prosperity( such as rising financial markets) –forming desirable beliefs even when evidence is relatively weak- but slow to respond to indictors of decline( such as political instability) –forming undesirable beliefs only when negative evidence can no longer be discarded. Indeed, in our study participants were more likely to hold positive false beliefs( falsely believing they are in the desirable factory when in fact they were in the undesirable factory) than negative false beliefs( falsely believing they are in the undesirable factory when in fact they were in the desirable factory). While both positive and negative false beliefs resulted in a material cost, we speculate that positive false beliefs may have non-monetary benefits. In particular, it has been hypothesized that beliefs, just like material goods and services, have utility in and of themselves[30–36]. In certain circumstances it is possible that the increase in utility from false beliefs themselves may be greater than the material utility lost, resulting in net benefit.","answer":"People tend to gather information before making judgments . As information is often unlimited a decision has to be made as to when the data is sufficient to reach a conclusion . Here , we show that the decision to stop gathering data is influenced by whether the data points towards the desired conclusion . Importantly , we characterize the factors that generate this behaviour using a valence-dependent evidence accumulation model . In a sequential sampling task participants sampled less evidence before reaching a desirable than undesirable conclusion . Despite being incentivized for accuracy , participants’judgments were biased towards believing they were in a desirable state . Fitting the data to an evidence accumulation model revealed this behavior was due both to the starting point and rate of evidence accumulation being biased towards desirable beliefs . Our results show that evidence accumulation is altered by what people want to believe and provide an account for how this modulation is generated ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Initiation of DNA replication requires the function of MCM gene products, which participate in ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once in the cell cycle. Expression of all mammalian genes of the MCM family is induced by growth stimulation, unlike yeast, and the mRNA levels peak at G1 / S boundary. In this study, we examined the transcriptional activities of isolated human MCM gene promoters. Human MCM5 and MCM6 promoters with mutation in the E2F sites failed in promoter regulation following serum stimulation and exogenous E2F expression. In addition, we identified a novel E2F-like sequence in human MCM6 promoter which cooperates with the authentic E2F sites in E2F-dependent regulation. Forced expression of E2F1 could induce expression of all members of the endogenous MCM genes in rat embryonal fibroblast REF52 cells. Our results demonstrated that the growth-regulated expression of mammalian MCM5 and MCM6 genes, and presumably other MCM members, is primarily regulated by E2F through binding to multiple E2F sites in the promoters.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"rat embryonal fibroblast REF52 cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [\\"isolated human MCM gene promoters\\", \\"mammalian genes\\", \\"E2F sites\\", \\"mammalian MCM5 and MCM6 genes\\", \\"E2F - like sequence\\", \\"multiple E2F sites\\", \\"Human MCM5 and MCM6 promoters\\", \\"promoters\\", \\"human MCM6 promoter\\", \\"MCM family\\", \\"endogenous MCM genes\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"transcription factor\\", \\"E2F\\", \\"MCM gene products\\", \\"E2F1\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

However, it is not clear to what extent these measures explain the low numbers of recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Africa. One of the main aims of control measures is to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission through direct contact with others. In this study, we collect contact data from residents of informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya, to assess if control measures have changed contact patterns, and estimate the impact of changes on the basic reproduction number (R0). METHODS: We conducted a social contact survey with 213 residents of five informal settlements around Nairobi in early May 2020, 4 weeks after the Kenyan government introduced enhanced physical distancing measures and a curfew between 7 pm and 5 am. Respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made the previous day, alongside a questionnaire asking about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and control measures. We examined contact patterns by demographic factors, including socioeconomic status. We described the impact of COVID-19 and control measures on income and food security. We compared contact patterns during control measures to patterns from non-pandemic periods to estimate the change in R0. RESULTS: We estimate that control measures reduced physical contacts by 62% and non-physical contacts by either 63% or 67%, depending on the pre-COVID-19 comparison matrix used. Masks were worn by at least one person in 92% of contacts. Respondents in the poorest socioeconomic quintile reported 1.5 times more contacts than those in the richest. Eighty-six percent of respondents reported a total or partial loss of income due to COVID-19, and 74% reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 control measures have had a large impact on direct contacts and therefore transmission, but have also caused considerable economic and food insecurity. Reductions in R0 are consistent with the comparatively low epidemic growth in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries that implemented similar, early control measures. However, negative and inequitable impacts on economic and food security may mean control measures are not sustainable in the longer term.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\", \\"Transmission\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

The dietary fibre (DF) content in wheat grain based food products have been established with both the classical AOAC 985.29 dietary fibre and the new AOAC 2009.01 total dietary fibre protocol. There is a good agreement between the high molecular weight dietary fibre (HMWDF) contents measured with the AOAC 2009.01 method and (DF) content measured with the classical AOAC 985.29 method in wheat grain based food products. With the AOAC 2009.01 method also a significant amount of low molar weight dietary fibre (LMWDF), ranging from 1% to 3% w/w, was measured which is not quantified with the AOAC 985.29 method. With semi-preparative GPC the LMWDF (DP⩾3) fractions in the wheat grain based food products were isolated. The monosaccharide composition of the dissolved LMWDF constituents was determined. Glucose was by far the most abundant monosaccharide present with arabinose, galactose, xylose and mannose as minor constituents. It appeared that the LMWDF contains still not fully converted digestible starch/malto-oligosaccharide fragments with DP⩾3, which are erroneously quantified as LMWDF. By introducing an extra AMG hydrolysis step in the AOAC 2009.01 protocol after evaporation of the ethanol and dissolving the residue in deionised water, these malto-oligosaccharides are fully hydrolysed resulting in that way in a correct and lower LMWDF content.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"galactose\\", \\"ethanol\\", \\"arabinose\\", \\"mannose\\", \\"monosaccharide\\", \\"Glucose\\", \\"xylose\\"]}"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

The nucleotide sequence data reported will appear in DDBJ, EMBL, GenBank (R) and GSDB Nucleotide Sequence Databases; the sequences of ovine CPT1A and CPT1B cDNAs have the accession numbers Y18387 and AJ272435 respectively and the partial adipose tissue and liver CPT1A clones have the accession numbers Y18830 and Y18829 respectively. Fatty acid and ketone body metabolism differ considerably between monogastric and ruminant species. The regulation of the key enzymes involved may differ accordingly. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT 1) is the key locus for the control of long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation and liver ketogenesis. Previously we showed that CPT 1 kinetics in sheep and rat liver mitochondria differ. We cloned cDNAs for both isoforms [ liver- (L-) and muscle- (M-) ] of ovine CPT 1 in order to elucidate the structural features of these proteins and their genes (CPT1A and CPT1B). Their deduced amino acid sequences show a high degree of conservation compared with orthologues from other mammalian species, with the notable exception of the N-terminus of ovine M-CPT 1. These differences were also present in bovine M-CPT 1, whose N-terminal sequence we determined. In addition, the 5'-end of the sheep CPT1B cDNA suggested a different promoter architecture when compared with previously characterized CPT1B genes. Northern blotting revealed differences in tissue distribution for both CPT1A and CPT1B transcripts compared with other species. In particular, ovine CPT1B mRNA was less tissue restricted, and the predominant transcript in the pancreas was CPT1B. Expression in yeast allowed kinetic characterization of the two native enzymes, and of a chimaera in which the distinctive N-terminal segment of ovine M-CPT 1 was replaced with that from rat M-CPT 1. The ovine N-terminal segment influences the kinetics of the enzyme for both its substrates, such that the K (m) for palmitoyl-CoA is decreased and that for carnitine is increased for the chimaera, relative to the parental ovine M-CPT 1.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

the few available exactly solvable one  dimensional models@xcite . in this journalthere has been great interest in the subject@xcite as well as in one  dimensional potential scattering in general@xcite .such interest has been focussed not only on the analytical properties of potential scattering@xcite but also on the numerical calculation of transmission probabilities and other quantities that describe barrier penetration and potential scattering@xcite .the purpose of this paper is to show that a straightforward application of wronskians , which are well known in the study of ordinary linear differential equations@xcite , greatly facilitates the discussion of the analytical properties of potential scattering .they are also suitable for the numerical calculation of the transmission probability and any other quantity of interest in potential scattering .present discussion is motivated by an earlier application of wronskians to the analysis of one  dimensional models for resonance tunneling reactions@xcite .    in sec .[ sec : schro ] we apply wronskians to the schrdinger equation for potential scattering in one dimension and derive matrix equations connecting the coefficients of the asymptotic forms of the wavefunction left and right of the scattering center . in sec .[ sec : tunneling ] we specialize in a general short  range interaction and derive equations for the transmission probability . as illustrative nontrivial examples we consider a gassian barrier and a gaussian well . by means of anexactly  solvable problem we discuss the origin of the scattering resonances in potential wells . in sec .[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main results and draw conclusions . in order to make this paper sufficientlyself  contained we collect some well known mathematical properties of the wronskians in an appendix .the time  independent schrdinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath0 that moves in one dimension ( @xmath1 ) under the effect of a potential @xmath2 is @xmath3 if we define the dimensionless coordinate @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an appropriate length scale , then we obtain the dimensionless eigenvalue equation @xmath6 the length unit @xmath5 that renders both @xmath7 and @xmath8 dimensionless is arbitrary and we can choose it in such a way that makes the schrdinger equation simpler .we will see some examples in sec .[ sec : tunneling ] .    in most cases of physical interest we can write the asymptotic behavior of the dimensionless wavefunction @xmath9 as follows @xmath10 and in the intermediate region @xmath11we have @xmath12 the form of the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 depends on the problem and throughout this paper we choose all of them real . on the other hand , the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 may be complex .we discuss some examples in sec .[ sec : tunneling ] ; for the time being we assume that those functions satisfy the conditions ( [ eq : c , s ] ) at a conveniently chosen point @xmath17 . by means of the eq .( [ eq : a , b_w ] ) given in the appendix we can easily obtain matrix expressions connecting the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the three regions : @xmath20 where @xmath21 in these equations @xmath22 denotes the wronskian of the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24@xcite already defined in the appendix . if we repeat the procedure and obtain the inverse relations we appreciate that @xmath25 from which it follows that @xmath26 where the superscript @xmath27 stands for transpose .since the skew  symmetric matrix @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29 we conclude that @xmath30 which resembles the symplectic condition for a canonical transformation in classical mechanics@xcite .any matrix that satisfies eq .( [ eq : r_trans - r_inv ] ) is said to be symplectic@xcite . besides , eq .( [ eq : r1,r2_inv ] ) tells us that the determinant of every symplectic matrix @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is unity .    if the potential is parity  invariant ( @xmath34 ) then @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 so that we need to calculate half the number of wronskians .it is worth noting that wronskians containing @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constant for @xmath40 and those with @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constant for @xmath43 .we assume that @xmath44 where @xmath45 are finite constants .if @xmath8 approaches those limits sufficiently fast then we know that the asymptotic behavior of the solution is @xmath46 provided that @xmath47 .    if we choose @xmath48 in eq .( [ eq : phi_1,3 ] ) and compare it with eq .( [ eq : phi_1,3_exp ] ) we obtain @xmath49    suppose that we want to study the scattering of a particle that comes from the left ( @xmath50 ) .in such a case @xmath51 and the transmission probability is given by @xmath52 noting that @xmath53 we can easily rewrite the transmission probability in terms of the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 because @xmath54    in the intermediate or scattering region we write @xmath9 as in eq .( [ eq : phi_2 ] ) where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are two solutions of the dimensionless schrdinger equation that satisfy eq .( [ eq : c , s ] ) . in order to obtain themwe may resort to any available numerical integration method , like , for example , runge kutta@xcite ( see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rungekutta_methods ) .let @xmath57 be either @xmath55 or @xmath56 .typical numerical integration methods yield @xmath57 at a set of coordinate points @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the step size .they simultaneously provide the derivative of the function @xmath61 at the same set of points so that the numerical calculation of the wronskians between the intermediate solutions and the asymptotic ones is straightforward .numerical integration methods like runge  kutta are available in many commercial and free softwares so that it is unnecessary to write a computer program for that purpose . in the present case we resorted to the fourth  order runge kutta method built in the computer algebra system derive ( http://www.chartwellyorke.com/derive.html ) .the starting point of the integration process requires @xmath62 and @xmath63 that are already known for the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .we propagate the solution left and right till the wronskians appearing in the matrices ( [ eq : r1,r2 ] ) are constant within a given error .then we calculate the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 in terms of @xmath66 by means of eq .( [ eq : connect_ab ] ) and finally the transmission coefficient from equations ( [ eq : t ] ) and ( [ eq : a3/a1 ] ) .note that the application of the numerical integration method is straightforward because all the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are real .in the simplest case of a parity  invariant potential we need half the wronskians in order to obtain the matrix @xmath33 in equations ( [ eq : connect_ab ] ) and ( [ eq : r1,r2 ] ) as discussed at the end of sec .[ sec : schro ] .the transmission probability reads @xmath67 } label{eq : t_sym} ] ] and we only have to integrate the differential equations for @xmath55 and @xmath56 from @xmath68 to the right : @xmath69 , @xmath70 .as an illustrative example we choose the gaussian barrier @xmath71 if we set @xmath72 then @xmath73 and the dimensionless schrdinger equation depends on just one potential parameter @xmath74 . since @xmath75 then @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the dimensionless energy .    throughout this paperwe choose the integration step size @xmath78 and @xmath79 integration points so that the maximum coodinate value is @xmath80 . fig .[ fig : c2s2 ] shows the behaviour of the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath81 and the gaussian barrier with @xmath82 . in fig .[ fig : wronskians ] we appreciate that the wronskians approach constants as @xmath83 and that @xmath84 is large enough for an accurate estimation of those limits .we thus calculated the transmission coefficients shown in fig .[ fig : twg ] for three values of @xmath85 . as expected there is tunneling for all @xmath86 and @xmath87 .it is clear that the oscillatory behavior of @xmath88 found by chalk@xcite is due to the truncation of the gaussian potential with the purpose of connecting the power  series solution for the intermediate region with the asymptotic plane waves@xcite .we appreciate that the necessary truncation of the integration interval does not produce any undesirable effect on the transmission probabilities calculated in terms of wronskians .in fact , the great advantage of the wronskian method is that we calculate the constant asymptotic limit of each wronskian with a given desired accuracy as shown in fig .[ fig : wronskians ] .    in passing we point out that there is no trace of the questionable tunneling condition derived by nandi@xcite for the gaussia barrier .another simple , nontrivial , and most interesting problem is the gaussian well @xmath89 proceeding as in the preceding example we obtain the dimensionless potential @xmath90 and the same expressions for @xmath85 and @xmath7 . in this caseit is most instructive to calculate the transmission probability @xmath91 in terms of @xmath85 for fixed values of @xmath7 in order to reveal the scattering resonances as shown in fig .[ fig : twgw ] .note that the maxima of the transmission probability @xmath92 that occur at some particular values of @xmath85 are roughly independent of the energy @xmath93 .this well known phenomenon is better understood by means of an exactly solvable model .the scattering resonances appearing in fig .[ fig : twgw ] are similar to the ones exhibited by the exactly solvable well @xmath94 that we easily transform into the dimensionless potential @xmath95 .both the dimensionless potential parameter @xmath85 and energy @xmath7 have the same expressions as in the preceding examples .in this case the transmission probability reads@xcite @xmath96 the family of curves @xmath91 vs. @xmath85 for constant @xmath7 resembles the one shown in fig .[ fig : twgw ] .note that there is full transmission @xmath92 when @xmath97 ; that is to say , when @xmath98 is an integer . in order to understand the origin of these resonances we pay attention to the bound states@xcite @xmath99 we appreciate that full transmission takes place when one of the excited bound state energies ( @xmath100 ) lies exactly at the rim of the well @xmath101 in which case @xmath102 ( the ground  state energy @xmath103 is negative for all @xmath104 ) .this exactly solvable problem also proved to be useful for testing the accuracy of our programs for the calculation of the transmission probability .in this paper we propose an alternative way of approaching quantum scattering in one dimension .we think that the method based on the wronskians between linearly independent solutions to the schrdinger equation is preferable to other approaches .the relatively light effort necessary to master a few mathematical properties of the wronskians pays generously when attacking the scattering problem either analytically or numerically . in this paperwe focused mainly on the latter because we are interested in nontrivial problems that are not so widely discussed in most textbooks on quantum mechanics@xcite .the derivation of all the necessary scattering equations in terms of wronskians is straightforward as well as their practical application by means of extremely simple computer programs .the calculation of the transmission probability is quite reliable if one simply checks for constant wronskians before truncating the propagation of the solutions towards left and right in the numerical integration routine .thus , the error due to a finite integration interval is simply the error in the lack of constant wronskians that is easily bounded to the desired accuracy . in this waywe avoid any spurious oscillations in the transmission probability as discussed in sec .[ sec : tunneling ] .in addition to all that , the wronskians have proved to be most useful for the estimation of the complex energies that describe tunnel resonances as discussed in the paper on which we based present pedagogical presentation@xcite .one can also apply the wronskian method to bound states and calculate their energies by simply taking into account the appropriate asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction and requiring that it be square integrable .it is clear that the approach exhibits a wide variety of useful applications and for that reason we think that it is worth teaching in advanced undergraduate or graduate courses on quantum mechanics .in order to make this paper sufficiently self  contained in this appendix we outline some well known results about the wronskians that are useful for the study of ordinary differential equations in general@xcite and also for the treatment of the schrdinger equation in particular@xcite . to this end, we consider the ordinary second  order differential equation @xmath105 if @xmath106 and @xmath107 are two linearly independent solutions to this equation then we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the wronskian ( or wronskian determinant@xcite ) .two obvious properties are : @xmath110    by linear combination of @xmath111 and @xmath112 we easily obtain two new solutions @xmath113 and @xmath114 satisfying @xmath115 at a given point @xmath17 so that @xmath116 for all @xmath117 .if we write the general solution to eq .( [ eq : diffeq ] ) as @xmath118 then @xmath119 this equation is quite useful for deriving relationships between the coefficients of the asymptotic expansions of the wavefunction in different regions of space as shown in sections [ sec : schro ] and [ sec : tunneling ] .a more detailed discussion of the wronskians is available in powell and crasemann s book on quantum mechanics@xcite .","answer":"we show that wronskians between properly chosen linearly independent solutions of the schrdinger equation greatly facilitate the study of

like receptors , have been found in the  human anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) .these mechanoreceptors convert applied mechanical  loads into afferent impulses to regulate the stability of the knee joint and possibly  prevent ligament injury3 , 4 .recently , much attention has been devoted to the role of  proprioception as a contributing factor to functional stability of the knee joint5 .the majority of  acl injuries occur with a noncontact mechanism . the rate for noncontact acl injuries ranges  from 70 to 84% of all acl tears in both female and male athletes6,7,8 .noncontact acl injuries frequently occur in the weight - bearing ( wb )  phase .loading of the acl may occur in multiple planes , as anterior tibial translation , knee  valgus , and lower extremity rotational motions all increase the amount of load on the  acl9,10,11,12,13 .the relative orientation of the thigh to  the shank is thought to be a factor contributing to acl rupture . knee joint valgus is often  implicated as a hazardous position for the acl and has recently been linked to acl injury  risk14,15,16,17 .current research suggests that a combined loading pattern is most  detrimental with respect to acl injury .movement patterns that appear to increase acl injury  risk include a valgus and extension moments , especially during slight knee flexion ( dynamic  knee valgus)6 . in recent years ,interest in assessment , prevention , and treatment of proprioceptive  deficits has been increased .in addition , increasing numbers of authors have recommended  that future examinations are necessary to more fully characterize the differential  proprioceptive acuity in the constrained planes of movement ( both frontal and transverse  planes ) compared with the primary plane of movement at the knee , and a test of  proprioception is needed that involves movements similar to the mechanism of injury18 , 19 .most studies have tested knee proprioception in the sagittal plane and non - weight - bearing  ( nwb ) position .as it has been revealed that the acl is not only the primary restraint of  posteroanterior motion of the tibia on the femur , but it also controls and induces  valgus / rotation movement during wb activities , the limb alignment during high - risk wb  activities may be more relevant in assessment of proprioception . to the authors best  knowledge , no study has measured proprioception in a manner relevant to the mechanism of  injury .therefore , the aim of this study was to measure knee jps in the noncontact acl  injury risk position and normal wb condition in healthy subjects .thirty healthy male volunteer athletes ( age , 24.19  5.27  years ; height , 177.9  7.7  cm ;  weight , 78.03  11.7  kg ) participated in the study .the study s exclusion criteria for  subjects included : 1 ) clinical signs of an impairment or abnormality in the knee ( such as  abnormal range of motion , muscle weakness , or malalignment ) , 2 ) injury to the knee that  required medical attention , 3 ) previous surgery on the knee , or 4 ) current pain in the knee . all of the subjects were familiarized with the procedure by explanation , demonstration , and  one practice repetition .the dominant knees of the  subjects ( defined as the leg used for kicking ) were tested .all the subjects signed an  informed consent form , and the study was approved by the tehran university of medical  sciences .series twin axis electrogoniometer ( biometrics ltd , uk ) was used to  measure jps .participants were asked to wear shorts for ease of attachment of the  electrogoniometer to the lateral side of the knee joint .the electrogoniometer was attached  to the knee joint in the neutral knee position , which was defined based on the relationship  between the thigh and the leg in the anatomical position20 .the telescopic block was placed in parallel to an imaginary line  between the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus .the fixed end block was placed in  parallel to an imaginary line between the greater trochanter and the lateral condyle of the  femur .the electrogoniometer was zeroed when the subject was standing motionless in the  anatomic position , and this was confirmed with a hand held goniometer . to prevent slippage  during knee joint motion ,the end blocks were adhered to the test leg with double - sided  adhesive tape and further secured in place with adhesive tape .the test procedure included  active reproduction of the angles in the acl injury risk position and normal wb condition . the acl injury risk position was executed in a standing position , with the feet slightly  wider than shoulder -

risk positions should be  examined .thus , results of studies using nwb and normal wb positions may not correspond with  those using high - risk positions .assessment of jps in wb risk positions potentially provides  clinicians with more information on the status of the knee , thus giving a more precise  picture for screening methods and prevention strategies . in the current study ,jps of the  knee was compared between the noncontact acl injury risk position and normal wb conditions  in healthy subjects .the results showed less accurate knee jps in the noncontact acl injury  risk position than in the normal wb condition .examined knee proprioception in movements similar to the mechanism of injury  during active internal and external rotations of the knee in healthy subjects .their study  reported that proprioceptive acuity of internal rotation was signicantly lower than for  external rotation19 .several possible hypotheses for the different levels of jps in the acl injury risk and  normal positions may be suggested .one hypothesis is that knee joint proprioception combines  sensory input from a variety of afferent receptors in muscles , tendons , ligaments , and skin . the differential contributions of each of these structures could vary with joint position  and direction / plane of loading18 .another  possible reason for the difference in jps between the acl injury risk and normal positions  may relate to altered proprioceptive input caused by incorrect functional alignment in the  risk position . therefore , the knee positions used during testing may have confounded our  interpretation of the differential proprioceptive acuity across positions in the test . in  conclusion ,the poorer jps in the noncontact acl injury risk position compared with the  normal wb condition identied in this study may contribute to the increased incidence of acl  injury .one of the most common mechanisms of noncontact acl injury is dynamic knee valgus . it is possible that people with less accurate proprioception in the noncontact acl injury  risk position may be at greater risk of acl injury .however , further prospective studies are  required to conrm this hypothesis . from a clinical perspective ,knee joint proprioception  assessment in the high -

Interferons exert their antiviral, antiproliferative and immunoregulatory activities by stimulating the expression of several genes. Such genes disclose a common element within their promoters, defined Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE), which binds a nuclear factor (s) translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (ISGF3) after the binding of interferon (IFN) to the specific receptor. Here we report the induction of the synthesis and of the hydrolytic activity of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) in human T lymphocytes by IFN-beta. The increased level of PLC gamma 1 becomes evident after 90 min of IFN-beta treatment and is still detectable after 24 h. Neither the PLC gamma 1 overexpression induced by IFN nor the increased hydrolytic activity of the enzyme appear to be affected by pretreatment of the cells with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, which is known to prevent the association of ISGF3 components. These results suggest that in human T lymphocytes IFN-beta can activate other transcription factor (s) distinct from ISGF3 to regulate PLC gamma 1 expression. In addition, the ability of this enzyme to hydrolyse PIP2, also in the presence of genistein, implies the possibility that this enzyme can exert its hydrolytic activity independently of protein tyrosine kinase activation.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human T lymphocytes\\", \\"the cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"ISRE\\", \\"Interferon Stimulated Response Element\\", \\"promoters\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Interferons\\", \\"interferon\\", \\"PLC gamma 1\\", \\"interferon beta\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"IFN\\", \\"Phospholipase C gamma 1\\", \\"enzyme\\", \\"interferon (IFN)\\", \\"tyrosine kinase\\", \\"protein tyrosine kinase\\", \\"immunoregulatory\\", \\"IFN - beta\\", \\"nuclear factor\\", \\"ISGF3\\", \\"phospholipase C gamma 1\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to be associated with various kinds of immunological diseases including colitis. However, there are few drug candidates targeting inflammasomes for the treatment of colitis. In the present study, we aimed at examining the effect of 1-ethyl-5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole, a synthetic small molecular compound also named Fc11a-2, for the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced experimental colitis in mice via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome. Treatment with Fc11a-2 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of body weight and shortening of colon length induced by DSS. In addition, the disease activity index, histopathologic scores and myeloperoxidase activity were also significantly reduced by Fc11a-2 treatment. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of DSS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in colon, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-17A and IFN-γ, were markedly suppressed by Fc11a-2. Furthermore, a decreased CD11c (+) macrophage infiltration in colons and inactivation of caspase-1 in peritoneal macrophages were detected in Fc11a-2-treated mice. The mechanism of action of Fc11a-2 was related to the inhibition of the cleavage of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 which in turn suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of Fc11a-2 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its potential use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.","answer":"[[\\"benzo[d]imidazole\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"NLRP3\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"IL-1u03b2\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"pro-IL-18\\"], [\\"1-ethyl-5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"NLRP3\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"TNF-u03b1\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"pro-caspase-1\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"pro-IL-1u03b2\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"IL-18\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"cytokines\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"myeloperoxidase\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"IFN-u03b3\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"NLRP3\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"NLRP3\\"], [\\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"IL-17A\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Transformation from indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has historically been associated with a poor prognosis. A small series of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) studies using conventional conditioning regimens has demonstrated durable progression-free survival (PFS) rates ranging from 25% to 47%, but data in the rituximab era are lacking. Here we report the results of a multicenter retrospective trial evaluating ASCT in patients with transformed lymphoma using the Z-BEAM conditioning regimen , which combines yttrium-90-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin ) with high-dose BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ) chemotherapy . Sixty-three patients from 4 institutions were treated between 2003 and 2011. Histological confirmation of transformation was required and defined as a diagnosis of DLBCL in patients with either a prior history or concomitant diagnosis of low-grade B cell NHL. Median patient age at ASCT was 59.5 years, median number of prior regimens was 2, and all patients were exposed to rituximab. Disease status at ASCT was as follows: first complete remission (CR) (n = 30), first partial remission (n = 11), first relapse (n = 14), and at least second CR (n = 8). The median time from diagnosis of histological transformation to ASCT was 7.5 months (range, 2.8 to 116). Two-year nonrelapse mortality was 0%. Median follow-up for living patients was 28 months (range, 5 to 103). Two-year PFS was 68% (95% confidence interval, 58% to 75%), and overall survival was 90% (95% confidence interval, 80% to 95%). In conclusion, the Z-BEAM conditioning regimen for ASCT is well tolerated by patients with transformed lymphoma and demonstrates encouraging clinical outcomes.sentence: Here we report the results of a multicenter retrospective trial evaluating ASCT in patients with transformed lymphoma using the Z-BEAM conditioning regimen , which combines yttrium-90-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin ) with high-dose BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ) chemotherapy .","answer":"[[\\"ibritumomab tiuxetan\\", \\"carmustine\\", \\"etoposide\\", \\"cytarabine\\", \\"melphalan\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

There havenot been analogous advances for discrete distributions, where flows are typically thought to not be applicable. Instead, mostresearch for discrete data has focused on building either latent-variable models with approximate inference BID2 , or increasingly sophisticated autoregressive models that assume a fixed ordering of the data BID0 BID26 . In this paper, we present an alternative for flexible modeling of discrete sequences by extending continuous normalizing flows to the discrete setting. We demonstrateproofs of concept of discrete flows with two architectures:1. Discrete autoregressiveflows enable multiple levels of autoregressivity. For example, one can designa bidirectional language model of text where each token depends on both left-to-right and right-to-left contexts while maintaining an exact likelihood and sampling.2. Discrete bipartite flows (i.e., with flow structure similar to RealNVP BID6 ) enable flexible models with parallel generation. For example, one can design nonautoregressivetext models which maintain an exact likelihood for training and evaluation.","answer":"We extend autoregressive flows and RealNVP to discrete data."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

A live adenovirus vaccine containing serotypes 4 and 7 has been in use by the military for decades , suggesting adenoviruses may be safe for widespread vaccine use [36] . However, safety concerns have led to the majority of adenovirus-based vaccine development to focus on replication-defective vectors. Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is the most-studied serotype, having been tested for gene delivery and anti-cancer agents, as well as for infectious disease vaccines. Adenovirus vectors are attractive as vaccine vectors because their genome is very stable and there are a variety of recombinant systems available which can accommodate up to 10 kb of recombinant genetic material [37] . Adenovirus is a non-enveloped virus which is relatively stable and can be formulated for long-term storage at 4 °C, or even storage up to six months at room temperature [33] . Adenovirus vaccines can be grown to high titers, exceeding 10 1° plaque forming units (PFU) per mL when cultured on 293 or PER.C6 cells [38] , and the virus can be purified by simple methods [39] . Adenovirus vaccines can also be delivered via multiple routes, including intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intradermal injection, oral delivery using a protective capsule, and by intranasal delivery. Importantly, the latter two delivery methods induce robust mucosal immune responses and may bypass preexisting vector immunity [33] . Even replication-defective adenovirus vectors are naturally immunostimulatory and effective adjuvants to the recombinant antigen being delivered. Adenovirus has been extensively studied as a vaccine vector for human disease. The first report using adenovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza demonstrated immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5) expressing the HA of a swine influenza virus, A/Swine/Iowa/1999 (H3N2). Intramuscular immunization of mice with this construct induced robust neutralizing antibody responses and protected mice from challenge with a heterologous virus, A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) [40] . Replication defective rAd5 vaccines expressing influenza HA have also been tested in humans. A rAd5-HA expressing the HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; PR8) was delivered to humans epicutaneously or intranasally and assayed for safety and immunogenicity. The vaccine was well tolerated and induced seroconversion with the intranasal administration had a higher conversion rate and higher geometric meant HI titers [41] . While clinical trials with rAd vectors have overall been successful, demonstrating safety and some level of efficacy, rAd5 as a vector has been negatively overshadowed by two clinical trial failures. The first trial was a gene therapy examination where high-dose intravenous delivery of an Ad vector resulted in the death of an 18-year-old male [42, 43] . The second clinical failure was using an Ad5-vectored HIV vaccine being tested as a part of a Step Study, a phase 2B clinical trial. In this study, individuals were vaccinated with the Ad5 vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes. The vaccine induced HIV-specific T cell responses; however, the study was stopped after interim analysis suggested the vaccine did not achieve efficacy and individuals with high preexisting Ad5 antibody titers might have an increased risk of acquiring HIV-1 [44] [45] [46] . Subsequently, the rAd5 vaccine-associated risk was confirmed [47] . While these two instances do not suggest Ad-vector vaccines are unsafe or inefficacious, the umbra cast by the clinical trials notes has affected interest for all adenovirus vaccines, but interest still remains. Immunization with adenovirus vectors induces potent cellular and humoral immune responses that are initiated through toll-like receptor-dependent and independent pathways which induce robust pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Recombinant Ad vaccines expressing HA antigens from pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), H5 and H7 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (HPAIV), and H9 avian influenza viruses have been tested for efficacy in a number of animal models, including chickens, mice, and ferrets, and been shown to be efficacious and provide protection from challenge [48, 49] . Several rAd5 vectors have been explored for delivery of non-HA antigens, influenza nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 2 (M2) protein [29, [50] [51] [52] . The efficacy of non-HA antigens has led to their inclusion with HA-based vaccines to improve immunogenicity and broaden breadth of both humoral and cellular immunity [53, 54] . However, as both CD8 + T cell and neutralizing antibody responses are generated by the vector and vaccine antigens, immunological memory to these components can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use [48] . One drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, so alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus vectors include those from non-human primates (NHP), dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, birds and others [48, 55] . These vectors can infect a variety of cell types, but are generally attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. Swine, NHP and bovine adenoviruses expressing H5 HA antigens have been shown to induce immunity comparable to human rAd5-H5 vaccines [33, 56] . Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses from low-prevalence serotypes have also been shown to be efficacious. Low prevalence serotypes such as adenovirus types 3, 7, 11, and 35 can evade anti-Ad5 immune responses while maintaining effective antigen delivery and immunogenicity [48, 57] . Prime-boost strategies, using DNA or protein immunization in conjunction with an adenovirus vaccine booster immunization have also been explored as a means to avoided preexisting immunity [52] . Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were first explored as gene therapy vectors. Like rAd vectors, rAAV have broad tropism infecting a variety of hosts, tissues, and proliferating and non-proliferating cell types [58] . AAVs had been generally not considered as vaccine vectors because they were widely considered to be poorly immunogenic. A seminal study using AAV-2 to express a HSV-2 glycoprotein showed this virus vaccine vector effectively induced potent CD8 + T cell and serum antibody responses, thereby opening the door to other rAAV vaccine-associated studies [59, 60] . AAV vector systems have a number of engaging properties. The wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans and the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated [61] . As members of the parvovirus family, AAVs are small non-enveloped viruses that are stable and amenable to long-term storage without a cold chain. While there is limited preexisting immunity, availability of non-human strains as vaccine candidates eliminates these concerns. Modifications to the vector have increased immunogenicity, as well [60] . There are limited studies using AAVs as vaccine vectors for influenza. An AAV expressing an HA antigen was first shown to induce protective in 2001 [62] . Later, a hybrid AAV derived from two non-human primate isolates (AAVrh32.33) was used to express influenza NP and protect against PR8 challenge in mice [63] . Most recently, following the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, rAAV vectors were generated expressing the HA, NP and matrix 1 (M1) proteins of A/Mexico/4603/2009 (pH1N1), and in murine immunization and challenge studies, the rAAV-HA and rAAV-NP were shown to be protective; however, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + NP + M1 had the most robust protection. Also, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + rAAV-NP + rAAV-M1 were also partially protected against heterologous (PR8, H1N1) challenge [63] . Most recently, an AAV vector was used to deliver passive immunity to influenza [64, 65] . In these studies, AAV (AAV8 and AAV9) was used to deliver an antibody transgene encoding a broadly cross-protective anti-influenza monoclonal antibody for in vivo expression. Both intramuscular and intranasal delivery of the AAVs was shown to protect against a number of influenza virus challenges in mice and ferrets, including H1N1 and H5N1 viruses [64, 65] . These studies suggest that rAAV vectors are promising vaccine and immunoprophylaxis vectors. To this point, while approximately 80 phase I, I/II, II, or III rAAV clinical trials are open, completed, or being reviewed, these have focused upon gene transfer studies and so there is as yet limited safety data for use of rAAV as vaccines [66] . Alphaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Togaviridae family. A variety of alphaviruses have been developed as vaccine vectors, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis (SIN) virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus, as well as chimeric viruses incorporating portions of SIN and VEE viruses. The replication defective vaccines or replicons do not encode viral structural proteins, having these portions of the genome replaces with transgenic material. The structural proteins are provided in cell culture production systems. One important feature of the replicon systems is the self-replicating nature of the RNA. Despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels [67] . SIN, SFV, and VEE have all been tested for efficacy as vaccine vectors for influenza virus [68] [69] [70] [71] . A VEE-based replicon system encoding the HA from PR8 was demonstrated to induce potent HA-specific immune response and protected from challenge in a murine model, despite repeated immunization with the vector expressing a control antigen, suggesting preexisting immunity may not be an issue for the replicon vaccine [68] . A separate study developed a VEE replicon system expressing the HA from A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) and demonstrated varying efficacy after in ovo vaccination or vaccination of 1-day-old chicks [70] . A recombinant SIN virus was use as a vaccine vector to deliver a CD8 + T cell epitope only. The well-characterized NP epitope was transgenically expressed in the SIN system and shown to be immunogenic in mice, priming a robust CD8 + T cell response and reducing influenza virus titer after challenge [69] . More recently, a VEE replicon system expressing the HA protein of PR8 was shown to protect young adult (8-week-old) and aged (12-month-old) mice from lethal homologous challenge [72] . The VEE replicon systems are particularly appealing as the VEE targets antigen-presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, priming rapid and robust immune responses [73] . VEE replicon systems can induce robust mucosal immune responses through intranasal or subcutaneous immunization [72] [73] [74] , and subcutaneous immunization with virus-like replicon particles (VRP) expressing HA-induced antigen-specific systemic IgG and fecal IgA antibodies [74] . VRPs derived from VEE virus have been developed as candidate vaccines for cytomegalovirus (CMV). A phase I clinical trial with the CMV VRP showed the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and potent T cell responses. Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and considered safe [75] . A separate clinical trial assessed efficacy of repeated immunization with a VRP expressing a tumor antigen. The vaccine was safe and despite high vector-specific immunity after initial immunization, continued to boost transgene-specific immune responses upon boost [76] . While additional clinical data is needed, these reports suggest alphavirus replicon systems or VRPs may be safe and efficacious, even in the face of preexisting immunity. Baculovirus has been extensively used to produce recombinant proteins. Recently, a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use and was first available for use in the United States for the 2013-2014 influenza season [4] . Baculoviruses have also been explored as vaccine vectors. Baculoviruses have a number of advantages as vaccine vectors. The viruses have been extensively studied for protein expression and for pesticide use and so are readily manipulated. The vectors can accommodate large gene insertions, show limited cytopathic effect in mammalian cells, and have been shown to infect and express genes of interest in a spectrum of mammalian cells [77] . While the insect promoters are not effective for mammalian gene expression, appropriate promoters can be cloned into the baculovirus vaccine vectors. Baculovirus vectors have been tested as influenza vaccines, with the first reported vaccine using Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) expressing the HA of PR8 under control of the CAG promoter (AcCAG-HA) [77] . Intramuscular, intranasal, intradermal, and intraperitoneal immunization or mice with AcCAG-HA elicited HA-specific antibody responses, however only intranasal immunization provided protection from lethal challenge. Interestingly, intranasal immunization with the wild type AcNPV also resulted in protection from PR8 challenge. The robust innate immune response to the baculovirus provided non-specific protection from subsequent influenza virus infection [78] . While these studies did not demonstrate specific protection, there were antigen-specific immune responses and potential adjuvant effects by the innate response. Baculovirus pseudotype viruses have also been explored. The G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus controlled by the insect polyhedron promoter and the HA of A/Chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1) HPAIV controlled by a CMV promoter were used to generate the BV-G-HA.Question: Why adenovirus may be the safest vaccine vector?","answer":"A live adenovirus vaccine containing serotypes 4 and 7 has been in use by the military for decades"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

However, a great proportion of these hereditary predisposing factors still remain unidentified. To examine the contribution of rare copy number variants( CNVs) in breast cancer predisposition, high-resolution genome-wide scans were performed on genomic DNA of 103 BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 mutation negative familial breast cancer cases and 128 geographically matched healthy female controls; for replication an independent cohort of 75 similarly mutation negative young breast cancer patients was used. All observed rare variants were confirmed by independent methods. The studied breast cancer cases showed a consistent increase in the frequency of rare CNVs when compared to controls. Furthermore, the biological networks of the disrupted genes differed between the two groups. In familial cases the observed mutations disrupted genes, which were significantly overrepresented in cellular functions related to maintenance of genomic integrity, including DNA double-strand break repair( P = 0. 0211). Biological network analysis in the two independent breast cancer cohorts showed that the disrupted genes were closely related to estrogen signaling and TP53 centered tumor suppressor network. These results suggest that rare CNVs represent an alternative source of genetic variation influencing hereditary risk for breast cancer.Introduction:Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women. It is a complex disease with a well-established genetic component[1]; however, most of the familial and young breast cancer cases still remain unexplained by inherited mutations in the known susceptibility genes[2]. Multiple genome-wide association studies( GWAS) have identified several breast cancer associated single nucleotide polymorphisms( SNPs), but these have only modest effect sizes and explain much less of the heritability than originally anticipated[3]. Consequently, the contribution of rare variants with moderate to even high disease penetrance is now beginning to be more widely accepted. With the exception of some specific founder mutations, these rare variants are individually infrequent, and even specific to single cases or families. Much of the work with rare genomic variants has been conducted through candidate gene re-sequencing studies mainly concentrating on DNA damage response genes, Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway genes in particular, and their coding region variations[2]. However, rare genomic microduplications and microdeletions, also known as structural variants or copy number variants( CNVs), could represent an alternative class of genetic variation responsible for increased cancer risk. Recent reports have suggested a role for genomic structural variants in susceptibility to various diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders[4],[5]. Association of common CNVs with breast cancer susceptibility has been ruled out by a recently performed large case-control study[6], but the contribution of rare CNVs still remains poorly explored. As alleles in this variation class will be individually rare, the studies remain statistically underpowered to identify any specific loci involved, but the overall involvement can be tested by comparing the collective frequency of rare variants in cases with that in controls[5]. Moreover, the functional profiling of the disrupted genes will have a potential to reveal biological processes, which when defective could predispose to breast cancer. The known susceptibility genes are already considered to cause cancer predisposition through different mechanisms. Whereas BRCA1 and BRCA2 function in DNA repair[7], other high-risk susceptibility genes, TP53 and PTEN, participate in cell cycle control and regulation of cell proliferation[8],[9]. Here we have examined whether rare CNVs throughout the genome display an increased frequency in familial and young breast cancer cases when compared to healthy controls, and whether the biological pathways or processes, to which the disrupted genes relate to differ between the groups. Our results provide evidence that rare CNVs contribute to breast cancer susceptibility and that the disrupted genes are closely related to the TP53 tumor suppression network and to estrogen signaling.Discussion:The results from our high-resolution genome-wide scans for structural variants provide evidence that rare CNVs contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. When compared to controls, the studied breast cancer cases showed a slight but consistent increase in the frequency of rare CNVs. The difference was not as profound as seen in psychiatric disorder studies where the observed changes, typically involving large genomic regions and numerous genes, can have very severe effects on patients' phenotype and many of which are de novo mutations[4],[5]. However, in our study the biological networks affected by the disrupted genes differed between breast cancer cases and controls, supporting their role in cancer predisposition. The genes disrupted in familial cases showed a significant overrepresentation in functions involving the maintenance of genomic integrity. This included DSB repair, which is consistent with the prevailing paradigm that defects in this pathway contribute to breast cancer predisposition[2]. The three DSB repair genes, BLM, RECQL4 and DCLRE1C, disrupted in the case group all represent attractive breast cancer susceptibility genes. Moreover, IPA analysis demonstrated that the genes disrupted by rare CNVs in the studied breast cancer cases formed a network centered on TP53 and β-estradiol, a notion confirmed in two independent cohorts. Both networks are coherent and biologically meaningful, and their identification through the used genome-wide approach provides strong evidence for a role in breast cancer predisposition. TP53 network genes encode proteins functioning in pathways with potential role in malignancy prevention, including DNA damage response and apoptosis[25], but also RNA interference[33]. They all represent attractive susceptibility genes, which could harbor also other cancer predisposing mutations; thus being excellent candidates for re-sequencing studies. Of the disrupted TP53 network genes DAB2IP and CASP3 were particularly interesting. DAB2IP is a member of the Ras GTPase-activating gene family and has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor. Inactivation of DAB2IP by promoter methylation occurs in several malignancies, including prostate and breast cancer[34], and it has been shown to modulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and prostate-cancer metastasis[35]. CASP3 is an apoptosis related gene, which encodes a member of a highly conserved caspase protease family, caspase 3. Caspases are key intermediaries of the apoptotic process, failure of which can lead to cancer[36]. Various molecular epidemiological studies have suggested that SNPs in caspases may contribute to cancer risk, and a common coding variant in caspase 8 has been associated with breast cancer susceptibility[36],[37]. Curiously, apoptosis is also one of the numerous genomic integrity maintenance functions of BRCA1. Caspase 3 has been reported to mediate the cleavage of BRCA1 during UV-induced apoptosis, and the cleaved C-terminal fragment triggers the apoptotic response through activation of BRCA1 downstream effectors[38]. The rare CNVs disrupting the DAB2IP and CASP3 genes were both predicted to result in null alleles( Table 3). For estrogen, there are multiple lines of evidence for its profound role in breast cancer development, and disruptions in estrogen signaling and metabolism have long been considered to affect breast cancer risk. The estrogen network was largely explained by the genes under β-estradiol regulation, but two of the disrupted genes, ESR2 and STRN, had a more straightforward role in estrogen signalling. ESR2 encodes the estrogen receptor β, which is one of the main mediators of estrogen actions within the cell[29]. It binds estrogens with a similar affinity as estrogen receptor α, and activates expression of estrogen response element containing genes[39]. ESR2 has previously been suggested to harbor common breast cancer predisposing variants[40],[41], and ESR2 variation has been suggested to influence the development of breast cancer also by in vitro studies[42]. In contrast, striatin acts as molecular scaffold in non-genomic estrogen-mediated signaling[43]. It physically interacts with calmodulin 1[44] and estrogen receptor α, and also forms a complex with protein phosphatase 2A, which also regulates the function of estrogen receptor α[45]. The identification of a recurrent deletion allele in CYP2C19, encoding an enzyme involved in estrogen metabolism[46] and with an increased frequency in familial cases( Table S2), further emphasizes the role of estrogen in breast cancer predisposition. One CYP2C19 allele, CYP2C19*17, defining an ultra-rapid metabolizer phenotype, has previously been associated with a decreased risk for breast cancer. This suggests that increased catabolism of estrogens by CYP2C19 may lead to decreased estrogen levels and therefore reduced breast cancer risk[47]. Correspondingly, decreased activity of CYP2C19 through haploinsufficiency might potentially increase the risk of breast cancer. Curiously, based on their function both ESR2[40],[41] and CYP2C19[47] have long been considered strong candidate genes for breast cancer susceptibility. However, no structural variants have previously been reported in either of them, and it is possible that CNVs might represent a new class of cancer predisposing variation in both genes. Functionally relevant structural variants might be present also in other CYP genes that locate in gene clusters, like CYP2C19[48]. The clustering of similar genes increases the potential for unequal crossing-over between sister chromatids and thus for creation of CNV alleles. The genes disrupted in both studied breast cancer cohorts were also significantly overrepresented among genes connected to diabetes mellitus. This unexpected result likely represents shared risk factors predisposing to both breast cancer and diabetes. Indeed, these two diseases have already been reported to share several non-genetic risk factors, including obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. The hormonal factors altered in diabetes include several hormonal systems that may also affect the development of breast cancer, including insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and other growth factors as well as estrogen[49],[50]. Our results support estrogen being the key link in the association between diabetes and breast cancer, as over one third of the diabetes associated genes in the two studied breast cancer cohorts were part of the β-estradiol network. In conclusion, rare CNVs should be recognized as an alternative source of genetic variation influencing breast cancer risk. This notion is further supported by a recent study which also provided evidence for rare CNVs' contribution to familial and early-onset breast cancer[51]. The results from the current network analysis with two independent breast cancer cohorts provide strong evidence for the role of estrogen mediated signaling in breast cancer predisposition and reinforce the concept of TP53 centered tumor suppression in the prevention of malignancy. The variety of disrupted genes belonging to these networks underscores that diverse mechanisms are likely to be relevant to breast cancer pathogenesis.","answer":"Although genetic susceptibility to breast cancer has been well-established , the majority of the predisposing factors still remain unidentified .

Transdermal drug delivery of proteins is challenging because the skin acts as a natural and protective barrier. Several techniques including using the cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been studied to increase the penetration of therapeutic proteins into and through the skin. CPPs facilitate and improve the transduction of large and hydrophilic cargo molecules through plasma membrane. We have recently reported an efficient skin delivery of elastin protein in complex with a CPP called Pep-1. Since the biophysical characteristics of CPP/protein complexes have been linked with their biological responses, in the present study, we investigated biophysical properties of Pep-1/elastin complexes (ratio 10:1) stored in three temperatures (-20°C, 4°C and 25°C) by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS), Circular Dichroism (CD) and isothermal denaturation. We also evaluated the ability of transduction of this complex into cells and skin tissue using both fluorescence microscopy and Kodak In-Vivo FX Pro Imaging System.

Therefore, the discovery and development of new potent and selective anticancer drugs are of high importance in modern cancer research.</p><p>1,2,4-Triazole derivatives have received much attention due to their versatile biological properties including antibacterial, antifungal, anticonvulsant, antiinflammatory, anticancer, and antiproliferative properties [1-10]. 1,2,4-Triazole nucleus has been incorporated into a wide variety of therapeutically interesting molecules to transform them into better drugs [11-13]. Schiff bases of 1,2,4-triazoles have also been found to possess extensive biological activities [14-18]. On the other hand, γ-substituted butenolide moiety represents a biological important entity that is present in numerous biologically active natural products [19-24].</p><p>Recently, we reported on the synthesis of a series of hybrid 1,3,4-thiadiazoles derivatives possessing γ-substituted butenolide moiety, which exhibited good anticancer activities against cervical cancer cells [25]. In continuation of our studies on the identification of potential active antitumor compounds, herein we report the synthesis and evaluation of a new series of hybrid 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases bearing γ-substituted butenolide moiety as potential anticancer agents (Figure 1). To the best of authors' knowledge, the synthesis and anticancer activities of this types of compounds have not been reported so far.</p><p>The general structure of target compounds.</p>Results and discussion<p>The enantiomerically pure γ-substituted butenolides 1 were synthesized via acetalization of mucobromic acid by employing (−)-menthol and (+)-borneol as a chiral auxiliary, respectively, and followed by resolution of the resulting diastereomers [25-27].</p><p>The 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases 6 were synthesized by condensation 4-amino-5-substituted-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-thiols 5 with aromatic aldehydes in glacial acetic acid (Scheme 1) [14]. The 4-amino-5-substituted-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-thiols 5 were prepared according to the previous procedure [28,29]. When R1 is methyl, the compound 5a was prepared by heating a mixture of thiocarbohydrazide with acetic acid [28]. When R1 are aryl, a different procedure was employed as aromatic carboxylic acids are generally solid, have high melting points, and are difficult to react with thiocarbohydrazide fully [29]. Thus, staring from aromatic carboxylic acid esters 2, the aroyl hydrazides 3 were obtained by reaction with hydrazine in EtOH. Treatment of the aroyl hydrazides 3 with CS2 under a basic condition (KOH/EtOH) gave the corresponding potassium aroyl dithiocarbazates 4. Then, the resulting compounds 4 were cyclized with hydrazine to provide the compounds 5b–d in good yields.</p><p>Synthesis of 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases 6.</p>Results and discussion<p>The target compounds 7a–l were prepared via tandem Michael addition–elimination reaction of γ-substituted butenolides 1 with 5-substituted 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases 6 under phase-transfer catalysis conditions (Scheme 2).</p><p>Synthesis of target compounds 7a–l.</p>Results and discussion<p>The structures of these new compounds 7a–l were characterized with IR, 1H, 13 C NMR, and LC-MS spectra.

Please answer the question based on the provided context. Do not include any text in your response other than the answer.Question: What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?Context: We found that localized DNA demethylation at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) induced by 5-AzaCdR, reduced IGF2, increased H19 expression, increased CTCF and cohesin recruitment and changed histone modifications.Furthermore chromatin accessibility was increased locus-wide and chromatin looping topography was altered such that a CTCF site downstream of the H19 enhancers switched its association with the CTCF site upstream of the IGF2 promoters to associate with the ICR.The parent-of-origin-dependent expression of IGF2 and H19 is controlled by the imprinting center 1 (IC1) consisting of a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulatorIn conclusion, methylation defects at the IGF2-H19 locus can result from inherited mutations of the imprinting center and have high recurrence risk or arise independently from the sequence context and not transmitted to the progeny.Specific epigenetic alterations of IGF2-H19 locus in spermatozoa from infertile men.In the teratozoospermia group, 11 of 19 patients presented a loss of methylation at variable CpG positions either in the IGF2 DMR2 or in both the IGF2 DMR2 and the 6th CTCF of the H19 DMRThis study demonstrates that epigenetic perturbations of the 6th CTCF site of the H19 DMR might be a relevant biomarker for quantitative defects of spermatogenesis in humans.Hyper- and hypomethylation at the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region (ICR) result in reciprocal changes in IGF2-H19 expression and the two contrasting growth disorders, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS)The two alternative chromatin conformations are differently favoured in BWS and SRS likely predisposing the locus to the activation of IGF2 or H19, respectivelyEpigenetic status of the H19 locus in human oocytes following in vitro maturation.To evaluate if maturing human oocytes in vitro would be hazardous at the epigenetic level, we first determined the methylation profile of the H19 differentially methylated region (DMR). The methylation status of the H19 DMR seems particularly vulnerable to in vitro culture conditionsWe have identified a region with characteristics of a paternal-specific methylation imprint at the human H19 locusStructural analysis revealed the presence of CpG islands and a large direct repeat with a 400 bp sequence reiterated several times, but no significant sequence homology to the corresponding region of the mouse H19 gene.These findings could suggest a role for secondary DNA structure in genomic imprinting across the species, and they also present a puzzling aspect of the evolution of the H19 regulatory region in human and mouse.Mouse/human sequence divergence in a region with a paternal-specific methylation imprint at the human H19 locus.Furthermore, the chromatin loop organized by the CTCF-bound, differentially methylated region at the Igf2/H19 locus can be detected in mitosis.The H19 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor.The H19 locus belongs to a cluster of imprinted genes that is linked to the human Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The expression of H19 and its closely associated IGF2 gene is frequently deregulated in some human tumors, such as Wilms' tumors.The H19 locus thus clearly displays a tumor suppressor effect in mice.Mono-allelic expression at the mouse IGF2/H19 locus is controlled by differential allelic DNA methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR).In the mouse Igf2/H19 imprinted locus, differential methylation of the imprinting control region (H19 ICR) is established during spermatogenesis and is maintained in offspring throughout development.Imprinted expression of the mouse Igf2/H19 locus is controlled by parent-of-origin-specific methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR).The imprinted expression of the mouse Igf2/H19 locus is governed by the differential methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR), which is established initially in germ cells and subsequently maintained in somatic cells, depending on its parental origin.Microdeletions at the human H19/IGF2 ICR (IC1) are proposed to be responsible for IC1 epimutations associated with imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS).CTCF binding sites and DNA methylation at the ICR have previously been identified as key cis-acting elements required for proper H19/Igf2 imprinting.Genomic imprinting at the H19/Igf2 locus is governed by a cis-acting Imprinting-Control Region (ICR), located 2 kb upstream of the H19 gene.A maternally inherited H19 ICR inhibits Igf2 gene activation by the downstream enhancer due to its insulator function while it suppresses H19 gene transcription by promoter DNA methylation when paternally inherited.Thus, the ICR autonomously recapitulated imprinting within the normally nonimprinted transgenic beta-globin gene locus, but the temporal establishment of imprinting methylation differs from that at the endogenous Igf2/H19 locus.Like most imprinted genes, H19 and Igf2 are regulated by a differentially methylated imprinting control region (ICR).It is thought that the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) directs the silencing of the maternally inherited Igf2 allele through a CTCF-dependent chromatin insulator.Mutation of CTCF binding sites in the H19 ICR leads to loss of CTCF binding and de novo methylation of a CTCF target site within Igf2 DMR1, showing that CTCF can coordinate regional epigenetic marks.Thus, the ICR autonomously recapitulated imprinting within the normally nonimprinted transgenic beta-globin gene locus, but the temporal establishment of imprinting methylation differs from that at the endogenous Igf2/H19 locus.<br>the imprinted expression of the mouse igf2 h19 locus is governed by the differential methylation of the imprinting control region icr which is established initially in germ cells and subsequently maintained in somatic cells depending on its parental origin by grafting a 2 9 kbp h19 icr fragment into a human beta globin yeast artificial chromosome in transgenic mice we previously showed that the icr could recapitulate imprinted methylation and expression at a heterologous locus suggesting that the h19 icr in the beta globin locus contained sufficient information to maintain the methylation mark k tanimoto m shimotsuma h matsuzaki a omori j bungert j d engel and a fukamizu proc natl acad sci usa 102 10250 10255 2005 curiously however the transgenic h19 icr was not methylated in sperm which was distinct from that seen in the endogenous locus here we reevaluated the ability of the h19 icr to mark the parental origin using more rigid criteria in the testis the methylation levels of the solitary 2 9 kbp transgenic icr fragment varied significantly between six transgenic mouse lines however in somatic cells the paternally inherited icr fragment exhibited consistently higher methylation levels at five out of six randomly integrated sites in the mouse genome these results clearly demonstrated that the h19 icr could acquire parent of origin dependent methylation after fertilization independently of the chromosomal integration site or the prerequisite methylation acquisition in male germ cells.mono allelic expression at the mouse igf2 h19 locus is controlled by differential allelic dna methylation of the imprinting control region icr because a randomly integrated h19 icr fragment when incorporated into the genome of transgenic mice tgm was allele specifically methylated in somatic but not in germ cells it was suggested that allele discriminating epigenetic signature set within or somewhere outside of the tg h19 icr fragment in germ cells was later translated into a differential dna methylation pattern to test if the chicken β globin hs4 chs4 chromatin insulator might interfere with methylation imprinting establishment at the h19 icr we inserted the h19 icr fragment flanked by a set of floxed chs4 core sequences into a human β globin locus yac and generated tgm insulated icr tgm as controls the chs4 sequences were removed from one side 5 hs4 deleted icr or both sides pseudo wt icr of the insulated icr by in vivo cre loxp recombination the data show that while maternally inherited transgenic h19 icr was not methylated in insulated icr tgm it was significantly methylated upon paternal transmission though the level was lower than in the pseudo wt icr control because this reduced level of methylation was also observed in the 5 hs4 deleted icr tgm we speculate that the phenotype is due to vezf1 dependent demethylation activity rather than the insulator function borne in chs4 collectively although we cannot rule out the possibility that chs4 is incapable of blocking an allele discriminating signal from outside of the transgene the epigenetic signature appears to be marked intrinsically within the h19 icr.a subset of genes in mammals are subject to genomic imprinting the mouse h19 gene for example is active only when maternally inherited and the neighboring igf2 gene is paternally expressed this imprinted expression pattern is regulated by the imprinting control region icr upstream of the h19 gene a maternally inherited h19 icr inhibits igf2 gene activation by the downstream enhancer due to its insulator function while it suppresses h19 gene transcription by promoter dna methylation when paternally inherited these parent of origin specific functions depend on the allele specific methylation of the icr dna which is established during gametogenesis therefore the icr may also function as a landmark for epigenetic modifications to examine whether the icr confers these activities autonomously we introduced a 2 9 kbp icr containing dna fragment into a human beta globin yeast artificial chromosome at the 3 end of the locus control region and established transgenic mouse lines expression of all of the beta like globin genes was higher when the transgene was paternally inherited in accord with this result transgenic icr dna from nucleated erythrocytes was more heavily methylated when paternally transmitted chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ccctc binding factor is preferentially recruited to the maternal transgenic icr in vivo surprisingly however the parent of origin specific methylation pattern was not observed in germ cell dna in testis demonstrating that methylation was established after fertilization thus the icr autonomously recapitulated imprinting within the normally nonimprinted transgenic beta globin gene locus but the temporal establishment of imprinting methylation differs from that at the endogenous igf2 h19 locus.genomic imprinting at the h19 igf2 locus is governed by a cis acting imprinting control region icr located 2 kb upstream of the h19 gene this region possesses an insulator function which is activated on the unmethylated maternal allele through the binding of the ctcf factor it has been previously reported that paternal transmission of the h19 silk deletion which removes the 3 portion of h19 icr leads to the loss of h19 imprinting here we show that in the liver this reactivation of the paternal h19 gene is concomitant to a dramatic decrease in igf2 mrna levels this deletion alters higher order chromatin architecture igf2 promoter usage and tissue specific expression therefore when methylated the 3 portion of the h19 icr is a bi functional regulatory element involved not only in h19 imprinting but also in formatting the higher order chromatin structure for proper tissue specific expression of both h19 and igf2 genes.imprinted expression of the mouse igf2 h19 locus is controlled by parent of origin specific methylation of the imprinting control region icr we previously demonstrated that when placed in a heterologous genomic context the h19 icr fragment contains an intrinsic activity that allows it to acquire differential methylation in somatic cells but not in germ cells in the present study we investigated the requirements for the ctcf binding sites of the icr in the acquisition of post fertilization methylation to this end two mutant icr fragments were introduced into the human beta globin locus in a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse tgm model 4xmut had mutations in all four icr ctcf binding sites that prevented ctcf binding but retained the methylation target cpg motifs and 9cg harbored mutations in the cpg motifs within the ctcf binding sites but each site retained constitutive ctcf binding activity in tgm germ cells and pre implantation blastocysts the absence of ctcf binding sites 4xmut did not lead to hypermethylation of the transgenic h19 icr however after implantation the mutations of ctcf sites 4xmut and 9cg affected the maintenance of methylation these results demonstrated that although the ctcf binding sites are indispensable for maintenance of the unmethylated state of the maternal icr in post implantation embryos they are not required to establish paternal allele specific methylation of the transgenic h19 icr in pre implantation embryos.one of the best studied read outs of epigenetic change is the differential expression of imprinted genes controlled by differential methylation of imprinted control regions icrs to address the impact of genotype on the epigenome we performed a detailed study in 128 pairs of monozygotic mz and 128 pairs of dizygotic dz twins interrogating the dna methylation status of the icrs of igf2 h19 kcnq1 gnas and the non imprinted gene runx1 while we found a similar overall pattern of methylation between mz and dz twins we also observed a high degree of variability in individual cpg methylation levels notably at the h19 igf2 loci a degree of methylation plasticity independent of the genome sequence was observed with both local and regional cpg methylation changes discordant between mz and dz individual pairs however concordant gains or losses of methylation within individual twin pairs were more common in mz than dz twin pairs indicating that de novo and or maintenance methylation is influenced by the underlying dna sequence specifically for the first time we showed that the rs10732516 a polymorphism located in a critical ctcf binding site in the h19 icr locus is strongly associated with increased hypermethylation of specific cpg sites in the maternal h19 allele together our results highlight the impact of the genome on the epigenome and demonstrate that while dna methylation states are tightly maintained between genetically identical and related individuals there remains considerable epigenetic variation that may contribute to disease susceptibility.","answer":"We found that localized DNA demethylation at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) induced by 5-AzaCdR, reduced IGF2, increased H19 expression, increased CTCF and cohesin

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is a pluripotent activator of inflammation by inducing a proinflammatory cytokine cascade. This phenomenon is mediated, in part, through inducible expression of the CXC chemokine, interleukin-8 (IL-8). In this study, we investigate the role of TNFalpha-inducible reactive oxygen species (ROS) in IL-8 expression by \\" monocyte-like \\" U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells. TNFalpha is a rapid activator of IL-8 gene expression by U937, producing a 50-fold induction of mRNA within 1 hour of treatment. In gene transfection assays, the effect of TNFalpha requires the presence of an inducible nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (Rel A) binding site in the IL-8 promoter. TNFalpha treatment induces a rapid translocation of the 65 kD transcriptional activator NF-kappaB subunit, Rel A, whose binding in the nucleus occurs before changes in intracellular ROS. Pretreatment (or up to 15 minutes posttreatment) relative to TNFalpha with the antioxidant dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (2% [ vol / vol ]) blocks 80% of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. Surprisingly, however, DMSO has no effect on inducible Rel A binding. Similar selective effects on NF-kappaB transcription are seen with the unrelated antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin C. These data indicate that TNFalpha induces a delayed ROS-dependent signalling pathway that is required for NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and is separable from that required for its nuclear translocation. Further definition of this pathway will yield new insights into inflammation initiated by TNFalpha signalling.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells\\", \\"U937\\"], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [\\"IL - 8 gene\\", \\"inducible nuclear factor - kappaB (NF - kappaB) (Rel A) binding site\\", \\"IL - 8 promoter\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"NF - kappaB subunit\\", \\"Tumor necrosis factor alpha\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor alpha\\", \\"proinflammatory cytokine\\", \\"Rel A\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"CXC chemokine\\", \\"65 kD transcriptional activator\\", \\"Nuclear factor - kappaB\\", \\"interleukin - 8\\", \\"IL - 8\\", \\"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)\\", \\"TNFalpha\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"mRNA\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

GTP hydrolysis, which is stimulated upon dynamin polymerization, induces a change in the conformation of the dynamin coil and promotes dynamin polymer disassembly (3–5). Mammals express three dynamin genes, encoding dynamins (Dyns) 1, 2 and 3 (6). Dyn1 is abundant in presynaptic nerve terminals and participates in rapid synaptic vesicle recycling. Ubiquitously-expressed Dyn2 has a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, Golgi budding, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Dyn3, the least studied of the three dynamins, was originally identified in testes, but has since been shown to participate in restructuring of dendritic spines (7,8). In addition, Dyn3 may have a role in synaptic vesicle recycling in presynaptic terminals, as this isoform (but not Dyn 2) can partially rescue this process in Dyn1 knockout mice (9).</p><p>The three dynamins have the same overall domain structure, including an N-terminal catalytic domain, followed by a middle domain that mediates dynamin-dynamin interactions, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain involved in phosphoinositide binding, a GTPase effector domain (GED) that interacts with the catalytic domain and promotes concentration-dependent GTPase activation, and a C-terminal proline/arginine rich domain (PRD) known to mediate interactions between dynamins and other proteins. The sequences of the three dynamins are reasonably conserved but are most divergent in their PRDs. Dyns 1 and 2 have been extensively characterized in vitro. They express basal GTPase activities of ~1–2 min−1 (Dyn1) or ~10–20 min−1 (Dyn2), which can be stimulated to ~200 min−1 in the presence of scaffolds, such as microtubules (10–12). These scaffolds facilitate dynamin self-assembly, presumably allowing productive interactions between the catalytic and GED domains. Dyns 1 and 2 can also self-assemble in the absence of scaffolds at sufficiently low ionic strength and sufficiently high dynamin concentrations (3,13,14). Dyn2, by itself, polymerizes at lower concentrations than Dyn1, and achieves much higher levels of concentration-dependent self-activated GTPase activity (~10 per min for Dyn1; ~100 per min for Dyn2) (3).</p><p>In contrast to Dyns 1 and 2, almost nothing is known about the physical and enzymatic properties of Dyn3. To determine its ability to self-assemble and self-activate, we expressed human Dyn3 in Sf9 cells with a C-terminal His6 tag and purified the protein by affinity to Ni2+ resin. As shown in Figures 1A and 1B, Dyn3 expressed high GTPase activity which, like that of Dyn2, was concentration dependent and approximately 10-fold higher than that of Dyn1 (~100 min−1 vs. ~10 min−1) (3). Using a turbidity assay, we observed that Dyn3 was also similar to Dyn2 with respect to its strong propensity to self-assemble (compare Figure 1C with Figure 3). Moreover, Dyn2 and Dyn3 polymers disassembled at similar rates upon addition of GTP. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements indicated that, like Dyns 1 and 2 (15,16), unassembled Dyn3 exists in a monomer-tetramer equilibrium with a Ka (1,4) of 8.1 ×1019 M−3 (Figure S1).</p><p>As stated, dynamin isoforms differ in their abilities to self-assemble into higher-order structures upon dilution into low ionic strength buffers. To identify the domains responsible for these differences, we analyzed a series of dynamin hybrids with interchanged GED and PRD segments (Figure 2A). Because the GED is critical for both dynamin self-assembly (17) and self-activation (18), and was shown to interact directly with the catalytic domain (18,19), we first examined hybrids of Dyns 1 and 2 with exchanged GEDs. Surprisingly, the concentration-dependent GTPase activities of Dyn1(GED2) and Dyn2(GED1) were nearly identical to those of Dyn1 and Dyn2, respectively (Figures 2B and 2C). However, the hybrid protein consisting of Dyn1 with the PRD of Dyn2 (Dyn1(PRD2)) expressed even stronger self-activation than wild-type Dyn2 (compare Figures 2B and 2C). Conversely, Dyn2(PRD1) and Dyn3(PRD1) showed lower self-activation than their wild-type parent molecules (for wild-type activities see Figures 2C and 1B), albeit slightly higher than that of wild-type Dyn1. Confirming the importance of the PRDs in self-activation, a construct consisting of Dyn1 with both the GED and PRD of Dyn2 behaved like wild-type Dyn2, while a construct consisting of Dyn2 with the GED and PRD of Dyn1 behaved like Dyn1 (data not shown). Thus, the PRD is a major determinant of the abilities of the three dynamins to self-activate. To verify that the hybrid dynamins were properly folded, we compared the PI(4,5)P2-stimulated GTPase activities of the PRD-swapped mutants with those of wild-type dynamins. These assays were carried out at low dynamin concentrations (0.1μM) to minimize self-activation of Dyn2 and Dyn3. All six dynamins expressed PI(4,5)P2-activated GTPase activities of approximately 80–100 min−1 (Figure S2), suggesting that the mutations did not alter protein conformation. The activities of constructs analyzed in this study are compiled in Table S1.</p><p>We next asked whether Dyn1 interferes with the strong self-activating abilities of Dyn2 and Dyn3. Assays were performed on mixtures consisting of fixed (0.5 μM) concentrations of Dyn2 or Dyn3 and various concentrations of Dyn1. Figure 2D shows that the activities of both Dyn2 and Dyn3 were dramatically reduced as a function of Dyn1 concentration, indicating that the dynamin isoforms copolymerize, and that the presence of Dyn1 in these copolymers has a negative effect on GTPase self-activation. These results suggest that the PRD of one dynamin in the polymer interacts with one or more domains of an adjacent dynamin, as speculated previously by Muhlberg et al. (18).</p><p>Because concentration-dependent GTPase activation is tightly coupled to dynamin self-assembly, we asked whether the differential abilities of the dynamin isoforms to polymerize are also controlled by their PRDs. Using turbidity assays to monitor dynamin assembly, we found that Dyn2(PRD1) polymerized to approximately the same extent as wild-type Dyn2 (Figure 3A). However, Dyn2(PRD1) polymers consistently disassembled more rapidly and extensively than wild-type Dyn2 polymers upon addition of GTP (Figures 3A and S3) and were more susceptible to disassembly by increased ionic strength (Figure S4). The turbidity of Dyn1(PRD2) increased more markedly than that of wild-type Dyn1, and these polymers were even more resistant than Dyn2 polymers to GTP-induced disassembly. The latter observation may explain the high level of concentration-dependent GTPase activation of Dyn1(PRD2) relative to that of Dyn2 (Figures 2B and 2C). The Dyn3(PRD1) construct was essentially unable to self-assemble under our conditions (Figure 3A).</p><p>This study demonstrates the importance of the PRD in determining the lower propensity of Dyn1 to self-assemble and to express concentration-dependent GTPase activation compared to Dyns 2 and 3. At present there is insufficient information to provide a molecular basis for this finding, as no X-ray structures containing the PRD are available, and cryo-electron microscopy images have been obtained using truncated dynamins lacking the PRD (20).</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that the PRD is a positive regulator of Dyn1 assembly and self-activation. For example, Dyn1 polymers fail to form in vitro at low ionic strength if the PRD is removed by limited proteolysis (18) or by introduction of a stop codon after the GED (3). Also, deletion of residues 792–841 from the PRD reduces the strength of Dyn1 self-interactions in a yeast two-hybrid assay (21). The PRD is also important for self-assembly and self-activation of Dyn2 (3) (see also Figures S5 A and B of this study). To reconcile these earlier observations with our current results, we suggest that whereas the PRD is necessary to initiate self-assembly of all three forms of dynamin, the Dyn1 PRD is less effective than the PRDs of Dyn2 or Dyn3 in stabilizing dynamin polymers once they are formed. Recent evidence demonstrates that membrane fission is likely to occur concomitantly with dynamin disassembly (4,5). Therefore, PRD-dependent destabilization of Dyn1 polymers may contribute to the rapidity of synaptic vesicle retrieval in neurons, which is not an essential feature of Dyn2-catalyzed receptor-mediated endocytosis (22). Interestingly, point mutations in the Dyn2 middle and PH domains of centronuclear myopathy patients were found to enhance Dyn2 polymerization and GTPase activity (23,24), further highlighting the importance of properly controlled dynamin disassembly.</p><p>Replacement of the Dyn2 PRD with that of Dyn1 profoundly reduced the GTPase activity of Dyn2 without affecting its ability to self-assemble, demonstrating that dynamin polymerization alone is insufficient to promote catalytic activation. In support of this conclusion, Dyn1 polymers formed at high dynamin concentrations and very low ionic strength were also shown to express low GTPase activity (~10 min−1) (13). In contrast, assembly of Dyn1 on microtubules or anionic liposomes elicited GTPase activities of >200 min−1 (12). We suggest that these microtubule and liposome scaffolds stabilize dynamin polymers, overcoming the de-stabilization caused by the presence of the Dyn1 PRD, and allowing multiple cycles of the GTPase reaction to occur prior to polymer disassembly.</p><p>Biochemical analysis of Dyn3.

Brain-specific dynamin 1 has a lower propensity to self-assemble and self-activate than ubiquitously-expressed dynamin 2. Here we show that dynamin 3, which has important functions in neuronal synapses, shares the self-assembly and GTPase activation characteristics of dynamin 2. Analysis of dynamin hybrids and of dynamin 1/2 and 1/3 heteropolymers, reveals that concentration-dependent GTPase activation is suppressed by the C-terminal proline/arginine-rich domain of dynamin 1. Dynamin proline/arginine-rich domains also mediate interactions with SH3 domain-containing proteins and thus regulate both self-and hetero-associations of dynamins."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

The Rel / NF-kappa B family of transcription factors is composed of two distinct subgroups, proteins that undergo proteolytic processing and contain SWI6 / ankyrin repeats in their carboxyl termini (p105, p98), and those without such repeats that do not require processing (p65, c-Rel, RelB, and Dorsal). We demonstrate that the p105 and p98 precursors share functional properties with the I kappa B proteins, which also contain SWI6 / ankyrin repeats. Both p105 and p98 were found to form stable complexes with other Rel / NF-kappa B family members, including p65 and c-Rel. Association with the precursors is sufficient for cytoplasmic retention of either p65 or c-Rel, both of which are otherwise nuclear. These complexes undergo stimulus-responsive processing to produce active p50 / c-Rel and p55 / c-Rel complexes. These observations suggest a second pathway leading to NF-kappa B induction, in which processing of the precursors rather than phosphorylation of I kappa B plays a major role.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"p98\\", \\"RelB\\", \\"p105\\", \\"such repeats\\", \\"p50 / c - Rel\\", \\"carboxyl termini\\", \\"c - Rel\\", \\"p65\\", \\"p55 / c - Rel\\", \\"SWI6 / ankyrin repeats\\", \\"precursor proteins\\", \\"I kappa B proteins\\", \\"NF - kappa B\\", \\"Rel / NF - kappa B family\\", \\"Rel / NF - kappa B family members\\", \\"Dorsal\\", \\"I kappa B\\", \\"transcription factors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

The α subunit of β-conglycinin is a major allergen in soybean. The objective of this study was to predict and identify the linear immunoglobulin (Ig)E epitopes of the soybean α subunit of β-conglycinin. Three immunoinformatics tools were used to predict the potential epitopes and were confirmed by dot-blot inhibition using sera from soybean allergic subjects. As a result, 15 peptides were predicted and assembled by solid-phase synthesis. Eleven epitopes were identified by the dot-blot inhibition test. Moreover, peptide 3 had IgE binding capability with all sera(5/5) tested, while peptide 1, 4, 6, 8 and12 could bind to 4/5 of the sera samples.

This systematic review examines its patient -specific applications in craniomaxillofacial surgery. Terms related to \\" three-dimensional printing \\" and \\" surgery \\" were searched on PubMed on May 4, 2015; 313 unique articles were returned. Inclusion and exclusion criteria concentrated on patient -specific surgical applications, yielding 141 full-text articles, of which 33 craniomaxillofacial articles were analyzed. Thirty-three articles included 315 patients who underwent three-dimensional printing -assisted operations. The most common modeling software was Mimics, the most common printing software was 3D Systems, the average time to create a printed object was 18.9 hours (range, 1.5 to 96 hours), and the average cost of a printed object was 1353.31 (range, 69.75 to 5500). Surgical procedures were divided among 203 craniofacial patients (205 three-dimensional printing objects) and 112 maxillofacial patients (137 objects). Printing technologies could be classified as contour models, guides, splints, and implants. For craniofacial patients, 173 contour models (84 percent), 13 guides (6 percent), two splints (1 percent), and 17 implants (8 percent) were made. For maxillofacial patients, 41 contour models (30 percent), 48 guides (35 percent), 40 splints (29 percent), and eight implants (6 percent) were made. These distributions were significantly different (p < 0.0001). Four studies compared three-dimensional printing techniques to conventional techniques; two of them found that three-dimensional printing produced improved outcomes. Three-dimensional printing technology in craniomaxillofacial surgery can be classified into contour models (type I), guides (type II), splints (type III), and implants (type IV). These four methods vary in their use between craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery, reflecting their different goals. This understanding may help advance and predict three-dimensional printing applications for other types of plastic surgery and beyond.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"techniques\\", \\"technology\\", \\"operations\\", \\"Printing technologies\\", \\"surgery\\", \\"Technologies\\", \\"surgical\\", \\"craniofacial\\", \\"maxillofacial surgery\\", \\"Craniomaxillofacial Surgery\\", \\"craniomaxillofacial surgery\\", \\"Surgical procedures\\", \\"plastic surgery\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"methods\\", \\"Classification\\", \\"classified\\", \\"modeling software\\", \\"articles\\", \\"3D Systems\\", \\"craniomaxillofacial articles\\", \\"systematic review\\", \\"Mimics\\", \\"printing software\\", \\"goals\\", \\"Systematic Review\\", \\"PubMed\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [\\"guides\\", \\"splints\\", \\"implants\\"], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"studies\\", \\"analyzed\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: Among the conspicuous examples are influenza A, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, severe adult respiratory distress (SARS), coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus , which challenge prevention and control measures of public health systems [7] . In the Americas, the recent outbreak of pandemic influenza A subtype H1N1 became a major target for control due to its rapid spread, and uncertainties in virulence and transmissibility, yet vaccine availability was limited when significant activity occurred in advance of the traditional influenza season [8] . However, in the last century outbreaks of several viral-related diseases have emerged or re-emerged involving arenaviruses and dengue viruses, and more recently, hantaviruses, and the expansion of the geographic range of West Nile virus. Among zoonotic diseases, small mammals are hosts of several pathogenic RNA viruses, especially Arenaviridae and Bunyaviridae: Hantavirus [9] [10] [11] . Hantavirus infections became a concern in the Americas after the description of an outbreak of acute respiratory distress occurred in the Four Corners area in 1993 [12] . The newly recognized disease, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, HCPS (or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome), was linked to infection by the newly-discovered Sin Nombre virus (SNV), and the rodent Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse) was identified as the reservoir [13] . However, hantavirus infections have a much longer history. A review of ancient Chinese writings, dating back to approximately 960 AD, revealed descriptions closely resembling hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), the syndrome caused by Old World hantaviruses [14] . During the twentieth century, cases of acute febrile disease with renal compromise were described from several Eurasian countries and Japan, often in association with military engagements [15] . HFRS as a distinct syndrome, however, was first brought to the attention of western medicine in association with an outbreak that occurred among United Nations troops during the Korean conflict between 1951 and 1954, where more than 3,200 soldiers were afflicted [16] . It took more than two decades until the etiologic agent, Hantaan virus (HTNV), was isolated from the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius, detected in part by the binding of antibodies from patient serum samples to the lung tissues of healthy, wild-caught field mice [17, 18] . The virus was later found to represent the type species of a new genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae, although it was later apparent that the first hantavirus to be isolated was the shrew-borne Thottapalayam virus [19] . The categorization of hantaviruses as belonging to the family Bunyaviridae is due in part to the consistent presence of three RNA genomes that are circularized in vivo as a result of the presence of terminal complementary nucleotides that help fold the genome into a -hairpin‖ morphology, first described for the Uukuniemi phlebovirus [19, 20] . Table 1 is a list of the predominant, serologically distinct pathogenic hantaviruses. Many other named genotypes are described, but such other pathogenic forms are generally closely related to Andes or, in some cases, Sin Nombre virus. During virus maturation, the precursor form GPC is processed using a membrane -bound protease into Gn and Gc, a cleavage that occurs, and appears to be signaled, after the conserved peptide signal WAASA at the C-terminal of Gn [24] . Although the two proteins can be expressed independently through transfection, they can be retained in the wrong cellular compartment (ER or aggresome); they thus must be co-expressed to allow them stability so that the two can be assembled correctly in the Golgi [25, [27] [28] [29] . A number of activities and properties have been identified for the hantavirus envelope glycoproteins, including some features that are suspected to be involved in the pathogenicity of the disease-causing serotypes, a possibility that has engendered experimental attention. The glycoproteins are the known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors, the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor, or DAF [30, 31] ; with gC1qR/p32 also identified as another potential entry receptor [32] . Comparisons with the tick-borne encephalitis virus E protein, led Tischler et al. to consider the Gc glycoprotein as a potential class II fusion protein, perhaps imparting fusion activity to the virion, and this hypothesis has gained support in other studies [33, 34] . Additional activities have been identified with, or claimed to be related to, Gn. For many of these studies, an underlying premise has held that there are differences between the glycoproteins of -pathogenic‖ hantaviruses relative to viruses in the genus that are dubbed to be -non-pathogenic‖. While it is true that it has not yet been possible to link Prospect Hill virus (PHV) to human disease, the absence of evidence for its pathogenicity should perhaps not be equated with the evidence of its absence. One might only consider that the level of disease (e.g., lethargy, fever, proteinuria, and azotemia) associated with infection of nonhuman primates by PHV is not significantly different from that recorded for nonhuman primate models using the known-pathogen Puumala virus (PUUV) [35, 36] . For the purpose of this discussion we will presume that apathogenic hantaviruses are indeed apathogenic. While some studies have suggested that Gn glycoproteins are directed more rapidly into the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway than are apathogenic forms, others have interpreted differences in the handling of Gn glycoproteins across hantavirus species by the ubiquitin-proteosomal system as independent of pathogenicity [37] [38] [39] . Some investigators have directed their efforts toward identifying a differential capacity, either kinetic or in absolute magnitude, in the ability of pathogenic and apathogenic hantaviruses to elicit an interferon response in cells. One premise that emerges is that apathogenic forms would tend to induce an earlier innate response that would render it more likely that the virus would be quickly cleared or rendered less competent in its replication so as to blunt any pathological response in the host [40] [41] [42] . The anti-hantavirus innate response can in some cases be attributed to viral interaction as a ligand of TLR-3, but not in others, and in endothelial cells, it appears not to require more than the viral particle itself, even when introduced in replication-incompetent form [43, 44] . Proteins and mRNAs prominently induced by hantaviruses include MxA and IFIT-1 (ISG-56) and others including some with known or suspected anti-viral activity. Those hantaviruses, often highly pathogenic strains, that fail to induce a potent antiviral response, are suspected or presumed to have a (more) potent interferon-pathway antagonism mechanism relative to other viruses, a mechanism that acts positively to prevent an effective innate response from forming, at least early in infection [42, 45] . Yet some instances are reported wherein highly pathogenic hantaviruses, such as SNV, are also able to induce expression of interferon-stimulated gene mRNAs, even very early in infection, with ISG proteins, as expected, taking longer to appear in the cell [44] . Anti-interferon activities have also been attributed to the NSs protein that may be elaborated in cells infected by serotypes that encode this protein [46] . Other investigators have examined the activities of hantavirus glycoproteins and other proteins that might themselves directly affect some aspects of the pathogenic progression associated with hantavirus infection of humans, such as vascular permeability changes. While early attempts to directly cause increases in permeability of endothelial monolayers with viral particles or viral infection were largely disappointing, hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating VEG-F-induced endothelial permeability [47, 48] . The shorter (50-kD) nucleocapsid or N protein is a structural component of the viral nucleocapsid, along with the genomic viral RNA segments. As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments with high affinity [49, 50] , it limits the access of the RNA to host nucleases and helps to render viral replication a closed process within the cytoplasm. It also acts as a peripheral membrane protein, as does the L protein [51] , an activity that could play a role in its presumed, but not yet demonstrated function as matrix [52] . Until recently, it had not been appreciated that N has a wide variety of other activities, some of which can be linked, not only to fundamental requirements of replication, but also to the interference with an array of the intracellular processes of the normal cell. Thus, an interaction between the amino terminus of the hantavirus N protein and the cellular protein Daxx has been proposed, with the suggestion of potential pro-apoptotic consequences [51] . N is also reported to interact with actin microfilaments, and the SUMO-1 protein [53, 54] . Using reporter-gene based assays, Connie Schmaljohn and her colleagues have reported that Hantaan virus' nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B). The effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS [55] . In the cytoplasm of infected cells, N protein can be found in cellular P bodies where it sequesters and protects 5' caps. It may locate the caps through its interaction with DCP1, a key constituent of P bodies. During hantavirus infection, the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies, through their interaction with N and DCP1. The N protein demonstrates preferential protection of mRNAs engineered to prematurely terminate their encoded protein in comparison to native mRNAs [56] . N protein has been increasingly linked to viral replication and translation, sometimes in previously unanticipated ways. It is among a growing family of diverse viral proteins that can serve as a nonspecific -RNA chaperone‖, an activity that should facilitate the L polymerase's access to vRNA for transcription and replication, in that it can transiently dissociate misfolded RNA structures [57] . Some of N protein's effects on translation might not immediately be recognized to be adaptive in nature. It can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex, simultaneously presenting the ribosome with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eIF 4E, binding to the 43S pre-initiation complex as does eIF 4G, while replacing the helicase activity of eIF 4A, which is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure [56, 58] . These three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation. In P bodies, N protein's ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides, along with its activity in protecting capped RNAs from degradation likely facilitates the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation by L polymerase (-cap snatching‖). Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi [27] . The N proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions, and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that N tracks along microtubules but not with actin filaments [52] . The ultimate destination for N, for its assembly into viral particles is the Golgi, and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), also known as vesicular-tubular cluster [52] . A dominant negative inhibitor, dynamitin, associated with dynein-mediated transport, reduced N's accumulation in the Golgi. Later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to Old World hantaviruses such as HTNV, but that the New World hantavirus ANDV is instead associated with actin filaments [59] . However, recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the New World hantavirus SNV [60] . Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression ( Table 2 ). The pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is the topic of a continuously-updated review in the series UpToDate [61] . By the time symptoms appear in HCPS, both strong antiviral responses, and, for the more virulent viral genotypes, viral RNA can be detected in blood plasma or nucleated blood cells respectively [63, 64] . At least three studies have correlated plasma viral RNA with disease severity for HCPS and HFRS, suggesting that the replication of the virus plays an ongoing and real-time role in viral pathogenesis [65] [66] [67] . Several hallmark pathologic changes have been identified that occur in both HFRS and HCPS. A critical feature of both is a transient (~ 1-5 days) capillary leak involving the kidney and retroperitoneal space in HFRS and the lungs in HCPS. The resulting leakage is exudative in character, with chemical composition high in protein and resembling plasma. The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses. It is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. The virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia, a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections [62, 63] . By the time that secondary viremia emerges, the agents of the more severe forms of HFRS and HCPS have begun to achieve sufficient mass as to induce, through PAMP-PRR interactions and other means, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [64] . For HCPS, that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs, yet, for unknown reasons, spares the retroperitoneum and, in general, the kidney.Question: Which are among the conspicuous examples which challenge prevention and control measures of public health systems?","answer":"influenza A, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, severe adult respiratory distress (SARS), coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The degradation process was monitored by changes of mass and molecular weight (MW) and surface morphology of polymer films. During the whole period of degradation, MW of PEC was unchanged. Water uptake of the polymer was only 2.8 and 0.2% for PEC with the MW of 200 kDa (PEC200) and PEC with the MW of 41 kDa (PEC41), respectively. Degradation of less hydrophilic PEC41 with higher density was slower than that of PEC200. By this mechanism, CE-responsive drug in vitro release from PEC in situ forming depots (ISFD) was conducted successfully. As expected, less bovine serum albumin (BSA) was released from PEC41 compared with that of PEC200 in the same time period. In conclusion, this work enabled the in vitro drug release evaluation of existing PEC devices and implied a new candidate for the development of enzyme-responsive systems.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"PEC\\", \\"poly(ethylene carbonate)\\", \\"Cholesterol\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"CE\\", \\"BSA\\", \\"bovine serum albumin\\", \\"Cholesterol esterase\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

During our continuous efforts to identify more potent anti-angiogenic agents, we synthesized various nicotinamide derivatives and evaluated their anti-angiogenic effects. We found that 2-{1-[1-(6-chloro-5-fluoropyrimidin-4-yl)ethyl]piperidin-4-ylamino}-N-(3-chlorophenyl) pyridine-3-carboxamide (BRN-250) significantly inhibited human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration, tube formation, and microvessel growth in a concentration range of 10-100 nM. Furthermore, BRN-250 inhibited the VEGF-induced phosphorylation and intracellular tyrosine kinase activity of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the activation of its downstream AKT pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that BRN-250 be considered a potential lead compound for cancer therapy.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"nicotinamide\\", \\"2-{1-[1-(6-chloro-5-fluoropyrimidin-4-yl)ethyl]piperidin-4-ylamino}-N-(3-chlorophenyl) pyridine-3-carboxamide\\", \\"BRN-250\\", \\"BRN-103\\", \\"tyrosine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"VEGFR2\\", \\"VEGF receptor 2\\", \\"AKT\\", \\"vascular endothelial growth factor\\", \\"tyrosine kinase\\", \\"VEGF\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In 2-8% of patients with mental retardation, small copy number changes in the subtelomeric region are thought to be the underlying cause. As detection of these genomic rearrangements is labour intensive using FISH, we constructed and validated a high-density BAC/PAC array covering the first 5 Mb of all subtelomeric regions and applied it in our routine screening of patients with idiopathic mental retardation for submicroscopic telomeric rearrangements. The present study shows the efficiency of this comprehensive subtelomere array in detecting terminal deletions and duplications but also small interstitial subtelomeric rearrangements, starting from small amounts of DNA. With our array, the size of the affected segments, at least those smaller than 5 Mb, can be determined simultaneously in the same experiment. In the first 100 patient samples analysed in our diagnostic practice by the use of this comprehensive telomere array, we found three patients with deletions in 3p, 10q and 15q, respectively, four patients with duplications in 9p, 12p, 21q and Xp, respectively, and one patient with a del 6q/dup 16q. The patients with del 3p and 10q and dup 12p had interstitial rearrangements that would have been missed with techniques using one probe per subtelomeric region chosen close to the telomere.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The second most prevalent urological malignancy in middle aged and elderly men is bladder cancer, with 90% of the cases being transitional cell carcinomas. The success of current systemic and intravesical therapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, thiotepa, Adriamycin, mitomycin C, and bacillus Calmette-Guerin, is limited with recurrence rates reduced to 17-44%. In addition, most of these agents require instrumentation of the urinary tract and are delivered at a significant cost and potential morbidity to the patient. Fluroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, which can be administered p.o., may have a profound effect in bladder cancer management. This is primarily based on limited in vitro studies on tumor cells derived from transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder that revealed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth by ciprofloxacin at concentrations that are easily attainable in the urine of patients. However, the mechanism(s) by which ciprofloxacin elicits its biological effects on bladder cancer cells is not well documented. Our experimental data confirm previous studies showing the in vitro cell growth inhibition of the transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder cell line HTB9 and further showed the induction of cell cycle arrest at the S/G2-M checkpoints. In addition, we found down-regulation of cyclin B, cyclin E, and dephosphorylation of cdk2 in ciprofloxacin-treated bladder tumor cells. There was also an up-regulation of Bax, which altered the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, which may be responsible for mitochondrial depolarization reported to be involved prior to the induction of apoptosis. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 level was found to be decreased within 12 h of ciprofloxacin treatment and disappeared completely when HTB9 cells were treated with 200 microg/ml ciprofloxacin for 24 h. The down-regulation of p21WAF1 closely correlated with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and CPP32 activation. Recent studies revealed that p21WAF1 protects cells from apoptosis by arresting them in G1 and further binds to pro-caspase-3, preventing its activation and thus, inhibiting the apoptotic cascade. Hence, the down-regulation of p21WAF1, together with the alterations in Bax and cdk2 as observed in our studies, may define a novel mechanism by which ciprofloxacin inhibits tumor cell growth and induces apoptotic cell death. The results of our current studies provide strong experimental evidence for the use of ciprofloxacin as a potential preventive and/or therapeutic agent for the management of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"bladder tumor cells\\", \\"tumor cells\\", \\"transitional cell carcinoma\\", \\"urine\\", \\"bladder cancer cells\\", \\"bladder\\", \\"tumor cell\\", \\"cell\\", \\"mitochondrial\\", \\"urological malignancy\\", \\"bladder cancer\\", \\"urinary tract\\", \\"cells\\", \\"transitional cell carcinomas\\", \\"HTB9 cells\\", \\"bladder cell line\\", \\"bladder cell line HTB9\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Tolbutamide and gliclazide block the K(ATP) channel K(ir)6.2/Sur1, causing membrane depolarization and stimulating insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. We examined the ability of the EPAC-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM to potentiate the action of these drugs and the mechanism that might account for it. Insulin secretion stimulated by both 200 μM tolbutamide and 20 μM gliclazide, concentrations that had equivalent effects on membrane potential, was inhibited by thapsigargin (1 μM) or the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine (2 μM) and was potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at concentrations ≥2 μM in INS-1 cells. Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 μM but not 1 μM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 μM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 μM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 μM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 μM). Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM, that gliclazide can stimulate phospholipase C activity via a partially pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, and that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca(2+) influx.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"sulfonylurea\\", \\"8-pCPT-2u0027-O-Me-cAMP-AM\\", \\"nicardipine\\", \\"2-APB\\", \\"2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate\\", \\"K\\", \\"ATP\\", \\"thapsigargin\\", \\"Tolbutamide\\", \\"cAMP\\", \\"tolbutamide\\", \\"gliclazide\\", \\"Ca(2+)\\", \\"bisindolylmaleimide I\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Paclitaxel (PTX), a very potent anticancer drug from a taxane family, has achieved prominence in clinical oncology for its efficacy against a wide range of tumors including breast cancer. However, significant toxicity, such as myelosuppression, limit the effectiveness of Paclitaxel -based treatment regimens. Immodin (IM) is low molecular dialysate fraction of homogenate made from human leukocytes. It contains a mixture of substances from which so far have been described e.g. Imreg 1 and Imreg 2 formed by the dipeptide tyrosine-glycine and the tripeptide tyrosine-glycine-glycine, respectively. The aim of this study was to explore immunopharmacological activities of IM, using the strongly immunogenic 4T1 mouse breast cancer model, and evaluate its effect on the reactivity and the efficiency of PTX cancer therapy. The results highlight a potentially beneficial role for IM in alleviating PTX - induced toxicity, especially on the nonspecific immunity, during breast cancer therapy. Co-treatment exhibited an antitumor effect including reduced tumor growth, prolonged survival of tumor bearing mice, increased number of monocytes and lymphocytes in peripheral blood. In spleens, IM + PTX therapy elevated proportion of whole lymphocytes in the account of myelo-monocytic cells characteristic with low expression of CD11c+ and bearing Fc receptor (CD16 / 32) as well as T-lymphocytes, NK cells and dendritic cells. Accumulation of tumor - associated granulocytes in stroma of PTX - treated group and intensive 4T1 - necrosis / apoptosis in tumors after co-treatment were also recorded. These findings suggest the possibility of using IM alongside PTX treatment for maintaining the immune system functions and increasing patient survival.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"leukocytes\\", \\"stroma\\", \\"monocytes\\", \\"lymphocytes\\", \\"T-lymphocytes\\", \\"granulocytes\\", \\"myelo-monocytic cells\\", \\"dendritic cells\\", \\"NK cells\\", \\"4T1\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"necrosis\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"apoptosis\\", \\"breast cancer\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"mice\\", \\"immunity\\", \\"expression\\", \\"4T1 mouse\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"clinical oncology\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"peripheral blood\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [\\"immune system\\"], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"anticancer drug\\", \\"tyrosine-glycine-glycine\\", \\"Paclitaxel\\", \\"Imreg 2\\", \\"taxane\\", \\"chemotherapy agents\\", \\"Imreg 1\\", \\"dialysate fraction\\", \\"Immodin\\", \\"tyrosine-glycine\\", \\"tripeptide\\", \\"32\\", \\"dipeptide\\", \\"CD11c+\\", \\"paclitaxel\\", \\"CD16\\", \\"Fc receptor\\", \\"PTX\\", \\"IM\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"human\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"Accumulation\\", \\"myelosuppression\\", \\"findings\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"treatment regimens\\", \\"therapy\\", \\"cancer therapy\\", \\"treatment\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"toxicity\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"recorded\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Mammalian quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase) (EC 2.4.2.19) is a key enzyme in catabolism of quinolinate, an intermediate in the tryptophan-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) pathway. Quinolinate acts as a most potent endogenous exitotoxin to neurons. Elevation of quinolinate levels in the brain has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. As the first step to elucidate molecular basis underlying the quinolinate metabolism, the cDNA encoding human brain QPRTase was cloned and characterized. Utilizing partial amino acid sequences obtained from highly purified porcine kidney QPRTase, a human isolog was obtained from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a open reading frame of 297 amino acids, and shares 30 to 40% identity with those of bacterial QPRTases. To confirm that the cDNA clone encodes human QPRTase, its functional expression was studied in a bacterial host. Introduction of the human cDNA into a QPRTase defective (nadC) E. coli strain brought about an abrupt increase in QPRTase activity and allowed the cells to grow in the absence of nicotinic acid. It is concluded that the cloned cDNA encodes human QPRTase which is functional beyond the phylogenic boundary.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"QPRTases\\", \\"nadC\\", \\"quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase\\", \\"QPRTase\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

A Survey on the Application of Machine Learning to Formal Verification Chapter Title:  Guiding Interactive 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Abstract The Emacs authoring environment for Mizar (MizarMode) is today the authoring tool of choice for many (probably the majority of) Mizar authors. This article describes the MizarMode and focuses on the proof assistance functions and tools available in it. We start with the explanation of the design principles behind the Mizar system, and show how these design principles—mainly the concentration on simple and intuitive human-oriented proofs—have helped Mizar in developing and maintaining a very large body of formalized mathematics. Mizar is a non-programmable and non-tactical verifier: the proofs are developed in the traditional “write—compile—correct” software programming loop. While this method is in the beginning more laborious than the methods employed in tactical and programmable proof assistants, it makes the “proof code” in the long-run more readable, maintainable and reusable. This seems to be a crucial factor for a long-term and large-scale formalization effort. MizarMode has been designed with the aim to facilitate this kind of proof development by a number of “code-generating”, “code-browsing” and “code-searching” methods, and tools programmed or integrated within it. These methods and tools now include, e.g., the automated generation of proof skeletons, semantic browsing of the articles and abstracts, structured viewing, proof advice using trained machine learning tools like the Mizar Proof Advisor, deductive tools like MoMM, etc. We give an overview of these proof-assistance tools and their integration in the MizarMode, and also discuss some emerging and future extensions such as integration of external theorem proving assistance. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  This paper is intended to be a practical reference manual for basic Mizar terminology which may be helpful to get started using the system. The paper describes most important aspects of the Mizar language as well as some features of the verification software. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Isabelle/HOL is a popular interactive theorem prover based on higherorder logic. It owes its success to its ease of use and powerful automation. Much of the automation is performed by external tools: The metaprover Sledgehammer relies on resolution provers and SMT solvers for its proof search, the counterexample generator Quickcheck uses the ML compiler as a fast evaluator for ground formulas, and its rival Nitpick is based on the model finder Kodkod, which performs a reduction to SAT. Together with the Isar structured proof format and a new asynchronous user interface, these tools have radically transformed the Isabelle user experience. This paper provides an overview of the main automatic proof and disproof tools. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  We present ML4PG - a machine learning extension for Proof General. It allows users to gather proof statistics related to shapes of goals, sequences of applied tactics, and proof tree structures from the libraries of interactive higher-order proofs written in Coq and SSReflect. The gathered data is clustered using the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms available in MATLAB and Weka. ML4PG provides automated interfacing between Proof General and MATLAB/Weka. The results of clustering are used by ML4PG to provide proof hints in the process of interactive proof development.Literature Review:","answer":"Proofs. Due to the undecidability of H , there is no systematic way of nding proofs for conjectures in such logics. I s such as C  , I BIB004 or M BIB003 are used to assist the mathematician in proof nding, while P G BIB001 provides a high-level user-friendly interface to those I s. I environments can act as recommender systems to suggest for example promising facts to be used in the proof. Because this theme touches many parts of proofs, both classi cation and clustering M techniques can be used. Clustering becomes particularly useful here as it can inform the user of potential next steps through statistical analysis on similar proofs -it however cannot lead to automatic decision making such as when supervised approaches are used. Urban BIB002 describes a set of proof aids in E for M , explaining how M classi cation algorithms are used to suggest facts to a mathematician for the continuation of the proofs. Mercer et al.  propose a system and a user interface for recommending the next proof step, based on Duncan's work  on modeling proofs with Variable Length Markov models.
