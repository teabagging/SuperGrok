The relationship between female pattern hair loss (FPHL) and androgenic hormones is not well established, but some evidence indicates oral finasteride may be efficacious in FPHL. Use of a topical formulation has been proposed to minimize unwanted effects.  objectives Our objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical 0.25% finasteride combined with 3% minoxidil solution and 3% minoxidil solution as monotherapy in the treatment of FPHL.  methods This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in 30 postmenopausal women with FPHL. Each participant was randomized to receive either topical 0.25% finasteride combined with topical 3% minoxidil or topical 3% minoxidil solution as monotherapy for 24 weeks. To determine efficacy, the hair density and diameter was measured and global photographic assessment was conducted at baseline and 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Side effects and serum dihydrotestosterone levels were also evaluated.  results By 24 weeks, hair density and diameter had increased in both groups, and finasteride/minoxidil was significantly superior to minoxidil solution in terms of hair diameter (p = 0.039). No systemic side effects were reported. However, serum dihydrotestosterone levels in the finasteride/minoxidil group significantly decreased from baseline (p = 0.016).  conclusion A topical combination of 0.25 % finasteride and 3 % minoxidil may be a promising option in the treatment of FPHL with an additional benefit of increasing hair diameter .

function spreading throughout the space with equal probability .even a particle with a potential @xcite , which transforms the same way the kinetic part transforms under scale transformation @xmath0 , @xmath1 , does not usually possess any bound state @xcite .    despite this scale invariance in some problems @xcite onecan still expects bound state solution when quantization of the classical system is preformed . because the process of quantization may introduce a scale into the system .sae @xcite is one way of introducing a scale in the system , thus leading to a quantum mechanical anomaly @xcite .thus although we do nt see the scale in the hamiltonian , it is actually hidden in the boundary condition .sae has been a rigorous method to find the most general boundary conditions for a quantum mechanical model so that the operator , for example the hamiltonian , becomes self - adjoint . for the hamiltonian it is necessary to be self - adjoint , because otherwise the time evolution of the quantum states generated by @xmath2 @xcite will not be unitary .unitarity is essential to keep the norm of the states unchanged through out the transformation .the other importance of the self - adjointness is that the eigen - values are guaranteed to be real .hidden scale problem , quantum anomaly and the implications of self - adjoint extensions , all these three can be found in the case of a free particle dynamics .note that we call a particle free in the sense that the potential for the particle @xmath3 , i.e. , it has only kinetic part in the hamiltonian , @xmath4 .although the form of the hamiltonian is the simplest of all , it raises lot of intriguing facts when viewed as a hamiltonian of a localized wave packet .for example , the localization of a free particle on a half line @xcite is such an interesting problem , where sae gives rise to bound state solutions by introducing a length scale into the system .similarly for a particle confined on a whole plane can have bound state solution , once inequivalent quantization is made @xcite .the largest possible space dimensions in which a free particle can have bound state due to inequivalent quantization is @xmath5 . beyond three dimensions the quantum centripetal inverse square potential arising from pure kinetic term does not allow the localization of the wave -

adjoint and there exist a bound state of the particle .the 1-dimensional hamiltonian for the particle in the interval @xmath9 is of the simple form ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 we are interested in the bound state problem for the particle .the hamiltonian is manifestly scale covariant under the transformation @xmath12 , @xmath1 .so there is no scale in the problem and it suggests that the particle does not have any bound state @xcite .but the inequivalent quantization of the system with the self - adjoint domain @xmath13 allows us to get a bound state solution with energy eigenvalue and eigenfunction respectively given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 has to be positive and finite in order to make the solution @xmath16 square - integrable .the hidden scale @xmath15 , called the self - adjoint extension parameter , breaks the scale invariance of the system .this is a simple quantum mechanical example of scaling anomaly .the probability density for the wave - packet confined on a half line has been shown in fig .3 .     for a particle on a part of the plane ( first quadrant ) with length scale @xmath6 has been plotted as a function of @xmath7 .the probability density is zero at the origin ( @xmath8).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we now generalize the same problem by considering it on a full line , @xmath17 instead on a half line .the hamiltonian now possesses reflection symmetry in addition to its scale invariance contrary to the half line case , which had only scale invariance .we can exploit the the reflection symmetry of the problem to reduce it on the form ( [ 1h1 ] ) by using the transformation @xmath18 .so the analysis will be same , but the normalization constant of the bound state wave - function will now change due to reflection symmetry in the problem .the bound state solutions are @xmath19 note the simplicity of the result ( [ 1h2s ] ) , but despite its simplicity it has remained unnoticed so far. it is however know for a long time that particle on a line with @xmath20-function potential has bound state solution @xcite .in fact the result is same as what we have obtained without any potential but using sae .the probability density has a pick at the origin , which has been shown in fig .5 .     for a particle on a half line ( @xmath21 ) with length scale @xmath6 has been plotted as a function of @xmath22 .the probability density is maximum at the origin.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]to show the ring shaped localization of a free particle wave -

adjoint domain .one of the possible domains over which the hamiltonian is symmetric is of the form @xmath34 the domain @xmath35 is so restricted that it fails to make @xmath36 self - adjoint .then one seeks for a sae . using von neumann s methodit can be shown that the domain over which the hamiltonian @xmath36 is self -

ordinate will look like fig .3 , where probability density for a particle moving on a half line has been plotted .the reason for this similarity is obvious from the fact that for @xmath61 , the solid angle reduces to a half line.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we now consider the situation , where the particle is moving on a part of the plane not on a whole plane and ask the question whether the method of sae is still capable of binding the particle on the restricted region of the plane , for example in the region specified by @xmath62  ] , where @xmath63 .this problem can be easily solved once the eigen - value equation for the angular operator @xmath64 is solved .but we do nt need to explicitly solve the angular part for our discussion .what we need to know is that whether there exists any eigenvalue within the interval @xmath65 , because then only we can expect bound state solutions .one can easily convince oneself that @xmath66 is one of the eigen - functions of the operator @xmath67 with eigen - value @xmath68 . note that @xmath69 has the time reversal symmetry @xcite .thus the radial hamiltonian for @xmath70 wave will be @xmath71 , which has been shown in ( [ 2b ] ) and ( [ 2bs ] ) to possess bound state solution .the probability density for the radial eigen -

Transition to cold temperatures requires changes in the partitioning of energy substrates, re-routing fatty acids to BAT to fuel non-shivering thermogenesis. However, the mechanisms behind the redistribution of energy substrates to BAT remain largely unknown. Angiopoietin-like 4( ANGPTL4), a protein that inhibits lipoprotein lipase( LPL) activity, is highly expressed in BAT. Here, we demonstrate that ANGPTL4 is part of a shuttling mechanism that directs fatty acids derived from circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to BAT during cold. Specifically, we show that cold markedly down-regulates ANGPTL4 in BAT, likely via activation of AMPK, enhancing LPL activity and uptake of plasma triglyceride-derived fatty acids. In contrast, cold up-regulates ANGPTL4 in WAT, abolishing a cold-induced increase in LPL activity. Together, our data indicate that ANGPTL4 is an important regulator of plasma lipid partitioning during sustained cold.Introduction:Adipose tissue can be classified into white adipose tissue( WAT) and brown adipose tissue( BAT). Whereas WAT represents the main energy storage organ in the body, BAT is dedicated to the generation of heat via the burning of lipids. BAT is activated during cold exposure, when additional heat production is needed to maintain core body temperature. Heat production by BAT is stimulated via release of norepinephrine by the sympathetic nervous system, causing activation of β-adrenergic signalling and subsequent uncoupling of ATP production from mitochondrial respiration( Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004). Uncoupling in BAT is mediated by the uncoupling protein UCP1, which is highly abundant specifically in BAT( Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004). Studies in the last decade have shown the presence of BAT in humans and have provided preliminary evidence for an inverse relationship between BAT activity and parameters of obesity( van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009; Virtanen et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011). As a consequence, interest in BAT function and the possible targeting of BAT for treatment or prevention of metabolic diseases has surged. Upon cold exposure, oxidation of fuels by BAT is dramatically increased. In addition to circulating glucose and free fatty acids, fatty acids derived from circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins( TRLs) represent a major fuel source for BAT( Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004). The liberation of fatty acids from TRLs is catalyzed by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase( LPL), which is highly abundant in BAT( Bartelt et al., 2011; Kersten, 2014). Cold exposure markedly stimulates LPL activity in BAT, causing a concomitant increase in TRL-derived fatty acid uptake and even uptake of whole lipoprotein particles( Bartelt et al., 2011; Khedoe et al., 2014; Klingenspor et al., 1996). The increase in fatty acid uptake upon cold exposure, which can be mimicked by pharmacological ß3-adrenergic receptor activation, is highly specific for BAT, suggesting that the body may specifically re-direct lipid fuels to BAT during cold exposure( Bartelt et al., 2011; Berbée et al., 2015; Khedoe et al., 2014). Both transcriptional and( post-) translational regulation has been implicated in the increased LPL activity in BAT upon cold exposure. However, the specific underlying mechanisms have remained elusive( Carneheim et al., 1988; Giralt et al., 1990; Mitchell et al., 1992). Angiopoietin-like 4( ANGPTL4) has previously been identified as an inhibitor of LPL activity in muscle and WAT. Alterations of Angptl4 expression in these tissues mediate the changes in LPL activity observed during exercise and fasting, respectively( Catoire et al., 2014; Kroupa et al., 2012). In the initial paper describing the cloning of Angptl4, we had seen high expression of Angptl4 mRNA in BAT( Kersten et al., 2000). Since the exact mechanisms behind regulation of LPL activity in BAT upon cold exposure are currently unclear, we hypothesized that ANGPTL4 may act as an important regulator of LPL-mediated fatty acid uptake into BAT. Accordingly, in the present paper we studied the role of ANGPTL4 in lipid metabolism during cold exposure, taking advantage of Angptl4-deficient( Angptl4-/-) mice and Angptl4-overexpressing( Angptl4-Tg) mice.Discussion:The energy requirements of BAT increase manifold during cold exposure. The increased energy demands coincide with a marked increase in LPL activity, stimulating uptake of TRL-derived fatty acids( Bartelt et al., 2011; Bertin et al., 1985; Khedoe et al., 2014; Klingenspor et al., 1989, 1996). Increased LPL activity has been shown to be essential for the lipid-lowering effect of cold exposure, as injection of heparin or tetrahydrolipstatin compromises LPL-dependent uptake of TRLs and TRL-derived fatty acids( Bartelt et al., 2011). Since Lpl mRNA in BAT is only moderately increased upon prolonged cold exposure, it has been suggested that the pronounced increase in LPL activity in BAT occurs at the post-translational level( Giralt et al., 1990; Klingenspor et al., 1996). Our data demonstrate that a substantial part of the increase in LPL activity in BAT during prolonged cold exposure is mediated by down-regulation of ANGPTL4. Overall, our findings reveal a major role for ANGPTL4 in the regulation of lipid partitioning during sustained cold. Specifically, the data implicate ANGPTL4 as an important mediator of preferential shuttling of TRL-derived fatty acids to BAT during cold exposure. Via direct effects on local LPL activity and subsequent fatty acid uptake, the reciprocal regulation of ANGPTL4 in BAT and WAT assures an adequate fuel delivery to BAT during cold exposure. The differential regulation of ANGPTL4 and LPL between BAT and WAT leads to corresponding changes in fatty acid uptake from TRLs, with our data showing a clear dose-dependent and causal relationship between ANGPTL4 expression and TRL-derived fatty acid uptake into both tissues. The importance of ANGPTL4 in the regulation of LPL activity during cold complements the already established role of ANGPTL4 in regulation of LPL during fasting and exercise in WAT and skeletal muscle, respectively( Catoire et al., 2014; Kroupa et al., 2012). ANGPTL4 can thus be viewed as the master regulator of tissue LPL activity and fatty acid uptake during physiological conditions such as fasting, exercise and cold exposure. Our data suggest that the opposite regulation of ANGPTL4 expression during prolonged cold between BAT and WAT may be explained by the differential expression and activation of AMPK between the two tissues. Heterotrimeric AMPK has one catalytic( α), and two regulatory( β and γ) subunits, each having distinctive isoforms with a tissue-specific distribution( Viollet et al., 2009, 2010). Tissue-specific combinations of different subunit isoforms may confer tissue-specific properties to AMPK by determining subcellular localization and substrate targeting, thereby controlling cellular and systemic responses to metabolic stressors, including sustained cold( Viollet et al., 2009, 2010). Indeed, with prolonged cold exposure, AMPK becomes progressively activated in BAT and only to a minor extent in WAT( Bauwens et al., 2011; Mulligan et al., 2007). Systemic activation of AMPK has been previously shown to increase the activity of LPL in both heart and muscle and to lower plasma TG levels( An et al., 2005; Bergeron et al., 2001; Buhl et al., 2002; Catoire et al., 2014; Geerling et al., 2014; Ohira et al., 2009). Furthermore, AMPK activation was found to cause a pronounced reduction in ANGPTL4 expression in muscle cells( Catoire et al., 2014). Similar to muscle and heart, we found the AMPKα2 catalytic subunit to be abundantly present in BAT, but not WAT( Viollet et al., 2009). Together, the increased AMPK activation and different AMPK subunit expression in BAT as compared to WAT may explain why the repressive effect of cold-induced AMPK activation on ANGPTL4 expression is much more pronounced in BAT than in WAT. We suggest that regulation of ANGPTL4 in WAT during cold may be dominated by activation of β-adrenergic signalling, which may explain the increase in ANGPTL4 expression observed in WAT during sustained cold exposure. We provide evidence that regulation of ANGPTL4 by AMPK occurs at the transcriptional level, affecting PPARγ-mediated transcription of the Angptl4 gene. ANGPTL4 has been repeatedly shown to be a highly sensitive target of all PPAR transcription factors in a variety of tissues and cells and following a variety of physiological stimuli( Dijk and Kersten, 2014; Georgiadi et al., 2010; Kersten et al., 2000; Mandard et al., 2004). Previously, PPARγ-mediated transcription has been shown to be inhibited by activation of AMPK( Cheang et al., 2014; Namgaladze et al., 2013; Sozio et al., 2011). A potential link between PPARγ and AMPK may be the modulation of co-activator recruitment to PPARγ by AMPK. A well-established co-activator of PPARγ that has been shown to be regulated by AMPK is P300( Gelman et al., 1999; Leff, 2003; Yang et al., 2001). P300 is a key regulator of the assembly and mobilization of the transcriptional machinery by connecting transcription factors to the transcriptional machinery and enhancing DNA accessibility( Vo and Goodman, 2001). AMPK activation enhances P300 degradation and causes phosphorylation of P300 at serine residue 89, thereby blocking the interaction of P300 with PPARγ and reducing PPARγ transcriptional activity( Leff, 2003; Lim et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2001). Although our in vitro data suggest an involvement of P300 and PPARγ in the suppression of ANGPTL4 by AMPK activation, whether P300 is also involved in in vivo regulation of ANGPTL4 during cold exposure remains to be determined. Despite the unmistakable dependency of BAT LPL activity on ANGPTL4 expression, a modest cold-induced increase in LPL activity and TRL-derived fatty acid uptake is observed in BAT of Angptl4-/- mice, which may be( partially) explained by the moderate increase in Lpl mRNA in BAT in the cold. Alternatively, there may be a role for another, yet to be identified, cold-induced post-translational modulator of LPL. It may be hypothesized that this post-translational modulator is also involved in the rapid increase in LPL activity during acute cold exposure( Klingenspor et al., 1996). No overt abnormalities in cold-tolerance were observed in the Angptl4-/- or Angptl4-Tg mice as compared to wild-type mice. This observation, however, does not refute the importance of ANGPTL4 in fuel delivery to BAT during cold exposure. BAT is a well-conserved organ that is postulated to have conferred to mammals the evolutionary advantage to survive cold stressors such as birth or low environmental temperatures( Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004). It is likely that differential uptake of TG in other organs and altered uptake of other available fuels( free fatty acids, glucose) compensate for the reduced uptake of TRL-derived fatty acids by BAT in Angptl4-Tg mice. Strikingly, adipose tissue-specific deletion of LPL in mice does not result in an overt phenotype( Bartelt et al., 2012; Garcia-Arcos et al., 2013). While plasma TG levels are elevated in these mice, no other parameters were altered, indicating that even in mice completely lacking LPL in adipose tissue, alternative mechanisms exist to fuel BAT and WAT( Bartelt et al., 2012; Garcia-Arcos et al., 2013). In conclusion, our data show that regulation of ANGPTL4 is an important factor in directing lipid fuels towards BAT and away from WAT during prolonged cold exposure. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying fuel re-distribution may pave the way for new strategies to combat metabolic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes type 2, in which a mismatch in regulation of lipid uptake and usage by tissues is an important feature( Klop et al., 2013; Young and Zechner, 2013).","answer":"The body stores energy in the form of fat molecules . Most of these molecules are stored in white fat cells . Other fat cells , the so-called brown fat cells , consume fats and produce heat to maintain body temperature in cold conditions . The capacity of brown fat cells to consume fats has led researchers to investigate whether brown fat cells might be a key to combat obesity . When an organism is cold , fat is shuttled to the brown fat cells . An enzyme called lipoprotein lipase is involved in a process that allows these fat molecules to be taken up by brown fat cells . However , it was not clear exactly how this process works . A protein called Angiopoietin-like 4 ( ANGPTL4 ) inhibits the activity of lipoprotein lipase in white fat cells and is also found at high levels in brown fat cells . Here , Dijk et al . used genetic and biochemical approaches to study the role of ANGPTL4 in the fat cells of mice . The experiments show that when mice are exposed to cold , the levels of ANGPTL4 decrease in the brown fat cells . This allows the activity of lipoprotein lipase to increase so that these cells are able to take up more fat molecules . However , the opposite happens in white fat cells during cold exposure . The levels of ANGPTL4 increase , which decreases the activity of lipoprotein lipase in white fat cells to allow fat molecules to be shuttled specifically to the brown fat cells . Further experiments suggest that the opposite regulation of ANGPTL4 in brown and white fat cells could be due to a protein called AMPK . This protein is found at higher levels in brown fat cells than in white fat cells and is produced by brown fat cells during cold exposure . Taken together , Dijk et al . show that organs and cells work together to ensure that fat molecules are appropriately distributed to cells in need of energy , such as to brown fat cells during cold . How these findings could be used to stimulate fat consumption by brown fat cells in humans remains open for further investigation ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Nevertheless, important questions remain regarding the optimal dose, duration, and mechanisms of action in the context of healthy aging. Here we show that 3 months of rapamycin treatment is sufficient to increase life expectancy by up to 60% and improve measures of healthspan in middle-aged mice. This transient treatment is also associated with a remodeling of the microbiome, including dramatically increased prevalence of segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. We also define a dose in female mice that does not extend lifespan, but is associated with a striking shift in cancer prevalence toward aggressive hematopoietic cancers and away from non-hematopoietic malignancies. These data suggest that a short-term rapamycin treatment late in life has persistent effects that can robustly delay aging, influence cancer prevalence, and modulate the microbiome.Introduction:Successful interventions that increase healthy longevity in people could have profound benefits for quality of life, productivity, and reduced healthcare costs( Goldman et al., 2013; Kaeberlein et al., 2015). The drug rapamycin is a promising candidate for such an intervention, as it has been shown to increase lifespan in numerous species( Johnson et al., 2013) and to delay or reverse multiple age-associated phenotypes in mice including cognitive decline( Halloran et al., 2012; Majumder et al., 2012), cardiac dysfunction( Dai et al., 2014; Flynn et al., 2013), immune senescence( Chen et al., 2009), and cancer( Anisimov et al., 2011). Recently, a six week treatment with the rapamycin derivative RAD001 was reported to improve immune function in elderly people, as measured by response to influenza vaccine( Mannick et al., 2014), suggesting that at least some of the effects on aging in mice are conserved in humans. Despite these impressive results, the utility of rapamycin or other mTOR inhibitors to delay aging may be limited by side effects. The high doses of rapamycin and its derivatives used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection are associated with adverse events, including impaired wound healing, edema, elevated circulating triglycerides, impaired glucose homeostasis, gastrointestinal discomfort, and mouth ulcers( Augustine et al., 2007; de Oliveira et al., 2011). While many of these side effects have not been observed in mice at the lower doses that extend lifespan, chronic treatment with encapsulated rapamycin( eRapa) in the diet at 14 ppm has been reported to cause gonadal degeneration in males, increased risk of cataracts, and impaired response to a glucose tolerance test( Wilkinson et al., 2012; Lamming et al., 2012).Discussion:Taken together, our data demonstrate that a single three-month regimen of rapamycin is sufficient to robustly increase life expectancy in middle-aged mice, comparable to the effects previously reported for life-long treatment, while also improving measures of healthspan and substantially altering the microbiome. This work extends prior evidence indicating that short-term rapamycin treatment can improve health in mice, including one experiment suggesting that 4 mg/kg rapamycin every other day for 6 weeks enhanced survival until around 30 months of age in a small cohort( Chen et al., 2009), and studies reporting improvements in cardiac( Dai et al., 2014; Flynn et al., 2013) and immune( Chen et al., 2009) function following transient treatment with rapamycin. In the animals treated with the 126 ppm eRapa diet in this study, the improvements in lifespan and health were achieved without overt detrimental side effects, although it is possible that some side effects were undetected, and we did not explicitly test for cataracts, gonadal degeneration, and other adverse outcomes. In the case of the 8 mg/kg/day injection regimen, serious side effects were noted in female, but not male mice. Intriguingly, a dramatic shift toward aggressive hematopoietic cancers and away from non-hematopoietic cancers was observed in these female mice. This is consistent with a similar weak trend seen in kidney transplant patients receiving rapamycin to prevent organ rejection, suggesting a possible conservation of mechanism and clinical relevance( Mathew et al., 2004). Our data indicate a need to carefully consider sex effects when optimizing treatment regimens and mechanism of drug action. They also illustrate the importance of better understanding the effects of mTOR inhibitors on differential cancer risk, particularly as mTOR inhibitors are being tested and used clinically for a variety of purposes including the treatment of some rare forms of cancer. The importance of evaluating potential risks and adverse side effects when developing interventions to promote healthy aging should not be underestimated. This study extends other recent work aimed at developing mid-life interventions to promote healthy aging. Of particular note are two studies reporting improved healthspan from short-term treatments in older mice with a JAK pathway inhibitor( Xu et al., 2015) and increased lifespan after transient treatment with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside( Zhang et al., 2016). From a translational perspective, a healthy aging intervention that can be applied for a relatively short period of time during mid- or late-life is likely to have advantages in cost, practicability and quality of life of people, and we look forward to further developments in this area.","answer":"Old age is the single greatest risk factor for many diseases including heart disease , arthritis , cancer and dementia . By delaying the biological aging process , it may be possible to reduce the impact of age-related diseases , which could have great benefits for society and the quality of life of individuals . A drug called rapamycin , which is currently used to prevent organ rejection in transplant recipients , is a leading candidate for targeting aging . Rapamycin increases lifespan in several types of animals and delays the onset of many age-related conditions in mice . Nearly all of the aging-related studies in mice have used the same dose of rapamycin given throughout the lives of the animals . Lifelong treatment with rapamycin wouldn’t be practical in humans and is likely to result in undesirable side effects . For example , the high doses of rapamycin used in transplant patients cause side effects including poor wound healing , elevated blood cholesterol levels , and mouth ulcers . Before rapamycin can be used to promote healthy aging in humans , researchers must better understand at what point in life the drug is most effective , and what dose to use to provide the biggest benefit while limiting the side effects . Now , Bitto et al . show that treating mice with rapamycin for a short period during middle age increases the life expectancy of the mice by up to 60% . In the experiments , mice were given two different doses of rapamycin for only three months starting at 20 months old ( equivalent to about 60-65 years old in humans ) . After receiving the lower dose , both male and female mice lived about 50% longer than untreated mice , and showed improvements in their muscle strength and motor coordination . When given the higher dose , male mice showed an even greater increase in life expectancy , but the female mice did not . These female mice had an increased risk of developing rare and aggressive forms of blood cancer , but were protected from other types of cancer . Both drug treatments also caused substantial changes in the gut bacteria of the male and female mice , which could be related to effects of rapamycin on metabolism , immunity and health . More studies are needed to uncover precisely how such short-term treatments can yield long-term changes in the body , and how such changes are related to lifespan and healthy aging ."},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

(2015) and Zhang et al. (2016) modified the original bottom-up (encoder) network to include top-down (decoder) modules during training.However, in dense regression both bottom-up and top-down modules exist by default, and such methods are thus not trivial to extend to regression tasks.Motivated by the combination of supervised and unsupervised pathways, we propose a novel conditional GAN which includes implicit constraints in the latent subspaces.We coin this new model 'Robust Conditional GAN' (RoCGAN).In the original cGAN the generator accepts a source signal and maps it to the target domain.In our work, we (implicitly) constrain the decoder to generate samples that span only the target manifold.We replace the original generator, i.e. encoder-decoder, with a two pathway module (see FIG0 ).The first pathway, similarly to the cGAN generator, performs regression while the second is an autoencoder in the target domain (unsupervised pathway).The two pathways share a similar network structure, i.e. each one includes an encoder-decoder network.The weights of the two decoders are shared which promotes the latent representations of the two pathways to be semantically similar.Intuitively, this can be thought of as constraining the output of our dense regression to span the target subspace.The unsupervised pathway enables the utilization of all the samples in the target domain even in the absence of a corresponding input sample.During inference, the unsupervised pathway is no longer required, therefore the testing complexity remains the same as in cGAN.(a) The source signal is embedded into a low-dimensional, latent subspace, which is then mapped to the target subspace.The lack of constraints might result in outcomes that are arbitrarily off the target manifold.(b) On the other hand, in RoCGAN, steps 1b and 2b learn an autoencoder in the target manifold and by sharing the weights of the decoder, we restrict the output of the regression (step 2a).All figures in this work are best viewed in color.In the following sections, we introduce our novel RoCGAN and study their (theoretical) properties.We prove that RoCGAN share similar theoretical properties with the original GAN, i.e. convergence and optimal discriminator.An experiment with synthetic data is designed to visualize the target subspaces and assess our intuition.We experimentally scrutinize the sensitivity of the hyper-parameters and evaluate our model in the face of intense noise.Moreover, thorough experimentation with both images from natural scenes and human faces is conducted in two different tasks.We compare our model with both the state-of-the-art cGAN and the recent method of Rick Chang et al. (2017) .The experimental results demonstrate that RoCGAN outperform the baseline by a large margin in all cases.Our contributions can be summarized as following:• We introduce RoCGAN that leverages structure in the target space.The goal is to promote robustness in dense regression tasks.•We scrutinize the model performance under (extreme) noise and adversarial perturbations.To the authors' knowledge, this robustness analysis has not been studied previously for dense regression.•We conduct a thorough experimental analysis for two different tasks. Weoutline how RoCGAN can be used in a semi-supervised learning task, how it performs with lateral connections from encoder to decoder.Notation: Given a set of N samples, s (n) denotes the n th conditional label, e.g. a prior image; y (n) denotes the respective target image.

The symbolsL * define loss terms, while λ * denote regularization hyper-parameters optimized on the validation set.We introduce the Robust Conditional GAN (RoCGAN) model, a new conditional GAN capable of leveraging unsupervised data to learn better latent representations, even in the face of large amount of noise.RoCGAN's generator is composed of two pathways.The first pathway (reg pathway), performs the regression from the source to the target domain.The new, added pathway (AE pathway) is an autoencoder in the target domain.By adding weight sharing between the two decoders, we implicitly constrain the reg pathway to output images that span the target manifold.In this following sections (of the appendix) we include additional insights, a theoretical analysis along with additional experiments.The sections are organized as following:• In sec.

Toxicity of α-asarone, eugenol, isoeugenol, methyl eugenol, methyl isoeugenol, coumarin, coumarin 6, coniferyl aldehyde, diniconazole, ethyl cinnamate, and rosmarinic acid was evaluated by incorporation into the artificial diet. All of the phenylpropanoids exhibited dose - and time - dependent insecticidal activity. Among all the tested phenylpropanoids, coumarin exhibited the highest toxicity by revealing the least LD50 value (0.672 g/L). In addition, the most toxic compound (coumarin) observed in the current study, deteriorated the growth resulting tremendous reduction (78.39%) in efficacy of conversion of digested food (ECD), and (ECI) efficacy of conversion of ingested food (70.04%) of tenth-instar red palm weevil larvae. The energy - deficient red palm weevil larvae through their intrinsic abilities showed enhanced response to their digestibility resulting 27.78% increase in approximate digestibility (AD) compared to control larvae. The detoxification response of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus larvae determined by the quantitative expression of cytochrome P450, esterases, and glutathione S-transferase revealed enhanced expression among moderately toxic and ineffective compounds. These genes especially cytochrome P450 and GST detoxify the target compounds by enhancing their solubility that leads rapid excretion and degradation resulting low toxicity towards red palm weevil larvae. On the other hand, the most toxic (coumarin) silenced the genes involved in the red palm weevil detoxification mechanism. Based on the toxicity, growth retarding, and masking detoxification activities, coumarin could be a useful future natural red palm weevil - controlling agent.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"genes\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"Detoxification\\", \\"detoxification mechanism\\", \\"degradation\\", \\"detoxification activities\\", \\"expression\\", \\"detoxification response\\", \\"detoxify\\", \\"excretion\\", \\"tenth-instar\\", \\"Genes Expression\\", \\"growth\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"digested food\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"phenylpropanoids\\", \\"eugenol\\", \\"methyl isoeugenol\\", \\"methyl eugenol\\", \\"GST\\", \\"isoeugenol\\", \\"diniconazole\\", \\"Pesticide\\", \\"glutathione S-transferase\\", \\"coumarin\\", \\"cytochrome P450\\", \\"coumarin 6\\", \\"compound\\", \\"target compounds\\", \\"u03b1-asarone\\", \\"coniferyl aldehyde\\", \\"compounds\\", \\"Metabolites\\", \\"esterases\\", \\"agent\\", \\"ethyl cinnamate\\", \\"rosmarinic acid\\", \\"metabolites\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"larvae\\", \\"red palm weevil\\", \\"Natural Red Palm Weevil\\", \\"larvicidal\\", \\"natural red palm weevil\\", \\"Plant\\", \\"plant\\", \\"Rhynchophorus ferrugineus\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"insecticidal activity\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"diet\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"evaluated\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"Toxicity\\", \\"toxicity\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"current study\\", \\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"Modulating\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

associated pce and tamponade .a full term neonate born to a g2p2 mother by c - section ( performed for nonreassuring fetal status ) . at delivery , the amniotic fluid was found to be meconium stained .the infant demonstrated decreased tone and poor respiratory effort requiring intubation and aspiration of meconium .apgar score was 3 , 7 , and 8 at 1 , 5 , and 10 minutes , respectively ; birth weight was 2520 grams .he developed meconium aspiration syndrome ( mas ) and resultant persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( pphn ) and was placed on a conventional ventilator . due to worsening respiratory status ,he was later placed on high frequency oscillator ventilator ( hfov ) with subsequent addition of inhaled nitric oxide on day 6 of life .the baby required inotropic support in the form of dopamine , dobutamine , and hydrocortisone from day 1 .as a complication of mas and its treatment , he developed bilateral pneumothoraces , for which a chest tube was placed in the right pleural space . a double lumen umbilical venous catheter ( uvc ) was placed and total parenteral nutrition started on day 2 of life at 6.4  cc / hr ; 20% intralipid solution was added the next day at 1.6  cc / hr . we also found that the tpn was transfused through the proximal lumen of the uvc . due tocontinued cardio - respiratory instability , an echocardiogram was performed on day 6 of life .the study did not show any malposition of the catheter .   on arrival baby was on hfov , dopamine , and dobutamine at 15  mcg / kg / min .vitals on admission were as follows : t:37.0 c , heart rate:160/min , bp:79/55 , map:63  mmhg , pulse - oximetry was 90% .cxr on admission showed mild enlargement of cardio - thymic silhouette , right pleural effusion , and tip of the uvc just inferior to the diaphragm . all chest x - rays done from day 1 including the one done at our institution showed satisfactory position of uvc tip .the effusion was incompletely evacuated with removal of 9  ml of milky pericardial fluid which was sent for analysis .we were unable to remove more fluid form the pericardial cavity in that setting raising the possibility that a relatively small amount of fluid may have collected in the pericardial space in a short duration of time .the heart rate decreased by 3040  beats / min , the systolic blood pressure improved by 10  mmhg , and oxygen saturation improved to > 95% .thus , the hemodynamic compromise caused by the cardiac tamponade was taken care of and the infant 's cardio - respiratory status improved to some extent .analysis of pericardial fluid revealed glucose was 252 , triglycerides , 156 , 1 nucleated cell , and 1500  rbcs .the fluid was bloody in appearance with 14000 red blood cells and 720 nucleated cells ; predominantly neutrophils .glucose was 300 , protein < 2 , triglycerides 23 , and ldh of 151 .hence it was difficult to comment on the nature and origin of the pleural fluid .some centers perform a dye test to confirm the extravasation but this test is not done routinely at our center .the uvc was removed once the results of the fluid biochemistry were received and the infant received a new peripherally inserted central catheter line . on hospital day 3 , a small anterior pericardial effusion was present and on day 10 , the effusion had completely resolved .pce and tamponade are known complications of cvcs . with the increased use of long - term cvcs in neonatal intensive care units , there has been an increase in the incidence of pce associated with total parenteral nutrition .the etiology of such a pericardial effusion is not clear ; however several possibilities have been proposed based on clinical and autopsy findings [ 13 ] .  the myocardium in neonates may have areas of weakness which may be vulnerable to injury since it is not completely muscularized .repeated contact of the catheter tip with the cardiac wall with each contraction leads to endothelial cell damage and subsequent adherence of platelets and activation of the coagulation cascade .the resulting thrombus fosters attachment of the catheter tip to the heart , causing irritation of the endothelial cell lining by the infusate , causing osmotic injury . through the damaged lining ,, we did not appreciate any thrombus at the catheter tip on echocardiogram or on removal . depending on the acuity and severity of the diffusion , cardiac tamponade and even overt myocardial perforationcan occur . in instances where the tpn is infused through the proximal port of the uvc , deposits of lipids placed inside the liver may possibly diffuse to the pericardium via collaterals .the termination site of the catheter and the angle of the catheter within the heart may contribute to injury , for example , loops or curves in the device are associated with a greater incidence of myocardial perforation . interestingly ,a case has been reported by onal et al . from turkey describing a term infant developing tamponade despite correct position of the uvc .hyperosmolar infusates causing endothelial damage and transmural necrosis seems to be the mechanism of effusion in these cases . based on their experience, they suggest that high index of suspicion be maintained despite satisfactory position of the catheter when an infant with a central line deteriorates hemodynamically .another such report has been described by sehgal et al . with a properly positioned uvc . a retrospective review of pericardial effusions attributed to central venous catheters ( which includes uvcs ) ( n = 61 ) by nowlen et al .revealed that 92% of all catheters were last reported to be within the pericardial silhouette ( 82% were in the heart and 10% were at the vena cava / right atrial junction ) at the time the pericardial effusion was detected .we did not find similar data pertaining to uvcs only , except individual case reports [ 5 , 6 ] .the biochemical analysis of pericardial fluid in our case with high glucose and increased triglycerides in the absence of cells supports cvc - related fluid collection with tpn diffusion through myocardium .the fluid was initially milky and became blood tinged after repeat attempts to evacuate the fluid .review of literature suggests that most cases of the pericardial effusion resulting from central lines do not show evidence of trauma , supporting the hypothesis that there is osmotic diffusion of infusate even before overt myocardial perforation occurs .nonspecific signs of pce / tamponade include muffled or absent heart sounds , tachycardia or bradycardia , weak peripheral pulses , pallor , cyanosis , poor perfusion , increasing inotropic support , or unexplained deterioration of cardiopulmonary status [ 1 , 7 , 8 ] .there is considerable debate regarding the type and material of the central lines being used and correct tip placement of a cvc .studies in vitro and in adults suggest that thin , flexible silastic catheters are less likely to perforate and an increased angle of incidence between the cvc tip and the cardiac / vessel wall increases the likelihood of perforation [ 9 , 10 ] . hence it is recommended that routine radiography be performed on patients with cvc tips near the heart to ensure that the tip has not migrated . the cvc tip should remain outside the cardiac silhouette but still within the vena cavae .tip position in the high superior vena cavae or below the inferior vena cavae / right atrial junction should keep the cvc outside the pericardial reflections and thus minimize the risk of perforation .studies have also suggested that the accuracy of chest radiography is suboptimal in predicting catheter position . in a study by ades et al . , the sensitivity and specificity of cheat radiography in evaluating inappropriate catheter position were 32% and 89% .therefore , at the slightest suspicion of such a complication , prompt evaluation with ultrasound of the abdomen and heart must be performed to save valuable time .  for management of such pce / tamponade , stopping all infusions through the cvc is recommended followed by aspiration from the catheter / picc as a primary tool for evacuation of the effusion. we did not attempt to aspirate in our case since the uvc tip position was satisfactory at the time we evaluated the infant and so aspiration of fluid through uvc was not expected in our case .pce / tamponade is a rare but serious complication seen in neonates with cvcs which can happen even with correct position of the catheter tip .a high index of suspicion should be maintained in neonates with hemodynamic and respiratory instability and early echocardiography should be performed .. the cvc tip should remain outside the cardiac silhouette but still within the vena cavae .we think there should be a low threshold of performing an echocardiogram in sick neonates with central lines and may be repeated if there is any deterioration in clinical status .pericardiocentesis may be life saving procedure in these cases and leads to immediate hemodynamic improvement in addition to aiding in the diagnosis. cellular and biochemical analysis of the fluid also helps rule out other causes of pericardial effusion such as infections .written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images .a copy of the written consent is available for review by the editor - in - chief of this journal .","answer":"introduction .  pericardial effusion ( pce ) and tamponade can cause significant morbidity and mortality in neonates .  such cases have been reported in the literature in various contexts .  case presentation .  a 6-day old neonate with meconium aspiration syndrome and persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn on high frequency oscillator ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide was referred to our hospital with a large pericardial effusion causing hemodynamic compromise .  prompt pericardiocentesis led to significant improvement in the cardio -

In this paper we employ tools from stochastic geometry to characterize the statistics of radar interference. Specifically, using two different models for vehicle spacial distributions, namely, a Poisson point process and a Bernoulli lattice process, we calculate for each case the interference statistics and obtain analytical expressions for the probability of successful range estimation. Our study shows that the regularity of the geometrical model appears to have limited effect on the interference statistics, and so it is possible to obtain tractable tight bounds for worst case performance. A technique is proposed for designing the duty cycle for random spectrum access which optimizes the total performance. This analytical framework is verified using Monte-Carlo simulations.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: In this paper a method for interference detection and cancellation for automotive radar systems is proposed. With the growing amount of vehicles equipped with radar sensors, interference mitigation techniques are getting more and more important to maintain good interoperability. Based on the time domain signal of a 76 GHz chirp sequence radar the interfering signals of FMCW radar sensors are identified. This is performed by image processing methods applied to the time-frequency-image. With the maximally stable extremal regions algorithm the interference pattern in the signal is identified. Once the disturbed samples are known they are zeroed. To avoid any ringing effects in the processed radar image the neighborhood of affected samples is smoothed using a raised cosine window. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on real world measurements. The method reveals weak scattering centers of the vehicle, which are occluded by interference otherwise.[2]: [3]: Ultra wideband (UWB) automotive radars, less expensive than conventional millimeter-wave radars, have attracted attention from the viewpoint of reducing traffic accidents. The performance of automotive radars is degraded by interference from nearby radars operating at the same frequency. We assumed a scenario where two cars pass each other on a road. The desired-to-undesired signal power ratio (DUR) was found to vary approximately from −10 to 30 dB when employing cross polarization. Allocation of different maximum length sequences to different radars facilitates suppression of interference from other radars. Probabilities of false alarm (P fa ) and detection of the passing car (P d ) were evaluated by simulation. It was found that P d = 0.995 and 0.993 for P fa = 10−2 and 10−4, respectively, when DUR = −10 dB (the worst prediction).[4]: This paper provides qualitative and quantitative values for the received interference power at the antenna ports of automotive radars as well as the probability of their occurrence for actual and future, not yet measurable traffic scenarios on main roads. The influence of the environment, the road traffic behavior, and the radar penetration rate for a defined antenna configuration can be observed. The basis for the analyses are ray-tracing based simulations in order to achieve adequate predictions for the received power levels due to multipaths. The results show that for a radar penetration rate of 100 , the difference between the strongest overall incoherent received interference power level and the level that is received in 90 of the time is up to 7 dB, dependent on the antenna placement and the environment.[5]: Radar is an essential element of state of the art advanced driver assistance systems. In the foreseeable future, radar will be an indispensable sensor for the use in affordable, automated driven cars. Simulation tools are the key for an efficient development process and hence will lower the price of sophisticated driver assistance systems. Therefore, the development of adequate simulators is important for suppliers, car makers, and final consumers. This paper introduces the concept of such a simulator for multi-user automotive radar scenarios and presents selected simulation results for a use case of radar interference.","answer":"Further analytic attempts to investigate automotive radar interference can be found in [3] which studies the desired-to-undesired signal power ratio in ultra wideband automotive radar, also in [2] and [1] utilizing Frequency Modulation Continuous Wave (FMCW) as a modulation scheme. Simulation approaches can be found in [4] and [5] , mainly based on ray tracing with scenario specific simulation environments. To summarize, our understanding of the available literature on automotive radar interference, we list the following points: The majority of the literature is based on simulation and empirical approaches. Some analytic approaches investigate the interference in simple scenarios consisting of two vehicles. Simulation approaches investigate interference based on complex ray-tracing and stochastic environments. Most of the literature uses simulations and analysis, namely FMCW, and pulse radar."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Children <1 yo principally diagnosed with intestinal atresia were identified using the Kids' Inpatient Database (2012). Exposure variable was patient transfer status. Outcomes measured were inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge status. Linearized standard errors, design-based F tests, and multivariable logistic regression were performed. 1672 weighted discharges represented a national cohort. The highest income group and those with private insurance had significantly lower odds of transfer (OR:0.53 and 0.74, p < 0.05). Rural patients had significantly higher transfer rates (OR: 2.73, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed no difference in mortality (OR:0.71, p = 0.464) or non-home discharge (OR: 0.79, p = 0.166), but showed prolonged LOS (OR:1.79, p < 0.05) amongst transferred patients. Significant differences in hospital LOS and treatment access reveal a potential healthcare gap. Post-acute care resources should be improved for transferred patients.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"intestinal atresia\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"Post-acute care\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"diagnosed\\", \\"transfer status\\", \\"surgical outcomes\\", \\"improved\\", \\"discharge status\\", \\"Rural\\", \\"highest income\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"private insurance\\", \\"transfer\\", \\"non-home discharge\\", \\"weighted discharges\\", \\"healthcare\\", \\"treatment\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"design-based F tests\\", \\"Kidsu0027 Inpatient Database\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [\\"quaternary care center\\"], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"national cohort\\", \\"group\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"multivariable logistic regression\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

[ fig : pwlres ] )show that @xmath22 is rather flat inside the loop , but with a significant correlation .in contrast , the values of @xmath26 vary much more widely over the inside of the loop .this is a sign that the dominant effect of the vortex is given by whether or not it pierces the loop , regardless of where it does so , an effect not expected and not shown by the sign of the full gauge plaquette . both probes become uncorrelated very quickly when outside the loops . for gauge plaquettesthis can be understood from strong coupling ; such plaquettes only appear in quite high order . for p - plaquttes the natural interpretation is that vortices not piercing the wilson loop have no effect on it .however , if the vortices really correspond to extended physical objects , it is not clear why the change from inside to outside should be so sharp ; this raises questions about the size of the vortex core .9 m.  engelhardt , k.  langfeld , h.  reinhardt and o.  tennert , hep - lat/9904004 .l.  del debbio , m.  faber , j.  greensite , lejnk , phys .d55 ) 1997 ) 2298 , hep - lat/9610005 .g.  bali , c.  schlichter , k.  schilling , phys .d51 ( 1995 ) 5165 .hep - lat/9903023 , jhep 9903 ( 1999 ) 019 m.  engelhardt and h.  reinhardt , hep - th/9907139 .","answer":"we report two probes of centre vortices in pure su(2 ) .  first , we attempt to generate plaquette - size z(2 ) vortices in a quasi - random way to compare the structure with those of projected centre vortices from the full theory ; our prescription is , however , not completely random .  second , we test the effect of centre vortices on wilson loops as a function of position .  this shows clearly that the major effect is the piercing of the wilson loop regardless of the position of the vortex inside ."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] The relationship between sequence, folding and function has been extensively explored by Huc in families of amide oligomers. [9][10][11] These results suggest that sequence-encoded synthetic oligomers will be capable of showing the sophisticated recognition, self-assembly, catalysis and replication properties exhibited by biological oligomers. 12 We have been investigating the properties of synthetic oligomers based on the nucleic acid blueprint: an oligomeric backbone equipped with side-chains containing complementary hydrogen bonding recognition sites (Figure 1). [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21] Hydrogen bonding interactions between sequence-complementary oligomers leads to formation of stable duplexes in organic solvents for a wide range of molecular designs based on different synthesis, backbone and recognition modules.</p><p>Figure 1 shows one architecture, which is based on an oligoester backbone and phenolphosphine oxide base-pairing interactions. 21 Although the backbone ester groups could potentially compete for hydrogen bonding interactions with the phenol recognition groups, these interactions are very weak (β ≈ 5.5) compared with the very strong hydrogen bonds formed with phosphine oxide recognition sites (β ≈ 10.5), which leads to high fidelity basepairing in this system. 22 Backbone flexibility is another critical parameter in determining the duplex forming properties of recognition-encoded oligomers. If the backbone is too flexible, intramolecular interaction between adjacent complementary bases leads to 1,2-folding, which precludes duplex formation in mixed sequence oligomers. 17 However, sufficient flexibility is required to allow the backbone to adapt to a conformation compatible with multiple base-pairing interactions in longer duplexes. 20 The combination of the short-long base-pair geometry and the short flexible ester backbone shown in Figure 1 provides the right balance of flexibility and geometric constraint to ensure cooperative formation of closed duplexes for the AA, DD, and AD 2-mers with no competition from 1,2-folding. 21 Ester backbone chemistry is particularly attractive, because it is possible to prepare monomer building blocks equipped with orthogonal protecting groups, providing straightforward access to longer oligomers via stepwise synthesis. [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30] Here we describe the synthesis of the ADAD 4-mer and show that there are emergent supramolecular assembly properties that resemble those found in nucleic acids.</p><p>Figure 1: A blueprint for duplex forming molecules. There are three key design elements: the coupling chemistry used for the synthesis of oligomers (red), the recognition module, which controls intermolecular binding (blue), and the backbone module, which links these components together (black). The protected monomers used for the synthesis of oligoesters equipped with phenol and phosphine oxide recognition modules are shown, along with a schematic representation of the proposed duplex.</p>Synthesis<p>Synthesis of the two monomer building blocks (1 and 2) required for the preparation of oligomers was described previously. 21 Coupling of 1 and 2 with EDC gave the acetyl-protected 2-mer 3. Hydrogenation of 3 selectively removed the carboxylic acid protecting group to give 4. The alcohol protecting group on 3 was selectively removed with ntetrabutylammonium fluoride to give 5. Coupling 4 with 5 provided AD*AD*, the 4-mer with the phenol groups protected as acetate esters. The ester protecting groups were then hydrolysed to give ADAD. As with peptides, the backbone has a direction, so we write the sequence starting from the alcohol terminus and ending at the carboxylic acid terminus. Scheme 1: Synthesis of the ADAD 4-mer.</p>NMR Sequential Assignment<p>The backbone of the ADAD 4-mer has a direction, so none of the residues are equivalent, and all of the 1 H NMR signals were resolved in 500 MHz spectrum recorded in deuterochloroform.</p><p>Two well-separated signals were observed in both the 19 F and 31 P NMR spectra, which indicates that the two donor residues and two acceptor residues are both in quite different enviroments, suggesting that the oligomer either folds or forms a higher order supramolecular structure in solution. In order to determine the three-dimensional structure, assignment of the signals due to different residues was required. The sequential assignment strategy is summarized below (see Figures S3 to S8 for full details).</p><p>The labelling scheme used to assign the NMR spectra is illustrated in Figure 2 (a): B represents signals due to the Backbone units and R represents signals due to the Recognition units; carbon atoms are numbered sequentially for each unit (R1, R2, ..., B1, B3, ...) and the four different residues are distinguished using colours (red, blue, yellow and green). Protons have the same label as the carbon atom to which they are bonded; the signals due the phosphorus and fluorine atoms are labeled outer and inner to distinguish the two residues in the oligomer; the terminal protecting groups and the iso-butyl groups on the phosphine oxides were not assigned.</p>Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy<p>The NMR spectra suggest that there are hydrogen bonding interactions between the recognition groups in the ADAD 4-mer, and these interactions could be due to intramolecular folding or intermolecular interactions. Diffusion Order 19 F NMR Spectroscopy was therefore used to determine whether intermolecular complexes are present in chloroform solution.</p><p>The diffusion coefficient of the ADAD 4-mer was compared with the corresponding values for the AD 2-mer, which we have shown forms a duplex under these conditions, 21 and the 4-mer and 2-mer, AD*AD* and AD*, in which the phenol groups are protected as acetate esters and so cannot form hydrogen bonds. Figure 7 shows an overlay of the 19 F DOSY spectra of samples prepared at comparable concentrations in 1,1,2,2,-tetrachloroethane-d 2 .</p><p>The diffusion coefficients for AD and ADAD were both significantly lower than the values for the corresponding non-hydrogen bonding analogues AD* and AD*AD*, which implies formation of intermolecular complexes through hydrogen bonding interactions involving the phenol groups in both AD and ADAD at a concentration of 5 mm in TCE-d 2 . 31</p>NMR Dilution Studies<p>The self-association of ADAD was studied using 1 H, 19 8. The ADAD•ADAD complex could be assembled from two stemloops by making two intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the inner residues without disruption of the intramolecular interaction between the outer residues. By analogy with nucleic acids, we call this structure kissing stem-loops. 32 The other likely structure for the ADAD•ADAD complex is a duplex in which the intramolecular interactions between the two outer residues are broken to give four intermolecular hydrogen bonds.</p>Molecular Modelling<p>The three supramolecular structures shown in Figure 4 were investigated using molecular mechanics calculations (see ESI for further details). For the monomeric state of ADAD, a conformational search gave the 1,4-folded stem-loop with a hydrogen bond between the outer residues as the lowest energy structure, which is consistent with the NMR data. In order to reduce the size of the conformational search space for the dimeric state, constraints were used to make sure that the two inner residues formed the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which are present in both the duplex and kissing stem-loop structures. Two distinct local minima corresponding to the duplex and kissing stem loops structures were found for dimeric ADAD (Figure 10). While the calculated energy difference between the two structures (∆E OPLS3 ≈ 10 kJ mol −1 ) is small, the calculations are consistent with the NMR data, which suggest predominant formation of the kissing stem-loops structure.</p>NMR Melting Experiments<p>Thermal denaturation of the   1 (δ monomer = −58.7 and δ dimer = −60.9 ppm).</p><p>However, a simple two-state melting equilibrium does not explain the behaviour of ADAD (see Figure S11 for further details). In biochemistry, deviations from the enthalpies calculated using the van't Hoff method imply denaturation of proteins through an intermediate state. 33 If we assume that the melting of the ADAD dimer proceeds through a highly populated intermediate and use a three-state equilibrium, it is possible to describe the experimental data well (11).</p>","answer":"The sequences of oligomeric molecules equipped with interacting side-chains encode the three-dimensional structure, the supramolecular assembly properties, and ultimately function. In an attempt to replicate the duplex forming properties of nucleic acids, an oligoester containing an alternating sequence of hydrogen bonding donor (D) and acceptor (A) residues was synthesised. Characterisation of assembly properties of the ADAD oligomer revealed a supramolecular architecture that resembles the kissing stem-loops motif found in folded RNA. NMR dilution and melting experiments in chloroform and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane show that intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the terminal phenol and phosphine oxide recognition sites in the ADAD 4-mer leads to 1,4-folding. This folded stem-loop structure can be denatured to give the single strand by heating. At higher concentrations or lower temperatures, the stem-loop dimerises via intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the two inner recognition sites, leading to a kissing stem-loops structure. The results suggest a rich supramolecular chemistry for these recognition-encoded oligoesters and lay 1 strong foundations for the future development of new functional materials based on synthetic information molecules."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

However, potential effects of CLA and calcium on bone mass during a period of bone loss have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine how dietary calcium modulates the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in preventing bone loss, using an ovariectomised mouse model. CLA supplementation significantly prevented ovariectomy-associated weight and fat mass gain, compared to non-supplemented controls. CLA significantly increased bone markers without major changes in bone mineral composition in the femur compared to respective controls. CLA treatment increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) significantly (p=0.0172), while serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentration was not changed by CLA. Meanwhile, CLA significantly reduced femur tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, suggesting potential reduction of osteoclastogenesis. The data suggest that CLA, along with dietary calcium, has great potential to be used to prevent bone loss and weight gain associated with menopause.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"linoleic acid\\", \\"calcium\\", \\"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"PTH\\", \\"parathyroid hormone\\", \\"tartrate resistant acid phosphatase\\", \\"TRAP\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Here we investigate electrophysiological characteristics of Xenopus tadpole midbrain neurons across development and during homeostatic plasticity induced by patterned visual stimulation. We show that in development tectal neuron properties not only change on average, but also become increasingly diverse. After sensory stimulation, both electrophysiological diversity and functional differentiation of cells are reduced. At the same time, the amount of cross-correlations between cell properties increase after patterned stimulation as a result of homeostatic plasticity. We show that tectal neurons with similar spiking profiles often have strikingly different electrophysiological properties, and demonstrate that changes in intrinsic excitability during development and in response to sensory stimulation are mediated by different underlying mechanisms. Overall, this analysis and the accompanying dataset provide a unique framework for further studies of network maturation in Xenopus tadpoles.Introduction:Electrophysiological properties of neurons become increasingly diverse over development in ways that are critical for proper nervous system function and maturation( Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004; Marder and Goaillard, 2006). Perturbation of these processes can have broad and devastating consequences leading to neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation, autism, and schizophrenia( Rice and Barone, 2000; Belmonte et al., 2004; Pratt and Khakhalin, 2013). It remains unclear, however, to what degree this diversity in electrophysiological tuning reflects intrinsic developmental differentiation, and how much it reflects the particular activation history of a given neuron, as well as the constraints that shape how well neurons adapt to changes in their input patterns. The adaptability of electrophysiological properties is central for allowing developing neural circuits to maintain functional stability, while simultaneously providing flexibility for accommodating developmental changes. One mechanism that contributes to this balance is homeostatic plasticity, whereby neurons adjust their synaptic and intrinsic properties based on the activity of the circuit in which they are embedded( Daoudal and Debanne, 2003; Desai, 2003; Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004; Ibata et al., 2008; Turrigiano, 2008; Marder, 2011). Homeostatic plasticity allows developing circuits to function stably by maximizing their dynamic range as new inputs become incorporated( Bucher et al., 2005; Marder and Goaillard, 2006; Pratt and Aizenman, 2007). This is particularly relevant to developing animals: their nervous system must be functional and able to interact with its environment even as nascent circuitry is still developing. One place where this adaptability in synaptic and intrinsic properties is particularly salient, is in the optic tectum of Xenopus laevis tadpoles—a midbrain area that processes inputs from visual, auditory, and mechanosensory systems( Cline, 1991; Ewert, 1997; Cline, 2001; Ruthazer and Cline, 2004; Ruthazer and Aizenman, 2010). Sensory inputs to the tectum are strengthened over development, resulting in increasingly robust synaptic responses, yet this strengthening is accompanied with decreases in intrinsic excitability that may function to maintain a stable dynamic range in this circuit( Pratt and Aizenman, 2007). As a consequence, visually guided behaviors, such as collision avoidance, improve and become more tuned to specific stimuli( Dong et al., 2009). Changes in sensory environment can also elicit homeostatic plasticity in tectal cells, resulting in adjustment of both synaptic and intrinsic properties( Aizenman et al., 2003; Deeg and Aizenman, 2011). Since homeostatic plasticity coordinates changes of different cellular properties, over time it is expected to constrain these properties, limiting ways in which they can co-vary within the population of cells( O'Leary et al., 2013): for example, strong excitatory synaptic drive results in lower intrinsic excitability. Coordinated changes in different physiological properties may contribute to diversification of cell tuning that happens as networks mature, creating and shaping differences in cell phenotypes both between cell types as they emerge( Ewert, 1974; Frost and Sun, 2004; Kang and Li, 2010; Nakagawa and Hongjian, 2010; Liu et al., 2011), and within each cell type in a functional network( Tripathy et al., 2013; Elstrott et al., 2014). These considerations suggest that multivariate distributions of different physiological properties sampled across many cells in a network may contain unique information both about current tuning of this network, and the mechanisms behind this tuning that may act through local recalibration of properties in individual cells( O'Leary et al., 2013). Yet relatively few studies have attempted this kind of analysis on a large scale so far. Here we perform a large-scale electrophysiological census of retinorecipient neurons in the developing Xenopus laevis tectum to better understand the electrophysiological variability of tectal neurons in development, and in response to a need for homeostatic change. Using a comprehensive suite of tests we describe relationships between 33 electrophysiological variables, and show that both the variability and the predictability of multivariate cell tuning increases over development, and undergo changes in response to sensory stimulation. By analyzing groups of neurons that produce similar spike trains, we also show that similar spiking behaviors may be supported by different combinations of underlying electrophysiological properties.Discussion:In this study we systematically assessed cell-to-cell electrophysiological variability of primary neurons in the optic tectum of Xenopus tadpoles across several developmental periods and in response to sensory stimulation. Our results indicate that during development cells in the deep layer of the tectum become more diverse— although at the stages we studied they do not split into distinct non-overlapping cell types that are reported in the tecta of other species and at later stages of development in frogs( Lazar, 1973; Ewert, 1974; Grüsser and Grüsser-Cornehls, 1976; Frost and Sun, 2004; Kang and Li, 2010; Nakagawa and Hongjian, 2010; Liu et al., 2011). We also found that several key electrophysiological properties of tectal cells change over development. We confirmed previously described changes in the average intrinsic excitability of tectal cells with age( Pratt and Aizenman, 2007), and showed that at these stages most physiological differences between cells are linked to their overall spikiness( based on the results of Principal Variable Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and the comparison of statistical efficiency of different protocols). More importantly, we report an increased diversification of cell phenotypes at later developmental stages, and a shrinkage of this diversity in response to strong sensory stimulation. The cell-to-cell variability remained relatively low at stages 43–47, and different electrophysiological parameters were more random with respect to each other, both in terms of clustering and linear interdependencies between different variables. By stages 48–49 cell variability in the tectum increased, and some internal structure in the PCA cloud began to emerge, with patterns of cell properties agglomerating into clusters, which although poorly resolved at the PCA plot, were noticeable through the quantitative clustering analysis. Complementing previously described receptive field refinement( Dong et al., 2009), and temporal decorrelation of spiking activity( Xu et al., 2011), this tuning and differentiation of cell properties likely reflects maturation of tectal networks. An increase in cell tuning variability is reminiscent of reports from other experimental models, including mammalian sensory cortex( Jadhav et al., 2009; Yassin et al., 2010), where the non-uniformity of neuronal recruitment thresholds was shown to be a common feature of developed, functional networks( Elstrott et al., 2014). This emerging structure and differentiation of cell properties was, however, decreased by strongly patterned visual stimulation, which reduced cell-to-cell variability, making neurons more similar to each other electrophysiologically. At the same time, the amount of variance explained by linear correlations between different variables increased after visual stimulation. This suggests that sensory stimulation, and associated homeostatic plasticity( Aizenman et al., 2003; Dong et al., 2009) left a predictable trace in the mutual arrangement of different physiological properties within each cell( Turrigiano et al., 1994; Dong et al., 2009; Munz et al., 2014). These predictable traces and correlations were then picked up by local factor analysis, making our results similar to reports from the stomatogastric ganglion model( O'Leary et al., 2013). We also show that the shift in neuronal excitability induced by visual stimulation was supported by different underlying electrophysiological properties than were the similar changes in excitability observed during development. Among the practical consequences of this study, we point to developmental stage 47 as a likely candidate for the critical tuning period for tectal network maturation. We describe a previously undocumented sharp, transient increase in excitability in tectal cells during stage 47, providing an explanation for the previously unarticulated practice of aggregating developmental data over stages 45–46 and 48–49, but avoiding pools of stage 47 neurons with other stages( Pratt et al., 2008; Deeg et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2009; Sharma and Cline, 2010; Xu et al., 2011; Khakhalin and Aizenman, 2012; Spawn and Aizenman, 2012). This transient development stage, which lasts for only about 12–18 hr, and is traditionally defined solely on the basis of embryonic morphology( Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994), was accompanied by rapid changes in cell tuning variability, and a powerful( almost two-fold) increase in cell excitability. This intriguing developmental pattern could be explored in the future as a model for a critical period in development. Finally, our analysis of neurons with similar spiking outputs demonstrated that strikingly different combinations of underlying low-level electrophysiological properties can lead to similar spiking phenotypes, and conversely, that the predictability of spiking phenotype from any small set of cell properties is low. This reinforces the notion that the conflicting biological goals of developmental flexibility and stability in response to perturbations rely on the redundancy of parameters underlying dynamic behavior of these systems( Marder and Taylor, 2011; Marder et al., 2014). The consequence of this redundancy is that multiple parameter configurations can produce phenomenologically identical patterns of network activation( Goaillard et al., 2009; Caplan et al., 2014). Altogether, our results provide a promising framework for studying mechanisms of network maturation and calibration in Xenopus tadpoles, as well as a unique dataset that will be helpful to inform computational modeling of the optic tectum. In future studies we plan to combine electrophysiological identification of single cells with the transcriptional mapping of relevant genes( Nelson et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2006) to further advance our understanding of the molecular biology underlying development and plasticity in dynamic systems.","answer":"Brains consist of many cells called neurons: billions of them in a human brain , and hundreds of thousands in the brain of a small fish or a frog tadpole .

The transcription factor GATA-1 is essential for normal erythropoiesis. By examining in vitro-differentiated embryonic stem cells, we showed previously that in the absence of GATA-1, committed erythroid precursors fail to complete maturation and instead undergo apoptosis. The mechanisms by which GATA-1 controls cell survival are unknown. Here we report that in erythroid cells, GATA-1 strongly induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xL, but not the related proteins bcl-2 and mcl-1. Consistent with a role for bcl-xL in mediating GATA-1-induced erythroid cell survival, in vitro-differentiated bcl-xL-/-embryonic stem cells fail to generate viable mature definitive erythroid cells, a phenotype resembling that of GATA-1 gene disruption.

Previous studies demonstrated that the enzyme achieves high selectivity by using a more specific synthetic active site that is not prone to errors under physiological conditions. Interestingly, the synthetic active site of hs mt LeuRS displays a high degree of homology with prokaryotic, lower eukaryotic, and other mitochondrial LeuRSs that are less specific. However, there is one residue that differs between hs mt and Escherichia coli LeuRSs located on a flexible closing loop near the signature KMSKS motif. Here we describe studies indicating that this particular residue (K600 in hs mt LeuRS and L570 in E. coli LeuRS) strongly impacts aminoacylation in two ways: it affects both amino acid discrimination and transfer RNA (tRNA) binding. While this residue may not be in direct contact with the amino acid or tRNA substrate, substitutions of this position in both enzymes lead to altered catalytic efficiency and perturbations to the discrimination of leucine and isoleucine. In addition, tRNA recognition and aminoacylation is affected. These findings indicate that the conformation of the synthetic active site, modulated by this residue, may be coupled to specificity and provide new insights into the origins of selectivity without editing.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"leucyl\\", \\"isoleucine\\", \\"amino acid\\", \\"aminoacyl\\", \\"leucine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"hs mt LeuRS\\", \\"aaRS\\", \\"leucyl-tRNA synthetase\\", \\"KMSKS motif\\", \\"LeuRSs\\", \\"class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase\\", \\"Human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase\\", \\"E. coli LeuRS\\", \\"hs mt and Escherichia coli LeuRSs\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

It is known that root growth inhibition by ethylene involves auxin, which is partially mediated by the action of the WEAK ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2/ANTHRANILATE SYNTHASE α1( WEI2/ASA1), encoding a rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan( Trp) biosynthesis, from which auxin is derived. However, the molecular mechanism by which ethylene decreases root growth via ASA1 is not understood. Here we report that the ethylene-responsive AP2 transcription factor, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1( ERF1), plays an important role in primary root elongation of Arabidopsis. Using loss- and gain-of-function transgenic lines as well as biochemical analysis, we demonstrate that ERF1 can directly up-regulate ASA1 by binding to its promoter, leading to auxin accumulation and ethylene-induced inhibition of root growth. This discloses one mechanism linking ethylene signaling and auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis roots.Introduction:Phytohormones are central regulators of plant root growth and development. Each root development process is determined by a network of interacting signals to give the final architecture of the root[1]. Ethylene and auxin have been shown to regulate some of the same developmental processes, including primary root elongation[2–4]. Although the crosstalk between ethylene and auxin in regulating primary root elongation is well characterized[3, 5–9], there is still a significant lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism that links ethylene signaling and auxin biosynthesis. Ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, acts as a key regulatory signal during the plant life cycle[10, 11]. The biosynthesis of ethylene begins from methionine, which is converted to S-adenosyl-methionine( SAM) by SAM synthetase. Then a family of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid( ACC) synthases( ACS) converts SAM to ACC. This reaction is a rate-limiting step and a key regulatory point in ethylene biosynthesis[12]. Finally, ACC is converted to ethylene by ACC oxidase( ACO)[13, 14]. In the Arabidopsis genome, there are 12 members in ACS gene family, which display overlapping temporal and spatial expression patterns and are responsive to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses and hormones, such as auxin[15, 16]. Apparently all major components of ethylene signal transduction have been identified by the successful isolation of a series of ethylene response mutants and a precise ethylene signaling pathway has been established[17–21]. Once ethylene is synthesized, it is perceived by any of five membrane bound protein receptors ETHYLENE RESPONSE1( ETR1), ETR2, ETHYLENERESPONSE SENSOR1( ERS1), ERS2, and ETHYLENEINSENSITIVE4( EIN4), which possess sequence similarity to bacterial two-component His kinases[22–24]. The binding of ethylene to its receptor results in inhibition of a Raf-like Ser/Thr protein kinase CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1( CTR1)[25]. Inhibited CTR1 loses its ability to phosphorylate and repress a positive component of the ethylene signal pathway, the membrane protein ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2( EIN2)[26]. The active form of EIN2 stabilises the transcription factors of the EIN3 family located in the nucleus. The EIN3 proteins subsequently bind to the promoters of the ERF genes and activate their transcription[27, 28]. Thus a transcriptional cascade commencing with the sensing of ethylene is triggered to produce the ethylene response. ERFs, which contain an AP2 DNA-binding domain, form a plant-specific superfamily of 122 transcriptional factors in Arabidopsis[29]. ERFs influence a variety of functions involved in plant development and also play important roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses[30–34], through specifically binding to sequences containing GCCGCC motifs( GCC-box) in the regulatory region of downstream genes[35]. It was reported that GCC-box is not well conserved in ethylene responsive genes, suggesting that other types of transcription factors may also be activated by EIN3 and involve in transcriptional cascade caused by ethylene[7]. ERF1( AT3G23240) is a downstream component of the ethylene signaling pathway and is directly regulated by EIN3 at the transcriptional level[27]. It is well known that ERF1 is a key integrator of the jasmonic acid( JA) and ethylene signaling pathways involved in the regulation of defence response genes such as b-CHI and PDF1. 2[36]. Ethylene signaling is also involved in plant responses to both salt and water stress, as ethylene insensitive mutants were more salt sensitive[37–39]. ERF1 also plays a positive role in abiotic stress responses such as salt, drought, and heat stress[40]. In addition to responding to biotic and abiotic stress, ERF1 further mediates ethylene responses in developmental processes, such as the inhibition of primary root growth and hypocotyl elongation in the dark. This has been confirmed by the production of transgenic plants with constitutively activated ERF1, which displayed phenotypes similar to that are observed in ctr1 mutant, EIN3-overexpressing plants, and wild-type plants treated with ethylene[25, 27, 41]. Recently, ERF109 was shown to mediate crosstalk between JA signaling and auxin biosynthesis[42]. Root growth relies on two essential developmental processes: cell division in the root meristem and elongation of cells produced by the root meristem[43]. Root cell elongation can be affected by diverse endogenous and exogenous factors such as ethylene[3], auxin[44], and calcium[45]. Ethylene, and its precursor ACC, reduces root elongation in a concentration-dependent manner by inhibition of the cell elongation process[4, 6]. The crosstalk between ethylene and auxin has been well investigated[3, 6]. The most interesting discovery for auxin/ethylene crosstalk in recent years is that Arabidopsis pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase, VAS1, uses the ethylene biosynthetic intermediate methionine as an amino donor and the auxin biosynthetic intermediate indole-3-pyruvic acid as an amino acceptor to produce L-tryptophan and 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid[46]. Many mutants that affect auxin synthesis, distribution, or signaling also result in abnormal responses to ethylene[8, 47–50], such as, mutants of AUX1 and EIR1/AGR/PIN2 involved in auxin transport, AXR2/IAA7 and AXR3/IAA17 in the auxin signal pathway, or the auxin receptor TIR1, which all exhibit ethylene-insensitive root growth[5, 20, 49, 51–53]. Auxin biosynthetic genes encoding enzymes such as WEI2/ ANTHRANILATE SYNTHASE α1( ASA1), WEI7/ASB1, TAA1, and TAR1, which are regulated by ethylene, also exhibit ethylene-insensitive root growth[8, 9]. YUC genes also play an important role in root responses to ethylene[54]. These studies suggest that the inhibition of primary root growth caused by ethylene requires auxin biosynthesis, transport, or signaling. WEI2 encodes the α-subunit of the enzyme anthranilate synthase in Trp-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Its expression in roots can be induced by ethylene and wei2 mutations cause ethylene-insensitive root growth phenotypes[8]. In Arabidopsis roots, ethylene promotes auxin biosynthesis in a ASA1-dependent manner[8], this is an important molecular mechanism by which ethylene exerts its effect on promoting auxin biosynthesis. However, the molecular mechanism for regulation of ASA1 by ethylene is not well understood. Here, we report that ERF1, a downstream AP2 transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, positively regulates auxin biosynthesis during inhibition of ethylene-mediated primary root growth. Transgenic plants with constitutive expression or knockdown of ERF1 displayed similar root development phenotype to mutants of ethylene signaling. ERF1 affected auxin accumulation through directly binding to the ASA1 promoter and positively regulating ASA1 expression. Our results indicate that ERF1 plays a pivotal role in the inhibition of ethylene-induced primary root growth in Arabidopsis and acts as the crosstalk node between ethylene and auxin in primary root elongation.Discussion:One of the best studied effects of ethylene on roots is the inhibition of root elongation[5, 20]. A number of studies have indicated that ethylene inhibits root development through interaction with auxin. Ethylene has been shown to increase auxin synthesis, auxin transport to the elongation zone, and auxin signaling at the root tip[3, 5–9, 47, 52]. ERF1, a downstream transcription factor in the ethylene signal pathway was reported to reduce primary root growth in the dark when constitutively expressed[27]. Until now, no detailed and explicit mechanism has been provided for its role in primary root elongation. In this study, we demonstrated that ERF1 directly regulates the expression of ASA1, a key enzyme in Trp biosynthesis where auxin is derived and known to play an important role in ethylene-regulated root development[8]. This work elaborates the mechanism by which the transcription factor ERF1 participates in primary root development and directly mediates crosstalk between ethylene and auxin biosynthesis during root elongation. Through analyses of root response to ethylene with overexpression and knockdown lines of ERF1( Fig 2A–2C), we found that the length of the primary root was closely correlated to ERF1 expression. These results imply that ERF1 is involved in ethylene-mediated root elongation. ERFs belong to a large gene family. Only a few ERF mutants show obvious phenotypes, probably due to functional redundancy. However, ERF1 knockdown lines displayed longer root under normal and added ACC conditions( Fig 2B, 2C and 2G), indicating that ERF1 plays an important role in ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Furthermore, ERF1 controls primary root elongation by reducing cell elongation, but not cell division( Fig 2D–2F), which is consistent with ethylene signal pathway mutants[6]. Ethylene upregulates auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis seedlings to enhance inhibition of root elongation[6]. High auxin levels are known to reduce root growth[3]. Some auxin biosynthesis genes are ethylene responsive, and if mutated, cause some defects in root growth in the presence of ACC[8, 9]. To understand how ERF1 mediates ethylene signaling in primary root elongation and particularly auxin biosynthesis, we analysed the promoters of all genes which participate in auxin biosynthesis, and found that two genes including ASA1 and YUCCA2 contained a GCC-box which can be specifically bound by ERF1. A recent study showed that ERF109, another member of the ERF family that is highly responsive to JA signaling, directly regulates both ASA1 and YUC2 and mediates crosstalk between JA and auxin biosynthesis[42]. The primary root elongation of the yucca2 mutant, in the presence of added ACC, did not differ from wildtype. Considering that ASA1 is ethylene responsive, asa1 is ethylene insensitive in root-elongation[8], and there is a GCC-box in the promoter of ASA1 which could be bound by ERF1, we hypothesized that ASA1 might be a direct target of ERF1. To confirm our hypothesis, we conducted in vitro binding( EMSA), yeast-one-hybrid, and chromatin immunoprecipitation( ChIP) experiments and confirmed that ERF1 could directly bind a conserved GCC-box element in the promoter of ASA1 in vitro and in vivo( Fig 4). We further confirmed our hypothesis by analyzing ASA1pro:GUS in ERF1 knockdown and overexpression background. As we expected, the expression of ASA1 was remarkably increased in ERF1 overexpression background but reduced in the knockdown lines( Fig 5). Upon ACC treatment, the staining of ASA1pro:GUS in ERF1 knockdown background becomes darker but still relatively weaker than that in Col-0 background at the root tip and DZ( Fig 5C), indicating that the ethylene responsiveness was not completely removed. In the ERF1 knockdown lines, the induction of ASA1 by ethylene was reduced but some induction was still retained compared to the wildtype( S4C Fig), which is consistent with the primary root phenotype( Fig 6). This may be due to incomplete suppression of ERF1 by RNAi technique, alternatively, there may be additional components involved in this process. For instance, EIN3 was suggested to directly regulate ASA1 based on the data of EIN3 ChIP-Seq experiments[63]. Meanwhile, analyses of ASA1pro:GUS reporter in ethylene signal pathway mutation background( ein2-5, ein3-1, ctr1-1, EIN3ox) showed that when ethylene signal pathway was enhanced, the expression of ASA1 was also enhanced. Conversely, if ethylene signal pathway was blocked, the expression of ASA1 was reduced and the induction by ACC was also impaired( Fig 7). These results explicated that ASA1 is downstream of these ethylene signal pathway components. Taken together, our results support a model in which ethylene stimulates auxin biosynthesis in roots through ethylene-responsive transcription factor ERF1 that positively regulates ASA1. As a consequence of activating ASA1 expression, ERF1 increases the accumulation of auxin, which in turn decreases root elongation and alters root architecture.","answer":"Ethylene is a gaseous phytohormone that plays critical roles in plant development and defense .

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Britto et al., 2017; Linden et al., 2019) . This is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections, thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole (Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . Furthermore, due to the different replication cycles and response against the myriad of respiratory viruses, each respiratory virus may also contribute to exacerbations via different mechanisms that may alter their severity. Hence, this review will focus on compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases; as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease. The review will serve to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation. Such an approach may be clinically significant due to the current scarcity of antiviral drugs for the management of viral-induced exacerbations. This will improve the quality of life of patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Once the link between viral infection and acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory disease was established, there have been many reports on the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation induced by respiratory viral infection. Upon infecting the host, viruses evoke an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection. Generally, infected airway epithelial cells release type I (IFNα/β) and type III (IFNλ) interferons, cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Matsukura et al., 2013) . These, in turn, enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNγ), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) . These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases. Additionally, in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP), viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2015; Dunican and Fahy, 2015) . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) . Viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation; worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating COPD, CRSsNP and even CRSwNP in certain cases (Wang et al., 2009; Tacon et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . An epithelial-centric alarmin pathway around IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and their interaction with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) has also recently been identified (Nagarkar et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2018; Allinne et al., 2019) . IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP are type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier (Gabryelska et al., 2019; Roan et al., 2019) . ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated (Scanlon and McKenzie, 2012; Li and Hendriks, 2013) . In the event of viral infection, cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier will also induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, with heighten expression in an inflamed airway (Allakhverdi et al., 2007; Goldsmith et al., 2012; Byers et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2013; Beale et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2014; Uller and Persson, 2018; Ravanetti et al., 2019) . These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation (Camelo et al., 2017) . In the case of COPD, increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation (Silver et al., 2016) . Interestingly, these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 . As integration of the virology, microbiology and immunology of viral infection becomes more interlinked, additional factors and FIGURE 1 | Current understanding of viral induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Upon virus infection in the airway, antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway. Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org mechanisms have been implicated in acute exacerbations during and after viral infection (Murray et al., 2006) . Murray et al. (2006) has underlined the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents in causing more severe acute exacerbations in the airway. This is especially true when not all exacerbation events occurred during the viral infection but may also occur well after viral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Stolz et al., 2019) in particular the late onset of a bacterial infection (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a . In addition, viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation, as the nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections. Moreover, not all viral infections of the airway will lead to acute exacerbations, suggesting a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the \\"united airway\\" hypothesis (Kurai et al., 2013) . On the other hand, viral infections or their components persist in patients  with chronic airway inflammatory disease (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Hence, their presence may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. Future studies should be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance (Hammond et al., 2015; McKendry et al., 2016; Akbarshahi et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells (Becker, 2006; McKendry et al., 2016) . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium (Contoli et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2019; Wark, 2019) . Due to the viral components remaining in the airway, antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation (Wood et al., 2011; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018) . These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) . With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection. On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) .Question: What is the effect of chronic airway inflammatory disease  in patients?","answer":"viral infections or their components persist in patients"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Although gefitinib combined with various cytotoxic agents has been reported to enhance cytotoxicity in vitro and in mouse models, the mechanism remains undetermined. Here, to explore the mechanism with topoisomerase I inhibitors, we focused on the efflux pump of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), and then examined whether gefitinib restored drug sensitivity in multidrug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing BCRP. We used PC-6 human small cell lung cancer cells and multidrug-resistant PC-6/SN2-5H cells selected with SN-38 of the active metabolite of irinotecan, and BCRP-overexpressing MCF-7/MX cells selected with mitoxantrone and BCRP cDNA transfectant MCF-7/clone 8 cells. Drug sensitivity against anticancer drugs was determined by tetrazolium dye assay, and intracellular topotecan accumulation by FACScan. The topotecan transport study was done using the plasma membrane vesicles of PC-6/SN2-5H cells. The resistant PC-6/SN2-5H cells overexpressed BCRP but not epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA. Ten micromoles of gefitinib reversed topotecan , SN-38 , and mitoxantrone resistance , and increased the intracellular topotecan accumulation in the resistant cells but not in the parental cells . Furthermore, gefitinib inhibited the topotecan transport into the vesicles, and the K(i) value was 1.01 +/- 0.09 micromol/L in the Dixon plot analysis, indicating direct inhibition of BCRP by gefitinib. However, gefitinib was not transported into the vesicles with the high-performance liquid chromatography method. These results indicate that gefitinib reverses BCRP-mediated drug resistance by direct inhibition other than competitive inhibition as a BCRP substrate. Combination of gefitinib and topoisomerase I inhibitors could be clinically effective in cancers expressing BCRP.sentence: Ten micromoles of gefitinib reversed topotecan , SN-38 , and mitoxantrone resistance , and increased the intracellular topotecan accumulation in the resistant cells but not in the parental cells .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

We train models with the above architecture changes and compare them on FID, evaluated at two different points of training, in Table 1. Aside from rescaling residual connections, all of the other modifications improve performance and have a positive compounding effect. We observe in Figure 2 that while increased depth helps performance, it increases training time and takes longer to reach the same performance as a wider model, so we opt not to use this change in further experiments. Table 4 also shows that classifier guidance improves precision at the cost of recall, thus introducing a trade-off in sample fidelity versus diversity. We explicitly evaluate how this trade-off varies with the gradient scale in Figure 4. We see that scaling the gradients beyond 1.0 smoothly trades off recall (a measure of diversity) for higher precision and IS (measures of fidelity). Since FID and sFID depend on both diversity and fidelity, their best values are obtained at an intermediate point. We also compare our guidance with the truncation trick from BigGAN in Figure 5. We find that classifier guidance is strictly better than BigGAN-deep when trading off FID for Inception Score. Less clear cut is the precision/recall trade-off, which shows that classifier guidance is only a better choice up until a certain precision threshold, after which point it cannot achieve better precision. Table 5 summarizes our results. Our diffusion models can obtain the best FID on each task, and the best sFID on all but one task. With the improved architecture, we already obtain state-of-the-art image generation on LSUN and ImageNet 64times64. For higher resolution ImageNet, we observe that classifier guidance allows our models to substantially outperform the best GANs. These models obtain perceptual quality similar to GANs, while maintaining a higher coverage of the distribution as measured by recall, and can even do so using only 25 diffusion steps. We also compare guidance to using a two-stage upsampling stack. Nichol and Dhariwal [43] and Saharia et al. [53] train two-stage diffusion models by combining a low-resolution diffusion model with a corresponding upsampling diffusion model. In this approach, the upsampling model is trained to upsample images from the training set, and conditions on low-resolution images that are concatenated channel-wise to the model input using a simple interpolation (e.g. bilinear). During sampling, the low-resolution model produces a sample, and then the upsampling model is conditioned on this sample. This greatly improves FID on ImageNet 256times256, but does not reach the same performance as state-of-the-art models like BigGAN-deep Nichol and Dhariwal (2021); Saharia et al. (2021), as seen in Table 5. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief background of diffusion models based on Ho et al. [25] and the improvements from Nichol and Dhariwal [43] and Song et al. [57], and we describe our evaluation setup. In Section 3, we introduce simple architecture improvements that give a substantial boost to FID. In Section 4, we describe a method for using gradients from a classifier to guide a diffusion model during sampling. We find that a single hyperparameter, the scale of the classifier gradients, can be tuned to trade off diversity for fidelity, and we can increase this gradient scale factor by an order of magnitude without obtaining adversarial examples Szegedy et al. (2013).Finally, in Section 5 we show that models with our improved architecture achieve state-of-the-art on unconditional image synthesis tasks, and with classifier guidance achieve state-of-the-art on conditional image synthesis. When using classifier guidance, we find that we can sample with as few as 25 forward passes while maintaining FIDs comparable to BigGAN. We also compare our improved models to upsampling stacks, finding that the two approaches give complementary improvements and that combining them gives the best results on ImageNet 256times256 and 512times512.Question: What are the FID values achieved by authors using Diffusion Model on ImageNet?","answer":"They obtain state-of-the-art image generation on ImageNet 64×64.

Visualization of central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with modern PET or SPECT imaging techniques has been hampered by the lack of a radioligand with suitable in vivo binding characteristics (i.e., high target-to-nontarget ratios and kinetics appropriate for the half-life of the tracer and imaging modality used). This paper describes in vivo binding, kinetics and pharmacology of a highly potent 18F-labeled analog of epibatidine, (+/-)-exo-2-(2-[18F]fluoro-5-pyridyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ([18F]FPH), in the mouse brain with the view towards application of this tracer for PET imaging of nAChR in human brain.  methods Fluorine-18-FPH was administered intravenously to mice, and time-activity curves were determined for several regions in the brain and other organs. Saturation and pharmacology of [18F]FPH binding was demonstrated in vivo by preinjecting unlabeled FPH or other drugs with known pharmacological action before [18F]FPH was injected. The effect of the drugs on [18F]FPH accumulation was evaluated.  results [18F]FPH was rapidly incorporated into the mouse brain; peak activity (2.4% of the injected dose) was measured at 5 min after intravenous administration, followed by washout to 1.1% injected dose (ID) at 60 min. Highest concentrations of 18F occurred at 15 min in areas known to contain high densities of nAChR ¿e.g., thalamus [9.7% of injected dose per gram tissue (ID/g¿] and superior colliculus (8.3% ID/g)]. Accumulation of the 18F tracer in hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and cortical areas was intermediate (5.0, 5.6, 4.2 and 5.6% ID/g, respectively) and low in the cerebellum (2.8% ID/g). The distribution of [18F]FPH in the mouse brain matched that of other in vivo nAChR probes such as 3H-labeled epibatidine or norchloroepibatidine, [3H](-)-nicotine and [3H]cytisine and that of nAChR densities determined in postmortem autoradiographic studies in rodents. Preinjection of blocking doses of unlabeled epibatidine , (-)-nicotine , lobeline and cytisine significantly inhibited [18F]FPH binding in thalamus and superior colliculus , but not in cerebellum , whereas drugs that interact with binding sites other than acetylcholine recognition sites of nAChR ( e.g. , mecamylamine , scopolamine , N-methylspiperone and ketanserin ) had no effect on [18F]FPH accumulation in any of the brain regions examined .  conclusion Fluorine-18-FPH labels nAChR in vivo in the mouse brain. Because of its high uptake into the brain and high ratios of specific-to-nonspecific binding, this radioligand appears to be ideally suited for PET imaging of nAChR in the mammalian brain.sentence: Preinjection of blocking doses of unlabeled epibatidine , (-)-nicotine , lobeline and cytisine significantly inhibited [18F]FPH binding in thalamus and superior colliculus , but not in cerebellum , whereas drugs that interact with binding sites other than acetylcholine recognition sites of nAChR ( e.g. , mecamylamine , scopolamine , N-methylspiperone and ketanserin ) had no effect on [18F]FPH accumulation in any of the brain regions examined .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

determined rate , locally or systemically , for a stipulated period of time .controlled drug delivery systems may incorporate the maintenance of drug levels within a desired therapeutic range , the need of less number of administrations , optimal use of the required drug and yet possibility of enhanced patient compliance .the quintessential drug delivery should be not only inert , biocompatible , but also at the same time provide patient compliance , capable of attaining high drug loading .however , it should also have preventive measures for the accidental release of drug and at the same time it should be simple to administer and to remove from the body . controlled release drug delivery involves drug - encapsulating devices from which drug or therapeutic compounds may be released at controlled rates for prolonged span of time .+ while many old and new therapeutics are well tolerated , numerous compounds are in requirement of localized advanced drug delivery technologies to reduce toxicity level , enhance therapeutic efficacy and potentially recast bio - distribution .local drug delivery is the manifestation of drug delivery in which drugs are delivered at a specific site inside the body to a particular diseased organ or tissue .though the drug delivery , in principle , may be monitored , but the most important hazard is that the design of drug delivery is unclear , which must be used to attain the level of control required for a specific purpose .this is because there exists complex interaction between biology , polymer chemistry and pharmacology @xcite .+ mathematical modelling of drug delivery and predictability of drug release is a steadily growing field with respect to its importance in academic and industrial areas due to its astronomic future potential . in the light of drug dose to be incorporated in desired drug administration and targeted drug release profile, mathematical prognosis will allow for good estimates of the required composition along with other requirements of the respective drug dosage forms .an extremely challenging aspect is to combine mathematical theories with models quantifying the release and transport of drug in living tissues and cells .various works are done in the past on drug delivery devices regarding its therapeutic efficiency , optimal design with the aid of either experimental methods or numerical / modelling simulations and sometimes both procedures are used @xcite .the investigation in which drug association / dissociation aspect is taken into account with regard to transdermal drug delivery @xcite while in another study , drug release process from a microparticle is considered based on solubilisation dynamics of the drug @xcite .very recently , the updated mathematical model considering both the above mentioned aspects is framed and analysed successfully @xcite .+ the study of concern is presented by a phenomenological mathematical model of drug release from a local drug delivery device and its subsequent transport to the biological tissue .the model is comprised of two - phase drug release where the drug undergoes solubilisation , recrystallisation and internalization through a porous membrane .an important aspect of the aforementioned model is appropriate judgement of the model parameters of significance such as diffusion coefficient , solid - liquid transfer rate , mass - transfer , drug association / dissociation rate constants , membrane permeability and internalization rate constant .the numerical simulation provides reliable information on different properties of drug release kinetics .to model the local drug delivery device , a two - phase system is considered which is made of : ( a ) a polymeric matrix that operates as a reservoir where the drug is loaded initially , and ( b ) the biological tissue where the drug is being transported as target region . the first phase i.e the drug delivery device is framed as a planar slab , encompassed on one side with an impermeable backing and the other side of the device is in contact with layer ( b ) .a rate - controlling membrane protecting the polymeric matrix is present at the interface of the coupled layers .+      at the beginning , the drug occurs completely in a solid phase embraced within the polymeric matrix ( e.g. in crystalline form ) ( @xmath0 ) at its maximum concentration .being in bound state , it can not be transferred to the tissues directly .water enters into the polymeric matrix and wets the drug encapsulated inside it , permitting solubilisation of the loaded drug crystals into free state ( @xmath1 ) which diffuses out of the matrix into the tissue .the rate of transfer of drug from solid state to free state depends not only on solubilisation phenomenon but is also proportional to the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .again , a fraction of solid drug ( @xmath2 ) is transformed to its free state which is competent to diffuse .conversely , through a recrystallisation process , another fraction of free drug ( @xmath3 ) is transferred back to its bound state .simultaneously , a part of free drug ( @xmath4 ) diffuses into the tissue . in the similar way , in tissue , a portion of free drug ( @xmath5 ) is metabolised into bound phase ( @xmath6 ) , which also unbinds ( @xmath7 ) to form free drug .now , the bound drug is engulfed ( internalized ) ( @xmath8 ) by the cell in the tissue through the process of endocytosis .endocytosis is an active energy - using transport phenomenon in which molecules ( proteins , drugs etc . )are transported into the cell .thus , bound drug gets transformed into internalized drug particles ( @xmath9 ) .these internalized drug particles , after a span of time , gets degraded by the lysosomes and the drug remnants after degradation ( @xmath10 ) is expelled out of the cell into the extracellular fluid . the complete drug transport process is schematically demonstrated in fig . 1.     schematic diagram of drug transport , width=529,height=113 ]generally , mass transport prevails in the direction normal to the tissue which may be the reason behind the modelling restriction confined to one - dimensional case . in the present study , x- axis is considered to be normal to the layer and aligned with the positive direction outwards .+      the governing equations describing the dynamics of drug release in the polymeric matrix phase are @xmath11 where , @xmath12 is the ratio of accessible void volume to solid volume , @xmath13 denotes available molar concentration of solid drug , @xmath1 is the available molar concentration of free drug , @xmath14 stands for partition coefficient , @xmath15 denotes porosity , @xmath16 is the length of the polymeric matrix , @xmath17 is mass transfer coefficient , @xmath18 stands for drug solubilisation limit , @xmath19 is the dissociation rate constant , @xmath20 is the association rate constant , @xmath21 denotes solid - liquid rate parameter .@xmath22 is the diffusion coefficient of free drug in the matrix .+      the corresponding equations governing the dynamics of drug in the tissue are @xmath23 where , @xmath4 is the available molar concentration of free drug in the tissue , @xmath24 is the available molar concentration of solid drug in the tissue , @xmath9 denotes the molar concentration of internalized drug particles , @xmath25 is the length of the tissue , @xmath26 depicts the binding rate coefficient , @xmath27 is the dissociation rate coefficient , @xmath28 stands for internalization rate coefficient , @xmath29 denotes degradation rate constant in the lysosome , and @xmath30 is the diffusion coefficient of free drug in the biological tissue .the initial conditions are as follows : + @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . + a flux continuity must be assigned at the interface , i.e at @xmath36 , @xmath37 .+ no mass flux can pass to exterior environment due to the presence of impermeable backing and hence no flux condition arises . at @xmath38 , @xmath39 .+ lastly , at @xmath40 , @xmath41 is considered to be finite .for the purpose of reducing the number of model parameters , the entire above - mentioned equations together with all the conditions are made dimensionless .the transformed equations subject to the conditions in dimensionless approach are solved analytically by separation of variables procedure .thus , the solutions should be read as + @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 ] ] @xmath45+e^{-(alpha_0phi_0+beta_0)t} ] ] @xmath46    @xmath47 ] ]    @xmath48    @xmath49 ] ]    where , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are arbitrary constants to be determined from the prevailing conditions , @xmath52 and , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are any positive real numbers . + all the parameters and the variables are expressed in dimensionless form whose expressions are not included here for the sake of brevity .numerical illustration for the present drug release system is performed by taking various parameter values of the model in order to characterise the pharmacokinetic aspects .the graphical representations of the time - variant concentration profiles of the drug in its different states for both the facets are well illustrated through the figs .2 - 6 in order to understand the drug release phenomenon .+ the time - variant concentration profiles for solid ( loaded ) and free drug particles in the polymeric matrix phase for four different axial locations spread over the entire domain are demonstrated in figs. 2 and 3 .     time variant concentration profile of @xmath1 at different locations.,width=288 ]     time variant concentration profile of @xmath1 at different locations.,width=288 ]    the rate of decrease of concentration of loaded drug ( @xmath0 ) becomes higher and higher as one proceeds away from the commencing region of the polymeric matrix to the interface resulting in early disappearance .when the loaded drug gets exposed to water , a solid -

6 represent the time - variant concentration profiles for free , bound and internalized drug particles respectively in the biological tissue for different axial locations stretched over the entire domain .it is important to observe that @xmath4 heightens hastily compared to both @xmath6 and @xmath9 towards the inception .this observation , as anticipated , reflects in the realm of drug kinetics that free drug ( @xmath4 ) gets transformed into bound drug ( @xmath6 ) and subsequently the bound drug is metabolised into internalized drug ( @xmath9 ) after a short passage of time .ultimately , it is further noted that the internalized drug takes more time to get absorbed completely in the tissue than the characteristics of both bound and free drug particles .in addition to the present findings , one may append that the extended time span distinctly reveals that both loaded and free drug particles in polymeric matrix melt away in a comparatively small span of time than those in the tissue where they need to take time lengthened to get the drug absorbed completely .+ one may also explore a variety of cases in order to exhibit the behaviour of the concentration profiles for both the phases under present consideration by varying all the parameter values of significance .the sensitivity of the model parameters imply the need of the components to be included in the model formation for future course of studies relevant to this domain .the sensitivity of the model parameters poses challenges to the applicability of drug administration for treatment of patients at large through pharmacotherapy .one may highlight that as both loaded and free drug particles in polymeric matrix melt away in comparatively small span of time than those in the tissue , its influence will certainly persist for a long time before repeated medication occurs and hence care needs to be exercised for maintaining appropriate time - gap before redispensation in order to avoid toxicity by the presence of excess drug .8 siepmann j and siepmann f 2008 _ int ._ b * 364(2 ) * 328 siepmann j and gopferich a 2001 _ adv .drug delivery rev . _ * 48 * 229 crane m , hurley n j , crane l , healy a m , corrigan o i , gallagher k m and mccarthy l g 2004 _ simul . model .pract . & theory _ * 12(2 ) * 147 narasimhan b 2001 _ adv .drug delivery rev . _* 48 * 195 bozsak f , chomaz j m and barakat a i 2014 _ biomech . model .mechanobiol . _ * 13(2 ) * 327 pontrelli g and monte f 2014 _ mathematical biosciences _ * 257 * 96 casalini t , rossi f , lazzari s , perale g and masi m 2014 _ mol .pharmaceutics _ * 11 * 4036 chakravarty k and dalal d c 2016 _ mathematical biosciences _ * 272 * 24","answer":"local drug delivery has received much recognition in recent years , yet it is still unpredictable how drug efficacy depends on physicochemical properties and delivery kinetics .  the purpose of the current study is to provide a useful mathematical model for drug release from a drug delivery device and consecutive drug transport in biological tissue , thereby aiding the development of new therapeutic drug by a systemic approach . in order to study the complete process ,  a two -

These thrombin derivatives are cleaved at the Leu144-Gly150 loop and at the fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), respectively. A phenomenological analysis of thermodynamic data showed that the amide substrates and p-ABZ interactions with zeta-thrombin were respectively, associated with a chemical compensation (i.e. the linear relationship between entropy and enthalpy of binding) and a hydrophobic phenomenon (i.e. a change in the standard heat capacity). The latter was slightly lower than that previously observed for a alpha-thrombin (0.78 +/- 0.25 versus 1.01 +/- 0.17 kcal/mol K). Both phenomenon were absent in gamma T-thrombin. The interaction of a alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin with macromolecular substrates that \\"bridge-bind\\" to both the catalytic site (CS) and fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), such as fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor (CPR), was also evaluated. These interactions were studied by following fibrinopeptide A (FpA) release and by measuring intraplatelet Ca2+ changes induced by thrombin-CPR interaction. It was found that the free energy of activation (RT ln Kcat/Km) for both fibrinogen and CPR hydrolysis followed the same hierarchy, i.e. alpha > zeta > gamma. Moreover, the values of delta Cp for alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin interaction with p-ABZ were found to be linearly correlated to the free energy of activation for both fibrinogen and CPR cleavage. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that: (1) the Leu144-Gly150 loop and the FRS are both involved in the conformational transition linked to the binding of p-aminobenzamidine to the thrombin active site; (2) the extent of thrombin's capacity to undergo conformational transitions in alpha-, zeta- and gamma T forms is positively correlated to the free energy of activation for hydrolysis of macromolecular substrates interacting with both the catalytic domain and the FRS.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"proflavin\\", \\"p-aminobenzamidine\\", \\"amide\\", \\"p-ABZ\\", \\"Ca2+\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"human thrombin\\", \\"alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin\\", \\"CPR\\", \\"thrombinu0027s\\", \\"FRS\\", \\"fibrinogen recognition exosite\\", \\"cleavable platelet receptor\\", \\"fibrinopeptide A\\", \\"FpA\\", \\"thrombin\\", \\"zeta-thrombin\\", \\"alpha-thrombin\\", \\"zeta- and gamma T-thrombin\\", \\"fibrinogen\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  From the Publisher: ::: Routinely collected sensor data provide the first level of information for use in ensuring the optimal and safe operation of manufacturing plants. However, these numerical observations are seldom consistent, as they may be corrupted by measurement errors as well as by random and gross errors regardless of how well the instrumentation system is designed and operated. Erroneous data may compromise plant safety and lead to off-specification production. ::: Although the reconciliation of process data has been studied for more than 20 years, Data Processing and Reconciliation for Chemical Process Operations provides the first unified treatment of this important subject. An introduction to the modern literature is presented together with in-depth coverage of the relevant theory of data reconciliation. The theory is illuminated by numerous examples from representative chemical processes, including detailed industrial case studies.Literature Review:","answer":"We are considering here the process of rejecting or accepting a single given model with the given data. Physico-chemical insight should be the first criterion to be used. Even a simple polynomial approximation assumes that the response variable fulfils continuity properties. However, this leads to the general question of model validation which also on the specific discipline, e.g. Murray-Smith  . Simple actions are: • Visual inspection of particular responses before and after fitting the data. The opinion of experts, or the response of knowledge management systems. • Degeneracy tests, i.e. defining limiting cases such as extremely high and low temperatures and simulate the model in those regions. • Comparison tests, where model simulations are contrasted to e.g. short-cut models. If we further assume, that the model at least fulfils its engineering purpose, there remain statistical measures to consider. Known measurement errors allow the well known χ 2 −test. Repeated measurements are the basis for the lack-of-fit test. Residuals can be tested whether they reject the assumed distribution, often the normal distribution. Measurements in time-series can be tested on independence between residuals such as applied in system identification BIB001 . In the last decade, it is becoming accepted practice to reconcile data BIB002 with the constraint that mass balances should always be fulfilled. This leads to better estimates at the measurement positions, but this process allows also for intermediate lack-of-fit testing, as the mass balance hypothesis can be tested as well. Ideally speaking, a model should be rejected when it fails one of the statistical tests. However, a model is often accepted in practice, especially when the alternatives are not much better. In that case, it should be realized that the statistic defined in eq. (1) has no statistical meaning, and is nothing more than a distance measure of equal footing with any other distance measure, especially the L 2 -norm."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Monoclonal antibodies against either monomorphic or polymorphic determinants of class I antigen induced in PBMC and highly purified T lymphocytes the nuclear activity of NF-kappa B / Rel complexes. These included both p50 / p50 and p50 / p65 dimers, recognized by specific antibodies in EMSA.

We used optogenetic approaches to test the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in the lithium-pilocarpine model of acute elicited seizures in awake behaving rats.This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures.We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research.Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.Therefore, one could optogenetically activate specific or a mixed population of interneurons and dissect their selective or concerted inhibitory action on principal cells. We chose to explore a conceptually novel strategy involving simultaneous activation of mixed populations of interneurons by optogenetics and study their impact on ongoing epileptiform activity in mouse acute hippocampal slices.Our data suggest that global optogenetic activation of mixed interneuron populations is a more effective approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, but the initial action potential generation in principal neurons needs to be taken in consideration.Recently, a number of experiments have explored the treatments for epilepsy with optogenetic control of neurons. Here, we discuss the possibility that an optogenetic approach could be used to control the release of gliotransmitters and improve astrocyte function such as glutamate and K(+) uptake, and thereby offer a potential strategy to investigate and treat astrocyte-related epilepsy.Optogenetic and designer receptor technologies provide unprecedented and much needed specificity, allowing for spatial, temporal and cell type-selective modulation of neuronal circuits. Using such tools, it is now possible to begin to address some of the fundamental unanswered questions in epilepsy, to dissect epileptic neuronal circuits and to develop new intervention strategies.We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research.Moreover, optogenetics may be considered for developing potential treatment strategies for brain diseases, particularly for excitability disorders such as epilepsy.This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures.How might novel technologies such as optogenetics lead to better treatments in epilepsy?WONOEP appraisal: optogenetic tools to suppress seizures and explore the mechanisms of epileptogenesis.Finally, optogenetic tools allow rapid and reversible suppression of epileptic electroencephalography (EEG) activity upon photoactivation.Our data suggest that epileptiform activity in the hippocampus caused by impaired inhibition may be controlled by optogenetic silencing of principal neurons and potentially can be developed as an alternative treatment for epilepsy.Seizure suppression by high frequency optogenetic stimulation using in vitro and in vivo animal models of epilepsy.Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.We first discuss the benefits and caveats to using optogenetic approaches and recent advances in optogenetics related tools.

One hundred twenty-eight participants quit smoking on a target date, after a 3-week period of (a) scheduled reduced smoking (progressive increase in the intercigarette interval), (b) nonscheduled reduced smoking (gradual reduction, no specific change in the intercigarette interval), (c) scheduled nonreduced smoking (fixed intercigarette interval, no reductions in frequency), or (c) nonscheduled nonreduced smoking (no change in intercigarette interval or smoking frequency). Participants also received cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention training. Abstinence at 1 year averaged 44%, 18%, 32%, and 22% for the 4 groups, respectively. Overall, the scheduled reduced group performed the best and the nonscheduled reduced group performed the worst. Both scheduled groups performed better than nonscheduled ones. Scheduled reduced smoking was associated with reduced tension, fatigue, urges to smoke, withdrawal symptoms, increased coping effort (ratio of coping behavior to urges), and self-efficacy, suggesting an improved adaptation to nonsmoking and reduced vulnerability to relapse.Title 2:Smoking cessation--gradual or sudden stopping?Abstract 2:One hundred ten patients addicted to nicotine were subjected to either sudden or gradual withdrawal in the course of a smoking cessation programme. Eighty-two patients emerged from the treatment as non-smokers. In a follow-up after 1 year 70% of these successful clients replied to an anonymous questionnaire. Concerning the relapse rate, no significant difference could be found between the two treatment groups, but patients who underwent slow withdrawal smoked significantly less when comparing their current consumption with that before the start of the therapy. Patients who underwent sudden stopping reached their original level of nicotine use again.Title 3:Format and quitting instructions as factors influencing the impact of a self-administered quit smoking program.Abstract 3:This article presents results from an experimental study designed to evaluate the effects of two features of self-help smoking cessation booklets, format (i.e., day-by-day plan for quitting versus a less structured menu format) and quitting instructions (i.e., \\"cold turkey\\" versus gradual reduction) on smoking cessation. Four separate self-help booklets were developed for comparison in this study. Each varied on a combination of the two study factors, but were similar in content, length, style, and readability. The four booklets provided similar advice on how to quit smoking, emphasizing behavioral self-management principles. In addition to the experimental booklets, a fifth control booklet provided general information about smoking and its adverse effects, but no specific advice on quitting. Study subjects included 1,534 adult cigarette smokers who called a stop smoking hotline in Buffalo, New York seeking information on how to quit. Subjects were followed up by phone one month and six months after enrollment to assess changes in smoking behavior. Overall, 18% of subjects reported of being off cigarettes for at least one week at the time of the six month follow-up interview. The format of the booklet and quitting instructions had no effect on smoking cessation rates. In addition, the four booklets emphasizing behavioral self-management skills were no more effective than the control booklet (6 month non-smoking prevalence rate: 17% versus 19%). It is recommended that future self-help quit smoking booklets include information aimed at motivating cessation and focus less attention on teaching strategies for quitting.Title 4:Nicotine gum treatment before smoking cessation: a randomized trial.Abstract 4:New ways of improving the efficacy of nicotine therapy need to be explored. We tested whether starting nicotine polacrilex gum treatment 4 weeks before the quit date improved smoking abstinence rates compared with starting treatment on the quit date.                An open randomized trial of 314 daily smokers (mean, 23.7 cigarettes/d) enrolled through the Internet and by physicians in Switzerland from November 2005 to January 2007. In the precessation treatment group, participants received nicotine polacrilex gum (4 mg, unflavored) by mail for 4 weeks before and 8 weeks after their target quit date, and they were instructed to decrease their cigarette consumption by half before quitting. In the usual care group, participants received the same nicotine gum for 8 weeks after their quit date and were instructed to quit abruptly. Instructions were limited to a booklet sent by mail and access to a smoking cessation Web site. Results are expressed as self-reported abstinence rates at the end of treatment and as biochemically verified smoking abstinence (cotinine plus carbon monoxide) after 12 months.                Eight weeks after the target quit date, self-reported 4-week abstinence rates were 41.6% in the precessation treatment group and 44.4% in the usual care group (P = .61). One year after the target quit date, biochemically verified 4-week smoking abstinence rates were 20.8% in the precessation treatment group and 19.4% in the usual care group (P = .76).                Starting nicotine gum treatment 4 weeks before the target quit date was no more effective than starting treatment on the quit date.Title 5:A comparison of alternative theoretical approaches to smoking cessation and relapse.Abstract 5:Two theoretical approaches to smoking cessation were compared. Participants were randomly assigned either to (a) a traditional treatment program that used contingency contracting and that emphasized the necessity for absolute abstinence (AA) or to (b) a relapse-prevention (RP) treatment that focused on gradual acquisition of nonsmoking skills. It was hypothesized that participants in the RP treatment would be less successful initially but would have better maintenance skills and thus would relapse less during a 1-year follow-up period. Each program was evaluated in two formats: group-based treatment and self-help materials. Results indicated comparable 1-year abstinence rates for all treatments, although more participants dropped out of the self-help formats. Participants in the RP intervention were more likely to lapse sooner after quitting and were more likely to quit again during the 1-year maintenance period. Exploratory analyses of successful participants suggested that women were more successful in the RP program and that men had greater success with the AA approach.Title 6:A randomized, controlled trial of NRT-aided gradual vs. abrupt cessation in smokers actively trying to quit.Abstract 6:Most smoking cessation programs advise abrupt rather than gradual cessation. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of gradual cessation (n=297) vs. abrupt cessation (n=299) vs. minimal treatment (n=150) among smokers who wanted to quit now and preferred to quit gradually. Participants were recruited via newspaper and radio advertisements. The gradual and abrupt conditions received five phone calls (total=90 min) and the minimal treatment condition received two calls (25 min total). The gradual condition received nicotine lozenge (via mail) to reduce smoking prior to their quit date. After the quit day, all participants received lozenge. The primary outcome was prolonged abstinence from 2 weeks post-quit day through 6 months. Prior to the quit day, the gradual condition decreased cigarettes/day by 54%, whereas the other two conditions decreased by 1% and 5%. Prolonged abstinence rates (CO<10 ppm) did not differ among gradual, abrupt and minimal treatment conditions (4%, 7% and 5%), nor did 7-day point prevalence rates (7%, 11% and 11%). Fewer smokers in the gradual condition (48%) made a quit attempt than in the abrupt (64%) or minimal (60%) conditions (p<.001). In the gradual condition, every week delay to the quit date increased the probability of lapsing by 19% (p<.001). We conclude that among smokers who want to stop gradually in the near future, gradual cessation with nicotine pre-treatment does not produce higher quit rates than abrupt cessation. One liability of gradual reduction may be that it allows smokers to delay their quit date.                Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Reduction interventions can be carried out using self-help materials or aided by behavioural support, and can be carried out with the aid of pre-quit NRT. Further research needs to investigate which method of reduction before quitting is the most effective, and which categories of smokers benefit the most from each method, to inform future policy and intervention development."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The fast temporal-dynamics and intrinsic motion segmentation of event-based cameras are beneficial for robotic tasks that require low-latency visual tracking and control, for example a robot catching a ball. When the event-driven iCub humanoid robot grasps an object its head and torso move, inducing camera motion, and tracked objects become no longer trivially segmented amongst the mass of background clutter. Current event-based tracking algorithms have mostly considered stationary cameras that have clean event-streams with minimal clutter. This paper introduces novel methods to extend the Hough-based circle detection algorithm using optical flow information that is readily extracted from the spatio-temporal event space. Results indicate the proposed directed-Hough algorithm is more robust to other moving objects and the background event-clutter. Finally, we demonstrate successful on-line robot control and gaze following on the iCub robot. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Event cameras are a new technology that can enable low-latency, fast visual sensing in dynamic environments towards faster robotic vision as they respond only to changes in the scene and have a very high temporal resolution (< 1μs). Moving targets produce dense spatio-temporal streams of events that do not suffer from information loss “between frames”, which can occur when traditional cameras are used to track fast-moving targets. Event-based tracking algorithms need to be able to follow the target position within the spatio-temporal data, while rejecting clutter events that occur as a robot moves in a typical office setting. We introduce a particle filter with the aim to be robust to temporal variation that occurs as the camera and the target move with different relative velocities, which can lead to a loss in visual information and missed detections. The proposed system provides a more persistent tracking compared to prior state-of-the-art, especially when the robot is actively following a target with its gaze. Experiments are performed on the iCub humanoid robot performing ball tracking and gaze following. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Unlike standard cameras that send intensity images at a constant frame rate, event-driven cameras asynchronously report pixel-level brightness changes, offering low latency and high temporal resolution (both in the order of micro-seconds). As such, they have great potential for fast and low power vision algorithms for robots. Visual tracking, for example, is easily achieved even for very fast stimuli, as only moving objects cause brightness changes. However, cameras mounted on a moving robot are typically non-stationary and the same tracking problem becomes confounded by background clutter events due to the robot ego-motion. In this paper, we propose a method for segmenting the motion of an independently moving object for event-driven cameras. Our method detects and tracks corners in the event stream and learns the statistics of their motion as a function of the robot's joint velocities when no independently moving objects are present. During robot operation, independently moving objects are identified by discrepancies between the predicted corner velocities from ego-motion and the measured corner velocities. We validate the algorithm on data collected from the neuromorphic iCub robot. We achieve a precision of ~ 90 % and show that the method is robust to changes in speed of both the head and the target. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  We present an algorithm to estimate the rotational motion of an event camera. In contrast to traditional cameras, which produce images at a fixed rate, event cameras have independent pixels that respond asynchronously to brightness changes, with microsecond resolution. Our method leverages the type of information conveyed by these novel sensors (i.e., edges) to directly estimate the angular velocity of the camera, without requiring optical flow or image intensity estimation. The core of the method is a contrast maximization design. The method performs favorably against ground truth data and gyroscopic measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit, even in the presence of very high-speed motions (close to 1000 deg/s). 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  We present an algorithm (SOFAS) to estimate the optical flow of events generated by a dynamic vision sensor (DVS). Where traditional cameras produce frames at a fixed rate, DVSs produce asynchronous events in response to intensity changes with a high temporal resolution. Our algorithm uses the fact that events are generated by edges in the scene to not only estimate the optical flow but also to simultaneously segment the image into objects which are travelling at the same velocity. This way it is able to avoid the aperture problem which affects other implementations such as Lucas-Kanade. Finally, we show that SOFAS produces more accurate results than traditional optic flow algorithms. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Event-based vision sensors, such as the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), are ideally suited for real-time motion analysis. The unique properties encompassed in the readings of such sensors provide high temporal resolution, superior sensitivity to light and low latency. These properties provide the grounds to estimate motion efficiently and reliably in the most sophisticated scenarios, but these advantages come at a price - modern event-based vision sensors have extremely low resolution, produce a lot of noise and require the development of novel algorithms to handle the asynchronous event stream. This paper presents a new, efficient approach to object tracking with asynchronous cameras. We present a novel event stream representation which enables us to utilize information about the dynamic (temporal)component of the event stream. The 3D geometry of the event stream is approximated with a parametric model to motion-compensate for the camera (without feature tracking or explicit optical flow computation), and then moving objects that don't conform to the model are detected in an iterative process. We demonstrate our framework on the task of independent motion detection and tracking, where we use the temporal model inconsistencies to locate differently moving objects in challenging situations of very fast motion. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  We present the first event-based learning approach for motion segmentation in indoor scenes and the first event-based dataset - EV-IMO - which includes accurate pixel-wise motion masks, egomotion and ground truth depth. Our approach is based on an efficient implementation of the SfM learning pipeline using a low parameter neural network architecture on event data. In addition to camera egomotion and a dense depth map, the network estimates pixel-wise independently moving object segmentation and computes per-object 3D translational velocities for moving objects. We also train a shallow network with just 40k parameters, which is able to compute depth and egomotion. ::: Our EV-IMO dataset features 32 minutes of indoor recording with up to 3 fast moving objects simultaneously in the camera field of view. The objects and the camera are tracked by the VICON motion capture system. By 3D scanning the room and the objects, accurate depth map ground truth and pixel-wise object masks are obtained, which are reliable even in poor lighting conditions and during fast motion. We then train and evaluate our learning pipeline on EV-IMO and demonstrate that our approach far surpasses its rivals and is well suited for scene constrained robotics applications. 8. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB008):  In contrast to traditional cameras, whose pixels have a common exposure time, event-based cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors whose pixels work independently and asynchronously output intensity changes (called \\"events\\"), with microsecond resolution. Since events are caused by the apparent motion of objects, event-based cameras sample visual information based on the scene dynamics and are, therefore, a more natural fit than traditional cameras to acquire motion, especially at high speeds, where traditional cameras suffer from motion blur. However, distinguishing between events caused by different moving objects and by the camera's ego-motion is a challenging task. We present the first per-event segmentation method for splitting a scene into independently moving objects. Our method jointly estimates the event-object associations (i.e., segmentation) and the motion parameters of the objects (or the background) by maximization of an objective function, which builds upon recent results on event-based motion-compensation. We provide a thorough evaluation of our method on a public dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by as much as 10%. We also show the first quantitative evaluation of a segmentation algorithm for event cameras, yielding around 90% accuracy at 4 pixels relative displacement.Literature Review:","answer":"In Section 4.1 we distinguished between two scenarios: static or moving camera. In case of a static camera BIB001 , events are caused by moving objects, hence, segmentation of such objects is trivial: it reduces to object detection by event activity. In this section, we review object segmentation in its non-trivial form: in the presence of event clutter, which is typically imputable to the apparent motion of the background due to the moving camera. Thus, events are caused by both, objects of interest as well as clutter, and the goal is to infer this classification for each event. BIB001 . We also assume constant illumination. The work in BIB002 presents a method to detect and track a circle in the presence of event clutter caused by the moving camera. It is based on the Hough transform using optical flow information extracted from temporal windows of events. The method was extended in BIB003 using a particle filter to improve tracking robustness: the duration of the observation window was dynamically selected to accommodate for sudden motion changes due to accelerations of the object. Segmentation of an independently moving object with respect to event clutter was also addressed in BIB004 . It considered more generic object types by detecting and tracking event corners as primitives; and it used a learning technique to separate events caused by camera motion from those due to the object, based on additional knowledge of the robot joints controlling the camera. Segmentation has also been addressed by exploiting the idea of motion-compensated (i.e., sharp) event images BIB005 . The method in BIB006 simultaneously estimates optical flow and segments the scene into objects that travel with distinct velocities. Thus, it clusters events according to optical flow, yielding motion-corrected images with sharp object contours. Similarly, BIB007 detects moving objects in clutter by fitting a motion-correction model to the dominant events (i.e., the background) and detecting inconsistencies with respect to that motion (i.e., the objects). They test their method in challenging scenarios inaccessible to standard cameras (HDR, high-speed) and release their dataset.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  This paper describes the first results on a sensor floor, which can be integrated in home environments to assist old and frail persons living independently at home. The sensor floor works with a dense array of piezo elements. Its purpose is not only to monitor the inhabitant's position within the room but also to analyze impact patterns for later activation of stable rescue procedures in case of fall or other emergency events. Algorithms were developed to gain information on steps of persons in the room from the piezo impulses. The sensors are invisibly integrated in the room's floor, which is part of a living lab (the Future Care Lab) developed and built within the eHealth project at RWTH Aachen University. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Footstep recognition is a relatively new biometric which aims to discriminate people using walking characteristics extracted from floor-based sensors. This paper reports for the first time a comparative assessment of the spatiotemporal information contained in the footstep signals for person recognition. Experiments are carried out on the largest footstep database collected to date, with almost 20,000 valid footstep signals and more than 120 people. Results show very similar performance for both spatial and temporal approaches (5 to 15 percent EER depending on the experimental setup), and a significant improvement is achieved for their fusion (2.5 to 10 percent EER). The assessment protocol is focused on the influence of the quantity of data used in the reference models, which serves to simulate conditions of different potential applications such as smart homes or security access scenarios.Literature Review:","answer":"In the systems based on this technique, sensors are place along the floor on the so called -force platforms‖ or instrumented walkways where gait is measured by pressure or force sensors and moment transducers when the subject walks on them. There are two types of floor sensors: force platforms and pressure measurement systems. Force platforms should be distinguished from pressure measurement systems which, although they too quantify the centre of pressure, do not directly measure the force vector applied. Pressure measurement systems are useful for quantifying the pressure patterns under a foot over time but cannot quantify horizontal or shear components of the applied forces [46] . An example of an instrumented floor sensor and the acquired data from a research conducted in University of Southampton is depicted in Figure 4 . The characteristic that distinguishes FS-based systems from IP-based systems is the analysis of force transmitted to the floor when walking, known as Ground Reaction Force (GRF). This type of system is used in many gait analysis studies BIB001 BIB002 . In BIB003 , a comparative assessment of the spatiotemporal information contained in the footstep signals for person recognition was performed analysing almost 20,000 valid footstep signals. These devices are the most basic ones that can be used to obtain a general idea of the gait problems patients may have. Since the reaction force is exactly the opposite of the initial force (Newton's third law), the specialist finds out the evolution of the foot's pressure on the floor in real time. These data, added to the previous comparison, help specialist to make diagnoses. Pressure is given in percentage of weight in order to compare the patients' data. Pressure varies during the time the foot is in contact with the floor. The maximum pressure occurs when the heel touches the floor and when the toes push off to take another step. During this time, pressure may reach up to 120%-150% of the patient's body weight. The most complex systems have a sensor matrix (up to four sensors per cm² ) which makes it possible to measure the differentiated pressure of each zone of the foot separately over time to obtain more significant information on the patient's ailment.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a large scale human annotated real-world QA dataset WebQA with more than 42k questions and 556k evidences. As existing neural QA methods resolve QA either as sequence generation or classification/ranking problem, they face challenges of expensive softmax computation, unseen answers handling or separate candidate answer generation component. In this work, we cast neural QA as a sequence labeling problem and propose an end-to-end sequence labeling model, which overcomes all the above challenges. Experimental results on WebQA show that our model outperforms the baselines significantly with an F1 score of 74.69% with word-based input, and the performance drops only 3.72 F1 points with more challenging character-based input.IntroductionQuestion answering (QA) with neural network, i.e. neural QA, is an active research direction along the road towards the long-term AI goal of building general dialogue agents BIBREF0 . Unlike conventional methods, neural QA does not rely on feature engineering and is (at least nearly) end-to-end trainable. It reduces the requirement for domain specific knowledge significantly and makes domain adaption easier. Therefore, it has attracted intensive attention in recent years.Resolving QA problem requires several fundamental abilities including reasoning, memorization, etc. Various neural methods have been proposed to improve such abilities, including neural tensor networks BIBREF1 , recursive networks BIBREF2 , convolution neural networks BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , attention models BIBREF6 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF7 , and memories BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , etc. These methods achieve promising results on various datasets, which demonstrates the high potential of neural QA. However, we believe there are still two major challenges for neural QA:System development and/or evaluation on real-world data: Although several high quality and well-designed QA datasets have been proposed in recent years, there are still problems about using them to develop and/or evaluate QA system under real-world settings due to data size and the way they are created. For example, bAbI BIBREF0 and the 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus BIBREF13 are artificially synthesized; the TREC datasets BIBREF14 , Free917 BIBREF15 and WebQuestions BIBREF16 are human generated but only have few thousands of questions; SimpleQuestions BIBREF11 and the CNN and Daily Mail news datasets BIBREF6 are large but generated under controlled conditions. Thus, a new large-scale real-world QA dataset is needed.A new design choice for answer production besides sequence generation and classification/ranking: Without loss of generality, the methods used for producing answers in existing neural QA works can be roughly categorized into the sequence generation type and the classification/ranking type. The former generates answers word by word, e.g. BIBREF0 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF6 . As it generally involves INLINEFORM0 computation over a large vocabulary, the computational cost is remarkably high and it is hard to produce answers with out-of-vocabulary word. The latter produces answers by classification over a predefined set of answers, e.g. BIBREF12 , or ranking given candidates by model score, e.g. BIBREF5 . Although it generally has lower computational cost than the former, it either also has difficulties in handling unseen answers or requires an extra candidate generating component which is hard for end-to-end training. Above all, we need a new design choice for answer production that is both computationally effective and capable of handling unseen words/answers.In this work, we address the above two challenges by a new dataset and a new neural QA model. Our contributions are two-fold:Experimental results show that our model outperforms baselines with a large margin on the WebQA dataset, indicating that it is effective. Furthermore, our model even achieves an F1 score of 70.97% on character-based input, which is comparable with the 74.69% F1 score on word-based input, demonstrating that our model is robust.OverviewFigure FIGREF4 shows the structure of our model. The model consists of three components: (1) question LSTM for computing question representation; (2) evidence LSTMs for evidence analysis; and (3) a CRF layer for sequence labeling. The question LSTM in a form of a single layer LSTM equipped with a single time attention takes the question as input and generates the question representation INLINEFORM0 . The three-layer evidence LSTMs takes the evidence, question representation INLINEFORM1 and optional features as input and produces “features” for the CRF layer. The CRF layer takes the “features” as input and produces the label sequence. The details will be given in the following sections.Question LSTMThe question LSTM consists of a single-layer LSTM and a single-time attention model. The question INLINEFORM0 is fed into the LSTM to produce a sequence of vector representations INLINEFORM1 DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 is the embedding matrix and INLINEFORM1 is word embedding dimension. Then a weight INLINEFORM2 is computed by the single-time attention model for each INLINEFORM3 DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . And finally the weighted average INLINEFORM2 of INLINEFORM3 is used as the representation of the question DISPLAYFORM0 Sequence LabelingFollowing BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , we use CRF on top of evidence LSTMs for sequence labeling. The probability of a label sequence INLINEFORM0 given question INLINEFORM1 and evidence INLINEFORM2 is computed as DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 is the number of label types, INLINEFORM3 is the transition weight from label INLINEFORM4 to INLINEFORM5 , and INLINEFORM6 is the INLINEFORM7 -th value of vector INLINEFORM8 .WebQA DatasetIn order to train and evaluate open-domain factoid QA system for real-world questions, we build a new Chinese QA dataset named as WebQA. The dataset consists of tuples of (question, evidences, answer), which is similar to example in Figure FIGREF3 . All the questions, evidences and answers are collected from web. Table TABREF20 shows some statistics of the dataset.The questions and answers are mainly collected from a large community QA website Baidu Zhidao and a small portion are from hand collected web documents. Therefore, all these questions are indeed asked by real-world users in daily life instead of under controlled conditions. All the questions are of single-entity factoid type, which means (1) each question is a factoid question and (2) its answer involves only one entity (but may have multiple words). The question in Figure FIGREF3 is a positive example, while the question “Who are the children of Albert Enistein?” is a counter example because the answer involves three persons. The type and correctness of all the question answer pairs are verified by at least two annotators.All the evidences are retrieved from Internet by using a search engine with questions as queries. We download web pages returned in the first 3 result pages and take all the text pieces which have no more than 5 sentences and include at least one question word as candidate evidences. As evidence retrieval is beyond the scope of this work, we simply use TF-IDF values to re-rank these candidates.For each question in the training set, we provide the top 10 ranked evidences to annotate (“Annotated Evidence” in Table TABREF20 ). An evidence is annotated as positive if the question can be answered by just reading the evidence without any other prior knowledge, otherwise negative. Only evidences whose annotations are agreed by at least two annotators are retained. We also provide trivial negative evidences (“Retrieved Evidence” in Table TABREF20 ), i.e. evidences that do not contain golden standard answers.For each question in the validation and test sets, we provide one major positive evidence, and maybe an additional positive one to compute features. Both of them are annotated. Raw retrieved evidences are also provided for evaluation purpose (“Retrieved Evidence” in Table TABREF20 ).The dataset will be released on the project page http://idl.baidu.com/WebQA.html.Evaluation MethodThe performance is measured with precision (P), recall (R) and F1-measure (F1) DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 is the list of correctly answered questions, INLINEFORM1 is the list of produced answers, and INLINEFORM2 is the list of all questions .As WebQA is collected from web, the same answer may be expressed in different surface forms in the golden standard answer and the evidence, e.g. “北京 (Beijing)” v.s. “北京市 (Beijing province)”. Therefore, we use two ways to count correctly answered questions, which are referred to as “strict” and “fuzzy” in the tables:Strict matching: A question is counted if and only if the produced answer is identical to the golden standard answer;Fuzzy matching: A question is counted if and only if the produced answer is a synonym of the golden standard answer;And we also consider two evaluation settings:Annotated evidence: Each question has one major annotated evidence and maybe another annotated evidence for computing q-e.comm and e-e.comm features (Section SECREF14 );Retrieved evidence: Each question is provided with at most 20 automatically retrieved evidences (see Section SECREF5 for details). All the evidences will be processed by our model independently and answers are voted by frequency to decide the final result. Note that a large amount of the evidences are negative and our model should not produce any answer for them.Evaluation on the Entire WebQA DatasetIn this section, we evaluate our model on the entire WebQA dataset. The evaluation results are shown in Table TABREF24 . Although producing multi-word answers is harder, our model achieves comparable results with the one-word answer subset (Table TABREF23 ), demonstrating that our model is effective for both single-word and multi-word word settings.“Softmax” in Table TABREF24 means we replace CRF with INLINEFORM0 , i.e. replace Eq. ( EQREF19 ) with DISPLAYFORM0 CRF outperforms INLINEFORM0 significantly in all cases. The reason is that INLINEFORM1 predicts each label independently, suggesting that modeling label transition explicitly is essential for improving performance. A natural choice for modeling label transition in INLINEFORM2 is to take the last prediction into account as in BIBREF27 . The result is shown in Table TABREF24 as “Softmax( INLINEFORM3 -1)”. However, its performance is only comparable with “Softmax” and significantly lower than CRF. The reason is that we can enumerate all possible label sequences implicitly by dynamic programming for CRF during predicting but this is not possible for “Softmax( INLINEFORM4 -1)” , which indicates CRF is a better choice.“Noise” in Table TABREF24 means whether we inject noise data or not (Section SECREF34 ). As all evidences are positive under the annotated evidence setting, the ability for recognizing unreliable evidence will be useless. Therefore, the performance of our model with and without noise is comparable under the annotated evidence setting. However, the ability is important to improve the performance under the retrieved evidence setting because a large amount of the retrieved evidences are negative ones. As a result, we observe significant improvement by injecting noise data for this setting.Effect of q-e.comm and e-e.comm FeaturesAs shown in Table TABREF41 , both the q-e.comm and e-e.comm features are effective, and the q-e.comm feature contributes more to the overall performance. The reason is that the interaction between question and evidence is limited and q-e.comm feature with value 1, i.e. the corresponding word also occurs in the question, is a strong indication that the word may not be part of the answer.Effect of Question RepresentationsIn this section, we compare the single-time attention method for computing INLINEFORM0 ( INLINEFORM1 , Eq. ( EQREF12 , EQREF13 )) with two widely used options: element-wise max operation INLINEFORM2 : INLINEFORM3 and element-wise average operation INLINEFORM4 : INLINEFORM5 . Intuitively, INLINEFORM6 can distill information in a more flexible way from { INLINEFORM7 }, while INLINEFORM8 tends to hide the differences between them, and INLINEFORM9 lies between INLINEFORM10 and INLINEFORM11 . The results in Table TABREF41 suggest that the more flexible and selective the operation is, the better the performance is.Effect of Evidence LSTMs StructuresWe investigate the effect of evidence LSTMs layer number, layer width and cross layer links in this section. The results are shown in Figure TABREF46 . For fair comparison, we do not use cross layer links in Figure TABREF46 (a) (dotted lines in Figure FIGREF4 ), and highlight the results with cross layer links (layer width 64) with circle and square for retrieved and annotated evidence settings respectively. We can conclude that: (1) generally the deeper and wider the model is, the better the performance is; (2) cross layer links are effective as they make the third evidence LSTM layer see information in both directions.Conclusion and Future WorkIn this work, we build a new human annotated real-world QA dataset WebQA for developing and evaluating QA system on real-world QA data. We also propose a new end-to-end recurrent sequence labeling model for QA. Experimental results show that our model outperforms baselines significantly.There are several future directions we plan to pursue. First, multi-entity factoid and non-factoid QA are also interesting topics. Second, we plan to extend our model to multi-evidence cases. Finally, inspired by Residual Network BIBREF28 , we will investigate deeper and wider models in the future.Figure 1: Factoid QA as sequence labeling.Figure 2: Neural recurrent sequence labeling model for factoid QA. The model consists of three components: “Question LSTM” for computing question representation (rq), “Evidence LSTMs” for analyzing evidence, and “CRF” for producing label sequence which indicates whether each word in the evidence is at the beginning (B), inside (I) or outside (O) of the answer. Each word in the evidence is also equipped with two 0-1 features (see Section 3.4). We plot rq multiple times for clarity.Table 1: Statistics of WebQA dataset.Table 2: Comparison with baselines on the one-word answer subset of WebQA.Table 4: Effect of embedding initialization and training.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the most common enzymopathy of humans, affects over 400 million people. The geographical correlation of its distribution with the historical endemicity of malaria suggests that this disorder has risen in frequency through natural selection by malaria. However, attempts to confirm that G6PD deficiency is protective in case-control studies of malaria have yielded conflicting results. Hence, for this X-linked disorder, it is unclear whether both male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes are protected or, as frequently suggested, only females. Furthermore, how much protection may be afforded is unknown. Here we report that, in two large case-control studies of over 2, 000 African children, the common African form of G6PD deficiency (G6PD A-) is associated with a 46-58% reduction in risk of severe malaria for both female heterozygotes and male hemizygotes. A mathematical model incorporating the measured selective advantage against malaria suggests that a counterbalancing selective disadvantage, associated with this enzyme deficiency, has retarded its rise in frequency in malaria-endemic regions. Although G6PD deficiency is now regarded as a generally benign disorder, in earlier environmental conditions it could have been significantly disadvantageous..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"X-linked disorder\\", \\"G6PD A-\\", \\"enzyme deficiency\\", \\"enzymopathy\\", \\"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency\\", \\"malaria\\", \\"G6PD deficiency\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

This task encourages systems to learn rich relationships between scientific texts and to express them concretely in natural language. Models for citation text generation will require robust document understanding including the capacity to quickly adapt to new vocabulary and to reason about document content. We believe this challenging direction of research will benefit high-impact applications such as automatic literature review or scientific writing assistance systems. In this paper we establish the task of citation text generation with a standard evaluation corpus and explore several baseline models.IntroductionThe output of the world's scientists doubles roughly every nine years BIBREF0, and their pace is quickening. As a result, scientists and other experts must devote significant time to the difficult task of literature review, or coming to understand the context in which they work. Might artificial intelligence help to reduce that time?Several lines of research seek to do so. Citation recommendations systems BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3 suggest references to relevant published work for a given document such as a current draft. Summarization systems BIBREF4, BIBREF5 condense the information in one or more documents, allowing researchers to more quickly understand the basic ideas in a piece of research.We introduce a complementary—but so far unaddressed—problem, citation text generation, where the relationship between a document and one or several others is expressed in natural language text. This differs from traditional summarization in that the primary focus is explaining the relationship between the two documents rather than their content. Automatically describing inter-document relationships could dramatically decrease the time researchers devote to literature review. For instance, a new paper could be explained in terms of its relationships to relevant works that a particular reader is most familiar with, rather than just those which the authors elected to cite (personalization). Further, such technology could be incorporated into writing assistance systems to help less experienced or non-native writers better articulate the connection between their work and prior art. Additionally, users of citation recommendation systems can benefit from natural language explanations of recommendation system choices.Beyond the immediate utility of citation text generation systems, the task offers significant challenges for language understanding and generation research. A major challenge is how to represent the information in one or more scientific texts. These documents are longer than those in most other domains typically studied in NLP, and make use of a long-tailed, open-domain technical vocabulary. Often an important phrase in the citing sentence output occurs only in a specific cited document and not elsewhere in the corpus. This requires a model that can learn phrase meanings from very few exposures, an important but unsolved problem for text generation systems. Possibly more challenging is understanding and expressing the various and nuanced relationships between related scientific works.In this work, we introduce the task of citation text generation. Leveraging the full texts of English-language scientific articles, we construct a dataset of citation sentences in the computer science domain for training and evaluating citation text generation models. We investigate strong retrieval and neural baseline models against which future work can compare. For use cases where large models can be trained, we extend the successful GPT2 architecture BIBREF6 to the scientific domain with additional pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning on the citation generation task. We experiment with different kinds of document context in the fine-tuning and inference stages. We also explore retrieval-based techniques which may more easily generalize to lower-resource settings. These models retrieve citation sentences from training documents which are most similar to test inputs. Our evaluations show that these techniques often produce plausible citation sentences, but indicate clear directions for improvement. Code and artifacts are provided for future research.ModelsWe explore two basic styles of model for citation text generation. Following current work in neural text generation, we fine-tune the predictions of a large pre-trained language model to the citation text generation task. Additionally, we investigate approximate nearest neighbor methods to retrieve plausible human-authored citation sentences from the training data.Models ::: Neural Text GenerationRecent work has shown that adapting large pre-trained language models to text generation tasks yields strong results BIBREF8. Due to its widespread use in text generation, we investigate the GPT model of BIBREF6 for the citation text generation task. GPT2 is a transformer model trained on 40 gigabytes of internet text with a language modeling objective BIBREF9. The adaptation process, called fine-tuning, involves continued training of the model on the target objective, in our case citation text generation.To fine-tune GPT2 for text generation, it is typical to concatenate the conditioning context X = x_1 ldots x_n and citing sentence Y = y_1 ldots y_m with a special separator token mho . The model learns to approximate next token probabilities for each index after mho :for 0<i<m and model parameters theta . Cross-entropy loss is calculated for each y_i and backpropagation is used find parameters theta  which maximize p(y_{i+1} mid X,mho ,y_1,ldots ,y_i).To adapt Equation DISPLAY_FORM6 to the citation text generation task, we construct the conditioning context X from the source and cited documents. We take j tokens from source document s_1,ldots ,s_j along with k tokens from the cited document c_1,ldots ,c_k. (Which tokens are drawn from the two documents is an independent variable that we explore experimentally.) We then condition the generation of citing sentence Y on X = s_1,ldots ,s_j,mho ,c_1,ldots ,c_k. This model is trained to predict each token of Y as described above.Models ::: Language Model PretrainingGPT2-based models have demonstrated an ability to capture long distance dependencies over hundreds of tokens, which we hypothesize will allow them to synthesize information in both the source and cited documents. But citation text generation models must also handle the challenging technical vocabulary of the scientific domain.Prior work has shown that pretraining on in-domain data improves the performance of large language models on domain-specific tasks BIBREF11. Inspired by this, we experiment with additional pretraining of GPT2 in the science domain. This model, SciGPT2, is trained for an additional 3 epochs over the full text of the documents in our corpus using a language modeling objective. We note that both SciGPT2 and the SciBERT language models used here have been exposed to citing sentences from the test and validation sets as in-line citations during their pre-training phases, which may improve their performance versus models without this exposure. Such exposure is typical when using pretrained language models, as text from test data cannot be guaranteed to be absent from the large task-independent corpora upon which these models are trained.EvaluationWe compare the different baseline systems using BLEU BIBREF12, ROUGE (specifically ROUGE 1, 2, and L; BIBREF13), and the recently introduced BertScore BIBREF14, a similarity metric based on BERT embeddings which has been shown to correlate well with human judgements on other tasks. To adapt the BertScore metric to the scientific text domain, we use SciBERT embeddings.Table TABREF7 (above the double line) shows the performance of the SciGPT2 model on the test set when provided with the different input context combinations outlined in Section SECREF5. We find that context does make a difference for this category of model, and that models which have access to the intro of the documents outperform those which use abstracts or sampling.Automatic evaluation of the retrieval-based methods on the test data are shown below the double line in Table TABREF7. This table shows that the retrieval methods perform well on this task. However we will show the limitations of these automatic metrics in Section SECREF14. We also observe that tuning the alpha  and beta  parameters on the validation set results in overfitting for this method. Outputs are largely unchanged by this tuning; fewer than 400 test datapoints differ from the untuned outputs. A larger validation split may alleviate this problem.Statistical significance is assessed for select results using bootstrapping with 1000 samples in each of 100 iterations. This test shows that conditioning on the introduction of the source document improves performance compared to conditioning on the abstract when using the SciGPT2 model. However, we see that IR methods perform better than the best neural models. We do not find enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis regarding what context from the cited document should be used.AnalysisIn this section we take a closer look at the details of the SciGPT2 and IR system outputs on a collection of validation datapoints. We provide a quantitative error analysis as well as qualitative analysis and examples.Analysis ::: ErrorsIn order to better understand the performance of the models, we undertake a quantitative analysis of its output. One author randomly selected 200 datapoints from the validation set and their associated model outputs. Source and cited papers in the topic of NLP were used so as to facilitate expert judgement. For tractability, we limited the context presented to the annotator to the document abstracts and analyze the outputs of the abs times  abs and IR systems.In this analysis, we ask whether the models are producing believable citing sentences given their input. In particular, we are interested in the relative believability of the SciGPT2 and IR systems, as well as how believability of a citing sentence changes when a reader can see the abstract of one document or both.We use 100 datapoints with outputs from the SciGPT2 system and 100 with outputs from the IR system. For 50 datapoints from each system, the cited document's abstract is initially masked such that only the source context is visible (Source, One Visible). Based only on the source context, the annotator judged whether the model output (1) could have convincingly been a citation in the source document based solely on the abstract (believable), (2) could have been a citation in the source document, but unclear from the abstract alone and depends on the rest of the paper's content (content-dependent), or (3) is unlikely to appear in this document (not believable). After making this judgment, the annotator was then shown the abstract of the cited document and asked to make the 3-way believability judgment based on both source and cited abstracts (Source, Both Visible). This process is repeated with the remaining 50 datapoints, but with the cited context masked initially (Cited, One Visible and Cited, Both Visible).The results of our analysis presented in Table TABREF13. We find that believability in the Cited, One Visible condition correlates well with the Cited, Both Visible condition. In the Source conditions, we see a greater difference in believability between One Visible and Both Visible. These findings makes sense: in-line citations often summarize a prior study rather than highlight the paper's own contributions. Together, these results indicate that the believability of citing sentences is more related to the cited document than to the source.Another interesting feature of this analysis is the difference between SciGPT2 and IR in terms of context-dependent citing sentences. We observe fewer such judgements in the IR outputs. This is probably due to the fact that neural text generation systems such as SciGPT2 will sometimes produce generic, uninformative outputs while the IR system outputs are usually specific enough that a stronger believability judgement can be made.We also observe an overall higher instance of not believable judgements of the IR model outputs. This implies that automatic metrics such as BLEU, where the IR system scored higher than SciGPT2, do not correlate with factual accuracy in citation text generation.Example citations and annotations are shown in Table TABREF15. We find that in the cases where the model generated outputs are unconvincing they are still on topic. All 10 cases in the Source, One Visible and 4 of the cases in Cited, One Visible that were no longer believable in the Both Visible conditions exhibit this quality. A common example (4 cases) of this phenomenon occurs when the model output references a dataset. While the dataset would be potentially relevant to both papers, the cited papers focus on modeling contributions and do not introduce a novel corpus.Analysis ::: Future WorkThe fluency and topical relevance of the baseline models show the plausibility of the citation text generation task as well as the utility of including pretrained scientific language models in future models. But based on the kinds of errors we have seen, future work should focus on two complementary goals: ensuring the factual accuracy of the generated text and improved modeling of the cited document. Factual accuracy is difficult to enforce in statistical text generation systems, especially where inference includes sampling procedures. Grounding to knowledge bases could help. For this task, knowledge extracted from candidate generations could be compared with knowledge from the full source and cited documents to prune false or irrelevant statements. Further, modeling input documents as knowledge graphs of their contents may help these algorithms better understand the cited document, resulting in better outputs. However, such a model will have to address the open problem of combining pretrained language models with graph encoding techniques.ConclusionWe have introduced the challenging but useful task of citation text generation. This task requires reasoning about the relationships between documents and expressing these relationships in natural language text. We have established a dataset for this task and studied the performance of contemporary neural text generation and information retrieval models. Our analysis shows that while these models produce fluent and topical outputs, more research is needed to ensure factual accuracy and specificity in the generated text.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the Office of Naval Research under the MURI grant N00014-18-1-2670.Figure 1: Overview of Citation Text Generation Task.

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:A central goal in the study of the primate visual cortex and hierarchical models for object recognition is understanding how and why single units trade off invariance versus sensitivity to image transformations.For example, in both deep networks and visual cortex there is substantial variation from layer-to-layer and unit-to-unit in the degree of translation invariance.Here, we provide theoretical insight into this variation and its consequences for encoding in a deep network.Our critical insight comes from the fact that rectification simultaneously decreases response variance and correlation across responses to transformed stimuli, naturally inducing a positive relationship between invariance and dynamic range.Invariant input units then tend to drive the network more than those sensitive to small image transformations.We discuss consequences of this relationship for AI: deep nets naturally weight invariant units over sensitive units, and this can be strengthened with training, perhaps contributing to generalization performance.Our results predict a signature relationship between invariance and dynamic range that can now be tested in future neurophysiological studies.Invariances to image transformations, such as translation and scaling, have been reported in single units in visual cortex, but just as often sensitivity to these transformations has been found (El-Shamayleh and Pasupathy, 2016 , Sharpee et al. 2013 , Rust and DiCarlo, 2012 .Similarly, in deep networks there is variation in translation invariance both within and across layers (Pospisil et al., 2018 , Shen et al., 2016 , Shang et al., 2016 , Goodfellow et al., 2009 .Notionally, information about the position of the features composing objects may be important to category selectivity.For example, the detection of eyes, nose, and lips are not sufficient for face recognition, the relative positions of these parts must also be encoded.Thus it is reasonable to expect some balance between invariance and sensitivity to position.We empirically observe that in a popular deep network, in both its trained and untrained state, invariant units tend to have higher dynamic range than sensitive units (Figure 1B and C) .This raises the possibility that the effective gain on invariant units into the subsequent layer is stronger than that of sensitive units.Here we provide theoretical insight into how rectification in a deep network could naturally biase networks to this difference between invariant and sensitive units.We do this by examining how co-variance of a multivariate normal distribution is influenced by rectification, and we then test these insights in a deep neural network.We have documented an empirical relationship between the dynamic range of unrectified units in a deep network and their invariance.We provided a simple 1st order statistical model to explain this effect in which rectification caused the population representation to primarily vary in dimensions that were invariant to small image perturbations, whereas small perturbations were represented in directions of lower variance.Further work can investigate whether this imbalance improves generalization because of the emphasis placed on invariant over sensitive units.We note this relationship is weaker in the trained then untrained network further work can udnerstand this difference.Our approximations assumed low covariance between input units and homoegenous input variance while this may be expected in a random network it may not be true in a trained network.More crucially further theoretical work should consider the influence of co-variance between input units and invariance of output units as a function of weights.To extend insights from simplified, artificial networks to neurobiology, it will first of all be important to test whether cortical neurons showing more invariance also tend to have a higher dynamic range.If they do, this will establish a fundamental theoretical connection between computations of deep networks and the brain.","answer":"Rectification in deep neural networks naturally leads them to favor an invariant representation."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS-CoV (2012-current) cause severe disease, but despite the initial R0 estimations of greater than 2.0 for SARS-CoV (indicating sustained and even worldwide transmission could occur), and some large outbreaks, neither were as transmissible as initial concerns suggested. SARS-CoV caused 8098 reported cases and 774 deaths (case-fatality rate, 9.6%) in 37 countries before the epidemic was controlled. Control was thought to have been possible because a high proportion of cases were severe, making it easier to rapidly identify and isolate infected individuals. In addition, the virus was present at lower levels in upper airway secretions. There was no secondary transmission in the United States from the 8 imported cases, although in Toronto, Canada, a single importation is thought to have led to about 400 cases and 44 deaths. Later estimates of R0 were less than 1, indicating that SARS-CoV may not have been capable of sustained transmission, especially in the setting of control measures.4Similarly, MERS-CoV appears to have high severity and low transmissibility. Since 2012, MERS-CoV has caused 2494 reported cases and 858 deaths (case-fatality rate, 34%) in 27 countries. MERS-CoV has also caused some rapid outbreaks, mainly in hospitals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and South Korea, but estimates of MERS-CoV R0 are less than 1, and thus far it has been contained.5Can a respiratory virus that is both transmissible and severe be contained? In preparation for an influenza pandemic, the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Pandemic Influenza Plan included a combination of nonpharmaceutical (border and school closing, infection control measures) and pharmaceutical (antiviral prophylaxis, vaccines) interventions meant to be used in combination to interrupt or slow influenza transmission. Despite implementation of some of these interventions, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 spread to 120 countries in 3 months. With the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Middle East, a preparedness plan was developed that included a surveillance plan, laboratory testing, and contact tracing guidance. Infection control guidance was developed for use in health care settings and traveler guidance was developed for the public.6 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction test kits to state health departments. Two cases were imported into the United States. Contacts were traced, including household, hospital, and airline contacts. No secondary cases were identified in the United States. MERS-CoV was thought to be severe and control measures relied on recognition of suspect cases. However, during a hospital outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, among hospitalized patients only 5 of 53 (9%) health care–associated cases had documented presence in the same room as a patient with MERS.5 Despite the high case-fatality rate (an important measure of severity), MERS cases can be asymptomatic and mild (25% in one outbreak). Although it is not known how often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients transmit MERS, initiating comprehensive measures such as isolating patients suspected of having or having been exposed to the virus and using personal protective equipment when caring for them may be extremely difficult because so many patients have mild and nonspecific symptoms. Is the world ready for a respiratory virus with high transmissibility and severity? After a new influenza virus (H7N9) was identified in China in 2013, a series of modeling articles described the effect of, and level of preparedness for, a severe, single-wave pandemic in the United States.7 In scenarios that used clinical attack rates (the proportion of individuals who become ill with or die from a disease in a population initially uninfected) of 20% to 30% (for comparison the clinical attack rate was 20% in the first year of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic), depending on severity there would be an estimated 669 000 to 4.3 million hospitalizations and an estimated 54 000 to 538 000 deaths without any interventions in the United States. The models suggested that without a vaccine, school closures would be unlikely to affect the pandemic, an estimated 35 000 to 60 000 ventilators would be needed, up to an estimated 7.3 billion surgical masks or respirators would be required, and perhaps most important, if vaccine development did not start before the virus was introduced, it was unlikely that a significant number of hospitalizations and deaths could be averted due to the time it takes to develop, test, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine. It is impossible to know what will happen so early in this novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The scope, morbidity, and mortality will depend on the combination of severity and transmissibility. Numerous experts have “nowcasted” how many cases have occurred and forecasted how many cases will likely occur. A recent study suggests rapid person to person transmission can occur.8 Disease modelers have estimated R0 to be 2.2 .9 The University of Hong Kong estimates the outbreak could infect more than 150 000 persons per day in China at its peak. Is 2019-nCoV infection severe? To date approximately 14% of cases of 2019-nCoV have been described as severe by WHO, with a case-fatality rate of 2.1%.10 Estimates of severity are usually higher in the beginning of an epidemic due to the identification of the most severely affected cases and decline as the epidemic progresses. However, because many infected persons have not yet recovered and may still die, the case-fatality rate and severity could be underestimated. On January 30, 2020, WHO officially declared the 2019-nCoV epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, indicating its concern that countries aside from China could be affected by 2019-nCoV. In preparing for possible sustained transmission of 2019-nCoV beyond China, applicable lessons from previous experiences with epidemics/pandemics of respiratory viruses should be carefully considered to better control and mitigate potential consequences. Influenza preparedness plans have been developed that aim to stop, slow, or limit the spread of an influenza pandemic to the United States. These plans address limiting domestic spread and mitigating disease but also sustaining infrastructure and reducing the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy and society. These plans would be useful to enact during the 2019-nCoV epidemic should the United States experience sustained transmission. Countries have been successful in the past and there is nothing yet to predict that this time it is likely to be worse. Effective prevention and control will not be easy if there is sustained transmission and will require the full attention of public health, federal and local governments, the private sector, and every citizen.

Comment2 Comments for this articleEXPAND ALLFebruary 12, 2020Understanding R and Disease ControlOz Mansoor | Public Health Physician, WellingtonThe message, that we need to prepare for a pandemic is vital. But the article misreports some key ideas. Firstly, SARS was not controlled \\"because a high proportion of cases were severe.\\" While that helped , it was because cases were not infectious before some days after symptom onset (usually in the second week of illness). This gave more time for case identification and isolation. And most cases did not pass on infection to anybody, but a few spread to many. When all such individuals were identified and isolated, spread stopped. Unfortunately, the new virusappears to be spreading from people much earlier in the course of illness, and even with mild symptoms - which was never documented for SARS. However, it is not clear that it is any different or better at spread between people, and perhaps with the same pattern of most cases not causing further spread. Secondly, the R0, the basic reproduction number, is correctly described as the average number of infections each case causes. But it lacks two key ideas: 1) the 0 after the R implies the native state, which is a fully susceptible population and without any control measures. R is the effectiive number and can include the impact of control measures. To claim that it was the lack of transmissibility, rather than the control measures that ended SARS, is not based on any evidence. And it ignores the heroic efforts of affected countries. Elimination of SARS demonstrated the potential of globally coordinated collective action, as well as the damage caused by ignorance and prejudice. Most seem to have already forgotten the lessons of SARS.CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Worked for WHO/WPRO in SARS responseREAD MOREFebruary 24, 2020COVID 19: a global presence and not only a new pathogen? Giuliano Ramadori, Professor of Medicine | University Clinic, Göttingen, GermanyIn the winter season there comes the time of upper and lower respiratory tract infections characterised by cough, dyspnea and eventually fever (influenza-like illness).Some of the patients, especially older people living alone affected by the disease ,may need hospitalization and eventually intensive care. In many of the cases who are hospitalized nasal and/or tracheal fluid are examined for viral or bacterial agents. Only in less than 50% of the cases influenza viruses are considered to be the cause of the disease.In the rest of the cases diagnostic procedure for human coronaviruses is not performed routinely. One of the fourdifferent Human Coronaviruses (HuCoV: 229E,NL 63,0C43 and HKU1) can however be found in up to 30% ofpatients negative for influenza viruses (1). Chinese scientists in Wuhan, who had to deal with an increasing number of acute respiratory tract diseases resembling viral pneumonia, performed deep sequencing analysis from samples taken from the lower respiratory tract and found a \\"novel\\" coronavirus. The sequence of the complete genome was made public. At the same time, however, the notice from Wuhan brought to mind the SARS- and MERS-epidemics. The measures taken by the Chinese- and WHO-authorities are now well known.

Ischemic heart diseases caused by insufficient oxygen supply to the cardiac muscle require pharmaceutical agents for the prevention of the progress and recurrence. Metallothionein (MT) has a potential as a protein therapeutic for the treatment of this disease due to its anti-oxidative effects under stressful conditions. In spite of its therapeutic potential, efficient delivery systems need to be developed to overcome limitations such as low transduction efficiency, instability and short half-life in the body. To enhance intra-cellular transduction efficiency, Tat sequence as a protein transduction domain (PTD) was fused with MT in a recombinant method. Anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects of Tat-MT fusion protein were evaluated under hyperglycemia and hypoxia stress conditions in cultured H9c2 cells. Recovery of cardiac functions by anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic effects of Tat-MT was confirmed in an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat myocardial infarction model. Tat-MT fusion protein effectively protected H9c2 cells under stressful conditions by reducing intracellular ROS production and inhibiting caspase-3 activation. Tat-MT fusion protein inhibited apoptosis, reduced fibrosis area and enhanced cardiac functions in I/R. Tat-MT fusion protein could be a promising therapeutic for the treatment of ischemic heart diseases.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

The effects of concentration, particle size, surface charge, and crystal structure on the lyophilization-induced self-assembly of cellulose particles in aqueous suspensions were studied. Within the concentration range of 0.5 to 1.0 wt %, cellulose particles self-organized into lamellar structured foam composed of aligned membrane layers with widths between 0.5 and 3 μm. At 0.05 wt %, CNC I, CNF I, CNC II, and CNF II self-assembled into oriented ultrafine fibers with mean diameters of 0.57, 1.02, 1.50, and 1.00 μm, respectively. The size of self-assembled fibers became larger when more hydroxyl groups and fewer sulfates (weaker electrostatic repulsion) were on cellulose surfaces.

While therapeutic proteins (TP), particularly recombinant human proteins and fully human monoclonal antibodies, are designed to have a low immunogenic potential in humans, a clinical immune response does sometimes occur and cannot be predicted from preclinical studies. Changes in TP pharmacokinetics may be perceived as an early indication of antibody formation and serve as a surrogate for later changes in efficacy and safety in individual subjects. Given the substantial increase in number of biological products, including biosimilars, there is an urgent need to quantitatively predict and quantify the immune response and any consequential changes in TP pharmacokinetics. The purpose of this communication is to review the utility of population-based modeling and simulation approaches developed to date for investigating the development of an immune response and assessing its impact on TP pharmacokinetics. Two examples of empirical modeling approaches for pharmacokinetic assessment are presented. The first example presents methods to analyze pharmacokinetic data in the presence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and confirm the effect of immunogenicity on TP pharmacokinetics in early phases of drug development. The second example provides a framework to analyze pharmacokinetic data in the absence or with very low incidence of ADA and confirm with enough power the lack of an immunogenicity effect on TP pharmacokinetics in late phases of drug development. Finally, a theoretical mechanism-based modeling framework is presented to mathematically relate the complex interaction among TP, their targets, and ADA.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Among immobilization methods, biosilicification is a remarkable strategy inspired by nature:[3–5] polycationic molecules are used to direct and promote silicic acid polycondensation reactions[4,6], which proceed under benign conditions[7], within a few minutes[6] and with high immobilization yields.[4]</p><p>Biomaterials of such kind have attracted significant interest,[8] and their usual characterization is based on the analysis of the catalytic activity, (Figure S1). Structurally, they are difficult to characterize by standard structural biology tools such as X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, but they can be investigated by MAS NMR, which has been used to study protein-mineral interfaces[9] and the mechanistic aspects of biosilica formation by peptides from Cylindrotheca fusiformis[10] or by Thalassiosira pseudonana cells.[11] We have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high-resolution MAS characterization of biosilica immobilized enzymes,[12] providing two examples: the catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase 12, in its complex with NNGH (N-Isobutyl-N-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)glycyl hydroxamic acid) (catMMP12)[13] and the Cu(II)-Zn(II) loaded C6A,C111S mutant of human superoxide dismutase 1 (AS-SOD).[14] Both proteins displayed highly resolved NMR spectra in the immobilized form and it was possible to ascertain that the structure of the protein was maintained.[12] However sensitivity is a persistent problem in the NMR studies of biosilica structures and bioinspired materials in general[11].</p><p>To address the challenges imposed by low sensitivity, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) may be applied. In DNP, the large electron polarization of a paramagnetic species is transferred to neighbouring nuclei via microwave irradiation. This efficiency of this process is optimal at cryogenic temperatures where electron spin and nuclear relaxation times increase and allow for efficient polarization transfer. Bis-nitroxide biradicals are the most successful polarizing agents due to the increased electron-electron coupling (20–35 MHz) that is required for cross effect (CE) efficiency.[15] To date solid-state DNP research faces two main issues: a) determining the kind of samples that are amenable for DNP and b) understanding and preventing the loss of resolution at cryogenic temperatures. Although several studies have demonstrated the possibility of polarizing the surface of silica-based materials by DNP,[16] it is not trivial to deduce that the method is also suited for increasing the sensitivity in the study of proteins encapsulated within a biosilica matrix. In terms of sample preparation, the protein and the radical may reside in different phases, separated by the silica matrix, as opposed to the case of a homogenous glassy preparation,[17] and as such it could give no enhancement at all, as in the case of frozen solution without cryoprotectant. On the contrary, in this work we could demonstrate that substantial enhancements are achieved in NMR sensitivity of catMMP12 and AS-SOD proteins entrapped in biosilica by employing high field DNP (5 T and 16.4 T), providing the proof of principle that high-field DNP enhancement can be obtained for these systems.</p><p>DNP-enhanced NMR spectra of biosilica-entrapped catMMP12 and AS-SOD were obtained at 5 T (211 MHz/140 GHz). The biosilica samples were treated with a cryoprotectant (60:30:10 glycerol-d8/D2O/H2O)[18] containing a 10 mM concentration of the biradical polarizing agent TOTAPOL [1-(TEMPO-4-oxy)-3-(TEMPO-4-amino)-propan-2-ol].[19] Proton DNP enhancements (ε) of 32 and 50 were achieved for catMMP12 and AS-SOD, respectively.</p><p>The presence of silica may affect the DNP properties of the sample, since it may act as a shell protecting the enzyme, and it can have non-specific interactions with the biradical.[20] Therefore we tested if the biosilica matrix could act similarly to surfactant-containing systems[21,22] or other systems where the biradical is protected from segregation upon solvent freezing:[23–28]i.e., if the use of a cryoprotectant could be avoided. For the cryoprotectant-free approach two samples were prepared by washing the solid with a 10 mM TOTAPOL solution in D2O. DNP ε of 20 and 55 were obtained for catMMP12 and AS-SOD (Figure S2): for AS-SOD the efficiency of DNP was comparable with and without cryoprotectant, while for catMMP12 the non-cryoprotected sample yielded somewhat lower but still significant enhancement. These results suggests that the DNP efficiency depends on the properties of the biosilica scaffold: the morphology of the biosilica particles are known to vary significantly depending on the entrapped protein and upon changes of the reaction conditions.[29] These result are important as they demonstrate that a matrix-free approach is feasible,[28] yielding easier detection of the resonances of interest due to the higher filling factor. Notably, the buildup rates of the non-cryoprotected samples are higher than those of the cryoprotectant sample, suggesting that the biradical may have preferential interaction with the silica[20] and thus remain closer to the protein at the time of freezing (Table S1).</p><p>The DNP experiments at 5 T demonstrate the ability to polarize enzymes entrapped in biosilica. However, as expected for samples at cryogenic temperatures and low fields, the spectral resolution is low:[30,31] when protein samples are kept at cryogenic temperatures for the DNP measurements, broadening of the resonances is often observed. It is worth noting that in the existing literature on NMR studies at cryogenic temperature, lines are generally thought to broadened due to one of the following: a) freezing of different side-chain conformations that are no longer averaged by collisions with the solvent and/or intrinsic molecular motions;[30] b) interference of MAS and/or decoupling with molecular motions,[32] and c) differential interactions between the protein and the surrounding frozen solvent;[30] in particular for biosilica entrapped enzymes differential interactions with the biosilica network that are not averaged by molecular motions could also broaden the resonances.[10,11]</p><p>NMR at higher magnetic fields could mitigate the resolution problem. Thus, the immobilized enzymes were further analyzed at 16.4 T (699 MHz/460 GHz). Figure 1 shows the resulting DNP 13C{1H} CPMAS NMR spectra of the same samples: although the resolution is still not sufficient for a thorough characterization, this comparison shows that high field DNP provides a promising resolution improvement. Indeed, the present data demonstrate that even if the resolution is lower than the room temperature spectra, the DNP spectra clearly show resonances typical of the folded protein (around 160 ppm and 10 ppm, Figure S3), affording a method to assess the maintainment of the protein fold with higher sensitivity than the room-temperature SSNMR, thus with a lower detection limit.</p><p>From theory,[33] it is expected that the enhancement at 16.4 T will be at least 3.3 times smaller than the enhancement at 5 T. The AS-SOD sample follows such prediction (ε=15), while the enhancement of catMMP12 was reduced only by a factor ~2 (ε=16). This could be due to a phenomenon that has been described recently: the presence of dielectric discontinuities (i.e., of particles with different dielectric constant) in the sample favors the dispersion of microwaves, which gives improved DNP performance.[34] Shorter wavelength microwaves could be scattered better, thereby accounting for the less-than-expected reduction of DNP at high field, with the different behavior between the two samples ascribable to the different size of the biosilica particles (Figure S4) and possibly to the difference in microwave penetration. In biosilica-entrapped samples, the presence of microscopic particles is intrinsic, thus we can expect the higher DNP efficiency at high field to be a feature of such systems.</p><p>The enhancements at 16.4 T allowed for the collection of 2D experiments within a few hours using ~14–20 μl of sample. Figure 2 shows the improvement in resolution for the biosilica-entrapped AS-SOD enzyme when moving from 5 to 16.4 T (catMMP12 is shown in Figure S5). The comparison illustrates the importance of combining multidimensional experiments and high field DNP for improving both resolution and sensitivity; furthermore it is possible to foresee that using even higher fields would be beneficial for resolution, at the same time not compromising DNP efficiency too much. Figure S6 shows the comparison with the room temperature spectrum, reproduced with permission by the Royal Society of Chemistry from reference [12], which confirms that the peaks that appear at 16.4 T are present also at room temperature. On this basis, we can state that the modest resolution is due to low temperature effects, but the latter are mitigated at high field.</p><p>As already mentioned, it is possible to use positively charged proteins, such as hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) as catalysts.[4] DNP-enhanced NMR spectra of HEWL entrapped in the biosilica matrix in natural abundance were thus recorded (Figure 3). Whereas the spectrum without DNP shows no protein signals after ~5 hours, a difference spectrum with DNP clearly shows the presence of protein signals. This is striking considering the low concentration of non-labeled lysozyme in the sample. Previously, characterization of this system by SSNMR had only been possible via 29Si.[35]</p><p>In conclusion high field DNP can be applied to biosilica-entrapped enzymes, and significantly higher sensitivity can be achieved, both with and without cryoprotectant. The ability to collect 13C-13C correlation spectra within hours of small sample volumes of AS-SOD and catMMP12 demonstrates the importance of DNP to achieve the sensitivity needed for studies of biosilica, bio-inspired materials, and of natural occurring materials (such as diatom's hexoskeleton) that are in natural abundance.[36,37] With continued study of sample preparation procedures at cryogenic temperatures, careful labeling procedures[10] and continued investment in radical design further improvements in resolution and sensitivity are possible. It is clear that DNP NMR will be required to mitigate or lift the sensitivity limitation that often restricts structural studies of complex biological systems.</p>","answer":"Enzymes are used as environmentally friendly catalysts in many industrial applications, and are frequently immobilized in a matrix to improve their chemical stability for long-term storage, and reusability. Recently, it was shown that an atomic-level description of proteins immobilized in a biosilica matrix can be attained by examining their magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra. However, even though MAS NMR is an excellent tool for determining structure, it is severely hampered by sensitivity. In this work we provide the proof of principle that NMR-characterization of biosilica-entrapped enzymes could be assisted by high-field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"pilocarpine\\", \\"tariquidar\\", \\"phenobarbital\\", \\"phenytoin\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"injury to the brain\\", \\"seizures\\", \\"seizure\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The gene encoding a chicken cytokine with T-cell proliferative activity was cloned, sequenced, and mapped. The results show that this cytokine is chicken IL2 and not IL15. The exon:intron structure of chicken IL2 corresponds almost exactly to those of mammalian IL2s with the exceptions of exon 2 and introns 2 and 3 which are shorter. Chicken IL2 contains five repeats of the \\" instability \\" motif ATTTA in the 3'untranslated region in exon 4. It is a single-copy gene, with neither structural (amino acid) nor promoter sequence polymorphisms identified. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence suggests that overall protein structure is conserved, but the receptor binding sites are not. A number of potential regulatory sequences similar to those found in mammals have been identified in the promoter. These include (5'-3') a composite NF-AT / \\" AP-1 \\" element, a CD28 response element, an AP-1 element, an NF-AT element, and the AP-1 part of an AP-1 / octamer composite element. The mammalian NF-kappaB and octamer binding sites seem to be absent, although there are alternative potential NF-kappaB and octamer-binding elements in the chicken IL2 promoter, in close proximity to their mammalian homologues. Sequence comparisons also predict other potential transcription factor binding sites as yet undescribed in mammalian IL2 promoters. A Taq I polymorphism was identified which enabled chicken IL2 to be mapped to chromosome 4, linked to ANX5, with synteny with mouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 4. This is the first non-mammalian cytokine gene to be mapped.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [\\"octamer - binding elements\\", \\"AP - 1 part of an AP - 1 / octamer composite element\\", \\"potential regulatory sequences\\", \\"exon  intron structure\\", \\"exon 2\\", \\"human chromosome 4\\", \\"single - copy gene\\", \\"ANX5\\", \\"octamer binding sites\\", \\"NF - AT / \\" AP - 1 \\" element\\", \\"AP - 1 element\\", \\"Promoter sequence\\", \\"NF - AT element\\", \\"mammalian homologues\\", \\"exon 4\\", \\"Taq I polymorphism\\", \\"chromosome 4\\", \\"exonintron structure\\", \\"CD28 response element\\", \\"mouse chromosome 3\\", \\"introns\\", \\"chicken IL2 promoter\\", \\"promoter\\", \\"3u0027untranslated region\\", \\"mammalian IL2 promoters\\", \\"non - mammalian cytokine gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"mammalian NF - kappaB\\", \\"chicken cytokine\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"IL15\\", \\"Chicken IL2\\", \\"predicted amino acid sequence\\", \\"the first non - mammalian cytokine\\", \\"protein structure\\", \\"IL2\\", \\"cytokine\\", \\"chicken IL2\\", \\"IL2s\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

METHODS Patients were r and omised to paclitaxel ( 90mg/m(2 ) , weekly , intravenously , 3 weeks on/1 week off )  plus sorafenib ( 400 mg , orally , twice daily ) or placebo . The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS ) . A sample size of 220 patients was planned with relative risk ≤ 0.82 ( 1-sided α=0.14 ) after 120 events supporting a treatment effect . FINDINGS Patients were r and omised in India ( n=170 ) , the United States ( n=52 ) and Brazil ( n=15 ) . Median PFS was 6.9 months for sorafenib versus 5.6 months for placebo ( hazard ratio (HR)=0.788 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.558 - 1.112 ; P=0.1715 [ 1-sided P=0.0857 ] ) . The addition of sorafenib increased time to progression ( median , 8.1 versus 5.6 months ; HR=0.674 ; 95 % CI 0.465 - 0.975 ; P=0.0343 ) and improved overall response ( 67 % versus 54 % ; P=0.0468 ) . Overall survival did not statistically differ ( median , 16.8 versus 17.4 months ; HR=1.022 ; 95 % CI 0.715 - 1.461 ; P=0.904 ) . Grade 3/4 toxicities ( sorafenib versus placebo ) included h and -foot skin reaction ( 31 % versus 3 % ) , neutropenia ( 13 % versus 7 % ) and anaemia ( 11 % versus 6 % ) . Two treatment-related deaths occurred ( malaria and liver dysfunction ) in the sorafenib arm . INTERPRETATION The addition of sorafenib to paclitaxel improved disease control but did not significantly improve PFS to support a phase 3 trial of similar design . Toxicity of the combination was manageable with dose reductionsTitle 2:First-line treatment of advanced breast cancer with sunitinib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone: results of a prospective, randomized phase III study.Abstract 2:PURPOSE To investigate whether sunitinib plus docetaxel improves clinical outcomes for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-negative advanced breast cancer ( ABC ) versus docetaxel alone . PATIENTS AND METHODS In this phase III study , patients were r and omly assigned to open-label combination therapy ( sunitinib 37.5 mg/d , days 2 to 15 every 3 weeks ; and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2 ) , day 1 every 3 weeks ) or monotherapy ( docetaxel 100 mg/m(2 ) every 3 weeks ) .  Progression-free survival ( PFS )  was the primary end point . RESULTS Two hundred ninety-six patients were r and omly assigned to combination therapy , and 297 patients were assigned to monotherapy .  Median PFS times were 8.6 and 8.3 months with combination therapy and monotherapy , respectively ( hazard ratio , 0.92 ; one-sided P = .265 ) . The objective response rate ( ORR ) was significantly higher with the combination ( 55 % ) than with monotherapy ( 42 % ; one-sided P = .001 ) . Duration of response was similar in both arms ( 7.5 months with the combination v 7.2 months with monotherapy ) . Median overall survival ( OS ) times were 24.8 and 25.5 months with combination therapy and monotherapy , respectively ( one-sided P = .904 ) . There were 107 deaths with the combination and 91 deaths with monotherapy . The frequency of common adverse events ( AEs ) was higher with the combination , as were treatment discontinuations caused by AEs . CONCLUSION The combination of sunitinib plus docetaxel improved ORR but did not prolong either PFS or OS compared with docetaxel alone when given to an unselected HER2/neu-negative cohort as first-line treatment for ABC . Sunitinib combination therapy may also have result ed in AEs that yield an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio . The sunitinib-docetaxel regimen evaluated in this study is not recommended for further use in ABCTitle 3:Comparative effectiveness of axitinib versus sorafenib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (AXIS): a randomised phase 3 trialAbstract 3:BACKGROUND The treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma has been revolutionised by targeted therapy with drugs that block angiogenesis . So far , no phase 3 r and omised trials comparing the effectiveness of one targeted agent against another have been reported . We did a r and omised phase 3 study comparing axitinib , a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptors , with sorafenib , an approved VEGF receptor inhibitor , as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer . METHODS We included patients coming from 175 sites ( hospitals and outpatient clinics ) in 22 countries aged 18 years or older with confirmed renal clear-cell carcinoma who progressed despite first-line therapy containing sunitinib , bevacizumab plus interferon-alfa , temsirolimus , or cytokines .  Patients were stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and type of previous treatment and then r and omly assigned ( 1:1 ) to either axitinib ( 5 mg twice daily ) or sorafenib ( 400 mg twice daily ) . Axitinib dose increases to 7 mg and then to 10 mg , twice daily , were allowed for those patients without hypertension or adverse reactions above grade 2 . Participants were not masked to study treatment . The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS ) and was assessed by a masked , independent radiology review and analysed by intention to treat . This trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00678392 . FINDINGS A total of 723 patients were enrolled and r and omly assigned to receive axitinib ( n=361 ) or sorafenib ( n=362 ) . The median PFS was 6·7 months with axitinib compared to 4·7 months with sorafenib ( hazard ratio 0·665 ; 95 % CI 0·544 - 0·812 ; one-sided p<0·0001 ) . Treatment was discontinued because of toxic effects in 14 ( 4 % ) of 359 patients treated with axitinib and 29 ( 8 % ) of 355 patients treated with sorafenib . The most common adverse events were diarrhoea , hypertension , and fatigue in the axitinib arm , and diarrhoea , palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia , and alopecia in the sorafenib arm . INTERPRETATION Axitinib result ed in significantly longer PFS compared with sorafenib . Axitinib is a treatment option for second-line therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma . FUNDING PfizerTitle 4:Vandetanib with docetaxel as second-line treatment for advanced breast cancer: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase II studyAbstract 4:Summary Purpose The aim of this Phase II study was to assess the efficacy and safety of v and etanib in combination with docetaxel in patients with pretreated advanced breast cancer . Methods The primary study objective was to compare the number of progression events in patients receiving once-daily oral v and etanib ( 100 mg ) in combination with docetaxel  ( 100 mg/m2 iv every 21 days ) versus placebo plus docetaxel .  Sixty-four patients were r and omized to receive study treatment ( n = 35 , v and etanib ; n = 29 , placebo ) . Results A slightly greater number of patients had experienced a progression event by the data cut-off in the v and etanib group ( 24 [ 69 % ] ) compared with the placebo group ( 18 [ 62 % ] ) ; HR = 1.19 , two-sided 80 % CI : 0.79–1.81 ; two-sided P = 0.59 ) , suggesting that the addition of v and etanib to docetaxel did not affect the risk of disease progression compared with placebo plus docetaxel .  The safety and tolerability profile of the combination therapy reflected those of both drugs as monotherapy agents . Conclusions In patients with advanced breast cancer , v and etanib plus docetaxel was generally well tolerated . Clinical benefit was not different to that observed with placebo plus docetaxel . However , due to the small patient number it was not possible to yield robust results , further research is required to identify predictive factors for patient selectionTitle 5:Sorafenib or Placebo with Either Gemcitabine or Capecitabine in Patients with HER-2–Negative Advanced Breast Cancer That Progressed during or after BevacizumabAbstract 5:Purpose : We assessed adding the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib to gemcitabine or capecitabine in patients with advanced breast cancer whose disease progressed during/after bevacizumab . Experimental Design : This double-blind , r and omized , placebo-controlled phase IIb study ( Clinical Trials.gov NCT00493636 ) enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative breast cancer and prior bevacizumab treatment . Patients were r and omized to chemotherapy with sorafenib ( 400 mg , twice daily ) or matching placebo . Initially , chemotherapy was gemcitabine ( 1,000 mg/m2 i.v . , days 1 , 8/21 ) , but later , capecitabine ( 1,000 mg/m2 orally twice daily , days 1–14/21 ) was allowed as an alternative . The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Results : One hundred and sixty patients were r and omized . More patients received gemcitabine ( 82.5 % ) than capecitabine ( 17.5 % ) . Sorafenib plus gemcitabine/capecitabine was associated with a statistically significant prolongation in PFS versus placebo plus gemcitabine/capecitabine [ 3.4 vs. 2.7 months ; HR = 0.65 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.45–0.95 ; P = 0.02 ] , time to progression was increased ( median , 3.6 vs. 2.7 months ; HR = 0.64 ; 95 % CI : 0.44–0.93 ; P = 0.02 ) , and overall response rate was 19.8 % versus 12.7 % ( P = 0.23 ) . Median survival was 13.4 versus 11.4 months for sorafenib versus placebo ( HR = 1.01 ; 95 % CI : 0.71−1.44 ; P = 0.95 ) . Addition of sorafenib versus placebo  increased grade 3/4 h and –foot skin reaction ( 39 % vs. 5 % ) , stomatitis ( 10 % vs. 0 % ) , fatigue ( 18 % vs. 9 % ) , and dose reductions that were more frequent ( 51.9 % vs. 7.8 % ) . Conclusion : The addition of sorafenib to gemcitabine/capecitabine provided a clinical ly small but statistically significant PFS benefit in HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients whose disease progressed during/after  bevacizumab . Combination treatment was associated with manageable toxicities but frequently required dose reductions .

Previous studies of the developing lens have shown that Notch signaling regulates differentiation of lens fiber cells by maintaining a proliferating precursor pool in the anterior epithelium. However, whether Notch signaling is further required after the onset of fiber cell differentiation is not clear. This work investigates the role of Notch2 and Jagged1 (Jag1) in secondary fiber cell differentiation using rat lens epithelial explants undergoing FGF-2 dependent differentiation in vitro. FGF induced Jag1 expression and Notch2 signaling (as judged by the appearance of activated Notch2 Intracellular Domain (N2ICD)) within 12-24 h. These changes were correlated with induction of the Notch effector, Hes5, upregulation of N-cadherin (N-cad), and downregulation of E-cadherin (E-cad), a cadherin switch characteristic of fiber cell differentiation. Induction of Jag1 was efficiently blocked by U0126, a specific inhibitor of MAPK/ERK signaling, indicating a requirement for signaling through this pathway downstream of the FGF receptor. Other growth factors that activate MAPK/ERK signaling (EGF, PDGF, IGF) did not induce Jag1. Inhibition of Notch signaling using gamma secretase inhibitors DAPT and L-685,458 or anti-Jag1 antibody markedly decreased FGF-dependent expression of Jag1 demonstrating Notch-dependent lateral induction. In addition, inhibition of Notch signaling reduced expression of N-cad, and the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p57Kip2, indicating a direct role for Notch signaling in secondary fiber cell differentiation. These results demonstrate that Notch-mediated lateral induction of Jag1 is an essential component of FGF-dependent lens fiber cell differentiation.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"FGF\\", \\"N-cadherin\\", \\"ERK\\", \\"Jag1\\", \\"Notch2 Intracellular Domain\\", \\"cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor\\", \\"p57Kip2\\", \\"Notch\\", \\"FGF-2\\", \\"Hes5\\", \\"E-cad\\", \\"N-cad\\", \\"FGF receptor\\", \\"Jagged1\\", \\"E-cadherin\\", \\"PDGF\\", \\"Notch2\\", \\"cadherin\\", \\"IGF\\", \\"EGF\\", \\"gamma secretase\\", \\"MAPK\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of initial experience of robotic cystectomy programs on oncologic outcomes and overall survival.(PATIENTS AND METHODS) • Utilizing a prospectively maintained, single institution robotic cystectomy database, we identified 164 consecutive patients who underwent RARC since November 2005. • After stratification by age group, gender, pathologic T stage, lymph node status, surgical margin status, and sequential case number; we used chi-squared analyses to correlate sequential case number to operative time, surgical blood loss, lymph node yield, and surgical margin status. • We also addressed the relationship between complications and sequential case number. We then utilized Cox proportional hazard modeling and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses to correlate variables to overall mortality.(RESULTS) • Sequential case number was not significantly associated with increased incidence of complications, surgical blood loss, or positive surgical margins (P= 0.780, P= 0.548, P= 0.545). Case number was, however, significantly associated with shorter operative time and mean number of lymph nodes retrieved (P<0.001, P<0.001). • Sequential case number was not significantly associated with survival; however, tumour stage, the presence of lymph node metastases, and positive surgical margins were significantly associated with death. • Although being the largest of its kind, this was a small study with short follow-up when compared to open cystectomy series.Question:Is patient outcome compromised during the initial experience with robot-assisted radical cystectomy?Answer:","answer":"NO"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Wireless indoor positioning systems have become very popular in recent years. These systems have been successfully used in many applications such as asset tracking and inventory management. This paper provides an overview of the existing wireless indoor positioning solutions and attempts to classify different techniques and systems. Three typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis, and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated, and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems. Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision, complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.Literature Review:","answer":"A survey paper from 2007 BIB002 analyses and compares general-purpose systems for indoor localization that rely on radiobased techniques. The systems considered deploy GPS, RFID, ultra-wideband (UWB), WLAN or Bluetooth [25] as well as cellular mobile networks. The analysed systems are compared with metrics that evaluate their positioning precision as well as complexity, scalability, robustness and cost. The highest precision is accomplished by UWB-based methods but these are in turn also rated as not robust and relatively expensive. As a general rule, most systems with a higher accuracy come at the cost of a higher complexity. Therefore, an adequate compromise has to be found for the respective application area. The development of improved localization algorithms and the combined use of signal-based methods together with inertial systems and waypoints are emphasized as important research areas. Furthermore, the advantageous placement of sensors or reference points may help to improve the localization accuracy can especially be relevant within mission critical scenarios. The general limits of signal-strength based localization techniques for indoor use are studied in BIB001 . Even though only radio techniques are analysed that are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, the authors claim that their results are valid for all technologies where the signal propagation is significantly affected by typical indoor conditions. The result of this analysis is that among all technologies considered the localization error reaches at best around 3 m with a 50% probability when considering the CDF of the localization error. For the 97th percentile the localization error lies at 9.15 m. Following these results, a reliable localization with an accuracy of below 1 m as specified in Section 2 is not possible using only signal strength based techniques. In accordance to the previous analysis, the authors of  also state that there are existing localization techniques based on radio signals that reach a localization error of around 3 m under advantageous conditions in indoor environments. Furthermore, the concept of a cooperative positioning system called MagicMap  is introduced that allows for the combination of different radio based localization techniques. First results with a combination of WLAN, RFID and ZigBee led to an average improved localization accuracy of 33% compared to the use of only a single technique. The possibility to use GPS even within buildings is analysed in  . The significantly worse signal quality of the GPS signal compared to the use outdoors is alleviated by the assistance of a cellular mobile network and the block correlation of multiple signals of different satellites. However, low-cost GPS receivers are not able to conduct these complex and timeintensive calculations. Therefore, more powerful chips have to be used. Although the general possibility for receiving a GPS signal within closed buildings could be shown with this method, the position deviation in three dimensions averaged to 25 m and is thus still far from room-level precision. The authors assume that further progress is possible with the use of differential GPS and improved chip processing power."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Plumbagin is a candidate drug for the treatment of prostate cancer. Previous observations indicated that it may improve the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This study evaluates the effectiveness of treatment with combinations of plumbagin and alternative strategies for ADT in mouse models of prostate cancer to support its clinical use.  methods Plumbagin was administered per oral in a new sesame oil formulation. Standard toxicology studies were performed in rats. For tumor growth studies, mouse prostate cancer cell spheroids were placed on top of grafted prostate tissue in a dorsal chamber and allowed to form tumors. Mice were separated in various treatment groups and tumor size was measured over time by intra-vital microscopy. Survival studies were done in mice after injection of prostate cancer cells in the prostate of male animals. Androgen receptor (AR) levels were analyzed by Western blot from prostate cancer cells treated with plumbagin.  results Plumbagin caused a decrease in AR levels in vitro. In mice, plumbagin at 1 mg/kg in sesame oil displayed low toxicity and caused a 50% tumor regression when combined with castration. The combination of plumbagin with various forms of chemical ADT including treatment with a GnRH receptor agonist, a GnRH receptor antagonist, or CYP17A1 inhibitors, outperformed ADT alone, increasing mouse survival compared to the standard regimen of castration alone. In contrast , the combination of plumbagin with AR antagonists , such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide , showed no improvement over AR antagonists alone . Thus, plumbagin is effective in combination with drugs that prevent the synthesis of testosterone or its conversion to dihydrotestosterone, but not with drugs that bind to AR.  conclusion Plumbagin significantly improves the effect of ADT drugs currently used in the clinic, with few side effects in mice.sentence: In contrast , the combination of plumbagin with AR antagonists , such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide , showed no improvement over AR antagonists alone .","answer":"[[\\"bicalutamide\\", \\"plumbagin\\", \\"COMB\\"], [\\"enzalutamide\\", \\"plumbagin\\", \\"COMB\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

BACKGROUND Allergen vaccination is effective in mite-allergic asthma . Liposomes are immunological adjuvants that can act as allergen carriers . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the immunological and functional effects of a liposome-entrapped D. pteronyssinus vaccine on mite monosensitive , mild asthma patients . METHODS A double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 26 asthma patients who randomly received vaccination or placebo for 1 year . The levels of exposure to Der p 1 allergen were constant during the study . Allergen bronchial challenge was made at the beginning ( T0 ) and after 1 year of treatment ( T12 ) . The day before and 24 h after the allergen provocation , patients were challenged with methacholine ( Mth ) ( until FEV1 fell by 40 % ) and blood and sputum samples were obtained . Dose-response curves to Mth were evaluated in terms of Mth-PD20 ( dose of Mth that induced 20 % drop in FEV1 ) , slope ( Mth-DRS ) and level of plateau . Blood and sputum eosinophils and serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP ) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) were measured . RESULTS Groups were comparable at the start of the trial . At TI2 , previous to the allergen challenge , the active group showed higher values of both FEV1 and Mth-PD20 and lower values of Mth-DRS . The number of patients presenting a level of plateau increased in the active group ( from two to four ) and decreased in the placebo group ( from two to one ) . At T12 , before the allergen challenge , serum ECP levels increased in the placebo group and blood eosinophils showed a trend towards lower numbers in the active one . The immediate response and the changes in Mth-DRS values , sputum eosinophils and serum ECP levels following the allergen challenge were attenuated in the active group .

Modern medicinal chemistry has come to its bottleneck and is full of challenges, specially when facing with long-term central nervous system (CNS) disorders induced by several factors, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). In order to probe these challenges, multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) design has been applied recently by medicinal scientists trying to get single compounds that can simultaneously modulate multiple targets. In addition, natural products have drawn the attention of drug developers again in recent years, as they have been used by human race for thousands of years and are full of diversity with their concomitant high potential to exhibit biological activities. We hereby review some of the research within the last few years focusing on multiple-target compounds acting in the CNS using natural products as lead resources. The target compounds obtained and described here represent bioactive hybrids either covalently connected or obtained by fusion of different bioactive moieties with at least one part derived from or representing directly natural products, along with some natural compounds themselves showing multiple pharmacological activities. We describe suitable ways to connect the drug components chemically, how to use the approach to enhance biological activity and selectivity, as well as potential drawbacks of the hybrid approach. This review will also show the rationale that these MTDLs are more than just the sum of their components but in many cases should be considered as new pharmacological entities in their own respect.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in the urban community of Dakar, Senegal.                Eligibility criteria were age greater than 15 years, HIV-1 or HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual seropositivity, CD4 cell count lower than 400 copies/mm3, no progressive infection, no previous history of intolerance to sulphonamide, lack of severe anemia or neutropenia, and renal or hepatic failure. Written informed consent was obtained. Recruited patients received 80 mg of trimethoprim and 400 mg of sulphamethoxazole daily or a matching placebo. The main outcomes were survival and the occurrence of clinical events defined as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, bacterial pneumonia, infectious enteritis, bacterial meningitis, urinary tract infection, bacterial otitis and sinusitis, and pyomyositis.                Between September 1996 and March 1998, 297 patients were screened, and 100 were randomized in the study. Demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics of the two groups were similar as was the mean length of follow-up (7.7 months for the cotrimoxazole group vs. 8.0 months for the placebo group). There was no significant difference between the two groups in survival (hazard ratio = 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-1.94) in the probability of severe event occurrence, defined as death or hospital admission (hazard ratio = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.57-2.13), or in the probability of clinical event occurrence (hazard ratio = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.55-2.59). Adjustment for initial CD4 cell count did not change these results. A low dose of cotrimoxazole was tolerated well clinically as well as biologically; only one treatment interruption occurred as the result of a moderate cutaneous eruption (grade 2).                Our study does not show a beneficial effect of chemoprophylaxis with low-dose cotrimoxazole on survival or occurrence of opportunistic or nonopportunistic infections for HIV-1-infected patients in Dakar, Senegal.Title 2:Efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis to decrease morbidity and mortality in HIV-1-infected patients with tuberculosis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: a randomised controlled trial.Abstract 2:There is a high incidence of opportunistic infection among HIV-1-infected patients with tuberculosis in Africa and, consequently, high mortality. We assessed the safety and efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole 800 mg/160 mg (co-trimoxazole) prophylaxis in prevention of such infections and in decrease of morbidity and mortality.                Between October, 1995, and April, 1998, we enrolled 771 HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 and HIV-2 dually seroreactive patients who had sputum-smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (median age 32 years [range 18-64], median CD4-cell count 317 cells/microL) attending Abidjan's four largest outpatient tuberculosis treatment centres. Patients were randomly assigned one daily tablet of co-trimoxazole (n=386) or placebo (n=385) 1 month after the start of a standard 6-month tuberculosis regimen. We assessed adherence to study drug and tolerance monthly for 5 months and every 3 months thereafter, as well as rates of admission to hospital.                Rates of laboratory and clinical adverse events were similar in the two groups. 51 patients in the co-trimoxazole group (13.8/100 person-years) and 86 in the placebo group (25.4/100 person-years) died (decrease In risk 46% [95% CI 23-62], p<0.001). 29 patients on co-trimoxazole (8.2/100 person-years) and 47 on placebo (15.0/100 person-years) were admitted to hospital at least once after randomisation (decrease 43% [10-64]), p=0.02). There were significantly fewer admissions for septicaemia and enteritis in the co-trimoxazole group than in the placebo group.                In HIV-1-infected patients with tuberculosis, daily co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was well tolerated and significantly decreased mortality and hospital admission rates. Our findings may have important implications for improvement of clinical care for such patients in Africa.Title 3:Early chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole for HIV-1-infected adults in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: a randomised trial. Cotrimo-CI Study Group.Abstract 3:In sub-Saharan Africa, various bacterial diseases occur before pneumocystosis or toxoplasmosis in the course of HIV-1 infection, and are major causes of morbidity and mortality. We did a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at community-health centres in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, to assess the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) chemoprophylaxis at early stages of HIV-1 infection.                843 HIV-infected patients were screened and 545 enrolled in the study. Eligible adults (with HIV-1 or HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual seropositivity at stages 2 or 3 of the WHO staging system) received co-trimoxazole chemoprophylaxis (trimethoprim 160 mg, sulphamethoxazole 800 mg) daily or a matching placebo. The primary outcome was the occurrence of severe clinical events, defined as death or hospital admission irrespective of the cause. Analyses were by intention to treat.                Four of the randomised patients were excluded (positive for HIV-2 only). 120 severe events occurred among 271 patients in the co-trimoxazole group and 198 among 270 in the placebo group. Significantly fewer patients in the co-trimoxazole group than in the placebo group had at least one severe event (84 vs 124); the probability of remaining free of severe events was 63.7% versus 45.8% (hazard ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.43-0.75], p=0.0001) and the benefit was apparent in all subgroups of initial CD4-cell count. Survival did not differ between the groups (41 vs 46 deaths, p=0.51). Co-trimoxazole was generally well tolerated though moderate neutropenia occurred in 62 patients (vs 26 in the placebo group).                Patients who might benefit from co-trimoxazole could be recruited on clinical criteria in community clinics without knowing the patients CD4-cell count. This affordable measure will enable quick public-health intervention, while monitoring bacterial susceptibility and haematological tolerance.Title 4:Safety and efficacy of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS.Abstract 4:The safety and efficacy of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were evaluated. Sixty patients with a new diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma and no history of opportunistic infections were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg of trimethoprim twice per day or no therapy. None of the 30 patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim developed P carinii pneumonia. Sixteen of the 30 patients receiving no suppressive therapy developed P carinii pneumonia. Development of P carinii pneumonia was associated with the stage of Kaposi's sarcoma, B subtype disease, and the presence of 0.20 X 10(9)/L (200/mm3) or fewer CD4 cells at study entry. The proportion of patients surviving and the mean length of survival were significantly greater in the treatment group compared with the control group. Adverse reactions occurred in 15 patients (50%).","answer":"In the trials included in the review, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis had a beneficial effect in preventing death and illness episodes in adults with both early and advanced HIV disease.

The molecular basis of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency was investigated in 4 unrelated CETP-deficient families. The high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels of the probands exceeded 150 mg/dl. The plasma of the probands was totally deficient in CETP activity and mass. The genomic DNA of the patients was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using two oligonucleotide primers located in the intron 12 and 14 of the CETP gene, and the amplified products were directly sequenced. Two patients were homozygous for a G-to-A change at the 5-splice donor site of the intron 14. The G-to-A change would cause impaired splicing of pre-messenger RNA. The other two probands were heterozygous for the mutation, but totally lacked CETP. Their lipoprotein patterns were also similar to those of the two homozygotes.

This becomes a crucial limitation when searching for a molecular understanding of the growing number of maternally inherited human diseases correlated with point mutations in tRNA genes. Here we describe the sequence of human mt-tRNAPropurified from placenta. It shows absence of editing events in this tRNA and highlights the presence of eight post-transcriptional modifications. These include T54, never found so far in an animal mt-tRNA, and m1G37, a modification known to have fundamental functional properties in a number of canonical tRNAs. Occurrence of m1G37 was further investigated in an analysis of the substrate properties of in vitro transcripts of human mt-tRNAProtowards pure Escherichia coli methylguanosine transferase. This enzyme properly methylates G37 in mt-tRNA and is sensitive to the presence of a second G at position 36, neighboring the target nucleotide for methylation. Since mutation of nt 36 was shown to be correlated with myopathy, the potential consequences of non-modification or under-modification of mt-tRNA nucleotides in expression of the particular myopathy and of mitochondrial diseases in general are discussed.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"mitochondrial\\", \\"placenta\\", \\"mitochondrial genome\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence.

In whatfollows, we propose a method that uses a human in the loop to directly estimate arbitrary distributions over complex feature spaces, adapting a framework that can exploit advances in deep architectures and computing power to increasingly capture and sharpen the precise structure of human category representations. Such knowledgeis crucial to forming an ecological theory of intelligent categorization behavior and to providing a ground-truth benchmark to guide and inspire future work in machine learning.Our results demonstrate the potential of our method, which leverages both psychological methods and deep surrogate representations to make the problem of capturing human category representations tractable.The flexibility of our method in fitting arbitrary generative models allows us to visualize multi-modal category templates for the first time, and improve on human-based classification performance benchmarks.It is difficult to guarantee that our chains explored enough of the relevant space to actually capture the concepts in their entirety, but the diversity in the modes visualized and the improvement in class separation achieved are positive indications that we are on the right track.Further, the framework we present can be straightforwardly improved as generative image models advance, and a number of known methods for improving the speed, reach, and accuracy of MCMC algorithms can be applied to MCMCP make better use of costly human trials.There are several obvious limitations of our method.First, the structure of the underlying feature spaces used may either lack the expressiveness (some features may be missing) or the constraints (too many irrelevant features or possible images wastes too many trials) needed to map all characteristics of human mental categories in a practical number of trials.Even well-behaved spaces are very large and require many trials to reach convergence.Addressing this will require continuing exploration of a variety of generative image models.We see our work are as part of an iterative refinement process that can yield more granular human observations and inform new deep network","answer":"using deep neural networks and clever algorithms to capture human mental visual concepts"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

It contains 50 real-world sequences comprising more than 100 minutes of video, recorded across dozens of different environments -- ranging from narrow indoor corridors to wide outdoor scenes. All sequences contain mostly exploring camera motion, starting and ending at the same position. This allows to evaluate tracking accuracy via the accumulated drift from start to end, without requiring ground truth for the full sequence. In contrast to existing datasets, all sequences are photometrically calibrated. We provide exposure times for each frame as reported by the sensor, the camera response function, and dense lens attenuation factors. We also propose a novel, simple approach to non-parametric vignette calibration, which requires minimal set-up and is easy to reproduce. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate two existing methods (ORB-SLAM and DSO) on the dataset, including an analysis of the effect of image resolution, camera field of view, and the camera motion direction.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We discuss calibration and removal of \\"vignetting\\" (radial falloff) and exposure (gain) variations from sequences of images. Unique solutions for vignetting, exposure and scene radiances are possible when the response curve is known. When the response curve is unknown, an exponential ambiguity prevents us from recovering these parameters uniquely. However, the vignetting and exposure variations can nonetheless be removed from the images without resolving this ambiguity. Applications include panoramic image mosaics, photometry for material reconstruction, image-based rendering, and preprocessing for correlation-based vision algorithms.[2]: In many computer vision systems, it is assumed that the image brightness of a point directly reflects the scene radiance of the point. However, the assumption does not hold in most cases due to nonlinear camera response function, exposure changes, and vignetting. The effects of these factors are most visible in image mosaics and textures of 3D models where colors look inconsistent and notable boundaries exist. In this paper, we propose a full radiometric calibration algorithm that includes robust estimation of the radiometric response function, exposures, and vignetting. By decoupling the effect of vignetting from the response function estimation, we approach each process in a manner that is robust to noise and outliers. We verify our algorithm with both synthetic and real data, which shows significant improvement compared to existing methods. We apply our estimation results to radiometrically align images for seamless mosaics and 3D model textures. We also use our method to create high dynamic range (HDR) mosaics that are more representative of the scene than normal mosaics.[3]: Creating textured 3D scans of indoor environments has experienced a large boost with the advent of cheap commodity depth sensors. However, the quality of the acquired 3D models is often impaired by color seams in the reconstruction due to varying illumination (e.g., Shadows or highlights) and object surfaces whose brightness and color vary with the viewpoint of the camera. In this paper, we propose a direct and simple method to estimate the pure albedo of the texture, which allows us to remove illumination effects from IR and color images. Our approach first computes the illumination-independent albedo in the IR domain, which we subsequently transfer to the color albedo. As shadows and highlights lead to over- and underexposed image regions with little or no color information, we apply an advanced optimization scheme to infer color information in the color albedo from neigh boring image regions. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to various real-world scenes.[4]: This paper concerns the problem of fully automated panoramic image stitching. Though the 1D problem (single axis of rotation) is well studied, 2D or multi-row stitching is more difficult. Previous approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image sequence in order to establish matching images. In this work, we formulate stitching as a multi-image matching problem, and use invariant local features to find matches between all of the images. Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the input images. It is also insensitive to noise images that are not part of a panorama, and can recognise multiple panoramas in an unordered image dataset. In addition to providing more detail, this paper extends our previous work in the area (Brown and Lowe, 2003) by introducing gain compensation and automatic straightening steps.[5]:","answer":"Many approaches exist to calibrate and remove vignetting artefacts and account for non-linear response functions. Early work focuses on image stitching and mosaicking, where the required calibration parameters need to be estimated from a small set of overlapping images [1] [2] [4] . Since the available data is limited, such methods attempt to find low-dimensional (parametric) function representations, like radially symmetric polynomial representations for vignetting. More recent work [5] [3] has shown that such representations may not be sufficiently expressive to capture the complex nature of real-world lenses and hence advocate non-parametric -- dense -- vignetting calibration. In contrast to [5] [3] , our formulation however does not require a uniformly lit white paper , simplifying the required calibration set-up."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

I have studied the effects of labetalol and dilevalol on the contractile responses of the rat and guinea-pig left atria and rat portal vein. On the guinea-pig left atria low concentrations of labetalol (> or = 10 (-8) M) and of dilevalol (> or = 10 (-7) M) inhibited to a small extent the responses to electrical cardiac stimulation, which is indicative of membrane stabilizing activity. Labetalol (> or = 3 x 10 (-8) M) and dilevalol (> or = 10 (-8) M) caused surmountable antagonism of the isoprenaline responses of the atria and the pA2 values were 8.60 and 8.98 at the beta 1-adrenoceptors of the rat left atria and 7.90 and 8.31, respectively, on the guinea-pig left atria which has functional beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Labetalol and dilevalol (both at > or = 10 (-7) M) attenuated the spontaneous contractile activity of the rat portal vein and the attenuation to labetalol at 10 (-6) M was abolished by ICI 118,551 which illustrates that the labetalol-induced attenuation is beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated. The isoprenaline attenuation responses of the portal vein were inhibited by labetalol and dilevalol (both at > or = 10 (-7) M) and the pA2 value for the labetalol at beta 2-adrenoceptors was 7.59. It is concluded that labetalol and dilevalol are beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonists.","answer":"[[\\"Labetalol\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"beta 1-adrenoceptors\\"], [\\"labetalol\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"beta 1-adrenoceptor\\"], [\\"isoprenaline\\", \\"AGONIST\\", \\"beta 1-adrenoceptors\\"], [\\"dilevalol\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"beta 1-adrenoceptor\\"], [\\"labetalol\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"beta 2-adrenoceptors\\"], [\\"dilevalol\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"beta 1-adrenoceptors\\"], [\\"ICI 118,551\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"beta 2-adrenoceptor\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A new approach to facilitate immobilization and affinity purification of recombinant proteins and selected human B lymphocytes has been developed. Using magnetic beads with attached DNA containing the Escherichia coli lac operator, fusion proteins comprising the DNA-binding lac repressor could be affinity-purified and recovered by gentle elution conditions, such as with a lactose analogue or by enzymatic means using either deoxyribonuclease (DNase) or restriction endonucleases. The results show for the first time that a DNA-binding protein can be used for affinity purification of fusion proteins as exemplified by the specific and gentle recovery of beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase from bacterial lysates using immunomagnetic separation. The approach was further extended to cell separation by the efficient recovery and elution of human CD37 B lymphocytes from peripheral blood.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"human CD37 B lymphocytes\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human B lymphocytes\\", \\"B - lymphocyte cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"DNA\\", \\"Escherichia coli lac operator\\", \\"DNA - binding lac repressor\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"fusion proteins\\", \\"DNA - binding protein\\", \\"beta - galactosidase\\", \\"recombinant proteins\\", \\"restriction endonucleases\\", \\"alkaline phosphatase\\", \\"DNase\\", \\"DNA -\\", \\"deoxyribonuclease\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Topiramate is a widely used antiepileptic agent whose mechanism of action is poorly understood. The drug has been reported to interact with various ion channel types, including AMPA/kainate receptors. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from principal neurons of the rat basolateral amygdala, topiramate at low concentrations (IC50, approximately 0.5 microm) selectively inhibited pharmacologically isolated excitatory synaptic currents mediated by kainate receptors containing the GluR5 subunit. Topiramate also partially depressed predominantly AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs, but with lower efficacy. Topiramate did not alter the degree of facilitation in paired-pulse experiments, and it reduced the amplitude of miniature EPSCs without affecting their frequency, demonstrating that the block of synaptic responses occurs postsynaptically. Inhibition of GluR5 kainate receptors could represent a key mechanism underlying the anticonvulsant activity of topiramate. Moreover, these results support the concept that GluR5 kainate receptors represent a novel target for antiepileptic drug development.","answer":"[[\\"topiramate\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"kainate receptors\\"], [\\"topiramate\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"GluR5\\"], [\\"topiramate\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"kainate receptors\\"], [\\"topiramate\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"GluR5\\"], [\\"topiramate\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"GluR5\\"]]"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Aniridia is a congenital malformation of the eye, chiefly characterised by iris hypoplasia, which can cause blindness. The PAX6 gene was isolated as a candidate aniridia gene by positional cloning from the smallest region of overlap of aniridia-associated deletions. Subsequently PAX6 intragenic mutations were demonstrated in Smalleye, a mouse mutant which is an animal model for aniridia, and six human aniridia patients. In this paper we describe four additional PAX6 point mutations in aniridia patients, both sporadic and familial. These mutations highlight regions of the gene which are essential for normal PAX6 function. In addition, the frequency at which we have found PAX6 mutations suggests that lesions in PAX6 will account for most cases of aniridia..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"Aniridia\\", \\"aniridia\\", \\"blindness\\", \\"iris hypoplasia\\", \\"congenital malformation of the eye\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Previously, we have found that BRN-103, a nicotinamide derivative, inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -mediated angiogenesis signaling in human endothelial cells. During our continuous efforts to identify more potent anti-angiogenic agents, we synthesized various nicotinamide derivatives and evaluated their anti-angiogenic effects. We found that 2-{1-[1- (6-chloro-5-fluoropyrimidin-4-yl) ethyl]piperidin-4-ylamino}-N- (3-chlorophenyl) pyridine-3-carboxamide (BRN-250) significantly inhibited human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration, tube formation, and microvessel growth in a concentration range of 10-100 nM. Furthermore, BRN-250 inhibited the VEGF-induced phosphorylation and intracellular tyrosine kinase activity of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the activation of its downstream AKT pathway.

Recruitment and extravasation of T cells through the blood-brain barrier are favored by adhesion molecule-mediated interactions of circulating T cells with endothelial cells. Since a common pathological finding in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) -associated diseases is the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes into various organs, we have looked for the profile of adhesion molecules expressed by HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that these cells were expressing high levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1 [ CD106 ]), a 110-kDa member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, first identified on endothelial cells stimulated with inflammatory cytokines. This adhesion molecule was also expressed by T cells obtained from one patient with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis but not by activated T cells isolated from one normal blood donor. The role of the viral trans-activator Tax protein in the induction of VCAM-1 was first indicated by the detection of this adhesion molecule on Jurkat T-cell clones stably expressing the tax gene. The effect of Tax on VCAM-1 gene transcription was next confirmed in JPX-9 cells, a subclone of Jurkat cells, carrying the tax sequences under the control of an inducible promoter. Furthermore, deletion and mutation analyses of the VCAM-1 promoter performed with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that Tax was trans activating the VCAM-1 promoter via two NF-kappaB sites present at bp-72 and-57 in the VCAM-1 gene promoter, with both of them being required for the Tax-induced expression of this adhesion molecule. Finally, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the nuclear translocation of proteins specifically bound to these two NF-kappaB motifs, confirming that VCAM-1 was induced on Tax-expressing cells in a kappaB-dependent manner. Collectively, these results therefore suggest that the exclusive Tax-induced expression of VCAM-1 on T cells may represent a pivotal event in the progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"Jurkat T - cell clones\\", \\"Tax - expressing cells\\", \\"JPX - 9 cells\\", \\"Jurkat cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"these cells\\", \\"endothelial cells\\", \\"HTLV - 1 - infected T lymphocytes\\", \\"circulating T cells\\", \\"T cells\\", \\"T lymphocytes\\", \\"HTLV - 1 - transformed T cells\\", \\"activated T cells\\", \\"Jurkat cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"NF - kappaB motifs\\", \\"inducible promoter\\", \\"VCAM - 1 gene promoter\\", \\"vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 gene\\", \\"VCAM - 1 promoter\\", \\"NF - kappaB sites\\", \\"chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs\\", \\"tax sequences\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein\\", \\"immunoglobulin gene superfamily\\", \\"adhesion molecule\\", \\"the viral trans - activator Tax protein\\", \\"vascular cell adhesion molecule 1\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"adhesion molecules\\", \\"inflammatory cytokines\\", \\"Tax\\", \\"CD106\\", \\"VCAM - 1\\", \\"viral trans - activator Tax protein\\", \\"kappaB\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

At low overpotentials, we observe a 2nd order dependence of the O2-reduction rate on the coverage of Cu(phenC), from which we infer that two physically proximal Cu(phenC) bind O2 to form a binuclear Cu2O2 species required for 4-electron reduction. We suggest that a similar binuclear species also forms in the case of Cu(phenP)8,10 but that rate-limiting binding of O2 to the first Cu(phenP) followed by rapid surface diffusion of a second Cu(phenP) has, until now, obscured the binuclear nature of the reaction.</p><p>The covalent attachment of 3-ethynyl-1,10-phenanthroline to an azide-modified glassy carbon electrode to form Cu(phenC) relies on the CuI-catalyzed cycloaddition of azide and ethynyl groups to form a triazole linker, commonly referred to as the click reaction.20,21 The electrode is azide terminated by treating a roughly-ground, heat-treated glassy carbon surface with a solution of IN3 in hexanes, a procedure modified from that first described by Devadoss and Chidsey.22 An XPS survey of the azide-modified surface shows two N 1s peaks at 399 eV and 403 eV in a 2:1 ratio attributable to the azide nitrogens.22-24 Upon exposure to 3-ethynyl-1,10-phenanthroline under the click reaction conditions25, the 403-eV peak disappears and the 399-eV peak broadens, consistent with the formation of the 1,2,3-triazole linker.22,24 XPS peaks at 934 and 953 eV corresponding to the Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 transitions26 and a N-to-Cu coverage ratio of 5.3 ± 0.3 are attributable to a covalently attached Cu(3-(4-triazolyl)-1,10-phenanthroline) complex, Cu(phenC).</p><p>A cyclic voltammogram (CV) of Cu(phenC) on a static glassy carbon electrode shows quasi-reversible reduction and oxidation peaks under anaerobic conditions, which are assigned to the CuII/I redox couple (Figure 1a). The standard redox potential of the complex is taken as the average of the cathodic and anodic peak potentials: ECu0=275±15mV vs. NHE.27 The Cu coverage was varied by controlling the initial azide coverage of the glassy carbon electrode,25 and the amount of immobilized Cu catalyst was determined by Faraday's Law from the CuII/I redox charge, Δq. This value was taken to be the average of the absolute values of the integrated current in the negative and positive scans of the CV corrected by the same scans after the surface was stripped of all copper.28 For the CV presented in Figure 1a, Δq = 21.8 μC, which is equivalent to a coverage of 7.0 × 1014 molecules cm-2. The relatively high surface coverage is consistent with significant roughness of the roughly-ground surface.29</p><p>O2 reduction by Cu(phenC) was measured at a rotating-disk electrode (RDE) at several rotation rates (Figure 1b).30 The currents show an onset of O2 reduction negative of ECu0. The currents are independent of the scan rate at or below 25 mV/s (not shown), but increase with increasing rotation rate as shown. In the limit of high rotation rate, the current is expected to asymptotically approach a potential-dependent kinetic current, iK, independent of the rate of mass transfer to the electrode surface and limited only by O2-binding and reduction kinetics. A Koutecky-Levich plot of the inverse of the current as a function of the inverse square root of the rotation rate yields the inverse of the kinetic current, iK-1, as the intercept (Figure 1b, inset).31 The slope of the Koutecky-Levich plot is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, n, by which O2 is reduced.31 The measured slope in Figure 1b yields n = 3.6,32 suggesting preferential catalysis of 4-electron, rather than 2-electron, reduction of O2.</p><p>The dependence of the rate of O2 reduction on catalyst coverage was determined from the difference in the measured kinetic currents with and without Cu on the electrode surface, ΔiK. This procedure was chosen to compensate for variable redox charge and kinetic current baselines. A plot of ΔiK as a function of Δq measured at 0 mV vs. NHE shows a 2nd order dependence (Figure 2), confirmed by a log/log plot slope of 1.98 (Figure 2, inset).33</p><p>This 2nd order dependence on coverage along with the onset of the O2-reduction current negative of the CuII/I redox potential suggests a potential-dependent rate of reduction of an O2 species ligated by 2 proximal CuI(phenC) sites as presented in Equations 1-3.35 The proximal sites, {2 CuI}, reversibly bind O2 to form {Cu2O2} (Equation 1, Figure 3), followed by a potential-dependent reduction step (Equation 2). Rapid protonation and further reduction regenerate the proximal CuI sites {2 CuI} and release water (Equation 3).36</p><p>The potential-dependent rate constant for the reduction of {Cu2O2}, k2(E), can be expanded using the Butler-Volmer parameterization (Equation 4):</p><p>where k{Cu2O2}0 is the standard rate constant of the electron-transfer reaction, F is Faraday's constant, α is the transfer coefficient typically taken to be 0.5, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and E{Cu2O2}0 is the standard reduction potential of {Cu2O2}.</p><p>At high Cu coverage, the dependence of ΔiK on potential (Figure 4a, solid) approximates the sigmoidal curve expected for an electrocatalytic process that is limited at high overpotential by a non-electrochemical step such as that in Equation 1.31 The deviation from sigmoidal behavior at more negative potentials suggests an additional O2-reduction pathway at greater overpotential. More striking evidence of this pathway is observed at low Cu coverage (Figure 4b, solid) with an approximately exponential rise in O2 reduction below 0 mV vs. NHE.</p><p>We propose that the second O2-reduction pathway is due to site-isolated mononuclear Cu complexes, {CuI}, which reduce O2 by 2 electrons and 2 protons to H2O2 at more negative potentials (Equations 5-7).

The total kinetic current for 4- and 2-electron reduction of O2 expected by the two pathways is given in Equation 8.25</p><p>This model provides a good fit to the observed kinetic currents for O2 reduction by Cu(phenC) at both high and low coverage (Figure 4a-b).</p><p>The 2nd order dependence of O2 reduction on the coverage of Cu(phenC), best observed at positive potentials, is distinct from the 1st order dependence on Cu coverage determined by Anson et al. for Cu(phenP) on edge-plane graphite.10 We have confirmed the Anson result at 0 mV vs. NHE,25 and have previously reported that there is no rate-limiting step for electrocatalytic O2 reduction by Cu(phenP) subsequent to O2 binding. 19, 38 In the physisorbed case, the expected high surface lateral mobility of Cu(phenP)39 will ensure that once one Cu(phenP) coordinates O2, another Cu(phenP) will be able to combine rapidly in an unconstrained manner to form a Cu2O2(phenP)2 complex. This would lead to the observed 1st order dependence on the Cu coverage if all reduction and protonation steps beyond the peroxide level intermediate are fast.</p><p>In conclusion, controlling the coverage of a covalently attached electrocatalyst allows for detailed mechanistic study of electrocatalytic processes. Here, this method yields evidence that the electrocatalytic 4-electron reduction of O2 to water by adsorbed discrete Cu catalysts requires two proximal CuI sites to coordinate and efficiently reduce O2. A general mechanism is proposed for electrocatalytic O2 reduction by adsorbed Cu catalysts that is consistent with both the observed 2nd order rate dependence on Cu coverage for covalently-immobilized Cu(phen) and the observed 1st order rate dependence on Cu coverage for physisorbed Cu(phen). This study suggests that having a polynuclear assembly is the key to attain 4-electron reduction of O2 at low overpotentials.</p>","answer":"A CuI complex of 3-ethynyl-phenanthroline covalently immobilized to an azide-modified glassy carbon surface is an active electrocatalyst for the 4-electron reduction of O2 to H2O. The rate of O2 reduction is 2nd order in Cu coverage at moderate overpotential, suggesting that two CuI species are necessary for efficient 4-electron reduction of O2. Mechanisms for O2 reduction are proposed that are consistent with the observations for this covalently immobilized system and previously reported results for a similar physisorbed CuI system."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Incidence and case fatality rate are significantly higher among elderly individuals (age>60 years), type 2 diabetes and hypertension patients. Cellular receptor ACE2, serine protease TMPRSS2 and exopeptidase CD26 (also known as DPP4) are the three membrane bound proteins potentially implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesised that common variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 may play critical role in infection susceptibility of predisposed population or group of individuals. Coding (missense) and regulatory variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 were studied across 26 global populations. Two missense and five regulatory SNPs were identified to have differential allelic frequency. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) signature was observed in different populations. Modelled protein-protein interaction (PPI) predicted strong molecular interaction between these two receptors and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 domain). However, two missense SNPs, rs12329760 (TMPRSS2) and rs1129599 (CD26), were not found to be involved physically in the said interaction. Four regulatory variants (rs112657409, rs11910678, rs77675406 and rs713400) from TMPRSS2 were found to influence the expression of TMPRSS2 and pathologically relevant MX1. rs13015258 a 50 UTR variant from CD26 have significant role in regulation of expression of key regulatory genes that could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Overexpression of CD26 through epigenetic modification at rs13015258-C allele was found critical and could explain the higher SARS-CoV-2 infected fatality rate among type 2 diabetes.","answer":"[\\"Mechanism\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

old patient visited the department of general surgery complaining of sudden abdominal pain after experiencing intermittent nausea and vomiting for a few days . tenderness and rebound tenderness in the right lower portion of her abdomen was observed upon physical examination .the operation was performed with the patient in a supine position while under general anesthesia .an incision was made 1 cm below the umbilicus , and a trocar 11 cm in length was inserted after pneumoperitoneum was induced using a veress needle .next , 5 mm trocars were inserted around the suprapubic area and anti - mcburney 's point .the appendix was extracted with laparoscopic forceps and the mesoappendix was removed by laparoscopic electric cautery .the base of the appendix was ligated with two endo - loops ( covidien co. ltd . ,mansfield , ma , usa ) and a 10 mm distal region of the base was also clipped with a laparoscopic clip .two days after the operation , the patient complained of hypesthesia and weakness in the right lower extremity .the patient was transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine , and a neurological examination was performed .the ability to sense pain and temperature were normal , but the sense of light touch was abnormal between the t11 and l2 dermatome , indicative of hypesthesia .muscle strength of right hip flexor , knee extensor , and knee flexor was reduced to 2/5 , but the strength of other muscles was unchanged according to a manual muscle test .pelvic and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) was performed in order to evaluate the cause of lower limb paralysis .the patient complained of pain around the surgical site , and paralysis of the right lower extremity persisted for 10 days after surgery .muscle strength of the right hip flexor , knee extensor , and knee flexor was still decreased in the follow - up manual muscle test . an electrodiagnostic study ( emg )nerve conduction and needle electromyography results appeared normal , except that the interference pattern of motor unit action potential in the muscles was decreased at maximal volition .rehabilitation training was performed by the patient for 40 minutes twice a day with a physical therapist since being transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine .the patient indicated that she liked ' taekwondo ' and desired to become a taekwondo athlete .therefore , functional training , including balance and posture exercises related to taekwondo , was performed continuously .. the sense of balance when in specific positions also improved while functional training was performed .on postoperative day 14 , tenderness around the right lower quadrant of the abdomen was still observed and the degree of the pain was 6 on the visual analogue scale . because the pain around the operation site and right lower abdomen persisted , a general surgery consultation was performed to evaluate the presence or absence of laparoscopic complications .however , the operation wound was found to be well healed , and no abscesses or mass lesions were found by follow - up abdominal computed tomography . on postoperative day 20 , a follow - up emg was performed in which no significant interval changes were observed , and the results were the same as the previous emg .therefore , peripheral nerve lesions and myopathy were ruled out as the cause of paralysis .brain , cervical , and thoracic mri was performed in order to detect disorders of the central nervous system , but definite abnormal findings were not observed .we subsequently decided to explore the possibility of psychological problems after organ damage , including nerve or muscle injury , was ruled out as the cause of paralysis .an interview with the patient 's parents was conducted on postoperative day 21 . according tothe results of the interview , the patient was having trouble adjusting to school and her parents had visited the school several times to meet with her teacher .the patient hoped to move to another school that has a taekwondo club in order to be an athlete , but the patient 's parents were against the idea .on postoperative day 22 , significant improvement of the leg strength was not observed but the patient could independently walk from the general ward to the rehabilitation clinic .although right hip flexor strength was still 2/5 the normal level , her lower extremities moved well without claudication from the stance to swing phase during gait training .on postoperative day 23 , we interviewed with the patient 's parents and explained that a conversion disorder could be a possible cause of paralysis .the parents were encouraged to resolve the conflict concerning the patient 's career path through continuous psychiatric consultation . the patient was discharged .paralysis of the patient 's lower extremity improved gradually and the patient returned to normal life .laparoscopic surgery is widely performed instead of open appendectomy due to many advantages , such as diagnostic help , shorter hospitalization periods , reduced post - operative pain , decreased need for analgesics , fewer cases of wound infection , and improved cosmetic results.1 ) however , direct organ injuries , vascular injury , wound infection , hernia formation , tumor seeding , and endometriosis resulting from laparoscopic surgery have been reported.2 ) although rare , paralysis due to nerve injury may also occur owing to positional injury , trocar injury , peritoneal adhesion , or pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic surgery.3 ) if organ problems or physical disorders are ruled out as the cause of sensorimotor dysfunction appearing after laparoscopic surgery , a conversion disorder might be the cause of limb paralysis.4,5 ) we came across a case of paralysis of the lower extremity after laparoscopic appendectomy . although a complete workup was performed in order to uncover the cause , no organ problems could be found .therefore , we investigated the possibility that the paralysis may be due to psychological problems .we were aware that the patient was coming into conflict with her parents over the patient 's career path and was having trouble adjusting to school .according to the diagnostic criteria of conversion disorder in the dsm - iv,6 ) we diagnosed the patient as having conversion disorder due to the motor weakness of the right lower extremity and decision of her career .in addition , there were no organ injuries causing limb paralysis in spite of multilateral evaluations , absences from school due to gait disturbance , and points that were not explained by other symptoms of mental illness .conversion disorder is a type of somatoform disorder that causes dyssynergia , tremor , dystonia , or paralysis of one or more extremities .this condition is also known as chronic neurosis , psychosomatic disorder , functional disorder , or functional overlay.7 ) conversion disorder is characterized by motor or sensory symptoms accompanied by psychological factors .functional loss is not intentional or related to general medical problems.8 ) conversion disorder must be distinguished from malingering , in which symptoms occur intentionally and are related to secondary gain .one characteristic of conversion disorder is that somatic symptoms are not provoked by intent.9 ) ten percent to 23% of patients with conversion disorder have paralysis of limbs as a major symptom.10 ) patients with conversion disorder are more likely amicable , cooperative , and reliant than malingerers and accept evaluation and treatment gladly .patients with conversion disorder are more likely to report historical gaps , incorrect , and unpredictable changes , whereas malingerers are more likely to provide extremely thorough and definite explanations of their experiences precipitating their illness.11 ) the patient cooperated well with medical examination and there were vagaries about her symptoms and signs .these factors were helpful in differentiating the diagnosis from malingering . for patients with paralytic symptoms due to conversion disorder ,hospitalization is required for a few day or months , and functional recovery is good.4 ) not much research has been conducted on the outcomes or long - term prognosis of conversion disorder in children and adolescents .it has been reported that many conversion disorder symptoms spontaneously improve after a few days or weeks or require minimal intervention .it was also found that the rates of clinical improvement are good , ranging from 56% to 100% .in particular , a good prognosis is associated with young age , fast diagnosis , rapid identification of stressors , and a good relationship with family members.12 ) however , it must be noted that the clinical symptoms may be perpetuated if diagnostic tests were performed aggressively in order to identify the causes , but the cause is not detected at an early stage .symptoms are also more likely to be chronic by excessive concern from family or medical staff.13 ) in the current study , we only considered the possibility of organic problems soon after the onset of symptoms and thus conducted several diagnostic tests .however , the cause was not identified with these methods and the patient 's family became increasingly concerned .fortunately , we determined that the cause was a stressor related to a conflict regarding the patient 's career path .furthermore , a close relationship was formed between the family members and the parents with respect to the patient 's desire to become a ' taekwondo ' athlete .this is thought to be an important step as the patient 's symptoms were not chronic and completely resolved within 2 months .treatments for conversion disorder include group or individual psychotherapy , medications , and rehabilitation therapies.4 ) rehabilitation therapy for patients with paralysis generally includes strengthening exercises for the paralytic muscles , stretching exercises to maintain range of motion for each joint , and functional training to improve gait or transfer .it is important to provide this treatment while not showing excessive concern or reinforcing abnormal gait patterns caused by paralysis that is associated with conversion disorder . in particular , kanarek et al.4 ) reported that it is important to plan task - oriented goals based on functional training while considering the patient 's interests in order to improve the patient 's function .rehabilitation training that included muscle - strengthening exercises and functional gait training was conducted for 40 minutes twice a day with a physical therapist .functional training , with balance and posture exercises relating to taekwondo , was also performed continuously considering the patient 's interest .we believe that a good rapport with the patient through these therapies prevented the development of sequelae associated with conversion disorder and promoted functional improvement .","answer":"limb paralysis can develop for various reasons .  we found a 13-year -

The need for annual revaccination against influenza is a burden on the healthcare system, leads to low vaccination rates and makes timely vaccination difficult against pandemic strains, such as during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In an effort toward achieving a broadly protective vaccine that provides cross-protection against multiple strains of influenza, this study developed a microneedle patch to co-immunize with A/PR8 influenza hemagglutinin DNA and A/PR8 inactivated virus vaccine. We hypothesize that this dual component vaccination strategy administered to the skin using microneedles will provide cross-protection against other strains of influenza. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel coating formulation that did not require additional excipients to increase coating solution viscosity by using the DNA vaccine itself to increase viscosity and thereby enable thick coatings of DNA vaccine and inactivated virus vaccine on metal microneedles. Co-immunization in this way not only generated robust antibody responses against A/PR8 influenza but also generated robust heterologous antibody responses against pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza in mice. Challenge studies showed complete cross-protection against lethal challenge with live pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus. Control experiments using A/PR8 inactivated influenza virus vaccine with placebo DNA coated onto microneedles produced lower antibody titers and provided incomplete protection against challenge. Overall, this is the first study showing DNA solution as a microneedle coating agent and demonstrating cross-protection by co-immunization with inactivated virus and DNA vaccine using coated microneedles.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Event driven architecture is a paradigm shift from traditional computing architectures which employ synchronous, request-response interactions. In this paper we introduce a conceptual architecture for what can be considered the next phase of that evolution: proactive event-driven computing. Proactivity refers to the ability to mitigate or eliminate undesired future events, or to identify and take advantage of future opportunities, by applying prediction and automated decision making technologies. We investigate an extension of the event processing conceptual model and architecture to support proactive event-driven applications, and propose the main building blocks of a novel architecture. We first describe several extensions to the existing event processing functionality that is required to support proactivity; next, we extend the event processing agent model to include two more type of agents: predictive agents that may derive future uncertain events based on prediction models, and proactive agents that compute the best proactive action that should be taken. Those building blocks are demonstrated through a comprehensive scenario that deals with proactive decision making, ensuring timely delivery of critical material for a production plant. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Complex Event Processing deals with the detection of complex events based on rules and patterns defined by domain experts. Many complex events require real-time detection in order to have enough time for appropriate reactions. However, there are several events (e.g. credit card fraud) that should be prevented proactively before they occur, not just responded after they happened. In this paper, we briefly describe Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Predictive Analytics (PA). Afterwards, we focus on a major future direction of CEP, namely the inclusion of PA technologies into CEP tools and applications. Involving PA opens a wide range of possibilities in several application fields. However, we have observed that only few solutions apply PA techniques. In this paper, we define a conceptual framework which combines CEP and PA and which can be the basis of generic design pattern in the future. The conceptual framework is demonstrated in a proof--of--concept experiment. Finally we provide the results and lessons learned. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  In this paper, we present a framework for parsing video events with stochastic Temporal And-Or Graph (T-AOG) and unsupervised learning of the T-AOG from video. This T-AOG represents a stochastic event grammar. The alphabet of the T-AOG consists of a set of grounded spatial relations including the poses of agents and their interactions with objects in the scene. The terminal nodes of the T-AOG are atomic actions which are specified by a number of grounded relations over image frames. An And-node represents a sequence of actions. An Or-node represents a number of alternative ways of such concatenations. The And-Or nodes in the T-AOG can generate a set of valid temporal configurations of atomic actions, which can be equivalently represented as the language of a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG). For each And-node we model the temporal relations of its children nodes to distinguish events with similar structures but different temporal patterns and interpolate missing portions of events. This makes the T-AOG grammar context-sensitive. We propose an unsupervised learning algorithm to learn the atomic actions, the temporal relations and the And-Or nodes under the information projection principle in a coherent probabilistic framework. We also propose an event parsing algorithm based on the T-AOG which can understand events, infer the goal of agents, and predict their plausible intended actions. In comparison with existing methods, our paper makes the following contributions. (i) We represent events by a T-AOG with hierarchical compositions of events and the temporal relations between the sub-events. (ii) We learn the grammar, including atomic actions and temporal relations, automatically from the video data without manual supervision. (iii) Our algorithm infers the goal of agents and predicts their intents by a top-down process, handles events insertion and multi-agent events, keeps all possible interpretations of the video to preserve the ambiguities, and achieves the globally optimal parsing solution in a Bayesian framework. (iv) The algorithm uses event context to improve the detection of atomic actions, segment and recognize objects in the scene. Extensive experiments, including indoor and out door scenes, single and multiple agents events, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  This paper focuses on event prediction in an event sequence, particularly on distant event prediction. We aim at mining episode rules with a consequent temporally distant from the antecedent and with a minimal antecedent. To reach this goal, we propose an algorithm that determines the consequent of an episode rule at an early stage in the mining process, and that applies a span constraint on the antecedent and a gap constraint between the antecedent and the consequent. This algorithm has a complexity lower than that of state of the art algorithms, as it is independent of the gap between the antecedent and the consequent. In addition, the determination of the consequent at an early stage allows to filter out many non relevant rules early in the process, which results in an additional significant decrease of the running time. A new confidence measure is proposed, the temporal confidence, which evaluates the confidence of a rule in relation to the predefined gap. The temporal confidence is used to mine rules with a consequent that occurs mainly at a given distance. The algorithm is evaluated on an event sequence of social networks messages. We show that our algorithm mines minimal rules with a distant consequent, while requiring a small computation time. We also show that these rules can be used to accurately predict distant events. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  We present a novel algorithm for finding patterns in data streams.We maximise memory usage in order to achieve higher accuracy.We generate reliable on-the-fly predictions for future events in the stream. Recently, new emerging applications, such as web click-stream mining, failure forecast and traffic analysis, introduced a new challenging data model referred to as data streams. Mining such data can reveal up-to-date patterns, which are useful for predicting future events. Consequently, pattern mining in data streams is a popular field in data mining that presents unique challenges. The data is large and endlessly keeps on coming, making it impossible to store it, or to re-analyse historical data once it has been discarded. To solve this, we first present a novel method for mining sequential patterns from a data stream, in which we maximise memory usage in order to achieve higher accuracy in terms of results. In a second step, we use the discovered patterns in order to try to predict future events. We propose a number of ways to assign a score to each pattern in order to generate predictions. The prediction performance of these scoring strategies is then extensively experimentally evaluated. The predictor offers an opportunity for a faster detection and response to an important, though perhaps unexpected, event, which will occur in the future.Literature Review:","answer":"As a final note, we briefly discuss the issue of event forecasting. The field of predictive analytics has gained considerable traction in the past years. Having the ability to forecast that an event will probably occur in the future, given a history of past SDEs, could allow a system to make proactive decisions. The need for event forecasting as a means for proactive behavior has led to proposals about how forecasting could be conceptualized and integrated within a CE processing system. However, such proposals still remain largely at a conceptual level, without providing concrete algorithms BIB002 BIB003 . Most systems for probabilistic CER do not yet possess any forecasting capabilities (Pei et al. BIB004 is an exception). Some relevant but nonrelational methods for forecasting have been developed within the field of temporal mining (for a relatively old review, see Laxman and Sastry  , and for some more recent attempts at event forecasting, see Fahed et al BIB005 , Laxman et al. BIB001 , and Zhou et al. BIB006 ). Relational forecasting, involving events with complex dependencies, is a research area that remains largely unexplored."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

tolerant microbes were frequently isolated ,it was suggested that alternative medicaments may be sometimes needed to resolve the infection to gain healing .it is bacteriostatic while at higher concentration it is bactericidal as it brings about coagulation and precipitation of cytoplasm .chx gluconate gel has been extensively used in dentistry mainly as an intracanal medicament . in this modern era of dentistryuse of plant parts as folklore medicine has been trailed by traditional healers since time immemorial . who has reported that 80% of world 's population relies mainly on traditional therapies .there are many advantages of using herbs as antimicrobials : ( a ) they have fewer side effects ; ( b ) less expensive ; ( c ) better patient tolerance ; and ( d ) renewable in nature . throughout asia , traditional medicinehas long used turmeric as an anti - inflammatory , anti - oxidant , anti - microbial agent to deal with a wide range of conditions .ajwain , the bishop 's weed containing thymol , the major phenolic compound renders it good germicidal and anti -

Interpretive bias is an essential feature of learning and understanding but also something that can be used to pervert or subvert the truth. The framework we develop here provides tools for understanding and analyzing the range of interpretive biases and the factors that contribute to them.The model of interpretive biasAs mentioned in Section SECREF1 , understanding interpretive bias requires two ingredients. First, we need to know what it is to interpret a text or to build a history over a set of facts. Our answer comes from analyzing discourse structure and interpretation in SDRT BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . A history for a text connects its elementary information units, units that convey propositions or describe events, using semantic relations that we call discourse relations to construct a coherent and connected whole. Among such relations are logical, causal, evidential, sequential and resemblance relations as well as relations that link one unit with an elaboration of its content. It has been shown in the literature that discourse structure is an important factor in accurately extracting sentiments and opinions from text BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , and our examples show that this is the case for interpretive bias as well.Epistemic ME gamesThe second ingredient needed to understand interpretive bias is the connection between on the one hand the purpose and assumption behind telling a story and on the other the particular way in which that story is told. A history puts the entities to be understood into a structure that serves certain purposes or conversational goals BIBREF18 . Sometimes the history attempts to get at the “truth”, the true causal and taxonomic structure of a set of events. But a history may also serve other purposes—e.g., to persuade, or to dupe an audience. Over the past five years, BIBREF4 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 have developed an account of conversational purposes or goals and how they guide strategic reasoning in a framework called Message Exchange (ME) Games. ME games provide a general and formally precise framework for not only the analysis of conversational purposes and conversational strategies, but also for the typology of dialogue games from BIBREF22 and finally for the analysis of strategies for achieving what we would intuitively call “unbiased interpretation”, as we shall see in the next section. In fact in ME Games, conversational goals are analyzed as properties, and hence sets, of conversations; these are the conversations that “go well” for the player. ME games bring together the linguistic analysis of SDRT with a game theoretic approach to strategic reasoning; in an ME game, players alternate making sequences of discourse moves such as those described in SDRT, and a player wins if the conversation constructed belongs to her winning condition, which is a subset of the set of all possible conversational plays. ME games are designed to analyze the interaction between conversational structure, purposes and assumptions, in the absence of assumptions about cooperativity or other cognitive hypotheses, which can cause problems of interpretability in other frameworks BIBREF23 . ME games also assume a Jury that sets the winning conditions and thus evaluates whether the conversational moves made by players or conversationalists are successful or not. The Jury can be one or both of the players themselves or some exogenous body.To define an ME game, we first fix a finite set of players INLINEFORM0 and let INLINEFORM1 range over INLINEFORM2 . For simplicity, we consider here the case where there are only two players, that is INLINEFORM3 , but the notions can be easily lifted to the case where there are more than two players. Here, Player INLINEFORM4 will denote the opponent of Player INLINEFORM5 . We need a vocabulary INLINEFORM6 of moves or actions; these are the discourse moves as defined by the language of SDRT. The intuitive idea behind an ME game is that a conversation proceeds in turns where in each turn one of the players \`speaks' or plays a string of elements from INLINEFORM7 . In addition, in the case of conversations, it is essential to keep track of “who says what”. To model this, each player INLINEFORM8 was assigned a copy INLINEFORM9 of the vocabulary INLINEFORM10 which is simply given as INLINEFORM11 . As BIBREF4 argues, a conversation may proceed indefinitely, and so conversations correspond to plays of ME games, typically denoted as INLINEFORM12 , which are the union of finite or infinite sequences in INLINEFORM13 , denoted as INLINEFORM14 and INLINEFORM15 respectively. The set of all possible conversations is thus INLINEFORM16 and is denoted as INLINEFORM17 . [ME game BIBREF4 ] A Message Exchange game (ME game), INLINEFORM18 , is a tuple INLINEFORM19 where INLINEFORM20 is a Jury. Due to the ambiguities in language, discourse moves in SDRT are underspecified formulas that may yield more than one fully specified discourse structure or histories for the conversation; a resulting play in an ME game thus forms one or more histories or complete discourse structures for the entire conversation.To make ME games into a truly realistic model of conversation requires taking account of the limited information available to conversational participants. BIBREF0 imported the notion of a type space from epistemic game theory BIBREF24 to take account of this. The type of a player INLINEFORM0 or the Jury is an abstract object that is used to code-up anything and everything about INLINEFORM1 or the Jury, including her behavior, the way she strategizes, her personal biases, etc. BIBREF24 . Let INLINEFORM2 denote the set of strategies for Player INLINEFORM3 in an ME game; let INLINEFORM4 ; and let INLINEFORM5 be the set of strategies of INLINEFORM6 given play INLINEFORM7 . [Harsanyi type space BIBREF24 ] A Harsanyi type space for INLINEFORM8 is a tuple INLINEFORM9 such that INLINEFORM10 and INLINEFORM11 , for each INLINEFORM12 , are non-empty (at-most countable) sets called the Jury-types and INLINEFORM13 -types respectively and INLINEFORM14 and INLINEFORM15 are the beliefs of Player INLINEFORM16 and the Jury respectively at play INLINEFORM17 . BIBREF0 defines the beliefs of the players and Jury using the following functions. [Belief function] For every play INLINEFORM18 the (first order) belief INLINEFORM19 of player INLINEFORM20 at INLINEFORM21 is a pair of measurable functions INLINEFORM22 where INLINEFORM23 is the belief function and INLINEFORM24 is the interpretation function defined as: INLINEFORM25 INLINEFORM26 where INLINEFORM0 is the set of probability distributions over the corresponding set. Similarly the (first order) belief INLINEFORM1 of the Jury is a pair of measurable functions INLINEFORM2 where the belief function INLINEFORM3 and the interpretation function INLINEFORM4 are defined as: INLINEFORM5 INLINEFORM6  Composing INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 together over their respective outputs reveals a correspondence between interpretations of plays and types for a fixed Jury type INLINEFORM2 : every history yields a distribution over types for the players and every tuple of types for the players and the Jury fixes a distribution over histories. We'll call this the types/history correspondence.An epistemic ME game is an ME game with a Harsanyi type space and a type/history correspondence as we've defined it. By adding types to an ME game, we provide the beginnings of a game theoretic model of interpretive bias that we believe is completely new. Our definition of bias is now: [Interpretive Bias] An interpretive bias in an epistemic ME game is the probability distribution over types given by the belief function of the conversationalists or players, or the Jury. Note that in an ME game there are typically several interpretive biases at work: each player has her own bias, as does the Jury.Outside of language, statisticians study bias; and sample bias is currently an important topic. To do so, they exploit statistical models with a set of parameters and random variables, which play the role of our types in interpretive bias. But for us, the interpretive process is already well underway once the model, with its constraints, features and explanatory hypotheses, is posited; at least a partial history, or set of histories, has already been created.The ME model in BIBREF0 not only makes histories dependent on biases but also conditionally updates an agent's bias, the probability distribution, given the interpretation of the conversation or more generally a course of events as it has so far unfolded and crucially as the agent has so far interpreted it. This means that certain biases are reinforced as a history develops, and in turn strengthen the probability of histories generated by such biases in virtue of the types/histories correspondence. We now turn to an analysis of SECREF3 discussed in BIBREF4 , BIBREF0 where arguably this happens.Question: Which interpretative biases are analyzed in this paper?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"in an ME game there are typically several interpretive biases at work: each player has her own bias, as does the Jury\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"An epistemic ME game is an ME game with a Harsanyi type space and a type/history correspondence as weu0027ve defined it.

These cytokines provide the initial host defense mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, can be induced by hepatitis C virus( HCV) in its host cells in a biphasic manner. The initial induction of TNF-α by HCV was prompt and could be blocked by the antibody directed against the HCV E2 envelope protein and by chemicals that inhibit endocytosis, indicating the specificity of endocytic uptake of HCV in this induction. Further studies indicated that the induction of TNF-α was dependent on toll-like receptors 7 and 8( TLR7/8) but not on other intracellular pattern recognition receptors. Consistently, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of the downstream effectors in the TLR7/8 signaling pathway including MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, TAK1 and p65 NF-κB suppressed the expression of TNF-α. The role of p65 NF-κB in the induction of TNF-α via transcriptional up-regulation was further confirmed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. TNF-α induced by HCV could activate its own receptor TNFR1 on hepatocytes to suppress HCV replication. This suppressive effect of TNF-α on HCV was due to its role in supporting interferon signaling, as the suppression of its expression led to the loss of IFNAR2 and impaired interferon signaling and the induction of interferon-stimulated genes. In conclusion, our results indicate that hepatocytes can sense HCV infection via TLR7/8 to induce the expression of TNF-α, which inhibits HCV replication via an autocrine mechanism to support interferon signaling.Introduction:Hepatitis C virus( HCV) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of 9. 6-Kb[1]. After binding to its receptors on hepatocytes, HCV is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and its genomic RNA is subsequently released into the cytosol to direct the synthesis of viral proteins using the internal ribosome entry site( IRES) located near its 5’-end. This leads to the production of a polyprotein with a length of approximately 3000 amino acids. The HCV polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved by host and viral proteases to give rise to individual viral proteins including the core protein, E1 and E2 envelope proteins, the p7 viroporin, and nonstructural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B[2]. Pattern recognition receptors( PRRs) including toll-like receptors( TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors are important components of the innate immune response. Upon the activation by the pathogen-associated molecular patterns( PAMPs), these PRRs induce the expression of various cytokines via the downstream signaling pathways. Some TLRs are located on the cellular surface and sense extracellular PAMPs and some TLRs are located in the endosomes to detect internalized pathogens[3]. The TLR signaling is mediated by the TIR domain-containing cytosolic adaptors MyD88, TIRAP/Mal and TRIF. The initial association of MyD88 to the receptor leads to the sequential recruitment and activation of IRAK4 and IRAK1. The activated IRAK1 then binds to TRAF6, after which the complex dissociates from the receptor for further signaling events including the activation of TAK1. TAK1 can activate NF-κB and AP1 to stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IRAK1 and TRAF6 can also activate IRF7 to induce the expression of type I interferons( IFNs)[4, 5]. Tumor necrosis factor-α( TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced in response to infectious pathogens. The soluble TNF-α is produced as a result of cleavage from its precursor transmembrane TNF-α by the TNF-α-converting enzyme( TACE). The secreted TNFα binds to its receptors, namely TNFR1 and TNFR2, to exert its biological effects[6]. Multiple studies indicate that the blood level of TNF-α is increased in HCV patients and its level is positively correlated with HCV pathogenesis and the severity of liver diseases[7–9]. The major source of TNF-α in response to HCV infection is unclear and thought to be immune cells such as T lymphocytes and macrophages[10, 11]. In this report, we provide evidence to demonstrate that hepatocytes can also produce TNF-α in response to HCV infection. This TNF-α induction is prompt and mediated by TLR7 and TLR8. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that TNF-α, through an autocrine mechanism, prevents the depletion of IFNAR2 by HCV and is required to support interferon signaling in HCV-infected cells.Discussion:HCV patients have an elevated serum level of TNF-α, and this level is positively correlated with the severity of liver diseases[7–9]. The source of TNF-α is unclear, but it is generally assumed that it is produced by immune cells such as macrophages[27]. In this report, we demonstrated that TNF-α could also be induced in HCV-infected cells. Although the amount of TNF-α produced by HCV-infected hepatocytes might be lower than that produced by professional immune cells such as macrophages[28], it was sufficient to trigger an inhibitory response on HCV replication. Our finding is consistent with a previous report, which described an increased level of TNF-α in the hepatocytes of HCV patients[9]. The induction of TNF-α by HCV was specific, as it could be blocked by the antibody that neutralized the infectivity of HCV( Fig 2C). This induction was biphasic, with the first phase of induction peaked at 2 hours post-infection( Fig 2A). The induction of TNF-α in the first phase was dependent on TLR7/8( Fig 4A) and required no HCV gene expression or replication( Fig 2E). As TLR7 and TLR8 are activated by ssRNA, HCV either has to release the viral genomic RNA into endosomes during endocytosis to activate TLR7/8 or the HCV genomic RNA released into the cytosol after uncoating must be delivered immediately back into the endosomes. We favor the first scenario, as, if HCV RNA is released first into the cytosol, then it will likely also activate RIG-I and/or MDA5, which are cytosolic PRRs. However, we found that these two PRRs did not play a significant role in the induction of TNF-α( S3A Fig). If HCV indeed activates TLR7/8 during endocytosis, then the HCV virion must be disintegrated during this process for the genomic RNA to be released. This may be triggered by the acidic content of endosomes/lysosomes, which may destabilize HCV virion to release the viral RNA. The activation of the TLR7/8 signaling pathway by HCV led to the activation of NF-κB( Fig 5A). This pathway was required for the induction of TNF-α by HCV in the first phase. The induction of TNF-α in the second phase also required NF-κB, as the depletion of p65 NF-κB also suppressed the second-phase induction of TNF-α by HCV( Fig 5C). It does not appear likely that this second-phase induction of TNF-α was due to the second-round of infection by progeny virus particles, as this second-phase induction of TNF-α was long-lasting( Fig 1A). A number of factors had been shown in the past to activate NF-κB in HCV-infected cells. These factors include TLR3 and protein kinase R( PKR), which could both be activated by the double-stranded HCV RNA replicative intermediates[29, 30]. These factors are likely the reasons why HCV was also able to induce TNF-α in the later phase of infection. TNF-α induced by HCV suppressed HCV replication( Fig 6A). Our results indicated that this was likely due to its role in interferon signaling and the induction of ISGs( Fig 7A and 7B). We found that both TNF-α and TNFR1 participated in IFN signaling by maintaining the stability of IFNAR2, as in the absence of either one of them, IFNAR2 was lost in HCV-infected cells( Fig 7D), apparently due to degradation by proteasomes( S15 Fig). How HCV induced the degradation of IFNAR2 and how TNF-α antagonized this effect of HCV are interesting questions that remain to be determined. It is noteworthy that the degradation of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 had previously been shown to be regulated by different mechanisms[31], and thus the selective degradation of IFNAR2 by HCV without affecting IFNAR1 was not unexpected. Nevertheless, our results reveal an interesting interplay between the virus and the host cell, with the virus attempting to blunt the IFN response by depleting IFNAR2 and the host cell overcoming this blunting effect of HCV by using TNF-α to restore the expression of IFNAR2. Although our results indicated that TNF-α could support IFN signaling to suppress HCV replication in cell cultures, the role of TNF-α in HCV replication and pathogenesis in vivo may be more complicated. This is due in part to our observation that TNF-α suppressed apoptosis of HCV-infected cells( S13 Fig), which would favor HCV persistence, in part to the pro-inflammatory activities of this cytokine, and in part to a recent report that TNF-α could depolarize liver cells to enhance HCV entry[28]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that TNF-α induced in the first phase may enhance HCV entry whereas it induced in the second phase may suppress HCV replication. This may explain why in the clinical trial of a limited number of HCV patients, the TNF-α inhibitor Etanercept was found to improve the therapeutic effect of IFN-α and ribavirin on HCV rather than to suppress it[32].","answer":"Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) patients have increased levels of circulating tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) .

Sleep problems in ASD predict the severity of ASD core diagnostic symptoms and have a considerable impact on the quality of life of caregivers. Little is known, however, about the underlying molecular mechanisms of sleep problems in ASD. We investigated the role of Shank3, a high confidence ASD gene candidate, in sleep architecture and regulation. We show that mice lacking exon 21 of Shank3 have problems falling asleep even when sleepy. Using RNA-seq we show that sleep deprivation increases the differences in prefrontal cortex gene expression between mutants and wild types, downregulating circadian transcription factors Per3, Bhlhe41, Hlf, Tef, and Nr1d1. Shank3 mutants also have trouble regulating wheel-running activity in constant darkness. Overall, our study shows that Shank3 is an important modulator of sleep and clock gene expression.Introduction:Autism Spectrum Disorder( ASD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in the United States( diagnosed in 1 in 59 children[Baio et al., 2018]). The core symptoms of ASD include social and communication deficits, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors( American Psychiatric Association, 2013). In addition, several studies show that individuals with ASD report a variety of co-morbid conditions including sleep problems and altered circadian rhythms( Glickman, 2010). It is estimated that 40–80% of the ASD population experience sleep disorders that do not improve with age( Johnson et al., 2009). More specifically, people with ASD have problems falling and staying asleep( Hodge et al., 2014). A recent study showed that sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood and increase over time, suggesting that sleep problems are an essential part of ASD( Verhoeff et al., 2018). Indeed, sleep impairments are a strong predictor of the severity of ASD core symptoms as well as aggression and behavioral issues( Cohen et al., 2014; Tudor et al., 2012). Although a great number of studies documented sleep problems in ASD, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. To better understand the mechanisms underlying sleep problems in ASD, we need animal models that closely recapitulate sleep phenotypes observed in clinical populations. The study of genetic animal models of ASD, in which a genetic abnormality that is known to be associated with ASD is introduced, has provided valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ASD( de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2016). These models include Fragile X syndrome, 16p11. 2 deletion syndrome, cortical dysplasia-focal epilepsy( CDFE) syndrome, and mutations in neuroligins, neurexins, and shank genes among others. However, sleep research in animal models of ASD is limited and has not yet revealed the underlying mechanisms of sleep issues associated with ASD. Studies using a fly model of Fragile X syndrome reported an increase in sleep which is in contrast to what is observed in the clinical population( Bushey et al., 2009). The opposite phenotype was reported in a Fragile X mouse model, displaying instead an age-dependent reduction in activity during the light phase( i. e the mouse subjective night)( Boone et al., 2018). Neuroligin 1 knockout mice spend more time asleep( El Helou et al., 2013), but mice with mutations in Neuroligin 2 spend less time asleep and more time awake( Seok et al., 2018). Mice with a missense mutation in Neuroligin 3 show normal sleep behavior( Liu et al., 2017), but rats with a deletion mutation in Neuroligin 3 spend less time in non-rapid eye movement( NREM) sleep than wild type rats( Thomas et al., 2017). Mutant rat models of CDFE syndrome show longer waking periods while the mutant mice show fragmented wakefulness( Thomas et al., 2017). Mice carrying a 16p11. 2 deletion syndrome sleep less than wild type mice, but only males are affected( Angelakos et al., 2017). More importantly, issues with sleep onset, the most prominent feature of sleep problems in ASD patients, have not been evaluated in animal models of ASD. In this study, we examined sleep in Phelan-McDermid syndrome( PMS) patients with SHANK3 mutations and in a mutant mouse with a deletion in Shank3 exon 21( Shank3ΔC). PMS is a syndromic form of ASD characterized by gene deletions affecting the human chromosomal region 22q13. 3( Phelan and McDermid, 2012), particularly the neuronal structural gene SHANK3. Individuals with PMS have high rates of intellectual disability, difficulties in communication and motor function, and approximately 84% fit the core diagnostic criteria for ASD( Soorya et al., 2013). There is also a high rate of sleep problems in PMS( Bro et al., 2017). Mice with mutations in Shank3 recapitulate multiple features of both ASD and PMS( Bozdagi et al., 2010; Dhamne et al., 2017; Jaramillo et al., 2017; Jaramillo et al., 2016; Kouser et al., 2013; Peça et al., 2011; Speed et al., 2015), including cognitive impairment, deficits in social behavior, and impaired motor coordination. We show that PMS patients have trouble falling and staying asleep similar to what is observed in the general ASD population. We also show that Shank3ΔC mice sleep less than wild type mice when sleep pressure is high, have reduced sleep intensity( using an accepted electroencephalographic( EEG) metric), and have delayed sleep onset following sleep deprivation. To identify molecular mechanisms underlying sleep changes in Shank3ΔC mice, we carried out genome-wide gene expression studies. We previously showed that genome-wide gene expression analysis is a valuable approach to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation( Gerstner et al., 2016; Vecsey et al., 2012). In this study, we found that sleep deprivation sharply increases the differences in gene expression between Shank3ΔC mutants and wild type mice, downregulating circadian transcription factors Per3, Bhlhe41( Dec2), Hef, Tlf, and Nr1d1( Rev-erbα). We also show that Shank3ΔC mice are unable to sustain wheel-running activity in constant darkness. Overall, these studies demonstrate that Shank3 is an important modulator of sleep that may exert its effect through the regulation of circadian transcription factors. Our findings may lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep problems in ASD. This may one day lead to the development of successful treatments or interventions for this debilitating comorbidity.Discussion:The present study is the first to establish a role for Shank3 in mammalian sleep. We show that both PMS patients and Shank3 mutant mice have trouble falling asleep( Figures 1, 2 and 3). This phenotype is widely observed in the ASD population and until now had not been replicated in animal models. Shank3∆C mice have problems falling asleep after periods of extended wakefulness when sleep pressure is high, such as at the end of the baseline dark period( Figure 2A) or following sleep deprivation( Figure 3D-E). They also have blunted NREM delta power( Figure 2B). However, Shank3∆C mice accumulate sleep pressure( Figure 3A) and show no gross abnormalities in circadian rhythms( Figure 5). This suggests that the primary deficit is in sleep onset. Our molecular studies show that sleep deprivation increases differences in gene expression between Shank3∆C and WT mice( Figure 4). These differences point to the downregulation of circadian transcription factors and genes involved in the MAPK/GnRH pathways in the mutants( Table 2). Circadian transcription factors affected include Per3, Hlf, Tef, Nr1d1( REV-ERBα), and Bhlhe41( DEC2). We therefore investigated the effects of our Shank3 mutation in circadian rhythms. Shank3∆C mice do not show a disruption in circadian rhythmicity, but they do exhibit a large reduction in wheel-running activity in response to constant darkness( Figure 5, Table 3). Shank3∆C mice were reported to have deficits in motor coordination( Kouser et al., 2013); however, under a 12:12 hr LD schedule their wheel-running activity increases over time( Supplementary file 1, Source data 1). Daily rhythms of activity in rodents are linked to circadian oscillations in dopamine release( Feenstra et al., 2000; Menon et al., 2019) in the frontal cortex as well as in the striatum, a motor region with high levels of Shank3 expression( Peça et al., 2011). Together with a reduction in circadian gene expression, this DD-specific activity deficit suggests that the mutant sleep phenotype involves clock gene functions outside of their central time-keeping role. Interestingly, mutations in some of the circadian transcription factors we identified, Per3 and Bhlhe41( DEC2), indeed lead to deficits in sleep regulation( Archer et al., 2018; He et al., 2009; Hirano et al., 2018). Our results support a role of clock genes in influencing sleep outside of their roles in generating circadian rhythms( Franken, 2013). An interesting question is how can deletion of exon 21 of Shank3 lead to dysregulation of transcriptional and signaling pathways linked to sleep and sleep loss? Exon 21 of Shank3 encodes the homer and cortactin interaction domains of the protein. Homer interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptors( mGluRs) and SHANK3/homer complexes anchor mGluRs to the synapse. Shank3∆C mice show a marked reduction of the major isoforms of SHANK3 as well as an increase of mGluRs at the synapse( Kouser et al., 2013). mGluR signaling activates the MAPK/ERK pathway, a key regulator of activity-dependent transcription and synaptic plasticity in mature neurons( Thomas and Huganir, 2004). So the role of SHANK3 at the synaptic membrane explains the observed regulation of MAPK pathway genes( Table 2). However, it is not yet clear how SHANK3 regulates expression of circadian transcription factors within the nucleus. One possibility might include the role of SHANK3 in Wnt signaling. SHANK3 modulates Wnt-mediated transcriptional regulation by regulating internalization of Wnt receptor Frizzled-2( Harris et al., 2016) and nuclear translocation of the Wnt ligand beta-catenin( Qin et al., 2018). The Wnt pathway kinase GSK3β phosphorylates circadian transcription factors PER2( Iitaka et al., 2005), CRY2( Harada et al., 2005), and REV-ERBα( Yin et al., 2006); however, this mechanism modulates circadian period length which is not altered in Shank3ΔC mice. A second potential mechanism is nuclear translocation of SHANK3 itself. SHANK3 is known to undergo synaptic-nuclear shuttling in response to neuronal activity and interact with nuclear ribonucleoproteins and components of the RNA Pol II mediator complex( Grabrucker et al., 2014). Deletion of the C-terminus leads to nuclear accumulation of SHANK3 and alterations in gene expression( Cochoy et al., 2015; Grabrucker et al., 2014). Thus, mutations in exon 21 of Shank3 could lead to deficits in transcriptional regulation in response to sleep deprivation through direct regulation of transcription in the nucleus. Yeast two-hybrid data show that SHANK3 can directly bind the circadian transcription factors REV-ERBα( encoded by Nr1d1) and DEC1( encoded by Bhlhe40), a close paralog of DEC2( Bhlhe41)( Sakai et al., 2011). Future studies of the effects of sleep on SHANK3 nuclear translocation will provide new insights into the non-synaptic function of shank proteins and their role in sleep and circadian rhythms.","answer":"Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in the United States .

Advanced prostate cancer, which is one of the most common cancers, usually progresses to hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). A recent randomized trial of treatment with docetaxel demonstrated improved survival for patients with HRPC. The combination of docetaxel and estramustine phosphate ( estramustine ) has been reported to be effective for HRPC . Low-dose estramustine suppresses the pituitary-gonadal axis. docetaxel plus 5-fluoro-5'-deoxyuridine (5'-dFUrd) had supra-additive cytotoxic effects on HRPC cells consistent with the molecular mechanism. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of adding 5'-dFUrd on the chemotherapy regimen, which consist docetaxel and estramustine.  methods All of the HRPC patients were treated with estramustine 140 mg orally twice 5'-dFUrd 200 mg orally four times daily on days 1-21, and docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) was administered on day 1.

One type of this well-explored electrophile is π-allyl complex, which is often generated in-situ via Pd addition/oxidation toward allyl or allene moieties (Scheme 1A).3 Although this protocol represents an efficient approach for a C-C bond construction, it suffers from several limitations, including limited substrate scope and lack of effective stereochemistry control.4 This is mainly due to A) the requirement of a pre-functionalized alkene to form Pd π-allyl complex and B) problematic reversible β-H elimination involved. Therefore, developing new reaction partners that can facilitate transformations under this dual-catalysis mode will not only offer practical synthetic utility but also foster mechanistic insight to further advance this intriguing reaction pattern.</p><p>The intrinsic reactivity of C-C double bonds allows alkene to own a privileged position in the organic synthesis.5 Lewis acid catalyzed nucleophilic addition of alkenes have become a powerful synthetic approach for C-C and C-X bond construction.6 However, palladium is considered as a weak π-acid towards alkene activation, therefore, a strong nucleophile is required to attack the Pd-activated alkene.7 Moreover, the resulting Pd-C intermediate could undergo fast β-H elimination, giving alkene products and other potential undesired side reactions. To overcome this problem, in 2016, Engle and coworkers first reported the application of bidentate directing group (DG) strategy to enhance the reactivity of Pd, allowing un-activated alkene to be readily attacked by soft carbon nucleophiles.8 More importantly, with a more sterically constrained Pd intermediate, the β-H elimination was successfully inhibited (Scheme 1B). This seminal work highlighted the advantage of applying the bidentate DGs in A) improve the reactivity of Pd(II) cation and B) secure olefin hydrocarbofunctionalization through protodemetallation. Although a wide range of carbon nucleophiles, including 1,3-dicarbonyls, aryl carbonyls, and electron-rich arenes, have been successfully applied for this transformation, ketones and aldehydes remained problematic. Also, only few examples have been reported for enantioselective addition to unactivated alkene using this strategy.9 Inspired by these findings, we envisioned that the combination of Pd-catalyzed directed alkene activation with enamine addition could offer a valid strategy to further extend reaction scope to ketone derivatives. More importantly, the adoption of a chiral amine catalysts will provide an effective stereochemistry control to achieve asymmetric α-alkylation of a ketone.</p><p>It is important to note here that as we were working on this idea independently, one paper with similar design from the Gong group was published, in which they reported the alkylation of substituted cyclic ketones through enamine activation.10, The desired α-alkylation was obtained in good yields and ee. We herein report our efforts on this novel transformation with alternative reaction conditions. We are able to extend the substrate scope to various of acetophenones, as well as β-keto-esters. It is our hope to offer another perspective on how we achieved this transformation from a different approach.</p>Results and discussion<p>Considering that the directing group is crucial for increasing the reactivity of Pd catalyst, we first screened some common used directing groups (1a-1e) under Engle's condition (HOAc, MeCN, 120 °C). The results are summarized in Table 1.</p><p>As expected, without the addition of amine, no desired product was observed in all the cases, which highlighted the challenge of applying acetophenone as a nucleophile toward Pd-activated alkene. Fortunately, when L-proline was applied as the co-catalyst with 8-aminoquinoline (AQ) as the directing group, the reaction successfully gave the desired addition product 3a in 60% NMR yield. Interestingly, other directing groups could not promote this transformation even with the addition of proline, emphasizing the unique roles of AQ in this reaction. After a series of conditions screening, pyrrolidine was identified as the optimal co-catalyst with toluene as the solvent. The reaction proceeded smoothly at 80 °C with nearly quantitative yield.</p><p>Inspired by this result, we then turned our attention into more challenging asymmetric addition with the assistant of chiral amines. Representative conditions screened are summarized in Table 2.</p><p>As expected, treating 1a with cyclohexanone 2b under Pd/pyrrolidine conditions gave 4a in 95% yield, as expected (entry 2). Various chiral amine catalysts were then tested for stereoselectivity. The Macmillan catalysts were ineffective in this system, which might due to the lack of reactivity towards ketone.11 L-Proline gave a decreased conversion and yield with 11% ee of 4a. Clearly, a tight transition state with Pd and amine is crucial for good stereoselectivity. To avoid competitive OAc binding, Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 was then employed. An increasing ee (15%) was obtained with L-proline as co-catalyst (entry 5). Finally, with Jorgensen catalyst A9, product 4a was obtained in 97% yield with 71% ee (entry 10). It is important to note that prolinol A8 gave the product in 65% ee, while the OMe protected ligand A7 gave almost no stereoselectivity (<5% ee). This result clearly suggested the importance of the hydroxyl group in promoting the stereoselectivity of the transformation. This is likely due to the coordination of OH with Pd intermediate, which not only accelerates the overall reaction rate by rendering the enamine addition into an intramolecular fashion, but also provides a good stereochemistry control. One challenge that prevents further improvement of the enantioselectivity is the racemization of product 4a. Extending reaction time resulted in a decreased ee value under the reaction conditions (entry 11). To further fine-tuning the reaction, we conducted the reaction at lower temperature (60 °C). Lower conversion (60%) and yield (55%) were observed, though higher ee was received (93%). To increase the reaction rate at a lower temperature, the neat condition was applied. The reaction gave 100% conversion and 95% isolated yield with 88% ee of 4a. Notably, under Gong's conditions, only 60% ee was obtained, though with 93% yield. With this optimal condition revealed, the reaction scope was evaluated. Substrates 3 from methyl-ketone is shown in Table 3.</p><p>In general, over 90% yields were obtained with almost all tested acetophenone derivatives. Both EDG (3b–3d) and EWG (3e and 3f) modified ketones gave excellent yields. Slightly reduced yields were obtained with the ortho-substituted substrate (3j 89%, 3k, 82%) due to steric hindrance. Interestingly, aryl halide substrates (3g, 3h, and 3i) worked very well for this transformation without observation of Pd catalyzed oxidative addition of C-X bond, revealing an orthogonal reactivity compared with typical Pd(0) involved coupling reactions. With 4'-Iodoacetophenone 3j, modest yield was observed, due to the formation of heck type by-product in the presence of more active C-I bond. Finally, amino acid modified derivative (3o) was also suitable for this reaction, suggesting the potential application of this method in bio-compatible compound preparation. Internal alkene derivatives, (Z) and (E)-N-(quinolin-8-yl)hex-3-enamide, were unreactive. Moreover, compound 3a was synthesized in a gram scale, which indicated its practical synthetic value.</p><p>Exploration of asymmetric reaction performance with cyclic ketones was also performed and summarized in Table 4. Comparing with non-substituted cyclohexanone (4a), 4-substituted cyclohexanone derivatives (4b-4d) required a higher temperature (80 °C) to achieve the full conversion due to increased hindrance. Interestingly, in these cases problematic racemization was also inhibited, providing higher enantioselectivity. On the other hand, modest dr value were observed. Ketal derivative (4e) was also tolerated under this acidic condition without deprotection, excellent yield and ee were obtained. Next, both O and N containing cyclohexanone (4f-4h) were tested. 4-oxotetrahydropyran (4f) provided 90% yield and 88% ee, while 4-oxopiperidine (4g) failed to observe any enantioselectivity possibly because of a quick epimerization. By switching to Boc protection, 3-oxopiperidine (4h) was achieved with modest ee, resulting from resonance of amide group to lock the conformation. 1-Tetralone (4i) showed excellent yields with 0% ee due to the more acidic α-proton. Smaller cyclic ketones such as cyclopentanone (4j) and cyclobutanone (4k) gave excellent yields with no ee, which is likely due to the presence of more acidic α-proton, which caused quick racemization of the formed product. As a result, introduction of an ester on cyclobutanone (4l) to increase steric bulkiness not only resulted in moderate enantioselectivity (45% ee) but also delivered excellent dr value (> 20:1).</p><p>In addition to cyclic ketones, other carbonyl substrates were also explored (Scheme 2A). First, aldehyde was tested and proved not suitable for this transformation due to the undesired rapid aldol condensation side reaction. Other readily available ketone derivatives such as 1,3-diketones and β-keto-esters were also tested. In particular, we chose α-substituted 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds for further study because it could form product with a quaternary stereocenter to prevent racemization. After the extensive screening of catalysts (see details in SI), primary amine A10 was identified as an effective catalyst in promoting condensation of β-keto-ester with AQ-modified olefin (Table 5A). Although all ketone esters (5a, 5b, and 5c) showed excellent yield (95%), a regioselectivity issue (linear vs branch selectivity) was revealed as well, due to the formation of two possible enamine intermediates. All of these three substrates gave similar regioselectivity ratio (from 53:47 to 48:52). With the increasing size of substituted group R, the enantioselectivity would be increased from 63% to 74% ee. We also demonstrated that AQ directing group could be removed by a Boc protection-basic hydrolysis sequence, yielding the ε- keto acids 6 with 86% yield over two steps (Table 5B).12</p>Conclusions<p>In summary, we reported a synergistic palladium/enamine catalyzed asymmetric addition of ketone to non-activated alkene under mild conditions. Using this protocol, asymmetric α-alkylation of ketone derivatives were successfully achieved by combining the chiral enamine formation and directed Pd-catalyzed alkene activation, which offered an efficient and cooperative catalysis system.

In an attempt to understand the evolution of PEDV in the United States and possibly develop a control strategy, we compared the genome sequences of a PEDV strain isolated from an infected piglet against its in vitro adapted version. The original PEDV strain was grown in Vero cells and passed 10 times serially in a MARC145 cell line. The sequence analysis of the native PEDV strain and in vitro passaged virus shows that the cell culture adaptation specifically modifies PEDV spike protein whereas the open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/b)-encoded polyprotein, the nucleoprotein, NS3B (ORF3), and membrane and envelope proteins remain unchanged. Text: highly contagious swine disease. While older pigs have a chance of survival, 80 to 100 percent of PEDV-infected piglets die within 24 h of being infected. PEDV spreads primarily through fecal-oral contact (1, 2) . Once the virus is internalized, it destroys the lining of piglets' intestines, making them incapable of digesting and deriving nutrition from milk and feed (1) . The virus causes diarrhea, vomiting, and death from dehydration and starvation (2) . PEDV is a member of the Coronavirinae subfamily and belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus. Its genomic size ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kb , which is relatively large for an RNA virus. Although vaccines for PEDV exist in China, Japan, and South Korea, there is no approved vaccine in the United States or Europe (3) . Furthermore, PEDV is still evolving within the U.S. swine population. This report briefly describes the comparison of genome sequences of a PEDV strain isolated from small intestine samples of an infected piglet and its in vitro adapted version. The original PEDV strain was dubbed NPL-PEDV/2013, grown in Vero cells, and passed 10 times in a MARC145 cell line. The serial in vitro passage strain was named NPL-PEDV/2013/P10. The total viral RNA was extracted by TRIzol LS reagent and sequenced by Sanger dideoxy sequencing using a primer walking technique. The raw sequences were imported into the Geneious assembler (Biomatters, CA), assembled, annotated, and compared against each other using USA/Colorado/2013 (GenBank accession no. KF272920) as a reference sequence. The whole-genome sequences of NPL-PEDV/2013 and NPL-PEDV/2013/P10 contain 28,038 and 28,025 nucleotides (nt), respectively, including the 5= and 3= untranslated regions (UTR). The NPL-PEDV/2013 genome shares 99% identity with all the U.S. isolates sequenced to date and many Chinese isolates as well. The top three BLAST hits were against U.S. isolates, USA/Colora-do/2013 (GenBank accession no. KF272920), IA1 (GenBank accession no. KF468753.1), and an isolate from Iowa, 13-019349 (GenBank accession no. KF267450.1). The NPL-PEDV/2013 isolate also shares 99% identity with the Chinese outbreak isolate AH2012 (GenBank accession no. KC210145). When the NPL-PEDV/2013/P10 strain was compared against NPL-PEDV/2013 , the open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/b) polyprotein, the nucleoprotein, NS3B, and membrane and envelope proteins were found to be 100% identical at the amino acid level. In contrast, the spike gene contains six nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, resulting in amino acid (aa) substitutions in the following positions: 375 (F¡L), 486 (T¡P), 856 (D¡E), 1081 (A¡V), 1099 (A¡S), and 1253 (Y¡D). The S1 domain of spike protein contains 2 aa substitutions, whereas the S2 domain contains 4 aa substitutions. PEDV has been shown to use porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as the major receptor for cell entry (4, 5) . However, Vero and MARC145 cells lack pAPN, clearly indicating that other receptors or receptor-independent pathways may be used for entry (6) . The spike protein in its trimeric conformation interacts with the cell receptor and contains numerous neutralizing antibody binding epitopes (7) . Analysis of the spike by PeptideCutter (http://web.expasy.org/ peptide_cutter/) shows that the native spike protein of NPL-PEDV/2013 has 63 trypsin and 2 chymotrypsin cleavage sites at 100% efficiency whereas NPL-PEDV/2013/P10 has lost one trypsin cleavage site but the number of chymotrypsin sites remain unchanged. This indicates that cell culture adaptation specifically modifies the PEDV spike protein; however, the immunological implications are unknown. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers.

To apply PM premises in an emerging coronavirus pandemic acquires potentially greater relevance in order to allow the selection of specific preventive measures as well as biomarkers that will be useful in disease management. Recent findings: The identification of the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had led to a plethora of strategies to contain viral dissemination, affecting life styles and personal behaviors. Viral genomic sequencing has shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs as its specific receptor. Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases. Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) were increased in severe patients. These cytokines might be useful biomarkers of disease worsening and potential targets for new biological therapies currently under investigation. Summary: Present knowledge and recent developments in PM approach to COVID-19 disease prevention, evaluation, and management are pointed out. Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The effects of clopamide , pindolol and its combination on plasma lipids in 49 hypertensive patients ( WHO I-II ) , divided into three parallel randomized groups , were studied over a 6 months period . Total cholesterol , triglycerides , HDL and LDL cholesterol fractions were determined twice during an initial 4-week washout phase , and after a 1- , 3- and 6-month active hypotensive drug phase . Patients were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits . Daily drug doses were adjusted progressively to attain optimal hypotensive effects . In the clopamide monotherapy group , total cholesterol increased significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) ; triglycerides and LDL showed a tendency to increase while for HDL a tendency to decrease was observed . In the pindolol monotherapy group , a significant reduction of triglycerides ( p less than 0.01 ) and a significant increase of HDL cholesterol ( p less than 0.05 ) were recorded . No significant changes in total cholesterol or LDL fraction were observed . Combined pindolol-clopamide therapy decreased total triglycerides ( NS ) , increased HDL significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) and did not influence total cholesterol and LDL fraction . It is concluded that pindolol does not negatively influence blood lipids as the thiazide-type diuretic clopamide does , and that when both drugs are used together , the beta-blocker can probably counterbalance the diuretic-induced negative effects on blood lipids . Accordingly , it is suggested that pindolol could be a more favorable beta-blocker drug to be used on hypertensive subjects with metabolic coronary risk factors .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"combination on plasma lipids\\", \\"clopamide\\", \\"pindolol\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"blood lipids\\", \\"total cholesterol and LDL fraction\\", \\"total cholesterol\\", \\"HDL and LDL cholesterol fractions\\", \\"total cholesterol or LDL fraction\\", \\"total triglycerides ( NS )\\", \\"Total cholesterol\\", \\"triglycerides\\", \\"HDL\\", \\"LDL\\", \\"HDL cholesterol\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"49\\", \\"three\\", \\"arterial hypertensive\\", \\"metabolic coronary risk\\", \\"hypertensive\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to prospect ively follow the kinetics of change in CD4(+ ) T cell cytokine secretion during the course of conventional immunotherapy . METHODS Six allergic individuals were treated with extracts of Dermatophagoides farinae/Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or with rye grass pollen ( Lolium perenne ) allergen , but not both , by using an internally controlled conventional immunotherapy protocol .  CD4(+ ) T cells from peripheral blood were examined in vitro at varying intervals after the initiation of immunotherapy by stimulation with D farinae or L perenne group I antigen . The quantity of IL-4 and IFN-gamma produced and its relationship to clinical improvement was determined . RESULTS The ratio of allergen-specific IL-4/IFN-gamma production by CD4(+ ) T cells from 4 of 6 individuals receiving immunotherapy greatly increased during the period when the dose of allergen was increasing . However , after high-dose maintenance therapy was achieved , this ratio decreased in subjects responding clinical ly to , but not in those failing , immunotherapy . In addition , late-phase skin reactions and allergen-specific IgE levels in responding , but not in nonresponding , subjects diminished over the course of immunotherapy . CONCLUSION Conventional immunotherapy may initially exacerbate allergic disease by increasing allergen-specific IL-4 and allergen-specific IgE production . Later clinical improvement is associated with a reduction in allergen-specific IL-4 production and in allergen-specific serumTitle 2:Preventing progression of allergic rhinitis: the role of specific immunotherapyAbstract 2:Allergic rhinitis and asthma are examples of allergic airways disease . Despite their differing symptomatology , both disorders affect the mucosal lining of the respiratory tract and are linked by common underlying cellular processes , thus , using the ‘ united airways ’ approach , they can be considered part of the same allergic disease . The conditions are often comorbid , and there is evidence to suggest that allergic rhinitis in children is a significant risk factor for subsequent development of asthma . Management strategies that target the underlying cause of allergic rhinitis in children have the potential to offer additional symptom control above that of symptomatic medications , and prevent disease progression . Specific immunotherapy ( SIT ) is the only currently available treatment that is proven to target the disease in this way . SIT affects the underlying cause of allergic rhinitis , producing changes in antibody responses to allergens . It has been shown to be effective in the reduction of  allergic rhinitis symptoms in both children and adults , with effects being sustained for several years after treatment completion . Furthermore , a number of trials provide evidence that SIT may prevent the development of new sensitisations and asthma in children and adults with allergic rhinitis . One such open-label , r and omised controlled study in children/adolescents ( the Preventive Allergy Treatment Study ) showed that significantly fewer patients who received 3 years of  SIT  for grass/birch pollen-induced allergic rhinitis had developed asthma 10 years after treatment initiation versus controls . Some clinical guidelines acknowledge this potential asthma preventive effect in children and the need for additional data from double-blind , placebo-controlled trials to support these findingsTitle 3:Three years of specific immunotherapy with house‐dust‐mite extracts in patients with rhinitis and asthma: significant improvement of allergen‐specific parameters and of nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivityAbstract 3:Twenty‐seven patients with allergy to house‐dust mite and the clinical symptoms of perennial rhinitis and /or mild asthma were treated with specific immunotherapy ( SIT ) with st and ardized extracts of house‐dust mite for 3 years . The success of therapy was evaluated in yearly intervalsTitle 4:Summary health statistics for U.S. adults: National Health Interview Survey, 2001.Abstract 4:OBJECTIVES This report presents health statistics from the 2001 National Health Interview Survey for the civilian noninstitutionalized adult population classified by sex , age , race and Hispanic origin , poverty status , and region of residence for chronic condition prevalence , health status and functional limitations , health care access and utilization , health behaviors , and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) testing . Also , health statistics by education , income , health insurance coverage , marital status , and place of residence are presented for health status and limitations in activity , health care access and utilization , health behaviors , and knowledge and attitudes toward HIV . SOURCE OF DATA The National Health Interview Survey is a multistage probability sample survey conducted annually by interviewers of the U.S. Census Bureau for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's National Center for Health Statistics and is representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population . Sociodemographic data are collected for everyone in the family during face-to-face interviews with adults present at the time of the interview . The health information for adults in this report was obtained from one r and omly selected adult per family . HIGHLIGHTS In 2001 , 64 % of adults 18 years of age and over reported excellent or very good health . Fifty-eight percent of adults never participated in any type of vigorous leisure-time physical activity , and 13 % of adults did not have a usual place of health care . Twelve percent of adults had been told by a doctor or health professional that they had heart disease , and 21 % had been told on two or more visits that they had hypertension . Nearly a quarter of all adults were current smokers , and 22 % were former smokers . Based on estimates of body mass index , 36 % of adults were overweight and 23 % were obeseTitle 5:SQ HDM SLIT-tablet (ALK) in treatment of asthma--post hoc results from a randomised trial.Abstract 5:INTRODUCTION In a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ( EudraCT identifier : 2006 - 001795 - 20 ) , the st and ardised quality ( SQ ) house dust mite ( HDM ) sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-tablet ( ALK , Denmark ) was investigated . METHOD The trial included 604 subjects , ≥14 years , with mild-moderate HDM allergic asthma . Subjects were r and omised 1:1:1:1 to 1 , 3 or 6 SQ-HDM or placebo once daily . The primary endpoint was reduction in inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) after one year . ICS reduction , asthma quality of life question naire ( AQLQ ) and asthma control question naire ( ACQ ) score was analysed post hoc in a subgroup with daily ICS use of 400 - 800 μg and ACQ score of 1 - 1.5 , corresponding to partly controlled asthma ( N = 108 ) . RESULTS The trial met its primary endpoint . In the subgroup , the difference between placebo and 6 SQ-HDM in change from baseline in daily ICS use was 327 μg ( p < 0.0001 ) , while it was 0.52 ( p = 0.010 ) for AQLQ . The treatment effect on ICS reduction and AQLQ was increased for the subgroup versus the residual population ( ICS reduction : p < 0.001 ) ; AQLQ : p = 0.044 ) . CONCLUSION In this subgroup , including only patients with partly controlled asthma , the benefit of 1 year of treatment with SQ HDM SLIT-tablet was significantly higher than for the less severe full population , both in terms of increased asthma control and improved quality of lifeTitle 6:Standardized quality (SQ) house dust mite sublingual immunotherapy tablet (ALK) reduces inhaled corticosteroid use while maintaining asthma control: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Abstract 6:BACKGROUND Investigations meeting current st and ards are limited for the effect of house dust mite ( HDM ) allergy immunotherapy in asthmatic patients . OBJECTIVE This trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a st and ardized quality ( SQ ; allergen st and ardization method proprietary to the trial sponsor ) HDM SLIT-tablet ( ALK , Hørsholm , Denmark ) in adults and adolescents with HDM respiratory allergic disease . This publication reports the results of the endpoints related to asthma . METHODS Six hundred four subjects 14 years or older with HDM allergic rhinitis and mild-to-moderate asthma were r and omized 1:1:1:1 to double-blind daily treatment with one of 3 active doses ( 1 , 3 , or 6 SQ-HDM ) or placebo . Their use of inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) was st and ardized and adjusted at baseline and the end of treatment to the lowest dose providing asthma control . The primary end point was a reduction in ICS dose from the individual subject 's baseline dose after 1 year of treatment . RESULTS The primary analysis revealed a mean difference between 6 SQ-HDM and placebo in the reduction in daily ICS dose of 81 μg ( P = .004 ) . Relative mean and median reductions were 42 % and 50 % for 6 SQ-HDM and 15 % and 25 % for placebo , respectively . No statistically significant differences were observed for the other assessed asthma parameters , reflecting the intended controlled status of the trial subjects . The most common adverse events were local reactions in the mouth . The rate and severity of adverse events were higher for 3 and 6 SQ-HDM than for 1 SQ-HDM and placebo . CONCLUSION Efficacy in mild-to-moderate asthma of 6 SQ-HDM relative to placebo was demonstrated by a moderate statistically significant reduction in the ICS dose required to maintain asthma control . All active doses were well toleratedTitle 7:Effect of cetirizine on bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthmaAbstract 7:Although H1 antihistamine compounds ( H1 ) are highly effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis ( AR ) , their role in the treatment of asthma is still controversial . Because a strong association between AR and bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) has been reported , this study was design ed to assess the effect of a new H1 anti histamine , cetirizine ( C ) , on nonspecific BHR in patients with AR . Twelve patients were included in a double‐blind , crossover , placebo‐controlled trial . All patients had positive skin tests for common allergens and showed BHR to inhaled methacholine  after specific nasal allergenic challenge . After a washout period of 1 week to ensure the stability of the BHR , the patients received , by crossover r and omization , C 10 mg daily or placebo ( P ) for 2 weeks . After each treatment period , BHR and nasal blocking index ( NBI ) were measured 1 and 6 h after nasal challenge . Bronchial responsiveness was expressed as methacholine PD20 , the provocation dose of methacholine causing a 20 % decrease in FEV1 . Measurements were then performed after 2 weeks of C and after 2 weeks of P. Baseline values of PD20 ( median ) measured before challenge showed no difference after cetirizine or after placebo ( 1.36 mg ) . Results 1 h after allergen did not show significant differences between C ( methacholine PD20=0.522 mg ) and placebo ( methacholine PD20=0.455 mg ) . By contrast , 6 h after challenge , methacholine PD20 was 0.918 mg for C and 0.483 mg for P ( P=0.042 ) . Similarly , NBI showed no change between C and P 1 h after challenge , whereas the difference was significant 6 h after challenge ( P=0.011 ) . These data demonstrate a protective nasal effect of C against BHR measured 6 h after nasal allergen challenge in patients with AR . They suggest that C may be useful in patients with asthma associated with ARTitle 8:House dust mite sublingual immunotherapy is safe and appears to be effective in moderate, persistent asthmaAbstract 8:The efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy in house dust mite – induced asthma have yet to be firmly established .

Toa human observer, a well-trained GAN appears to have learned facts about the objects in the image: for example, a door can appear on a building but not on a tree. Wewish to understand how a GAN represents such structure. Dothe objects emerge as pure pixel patterns without any explicit representation of objects such as doors and trees, or does the GAN contain internal variables that correspond to the objects that humans perceive? Ifthe GAN does contain variables for doors and trees, do those variables cause the generation of those objects, or do they merely correlate? Howare relationships between objects represented? Figure1: Overview: (a) Realisticoutdoor church images generated by Progressive GANs BID18 . (b) Given a pre-trainedGAN model, we identify a set of interpretable units whose featuremap is correlated to an object class across different images. For example, one unit inlayer4 localizes tree regions with diverse visual appearance. (c) We force the activationof the units to be zero and quantify the average casual effect of the ablation. Here we successfully removetrees from church images. (d) We activate tree causalunits in other locations. These same units synthesizenew trees, visually compatible with their surrounding context. In addition, our method candiagnose and improve GANs by identifying artifact-causing units (e). We can remove the artifactsthatappear (f) and significantly improve theresults by ablating the \\"artifact\\" units (g). Please see our demo video.Wepresenta general method for visualizing and understanding GANs at different levels of abstraction, from each neuron, to each object, to the contextual relationship between different objects. We first identify a group of interpretableunits that are related to object concepts ( Figure 1b ). These units' featuremaps closely match thesemantic segmentation of a particular object class (e.g., trees). Second, we directly intervene within the networkto identify sets of units that cause a type of objects to disappear (Figure 1c) or appear ( Figure 1d ). We quantify the causal effect of these units usinga standard causality metric. Finally, we examine the contextual relationship betweenthese causal object units and the background. We study where we can insert object concepts in new imagesand how this intervention interacts with other objects in the image (Figure 1d ). To our knowledge, our work provides the first systematic analysisfor understanding the internal representations of GANs.Finally, we show several practical applications enabled by this analytic framework, from comparing internal representations across different layers, GAN variants and datasets; to debugging and improving GANs by locating and ablating \\"artifact\\" units ( Figure 1e) ; to understanding contextual relationships between objects in scenes; to manipulating images with interactive object-level control.By carefully examining representation units, we have found that many parts of GAN representations can be interpreted, not only as signals that correlate with object concepts but as variables that have a causal effect on the synthesis of objects in the output.These interpretable effects can be used to compare, debug, modify, and reason about a GAN model.Our method can be potentially applied to other generative models such as VAEs BID20 and RealNVP BID7 .Wehave focused on the generator rather than the discriminator (as did in BID29 ) because the generator must represent all the information necessary to approximate the target distribution, while the discriminator only learns to capture the difference between real and fake images. Alternatively, we conference room church living room kitchen bedroom Figure 10 : Comparing the effect of ablating 20 window-causal units in GANs trained on five scene categories. In each case, the 20 ablated units are specific to the class and the generator and independent of the image. In some scenes, windows are reduced in size or number rather than eliminated, or replaced by visually similar objects such as paintings. DISPLAYFORM0Figure 11: Inserting door units by setting 20 causal units to a fixed high value at one pixel in the representation. Whether thedoor units can cause the generation of doors is dependent on its local context: we highlight every location that is responsive to insertions of door units on top of the original image, including two separate locations in (b) (we interveneat left). The same units areinserted in every case, but the door that appears has a size, alignment, and color appropriate to the location. Emphasizing a doorthat is already present results in a larger door (d). The chart summarizesthe causal effect of inserting door units at one pixel with different contexts.can train an encoder to invert the generator BID8 . However, this incursadditional complexity and errors. Many GANs also do nothave an encoder.Our method is not designed to compare the quality of GANs to one another, and it is not intended as a replacement for well-studied GAN metrics such as FID, which estimate realism by measuring the distance between the generated distribution of images and the true distribution BID2 surveys these methods). Instead, our goal hasbeen to identify the interpretable structure and provide a window into the internal mechanisms of a GAN.Prior visualization methods BID40 BID1 BID17 have brought new insights into CNN and RNN research. Motivated by that, inthis work we have taken a small step towards understanding the internal representations of a GAN, and we have uncovered many questions that we cannot yet answer with the current method. For example: why cana door not be inserted in the sky? How does the GAN suppressthe signal in the later layers? Further work will be neededto understand the relationships between layers of a GAN. Nevertheless, we hope thatour work can help researchers and practitioners better analyze and develop their own GANs. In Section 4.2, we have improvedGANs by manually identifying and ablating artifact-causing units. Now we describe an automatic procedureto identify artifact units using unit-specific FID scores.To compute the FID score BID13 for a unit u, we generate 200, 000 images and select the 10, 000 images that maximize the activation of unit u, and this subset of 10, 000 images is compared to the true distribution (50, 000 real images) using FID. Although every such unit-maximizing subsetof images represents a skewed distribution, we find that the per-unit FID scores fall in a wide range, with most units scoring well in FID while a few units stand out with bad FID scores: many of them were also manually flagged by humans, as they tend to activate on images with clear visible artifacts. FIG1 shows the performance of FID scores asa predictor of manually flagged artifact units. The per-unit FID scores can achieve 50% precisionand 50% recall. That is, of the 20 worst-FID units, 10 are also amongthe 20 units manually judged to have the most noticeable artifacts.

In the current study, 428 patients with untreated, advanced-stage FL were randomly assigned for therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) alone (n = 205) or CHOP combined with rituximab (R-CHOP) (n = 223). R-CHOP reduced the relative risk for treatment failure by 60% and significantly prolonged the time to treatment failure (P < .001). In addition, a significantly higher overall response rate (96% vs 90%; P = .011) and a prolonged duration of remission (P = .001) were achieved. In spite of a relatively short observation time, these beneficial effects even translated to superior overall survival (P = .016), with 6 deaths in the R-CHOP group compared with 17 deaths in the CHOP group within the first 3 years. The predominant treatment-related adverse effect was myelosuppression. Severe granulocytopenia was more frequently observed after R-CHOP (63% vs 53%; P = .01). However, severe infections were rare and of similar frequency after R-CHOP and CHOP (5% and 7%). Hence, adding rituximab to CHOP significantly improves the outcome for patients with previously untreated advanced-stage FL and does not induce major adverse effects.Title 2:CVP chemotherapy plus rituximab compared with CVP as first-line treatment for advanced follicular lymphoma.Abstract 2:The combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) is one of several standard treatment options for advanced follicular lymphoma. This, like similar chemotherapeutic regimens, induces response rates of 60% to 80%, with a median response duration of under 2 years. Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20, is active in follicular lymphoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. Previously untreated patients with stages III to IV follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned to receive either 8 cycles of CVP plus rituximab (R-CVP; n = 162) or CVP (n = 159). Overall and complete response rates were 81% and 41% in the R-CVP arm versus 57% and 10% in the CVP arm, respectively (P < .0001). At a median follow-up of 30 months, patients treated with R-CVP had a very significantly prolonged time to progression (median 32 months versus 15 months for CVP; P < .0001). Median time to treatment failure was 27 months in patients receiving R-CVP and 7 months in the CVP arm (P < .0001). Rituximab did not add significantly to the toxicity of CVP. The addition of rituximab to the CVP regimen significantly improves the clinical outcome in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma, without increased toxicity.Title 3:The addition of rituximab to a combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone (FCM) significantly increases the response rate and prolongs survival as compared with FCM alone in patients with relapsed and refractory follicular and mantle cell lymphomas: results of a prospective randomized study of the German Low-Grade Lymphoma Study Group.Abstract 3:In follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) the monoclonal antibody rituximab may improve the prognosis when combined with chemotherapy. This was investigated in a prospective randomized study in patients with relapsed disease. A total of 147 patients were randomized to receive 4 courses of chemotherapy with 25 mg/m(2) fludarabine on days 1 to 3, 200 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide on days 1 to 3, and 8 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone on day 1 (FCM), alone or combined with rituximab (375 mg/m(2); R-FCM). Of 128 evaluable patients, 62 were randomized for FCM and 66 for R-FCM. R-FCM revealed an overall response rate of 79% (33% complete remission [CR], 45% partial remission [PR]) as compared with 58% for FCM alone (13% CR, 45% PR; P = .01), with similar results in a subgroup analysis of FL (94% vs 70%) and MCL (58% vs 46%). In the total group, the R-FCM arm was significantly superior concerning progression-free survival (PFS; P = .0381) and overall survival (OS; P = .0030). In FL PFS was significantly longer in the R-FCM arm (P = .0139) whereas in MCL a significantly longer OS was observed (P = .0042). There were no differences in clinically relevant side effects in both study arms. Hence, the addition of rituximab to FCM chemotherapy significantly improves the outcome of relapsed or refractory FL and MCL.Title 4:Immunochemotherapy with rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone significantly improves response and time to treatment failure, but not long-term outcome in patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma: results of a prospective randomized trial of the German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group (GLSG).Abstract 4:Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by a poor prognosis with a low to moderate sensitivity to chemotherapy and a median survival of only 3 to 4 years. In an attempt to improve outcome, the German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group (GLSG) initiated a randomized trial comparing the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) and rituximab (R-CHOP) with CHOP alone as first-line therapy for advanced-stage MCL.                One hundred twenty-two previously untreated patients with advanced-stage MCL were randomly assigned to six cycles of CHOP (n = 60) or R-CHOP (n = 62). Patients up to 65 years of age achieving a partial or complete remission underwent a second randomization to either myeloablative radiochemotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation or interferon alfa maintenance (IFNalpha). All patients older than 65 years received IFNalpha maintenance.                R-CHOP was significantly superior to CHOP in terms of overall response rate (94% v 75%; P = .0054), complete remission rate (34% v 7%; P = .00024), and time to treatment failure (TTF; median, 21 v 14 months; P = .0131). No differences were observed for progression-free survival. Toxicity was acceptable, with no major differences between the two therapeutic groups.                The combined immunochemotherapy with R-CHOP resulted in a significantly higher response rate and a prolongation of the TTF as compared with chemotherapy alone. Hence, R-CHOP may serve as a new baseline regimen for advanced stage MCL, but needs to be further improved by novel strategies in remission.Title 5:Rituximab maintenance improves clinical outcome of relapsed/resistant follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients both with and without rituximab during induction: results of a prospective randomized phase 3 intergroup trial.Abstract 5:We evaluated the role of rituximab (R) both in remission induction and maintenance treatment of relapsed/resistant follicular lymphoma (FL). A total of 465 patients were randomized to induction with 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) (every 3 weeks) or R-CHOP (R: 375 mg/m(2) intravenously, day 1). Those in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) were randomized to maintenance with R (375 mg/m(2) intravenously once every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years) or observation. R-CHOP induction yielded an increased overall response rate (CHOP, 72.3%; R-CHOP, 85.1%; P < .001) and CR rate (CHOP, 15.6%; R-CHOP, 29.5%; P < .001). Median progression-free survival (PFS) from first randomization was 20.2 months after CHOP versus 33.1 months after R-CHOP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P < .001). Rituximab maintenance yielded a median PFS from second randomization of 51.5 months versus 14.9 months with observation (HR, 0.40; P < .001). Improved PFS was found both after induction with CHOP (HR, 0.30; P < .001) and R-CHOP (HR, 0.54; P = .004). R maintenance also improved overall survival from second randomization: 85% at 3 years versus 77% with observation (HR, 0.52; P = .011). This is the first trial showing that in relapsed/resistant FL rituximab maintenance considerably improves PFS not only after CHOP but also after R-CHOP induction.","answer":"The systematic review demonstrated improved OS for patients with indolent lymphoma, particularly in the subgroups of follicular and in mantle cell lymphoma when treated with R-chemo compared to chemotherapy alone."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

From February 9, all blood establishments in Hubei province, China, implemented nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA among blood donors to ensure blood safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nucleic acid test screening individually (ID) or by minipool (MP) testing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inactivated culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells was quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and series diluted with negative plasma to evaluate the assay's performance. RESULTS: The limit of detection of the kit for MP testing was 62.94 and 33.14 copies/mL for N and ORF1ab region, respectively. ID testing could achieve 3.87 and 4.85 copies/mL for two regions using 1600 muL of plasma. Coefficients of variations of two different concentrations of reference samples were all less than 5% in MP testing. As of April 30, 2020, a total of 98,342 blood donations including 87,095 whole blood donations and 11,247 platelet donations were tested by ID or MP testing, and no RNAemia was found. In addition, Hubei province suffered precipitously decreased blood supply, especially in February: 86% reduction compared with the same period of 2019. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid test screening of SARS-CoV-2 on blood donations is suitable in blood establishments using the commercial real-time PCR detection kit based on available instruments. The negative result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be no direct threat to blood safety but raises some serious issues for general blood supply.","answer":"[\\"Diagnosis\\", \\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

We employ an iterative optimization scheme, where we train an RNN on a dataset of K best programs from a priority queue of the generated programs so far. Then, we synthesize new programs and add them to the priority queue by sampling from the RNN. We benchmark our algorithm, called priority queue training (or PQT), against genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning baselines on a simple but expressive Turing complete programming language called BF. Our experimental results show that our simple PQT algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines. By adding a program length penalty to the reward function, we are able to synthesize short, human readable programs.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Tasks like code generation and semantic parsing require mapping unstructured (or partially structured) inputs to well-formed, executable outputs. We introduce abstract syntax networks, a modeling framework for these problems. The outputs are represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and constructed by a decoder with a dynamically-determined modular structure paralleling the structure of the output tree. On the benchmark Hearthstone dataset for code generation, our model obtains 79.2 BLEU and 22.7 exact match accuracy, compared to previous state-of-the-art values of 67.1 and 6.1 . Furthermore, we perform competitively on the Atis, Jobs, and Geo semantic parsing datasets with no task-specific engineering.","answer":"The algorithm presented here is partly inspired by [1] , where they use a priority queue of top- @math programs to augment with off-policy training. also bears resemblance to the cross-entropy method (CEM), a reinforcement learning technique which has been used to play games such as Tetris ."},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Glutathione is present in millimolar concentrations in most mammalian cells and it is involved in several fundamental biological functions, including free radical scavenging, detoxification of xenobiotics and carcinogens, redox reactions, biosynthesis of DNA, proteins and leukotrienes, as well as neurotransmission/neuromodulation. Glutathione is metabolised via the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which is catalyzed by six enzymes. In man, hereditary deficiencies have been found in five of the six enzymes. Glutathione synthetase deficiency is the most frequently recognized disorder and, in its severe form, it is associated with hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis, 5-oxoprolinuria, central nervous system (CNS) damage and recurrent bacterial infections. Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency is also associated with hemolytic anemia, and some patients with this disorder show defects of neuromuscular function and generalized aminoaciduria. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency has been found in patients with CNS involvement and glutathionuria. 5-Oxoprolinase deficiency is associated with 5-oxoprolinuria but without a clear association with other symptoms. Dipeptidase deficiency has been described in one patient. All disorders are very rare and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most of the mutations are leaky so that many patients have residual enzyme activity. Diagnosis is made by measuring the concentration of different metabolites in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, enzyme activity and in glutathione synthetase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency, also by mutation analysis. Prenatal diagnosis has been preformed in glutathione synthetase deficiency. The prognosis is difficult to predict, as few patients are known, but seems to vary significantly between different patients. The aims of the treatment of glutathione synthesis defects are to avoid hemolytic crises and to increase the defense against reactive oxygen species. No treatment has been recommended for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, 5-oxoprolinase and dipeptidase deficiency.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"glutathione\\", \\"glycine\\", \\"Gamma-glutamylcysteine\\", \\"cysteine\\", \\"gamma-glutamylcysteine\\", \\"Gamma-glutamyl\\", \\"glutamate\\", \\"tripeptide\\", \\"oxygen\\", \\"Glutathione\\", \\"gamma-glutamyl\\", \\"leukotrienes\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Dipeptidase\\", \\"Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase\\", \\"glutathione synthetase\\", \\"5-oxoprolinase\\", \\"5-Oxoprolinase\\", \\"dipeptidase\\", \\"gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase\\", \\"Glutathione synthetase\\", \\"Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase\\", \\"gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

For this purpose, we leverage AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) where multiple tiny modules between Transformer blocks called adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) can be combined after independent training, thus allowing a continual integration of the adapters without retraining the entire framework. Specifically, we treat the adapters as different KG-specific experts, and combine them using an attention-like fusion module. To improve the fusion of adapters, we suggest a KG-alignment adapter that guides to the apt expert adapters. Here, we use KGs in three different synthetic supervision training: (1) KG-specific QA datasets to train the KG-specific expert adapters, (2) a KG classification datasets to train the KG-alignment adapter, and (3) a balanced mixture of KG-specific QA datasets to train the fusion module. Our modularized method alleviates the interference between different KGs, which is the pitfall of MTL from our empirical observation, and thus combines multiple KGs into a synergetic zero-shot framework. Paragraph10 : Specifically, we propose a novel training task for KG-Classifier adapter, which requires predicting the KG for the given sample of the task. For that, given {Dk_QA} K k=1, we first transform a QA sample (Qi, Ai) into a new KG classification sample [Qi; Ai,label] where [; ] is the concatenation. Then, we obtain a new label yi ∈ {0, 1} K indicating the corresponding KG source. The samples are in Appendix E. Formally, KG classification dataset DKGC is defined as: DKGC = {([Qi ; Ai,label], yi)} M_i=1 (9) where M is the total size of {Dk QA} K k=1.Question: Which dataset is used for KG-Classifier adapter training?","answer":"For KG-Classifier adapter training, KG classification dataset has been used.

Please answer the question. Do not include any text in your response other than the answer.Context: Meta-path prediction is similar to link prediction but meta-paths allow heterogeneous composite relations.The meta-path prediction can be achieved in the same manner as link prediction.If two nodes u and v are connected by a meta-path p with the heterogeneous edges (t_{1},t_{2},ldots t_{ell}), then y_{u,v}^{p}=1, otherwise y_{u,v}^{p}=0. The labels can be generated from a heterogeneous graph without any manual labeling.They can be obtained by A_{p}=A_{t_{l}}ldots A_{t_{2}}A_{t_{1}}, where A_{t} is the adjacency matrix of edge type t. The binarized value at (u,v) in A_{p} indicates whether u and v are connected with the meta-path p.In this paper, we use meta-path prediction as a self-supervised auxiliary task. Meta-Path [46, 49] is a path on a heterogeneous graph G that a sequence of nodes connected with heterogeneous edges, i.e., v1 t1 −→ v2 t2 −→ . . . tl −→ vl+1, where tl ∈ T e denotes an l-th edge type of the meta-path. The meta-path can be viewed as a composite relation R = t1 ◦ t2 . . . ◦ tl between node v1 and vl+1, where R1 ◦ R2 denotes the composition of relation R1 and R2. The definition of meta-path generalizes multi-hop connections and is shown to be useful to analyze heterogeneous graphs. For instance, in Book-Crossing dataset, ‘user-item-written.series-item-user’ indicates that a meta-path that connects users who like the same book series.Question: How did the authors design the meta-path prediction task?","answer":"The authors designed the meta-path prediction task as a variation of link prediction. In meta-path prediction, instead of just predicting links between two nodes, the task is to predict the presence of a specific sequence of heterogeneous composite relations, called a meta-path. The prediction is done in the same way as link prediction, by assigning a binary label (1 or 0) to indicate whether the two nodes are connected by the meta-path. The labels for the task can be generated automatically from the heterogeneous graph, by calculating the product of the adjacency matrices of the edge types in the meta-path."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

Unlike the most existing efforts which study depression by analyzing textual content, we examine and exploit multimodal big data to discern depressive behavior using a wide variety of features including individual-level demographics. By developing a multimodal framework and employing statistical techniques for fusing heterogeneous sets of features obtained by processing visual, textual and user interaction data, we significantly enhance the current state-of-the-art approaches for identifying depressed individuals on Twitter (improving the average F1-Score by 5 percent) as well as facilitate demographic inference from social media for broader applications. Besides providing insights into the relationship between demographics and mental health, our research assists in the design of a new breed of demographic-aware health interventions.DatasetSelf-disclosure clues have been extensively utilized for creating ground-truth data for numerous social media analytic studies e.g., for predicting demographics BIBREF36 , BIBREF41 , and user's depressive behavior BIBREF46 , BIBREF47 , BIBREF48 . For instance, vulnerable individuals may employ depressive-indicative terms in their Twitter profile descriptions. Others may share their age and gender, e.g., \\"16 years old suicidal girl\\"(see Figure FIGREF15 ). We employ a huge dataset of 45,000 self-reported depressed users introduced in BIBREF46 where a lexicon of depression symptoms consisting of 1500 depression-indicative terms was created with the help of psychologist clinician and employed for collecting self-declared depressed individual's profiles. A subset of 8,770 users (24 million time-stamped tweets) containing 3981 depressed and 4789 control users (that do not show any depressive behavior) were verified by two human judges BIBREF46 . This dataset INLINEFORM0 contains the metadata values of each user such as profile descriptions, followers_count, created_at, and profile_image_url.Age Enabled Ground-truth Dataset: We extract user's age by applying regular expression patterns to profile descriptions (such as \\"17 years old, self-harm, anxiety, depression\\") BIBREF41 . We compile \\"age prefixes\\" and \\"age suffixes\\", and use three age-extraction rules: 1. I am X years old 2. Born in X 3. X years old, where X is a \\"date\\" or age (e.g., 1994). We selected a subset of 1061 users among INLINEFORM0 as gold standard dataset INLINEFORM1 who disclose their age. From these 1061 users, 822 belong to depressed class and 239 belong to control class. From 3981 depressed users, 20.6% disclose their age in contrast with only 4% (239/4789) among control group. So self-disclosure of age is more prevalent among vulnerable users. Figure FIGREF18 depicts the age distribution in INLINEFORM2 . The general trend, consistent with the results in BIBREF42 , BIBREF49 , is biased toward young people. Indeed, according to Pew, 47% of Twitter users are younger than 30 years old BIBREF50 . Similar data collection procedure with comparable distribution have been used in many prior efforts BIBREF51 , BIBREF49 , BIBREF42 . We discuss our approach to mitigate the impact of the bias in Section 4.1. The median age is 17 for depressed class versus 19 for control class suggesting either likely depressed-user population is younger, or depressed youngsters are more likely to disclose their age for connecting to their peers (social homophily.) BIBREF51 Gender Enabled Ground-truth Dataset: We selected a subset of 1464 users INLINEFORM0 from INLINEFORM1 who disclose their gender in their profile description. From 1464 users 64% belonged to the depressed group, and the rest (36%) to the control group. 23% of the likely depressed users disclose their gender which is considerably higher (12%) than that for the control class. Once again, gender disclosure varies among the two gender groups. For statistical significance, we performed chi-square test (null hypothesis: gender and depression are two independent variables). Figure FIGREF19 illustrates gender association with each of the two classes. Blue circles (positive residuals, see Figure FIGREF19 -A,D) show positive association among corresponding row and column variables while red circles (negative residuals, see Figure FIGREF19 -B,C) imply a repulsion. Our findings are consistent with the medical literature BIBREF10 as according to BIBREF52 more women than men were given a diagnosis of depression. In particular, the female-to-male ratio is 2.1 and 1.9 for Major Depressive Disorder and Dysthymic Disorder respectively. Our findings from Twitter data indicate there is a strong association (Chi-square: 32.75, p-value:1.04e-08) between being female and showing depressive behavior on Twitter.Multi-modal Prediction FrameworkWe use the above findings for predicting depressive behavior. Our model exploits early fusion BIBREF32 technique in feature space and requires modeling each user INLINEFORM0 in INLINEFORM1 as vector concatenation of individual modality features. As opposed to computationally expensive late fusion scheme where each modality requires a separate supervised modeling, this model reduces the learning effort and shows promising results BIBREF75 . To develop a generalizable model that avoids overfitting, we perform feature selection using statistical tests and all relevant ensemble learning models. It adds randomness to the data by creating shuffled copies of all features (shadow feature), and then trains Random Forest classifier on the extended data. Iteratively, it checks whether the actual feature has a higher Z-score than its shadow feature (See Algorithm SECREF6 and Figure FIGREF45 ) BIBREF76 .Main each Feature INLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1 RndForrest( INLINEFORM0 ) Calculate Imp INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 Generate next hypothesis , INLINEFORM3 Once all hypothesis generated Perform Statistical Test INLINEFORM4 //Binomial Distribution INLINEFORM5 Feature is important Feature is important Ensemble Feature SelectionNext, we adopt an ensemble learning method that integrates the predictive power of multiple learners with two main advantages; its interpretability with respect to the contributions of each feature and its high predictive power. For prediction we have INLINEFORM0 where INLINEFORM1 is a weak learner and INLINEFORM2 denotes the final prediction.In particular, we optimize the loss function: INLINEFORM0 where INLINEFORM1 incorporates INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 regularization. In each iteration, the new INLINEFORM4 is obtained by fitting weak learner to the negative gradient of loss function. Particularly, by estimating the loss function with Taylor expansion : INLINEFORM5 where its first expression is constant, the second and the third expressions are first ( INLINEFORM6 ) and second order derivatives ( INLINEFORM7 ) of the loss. INLINEFORM8 For exploring the weak learners, assume INLINEFORM0 has k leaf nodes, INLINEFORM1 be subset of users from INLINEFORM2 belongs to the node INLINEFORM3 , and INLINEFORM4 denotes the prediction for node INLINEFORM5 . Then, for each user INLINEFORM6 belonging to INLINEFORM7 , INLINEFORM8 and INLINEFORM9 INLINEFORM10 Next, for each leaf node INLINEFORM0 , deriving w.r.t INLINEFORM1 : INLINEFORM2 and by substituting weights: INLINEFORM0 which represents the loss for fixed weak learners with INLINEFORM0 nodes. The trees are built sequentially such that each subsequent tree aims to reduce the errors of its predecessor tree. Although, the weak learners have high bias, the ensemble model produces a strong learner that effectively integrate the weak learners by reducing bias and variance (the ultimate goal of supervised models) BIBREF77 . Table TABREF48 illustrates our multimodal framework outperform the baselines for identifying depressed users in terms of average specificity, sensitivity, F-Measure, and accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation setting on INLINEFORM1 dataset. Figure FIGREF47 shows how the likelihood of being classified into the depressed class varies with each feature addition to the model for a sample user in the dataset. The prediction bar (the black bar) shows that the log-odds of prediction is 0.31, that is, the likelihood of this person being a depressed user is 57% (1 / (1 + exp(-0.3))). The figure also sheds light on the impact of each contributing feature. The waterfall charts represent how the probability of being depressed changes with the addition of each feature variable. For instance, the \\"Analytic thinking\\" of this user is considered high 48.43 (Median:36.95, Mean: 40.18) and this decreases the chance of this person being classified into the depressed group by the log-odds of -1.41. Depressed users have significantly lower \\"Analytic thinking\\" score compared to control class. Moreover, the 40.46 \\"Clout\\" score is a low value (Median: 62.22, Mean: 57.17) and it decreases the chance of being classified as depressed. With respect to the visual features, for instance, the mean and the median of 'shared_colorfulness' is 112.03 and 113 respectively. The value of 136.71 would be high; thus, it decreases the chance of being depressed for this specific user by log-odds of -0.54.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing problem not only in the United States but also across the world. There is now strong evidence that intensive control of blood glucose can significantly reduce and retard the microvascular complications of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Ultimately however, up to 80% of type 2 diabetics die from macrovascular cardiovascular disease. This increased incidence of atherosclerotic disease is intricately associated with insulin resistance, which is a major pathophysiologic abnormality in type 2 diabetes. There is strong evidence that insulin resistance is involved in the development of not only hyperglycemia, but also dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulation, vasculopathy, and ultimately atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This cluster of metabolic abnormalities has been termed the insulin resistance or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome. The thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone), a new class of oral antidiabetic agents, are \\"insulin sensitizers\\" and exert direct effects on the mechanisms of insulin resistance. These effects not only improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with reduced insulin requirements, but also have potentially favorable effects on other components of the cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome. Long-term studies are needed to determine whether the insulin-sensitizing effects of the glitazones can prevent or delay premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, morbidity, and death.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"pioglitazone\\", \\"rosiglitazone\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"glitazones\\", \\"thiazolidinediones\\", \\"antidiabetic agents\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We propose a dynamic trust management protocol for Internet of Things (IoT) systems to deal with misbehaving nodes whose status or behavior may change dynamically. We consider an IoT system being deployed in a smart community where each node autonomously performs trust evaluation. We provide a formal treatment of the convergence, accuracy, and resilience properties of our dynamic trust management protocol and validate these desirable properties through simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our dynamic trust management protocol with a trust-based service composition application in IoT environments. Our results indicate that trust-based service composition significantly outperforms non-trust-based service composition and approaches the maximum achievable performance based on ground truth status. Furthermore, our dynamic trust management protocol is capable of adaptively adjusting the best trust parameter setting in response to dynamically changing environments to maximize application performance. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  This work proposes a new trust management system (TMS) for the Internet of Things (IoT). The wide majority of these systems are today bound to the assessment of trustworthiness with respect to a single function. As such, they cannot use past experiences related to other functions. Even those that support multiple functions hide this heterogeneity by regrouping all past experiences into a single metric. These restrictions are detrimental to the adaptation of TMSs to today's emerging M2M and IoT architectures, which are characterized with heterogeneity in nodes, capabilities and services. To overcome these limitations, we design a context-aware and multi-service trust management system fitting the new requirements of the IoT. Simulation results show the good performance of the proposed system and especially highlight its ability to deter a class of common attacks designed to target trust management systems. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  An Internet of Things (IoT) system connects a large amount of tags, sensors, and mobile devices to facilitate information sharing, enabling a variety of attractive applications. It challenges the design and evaluation of IoT systems to meet the scalability, compatibility, extendibility, dynamic adaptability and resiliency requirements. In this paper, we design and evaluate a scalable, adaptive and survivable trust management protocol in dynamic IoT environments. Recognizing that entities in an IoT system are connected through social networks of entity owners, we consider a community of interest (CoI) based social IoT where nodes form into communities of interest. Given inter-CoI vs. intra-CoI social connections among entity owners as input, we identify best trust protocol settings for achieving convergence, accuracy, dynamic adaptability and resiliency properties in the presence of dynamically changing conditions and malicious nodes performing trust-related attacks. For scalability, we consider a design by which a node only keeps trust information of a subset of nodes meeting its interest and performs minimum computation to update trust. We validate our design by extensive simulation considering both limited and ideal (unlimited) storage space. The results demonstrate that our trust management protocol using limited storage space achieves a similar performance level compared with the one under ideal storage space, and a newly joining node can quickly build up trust towards other nodes with desirable accuracy and convergence behavior. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  The addition of social networking to Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the paradigm of Social Internet of Things (SIoT). It is where digital devices called objects mimic the social behavior of their human counterparts and build up social relationships with other objects in order to provide services to the humans. One of the obstacles in realizing this idea is trust management. The most complex question in trust building is ‘How can objects trust the information provided by other objects?’ This paper proposes a new trust model based on Guarantor and Reputation for SIoT. The former requests an object to find a guarantor at an agreed commission rate in order to get service from another object; the latter uses reputation of a node to measure its trustworthiness. By simulating this model using an architecture based on real world scenarios, it was concluded that the trust model can be employed in different scenarios in SIoT and the use of penalties for malicious activity enables the model to detect and isolate malicious nodes. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Application of trust principals in internet of things (IoT) has allowed to provide more trustworthy services among the corresponding stakeholders. The most common method of assessing trust in IoT applications is to estimate trust level of the end entities (entity-centric) relative to the trustor. In these systems, trust level of the data is assumed to be the same as the trust level of the data source. However, most of the IoT based systems are data centric and operate in dynamic environments, which need immediate actions without waiting for a trust report from end entities. We address this challenge by extending our previous proposals on trust establishment for entities based on their reputation, experience and knowledge, to trust estimation of data items [1-3]. First, we present a hybrid trust framework for evaluating both data trust and entity trust, which will be enhanced as a standardization for future data driven society. The modules including data trust metric extraction, data trust aggregation, evaluation and prediction are elaborated inside the proposed framework. Finally, a possible design model is described to implement the proposed ideas. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  We propose and analyze a 3-tier cloud-cloudlet-device hierarchical trust management protocol called IoT-HiTrust for large-scale IoT systems. Our mobile cloud hierarchical trust management protocol allows an IoT device to report its service experiences and query the trustworthiness of another IoT device for service composition and selection following a simple localized report-and-query paradigm. We verify IoT-HiTrust's conver-gence, accuracy, and resiliency properties against self-promotion, discriminatory, bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and opportunistic service attacks despite intermittent network disconnection to the cloud. 8. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB008):  The Internet of Things (IoT) is an extended network that allows all devices to be connected to one another over the Internet. This new network faces numerous challenges, but mainly security issues. One such issue is how the IoT’s nodes can trust each other when they are connected over the Internet. There is a lack of studies that address the issue of trust management in IoT, or that provide a fully trustworthy framework. This paper proposes and delivers a centralized trust management mechanism for IoT by adding trust modules as a feature of the central trust manager, the Super Node (SN). To deliver a comprehensive approach, the SN includes other modules which are integrated with the whole IoT Trust Management framework to provide trustworthy communication between all nodes. 9. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB009):  Abstract In the age of IoT (Internet of Things), Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication has gained significant popularity over the last few years. M2M communication systems may have a large number of autonomous connected devices that provide services without human involvement. Interacting with compromised, infected and malicious machines can bring damaging consequences in the form of network outage, machine failure, data integrity, and financial loss. Hence, users first need to evaluate the trustworthiness of machines prior to interacting with them. This can be realized by using a reputation system, which evaluates the trustworthiness of machines by utilizing the feedback collected from the users of the machines. The design of a reliable reputation system for the distributed M2M communication network should preserve user privacy and have low computation and communication overheads. To address these challenges, we propose an M2M-REP System (Machine to Machine REPutation), a privacy-preserving reputation system for evaluating the trustworthiness of autonomous machines in the M2M network. The system computes global reputation scores of machines while maintaining privacy of the individual participant score by using secure multi-party computation techniques. The M2M-REP system ensures correctness, security and privacy properties under the malicious adversarial model, and allows public verifiability without relying on a centralized trusted system. We implement a prototype of our system and evaluate the system performance in terms of the computation and bandwidth overhead. 10. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB010):  Internet of Every things (IoE) is a network that integrates a variety of heterogeneous nodes, such as connected portable devices, connected cars, smart home appliances, humans, etc. to Internet. The constituents of IoE are heterogeneous, distributed by nature and also autonomous in most of cases, which meet the criteria of what we call Systems of Systems (SoS). These smart objects communicate and collaborate between each other in dynamic environments which are subject to several security attacks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical based blockchain trust management architecture with mobility support in highly distributed IoE based Systems of Systems. This architecture deals efficiently with scalability issues. It allows smart objects to disseminate the trustworthiness of the service providers they interact with them to the blockchain. This later makes the access to this information possible from anywhere and ensures a global view of trustworthiness information. Thanks to the blockchain technology, our architecture outperforms the existing trust management solutions especially in terms of scalability and mobility support. 11. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB011):  The Internet of Things (IoT)-Cloud combines the IoT and cloud computing, which not only enhances the IoT’s capability but also expands the scope of its applications. However, it exhibits significant security and efficiency problems that must be solved. Internal attacks account for a large fraction of the associated security problems, however, traditional security strategies are not capable of addressing these attacks effectively. Moreover, as repeated/similar service requirements become greater in number, the efficiency of IoT-Cloud services is seriously affected. In this paper, a novel architecture that integrates a trust evaluation mechanism and service template with a balance dynamics based on cloud and edge computing is proposed to overcome these problems. In this architecture, the edge network and the edge platform are designed in such a way as to reduce resource consumption and ensure the extensibility of trust evaluation mechanism, respectively. To improve the efficiency of IoT-Cloud services, the service parameter template is established in the cloud and the service parsing template is established in the edge platform. Moreover, the edge network can assist the edge platform in establishing service parsing templates based on the trust evaluation mechanism and meet special service requirements. The experimental results illustrate that this edge-based architecture can improve both the security and efficiency of IoT-Cloud systems.Literature Review:","answer":"The IoT vision comes as a result of connecting heterogeneous nodes ranging from physical entities to smart devices. As stated in BIB002  , there are 9 billion interconnected nodes and this number is expected to reach 20 billion by 2020. To benefit from the vision of IoT, data sources are the first step to be scrutinized. Usually, WSNs are utilized to gather and disseminate data. Data fusion techniques are then applied to discover desirable features or to enhance decision making. Finally, the fused data is consumed by smart applications in order to provide intelligent services. Data sources' misbehavior renders IoT smart applications unreliable. Therefore, during data collection and data fusion, we must select only trusted data sources and fusion centers. Since these sensors are the resource/information providers to fusion centers, a sensor could be captured by an adversary, which may lead to its non-cooperative behavior or misbehavior. In addition, a sensor can itself become untrustworthy. As such, IoT trust models are an essential requirement for information fusion and hence, for the success of IoT intelligent services. Designing an efficient architecture faces many issues such as heterogeneity, scalability, mobility, and constrained capabilities of various IoT entities. Centralized IoT architectures BIB007 BIB008  BIB004 BIB006  BIB009 BIB001 , where a central trust manager computes and stores trust values, have common issues including single-point of failure and the difficulty of maintaining the global view of all involved IoT devices due to the dynamicity nature of IoT systems. Furthermore, traffic bottleneck is another issue when a large number of IoT sensors interact with the centralized trust manager consuming energy and disrupting communication bandwidth. On the other hand, distributed trust models for IoT environments can be divided into three class, namely object-layer-based, fog-layer-based, or cloud-layer-based. Distributed architectures for modeling trust such as BIB003 BIB005 BIB010 implement the trust model at the things layer which has hardware constraints in terms of limited computing and energy resources. As such, these things will not be able to support basic functions like trust computation, trust propagation, trust updates, and trust storage BIB012 . To the best of our knowledge, the only distributed architecture that implements the trust model in the fog layer is BIB011 . This work allows smart objects to utilize the blockchain as storage to advertise their trust levels about other nodes. Scalability and mobility support of this architecture are inherited from the blockchain technology. Some functionalities, such as trust storage, of a trust model can also be implemented at the cloud layer. This implementation inherits similar disadvantages as the centralized IoT architectures."},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

BID2 .The policy π can learn to imitate the expert behavior by maximizing likelihood of the condition distribution of action given states p(a|s).This can be achieved by simply training a parameterized function (neural networks for instance) with state and action pairs from the expert trajectories.Since this involves end-to-end supervised learning, training is much more sample-efficient compared to reinforcement learning and overcomes inherent problems in model-free methods such as credit assignment BID22 ).However, since behavior cloning learns optimal action from a single state value only, it is unaware of the future state distribution the current action will produce.Thus, errors are compounded in the future states leading to undesired agent behavior as shown by BID18 ; BID17 .Therefore, numerous training samples are required for behavior cloning to reduce errors in action prediction required for satisfactory imitation learning.The second approach to imitation learning involves setting up exploration in a Markov Decision Process(MDP) setting.The goal then is to recover a reward signal that best explains the expert trajectories.BID12 first introduced Inverse Reinforcement Learning(IRL), where the goal is to find a reward signalr from the trajectories such that the expert is uniquely optimal.After computing this estimated reward signal, usually, a model-free reinforcement learning performed to obtain the desired policy imitating the expert behavior by maximizing the expected discounted reward E π ( t γ tr (s t , a t )).While this alleviates the problem of compounding errors as in behavior cloning, BID25 showed that estimating a unique reward function from state and action trajectories is an ill-posed problem.Following the success of Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) BID3 ) in various fields of machine learning, adversarial learning has also been shown incorporated in the imitation learning framework.The recent work on Generative Adversarial Imitation Leaning or GAIL by BID4 showed that model-free reinforcement learning using the discriminator as a cost function can learn to imitate the expert agent with much less number of demonstrated trajectories compared to behavior cloning.Following the success of GAIL, there have extensions by BID0 to model-based generative imitation learning using a differentiable dynamics model of the environment.Robust imitation policy strategies using a combination of variational autoencoders BID7 ; BID16 ) and GAIL has also been proposed by BID23 .Theprevious works assume that the expert trajectories consist of both action and state values from the optimal agent. However, optimal actions are usually not available in real-world imitation learning. For example, we often learn tasks like skipping, jump rope, gymnastics, etc. just by watching other expert humans perform the task. In this case, the optimal expert trajectories only consist of visual input, in other words, the consecutive states of the expert human with no action information. We learn tojump rope by trying to reproduce actions that result in state trajectories similar to the state trajectories observed from the expert. This requiresexploring the environment in a structured fashion to learn the dynamics of the rope (for jump rope) which then enables executing optimal actions to imitate the expert behavior. The recent workof BID10 presents learning from observations only with focus to transferring skills learned from source domain to an unseen target domain, using rewards obtained by feature tracking for model-free reinforcement learning.Inspired by the above method of learning in humans, we present a principled way of learning to imitate an expert from state information only, with no action information available. We first learna distribution of the next state from the current state trajectory, used to estimate a heuristic reward signal enabling model-free exploration. The state, actionand next states information from modelfree exploration is used to learn a dynamics model of the environment. For the case of learningin humans, this is similar to performing actions for replicating the witnessed expert state trajectories, which in turn gives information about the dynamics of the environment. Once this forward modelis learned, we try to find the action that maximizes the likelihood of next state. Since the forward modelgives a function approximation for the environment dynamics, we can back propagate errors through it to perform model-based policy update by end to end supervised learning. We demonstrate that ourproposed network can reach, with fewer iterations, the level close to an expert agent behavior (which is a pre-trained actor network or manually provided by humans), and compare it with reinforcement learning using a hand-crafted reward or a heuristics reward that is based on prediction error of next state learned from the optimal state trajectories of the expert.We presented a model-based imitation learning method that can learn to act from expert state trajectories in the absence of action information.Our method uses trajectories sampled from the modelfree policy exploration to train a dynamics model of the environment.As model-free policy is enriched through time, the forward model can better approximate the actual environment dynamics, which leads to improved gradient flow, leading to better model-based policy update which is trained in a supervised fashion from expert state trajectories.In the ideal case, when dynamics model perfectly approximates the environment, our proposed method is equivalent to behavior cloning, even in the absence of action information.We demonstrate that the proposed method learns the desired policy in less number of iterations compared conventional model-free methods.We also show that once the dynamics model is trained it can be used to transfer learning for other tasks in a similar environment in an end-to-end supervised manner.Future work includes tighter integration of the model-based learning and the model-free learning for higher data efficiency by sharing information (1) between the model-free policy π mf and the model-based policy π mb and (2) between the next state predictor p(s t+1 |s t ) and the dynamics model p(s t+1 |s t , a t ) and (3) improving the limitations of compounding errors and requirement of large number of demonstration, by adversarial training which can maximize likelihood of future state distributions as well.","answer":"Learning to imitate an expert in the absence of optimal actions learning a dynamics model while exploring the environment."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We assessed obesity-induced changes of n-3-derived SPM in adipose tissue and effects of dietary EPA/DHA thereon.Moreover, we treated obese mice with SPM precursors and investigated effects on inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Obesity significantly decreased DHA-derived 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA, resolvin D1 precursor) and protectin D1 levels in murine adipose tissue. Dietary EPA/DHA treatment restored endogenous biosynthesis of n-3 derived lipid mediators in obesity while attenuating adipose tissue inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity. Notably, 17-HDHA treatment reduced adipose tissue expression of inflammatory cytokines, increased adiponectin expression and improved glucose tolerance parallel to insulin sensitivity in obese mice. These findings indicate that impaired biosynthesis of certain SPM and SPM precursors including 17-HDHA and protectin D1 contributes to adipose tissue inflammation in obesity and suggest 17-HDHA as a novel treatment option for obesity-associated complications.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"EPA\\", \\"glucose\\", \\"17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid\\", \\"eicosapentaenoic acid\\", \\"DHA\\", \\"docosahexaenoic acid\\", \\"17-HDHA\\", \\"resolvin D1\\", \\"protectin D1\\", \\"polyunsaturated fatty acids\\", \\"resolvins\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"adiponectin\\", \\"cytokines\\", \\"insulin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

In a mouse model of chronic social isolation, a known risk factor for depressive illness, we show that 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus are less responsive to stimulation. Probing the responsible cellular mechanisms pinpoints a disturbance in the expression and function of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+( SK) channels and reveals an important role for both SK2 and SK3 channels in normal regulation of 5-HT neuronal excitability. Chronic social isolation renders 5-HT neurons insensitive to SK2 blockade, however inhibition of the upregulated SK3 channels restores normal excitability. In vivo, we demonstrate that inhibiting SK channels normalizes chronic social isolation-induced anxiety/depressive-like behaviors. Our experiments reveal a causal link for the first time between SK channel dysregulation and 5-HT neuron activity in a lifelong stress paradigm, suggesting these channels as targets for the development of novel therapies for mood disorders.Introduction:Major depression is a prevalent and debilitating disease for which standard treatments remain ineffective. Social isolation has long been implicated as a risk factor for depression in humans( Cacioppo et al., 2002, 2006; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010) and induces anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in rodents( Koike et al., 2009; Wallace et al., 2009; Dang et al., 2015; Shimizu et al., 2016; for review see Fone and Porkess, 2008; Lukkes et al., 2009). The most frequently prescribed medications for depression and anxiety disorders target the serotonin( 5-HT) producing neurons( Blier et al., 1990; Nutt, 2005), the majority of which are located in the dorsal raphe nucleus( DRN)( Descarries et al., 1982). The activity of 5-HT neurons is highly vulnerable to stress( Lira et al., 2003; Bambico et al., 2009; Espallergues et al., 2012; Challis et al., 2013) and is critical for depressive-like, anxiogenic, and reward-associated behaviors( Liu et al., 2014; Teissier et al., 2015; Urban et al., 2016). Interestingly, social isolation in rodents has been shown to affect endogenous 5-HT release and 5-HT turnover in postsynaptic areas( Heidbreder et al., 2000; Muchimapura et al., 2002, 2003). However, it is unknown how social isolation affects the activity of DRN 5-HT neurons themselves. Identification of changes in the activity of these neurons may uncover novel therapeutic targets for depression and anxiety disorders. Here, we show that chronic social isolation leads to a reduction in the excitability of DRN 5-HT neurons. Their firing activity to optical, electrophysiological, and neuromodulatory stimulation are all reduced after social isolation. Specifically, we have identified that the reduction in the firing activity of 5-HT neurons results from alterations in the function and expression of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+( SK) channels. Furthermore, inhibition of SK channels normalizes the activity of 5-HT neurons and restores the behavioral deficits observed after chronic social isolation.Discussion:Our results demonstrate that chronic social isolation results in a reduction in the excitability of 5-HT neurons and renders them less responsive to stimulation. We demonstrate that inhibiting SK channels, critical regulators of AHP in these cells, can reverse the reduced excitability. This work provides the first direct link between a chronic social isolation paradigm and functional alterations in 5-HT neurons themselves. We also reveal that SK2 contributes to normal regulation of 5-HT neuronal excitability but ceases to modulate these neurons significantly after chronic stress. Behavioral analysis showed that chronic social isolation increases anxiety/depression-like behaviors, which can be normalized upon inhibition of SK channels by acute systemic apamin. In humans, polymorphisms on the gene encoding the SK3 channel have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by emotional dysregulation including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and anorexia nervosa( Chandy et al., 1998; Koronyo-Hamaoui et al., 2007; Grube et al., 2011). Administration of the SK channel blocker apamin in mice and rats reduced immobility in a forced swim test( Galeotti et al., 1999; van der Staay et al., 1999), a measure of depressive-like behavior in rodents( Cryan and Slattery, 2007). Consistent with these reports, SK3 null mice show enhanced hippocampal 5-HT release and reduced immobility in forced swim and tail suspension tests, indicative of an antidepressant like phenotype( Jacobsen et al., 2008). Our work demonstrates for the first time that social isolation, a major risk factor for depression and anxiety, results in reduced 5-HT neuronal activity due to upregulated SK3 channel function in the DRN. Moreover, we show that systemic treatment with apamin, an inhibitor of SK channels improves behavioral deficits induced by chronic social isolation. Consistent with studies that have implicated SK channel function in neuropsychiatric conditions, our current findings suggest that SK channel modulation is a promising therapeutic target for disorders of emotional disturbance such as depression and anxiety. Apamin however has been reported to have adverse side effects in rats( van der Staay et al., 1999) close to the beneficial dose in the current mouse study. The diverse expression of SK channels in different tissue types and the lack of tissue/subtype specific modulators or inhibitors are currently the limiting factors for therapeutic interventions targeting SK channels. Further research focused on understanding the differential regulation, modulation and function of SK channel subtypes may shed light on the development of effective disease treatment strategies. Importantly, development of more specific drugs targeted at inhibiting SK3 function may have significant implications for treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders.","answer":"Major depressive disorder is a common and debilitating disease that interferes with the afflicted person’s everyday life . While some patients do benefit from antidepressant treatments , these medications need to be taken for several weeks before they become effective . Still , a large proportion of patients do not recover fully and some do not respond at all to the existing treatments . As a result , there is a need to find new and more effective treatments for depression . The most widely used antidepressant drugs target the chemical messenger or neurotransmitter called serotonin . The majority of nerve cells that produce serotonin are located in a region deep in the brain known as the dorsal raphe nucleus . When active , these nerve cells release serotonin; this in turn controls the cells’ own activity as well as the activity of a large number of connected nerve cells located throughout the brain . Any disruption in this system will have a widespread impact and can potentially increase the risk of disturbed moods . However , it was not exactly clear what alters the activity of serotonin-producing nerve cells in depression . Now , Sargin et al . have identified a previously unknown mechanism that underlies changes to the activity of serotonin-producing nerve cells . Keeping mice isolated for a prolonged period elicits the symptoms of depression . Sargin et al . found that serotonin-producing nerve cells were dramatically less active in isolated mice and that a specific type of ion channel protein ( the SK3 channel ) was more abundant in these nerve cells . A higher amount of this channel inhibits the activity of nerve cells . Blocking these inhibitory SK3 channels ( using a drug that can be obtained from bee venom ) restored normal activity in the serotonin-producing cells . Moreover , this treatment alleviated the depressive symptoms of the isolated mice . The findings of Sargin et al . suggest a new way to treat the symptoms of depression . Yet to translate them into an accessible treatment for patients , future work will be required to develop drugs that can specifically and potently target the affected channel ."},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

By 1955, when Henry Beecher published his landmark paper on placebos,2 it was understood that although the power of placebos was significant - Beecher estimated that approximately 30% of patients responded positively to placebo - drug and placebo responses were additive and, hence, the drug effect could be easily determined by subtraction. For the next half century, placebos would become the benchmark by which new drugs were tested, a veritable gold-standard for drug development. What Beecher did not foresee, however, was how placebos would wreak havoc on clinical trials and come to be a stumbling block for future drug development.</p>At what cost, failing to beat the placebo response?<p>In the last decade, a surprising and unexplained trend has emerged. Increasingly, drugs are failing to beat the placebo response. One possibility is that these new drugs are simply not efficacious. Although there are no comprehensive estimates of the extent of this problem, reports in schizophrenia, ADHD, neuropathic pain, clinical depression, and Parkinson disease suggest that while treatment efficacy has remained unchanged, the placebo response rate has crept up. These increased placebo response rates appear unpredictable, and while the sources of variation are not well understood, some studies point to variations in disease severity, non-stringent inclusion criteria, regression to the mean, natural history, treatment adherence, or psychological factors like openness to experience or extraversion, as contributors. Still, without methodology to control the vagaries of the placebo response, whole research areas remain at risk as evidenced by recent cutbacks in the neuroscience divisions of several large pharmaceutical companies.</p>What does neuroimaging tell us about the placebo response?<p>At the turn of this century, neuroimaging studies shifted our understanding of placebos from the domain of imagination to physiology and the brain. Brain regions activated in response to placebo treatment, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, amygdala, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray, revealed that there are regionally distinct pain, autonomic, and immune placebo response pathways. With evidence that signaling and downstream effectors included neurotransmitters (dopamine), hormones (norepinephrine), and cytokines (IL2), the research question turned to whether genetic variation in the molecules mediating these signaling pathways could influence variability in placebo response. Our group recently coined the term \\"placebome\\"3 to circumscribe the potential network of genome-related factors that influence the placebo response.4</p>The Placebome - Towards a genetics of the placebo response<p>Although placebos have been an integral part of clinical trials throughout the genomics era, there are no genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the placebo response, and no formal estimates of heritability. To assess what is known about placebo genetics, we started with a comprehensive review of the literature. Using the search terms ([placebo] and [gene] and [SNP]), we identified 28 genes from 42 studies associated with significant variation in outcomes in the placebo arm of a trial. These studies were all small (N<257), and included a mix of clinical trials and experimental paradigms in healthy volunteers. Only two studies included a no-treatment control, the requisite control for placebo research, and most of the studies conducted candidate analyses of genes hypothesized to be associated with the disease or treatment of interest. Given the limitations in this set of genes, we turned to the human interactome (the network of all known human physical protein-protein interactions) to identify other genes/proteins potentially associated with the placebo response. We developed a seed-connector algorithm to connect the original set of placebo response genes (seeds) to each other by adding as few extra nodes (proteins from the interactome) as possible. In this way, we created a placebome module consisting of 54 proteins. These 54 proteins were enriched for neurotransmitters, hormones, and cytokines that could readily be mapped to the pain (i.e., opioid: OPRM1 and OPRD1), autonomic (i.e., catecholamine: ADRA1B and COMT), and immune (i.e., cytokines: IL6 and TNF) placebo response pathways (Figure).</p><p>We hypothesized that the placebome, a distinct and novel module (or subnetwork) in the interactome, would be located proximal to modules (subnetworks) for specific diseases known to have a high placebo response. Using bench-mark conditions like anxiety, depression, and migraine disorders known to have a high placebo response, we confirmed that they were, indeed, proximal to the placebome. In contrast, conditions like viremia, uremia, and pneumothorax known to have low-to-no placebo responses were distal. We then compared the distance between an exhaustive set of 859 diseases and the placebome module, and found that there were 252 modules including central nervous system diseases (i.e., epilepsy and Parkinson disease) and substance abuse disorders that were significantly proximal to the placebome. Interestingly, metabolic diseases and some cancers also mapped close to the placebome. Although cancer and metabolic diseases are not known to have high placebo responses, the possibility remains that placebo response in some diseases could be initiated but limited in efficacy. We also mapped symptoms associated with high placebo response (pain, nausea, headache, fatigue, and hot flashes) and found them to be significantly proximal to the placebome compared to low-placebo symptoms like fever.</p>Additivity revisited<p>Strikingly, we found that 26 of the 28 placebo seed genes and 40 of the 54 genes in the placebome module were known drug targets. Further, when we examined the proximity of drug targets to the placebome module, we found 15 drug categories, including analgesics, appetite suppressants, and anti-depressives, that mapped significantly closely to the placebome. These observations raise two related questions. First, is the placebo response a 'druggable' target? And second, have we all along been developing drugs that target the placebo response? Certainly, naloxone and proglumide have been shown to disrupt the placebo response. What remains to be determined is how genetic variation in the placebo response pathway might affect our interpretation of clinical trial results. Could gene-drug/placebo interactions be an unexplored confounder of observed outcomes? Our findings of differential outcomes in the placebo and drug treatment arms as a function of a placebome gene, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), in two trials, NorCAPITAL5 and the Women's Health Study6 support this hypothesis and suggest that the placebome can be used to improve precision in drug efficacy determination.</p>Future directions<p>The concept of the placebome raises a series of interesting and challenging questions and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the placebo response in clinical trial design. Despite the tremendous body of work elucidating the neurological, behavioral, and now genetic underpinnings of the placebo response, placebos have not shaken the stigma of the charlatans they were enlisted to discredit. Any placebo researcher will tell you that scientists and clinicians are still disquieted by discussions about the implications of placebo effects. Because of this unease (a topic in and of itself), half of the data from thousands of clinical trials have been ignored for over half-a-century. This blind spot has cost us and will continue to do so unless and until we turn our scientific rigor towards this problem and address it with precision.</p>","answer":"There is perhaps no more important time in the history of placebos to consider their role in clinical trials and in medicine.

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: They have a double-stranded ribonucleic acid  (dsRNA) genome, divided into 11 segments coding for structural proteins (VP1-VP4, VP6 and VP7) and nonstructural (NSP1-NSP5/NSP6) proteins [16, 17] . There are records of a close relationship between Amazonian wildlife and human populations [18] , and this interaction is the effect of anthropogenic urbanization activities that result in the deforestation of forest areas, causing the degradation of previously isolated sites such as caves and small caves, a continuous and nature progressive process that has led not only to changes in wildlife habitats but also to a greater relationship with human populations in rural and urban environments, contributing to the occurrence and emergence of diseases different from what normally occurs in endemic regions [19] [20] [21] [22] . Although the results of RVA have already been described globally [12, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , in Brazil, the occurrence, diversity and role of rotavirus in these animals are still poorly studied, considering the large number of present species [4, [31] [32] [33] [34] . In the Brazilian Amazon, especially in the state of Pará, the city of Belém and Northeast metropolitan mesoregions are some of the areas with the highest indexes of environmental changes [35] , which are concentrated, along with the fact that the knowledge of the global diversity of enteric virus in animals is scarce [36] . Therefore, it is important to monitor the health of domestic and wild animals in their natural habitat, especially in areas with anthropic alterations that have an interface with rural communities and enterprises, in order to investigate the occurrence of RVA in this population. These communities are ecologically complex, because they have multiple hosts and endless pathogens that may eventually circulate in contiguous urban centers, in addition to the fact that it should also be considered that there is still a lack of studies showing the significance of these viruses infecting this population, as in the context of epidemiological surveillance, these animals become important, since they can be considered as natural sources, with the possibility of transmission to humans [37] [38] [39] . The qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) used the NSP3 gene and the TaqMan probe from a highly conserved region of the rotavirus non-structural protein 3 (NSP3), which was previously used in samples from human origin and with low viral loads Precipitation data were obtained from The Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (Inmethttp://www.inmet.gov.br/) for the years of capture in the Expedito Ribeiro Settlement (2014) and Açailândia (2015) of the Data Collection Platforms (PCDs) of Belém, located 50 km from Santa Bárbara do Pará, and Tracuateua, located 50 km from Peixe-Boi and 100 km from Viseu. Garmin GPSMap 64s Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates were collected in the field. The municipal boundaries were obtained on the website of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) (http://www.ibge.gov.br/) and data on deforestation and land use were obtained from the PRODES [43] and TerraClass [44] Projects. PRODES has annual data in digital format since 2000 and TerraClass presents biannual data since 2004. The satellite image was generated using the sensor Sentinel 2 of the European Space Agency (ESA) (https://sentinel.esa.int/ web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi) with Open Access CC-BY License (http://open.esa.int/) from the years of 2017 and 2018. All the data obtained was stored in a Geographic Database (BDG). The BDG was imported/ stored in a GIS for the editing of the graphic elements, establishment of topological relations between the elements and their respective attributes, spatial analysis and visualization of the result through thematic maps. For the present study, forest fragments of similar size, shape and Phyto physiology were chosen, considering an open peri urban matrix with similar soil use. The selected fragments were distributed within the mesoregions studied, and in each selected fragment fecal samples were randomly collected from domestic and wild animals [45] . Soil use classes were obtained from the TerraClass data mosaic from 2004 to 2016, because the study sites were in an area with a high cloud presence, which prevented observation (the area was not observed). The data processing, interpretation, visualization and spatial analysis were performed in ArcGIS software (http://www.arcgis.com/). For the analysis of data related to the determination of the richness, composition and abundance of the fauna of the animals studied in the study area, considering the collection methods adopted and the species available in each city, each sample was considered as an independent sample. The richness of wild fauna and domestic animals was determined by the total number of species including all collection methods, and the similarity of species was made by the chi-square analysis between the samples of the different treatments with the aid of the EstimateS 8.0 software [46] . For the calculation of the Test T, the Statistica software was used, and the indices of infected animals in the two environments (forest fragment and peridomicile) were calculated for each treatment sampled by collection area, using the software Past 1.92. Aiming at comparing the values of the diversity indexes through the paired test, as well as the descriptive analysis of the anthropic effects [47] . The data obtained for the occurrence of RVA and the questionnaires was inserted into a database for a descriptive analysis of the epidemiological profile of the animal population in the three forest ecosystems studied. In this analysis, descriptive statistical treatments were carried out, using customized \\"row-columns\\" type charts, referring to the data, in order to characterize the sample and quantify the results using absolute frequency values using the chi-square test and the Test T.Population study, collection of clinical specimens and laboratory methodology. The flying animals (wild birds and chiroptera) were captured using mist nets which were opened at dawn (4:00 a.m.) and closed in the morning (9:00 a.m.) and were inspected every one hour until the closing, with a sampling effort of 15 days. This research was approved by National All procedures with animals were performed by veterinarians, being birds and bats identified and released at the same capture site. The fecal specimens were collected by stimulation of the rectal ampulla with the use of a \\"Zaragatoa\\", packed in cryogenic vials, identified, stored in liquid nitrogen, and later sent to the Laboratory. Wild animals (small non-flying mammals) were trapped within live-containment traps of the Tomahawk cage (size 45x16x16cm) and Sherman type aluminum (size 30x9x8cm). In each sample plot, 61 traps were distributed, 20 Shermans and 41 Tomahawks being baited with a mixture made with peanut paste, sardines, cod liver oil and corn meal, as well as fruit like banana, apple and pineapple. All the traps used were inspected daily in the morning, the baits being exchanged when necessary and later after the capture in bags of cloth and at least five specimens of each species were chosen for the collection of biological material. The wild animals were sedated with a combination of ketamine 20mg/kg and xylazine 2mg/kg intramuscularly and subsequently, euthanized with anesthetic overdose of 2% lidocaine in the foramen magnum, according to the recommendation of the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA). From October 2014 to April 2016, 1,282 fecal samples were collected from wild and domestic animals. Amongthese, 648 (50.5%) samples were randomly selected for RVA research and handled in Level Three Biosafety Laboratory (NB3). The viral genome was extracted using the TRIZOL LS REAGENT protocol (INVITRO-GEN, USA/KIT QIAGEN), following the manufacturer's recommendations, with minor adaptation according to the protocol described in the supplemental data. The qRT-PCR was conducted according to Zeng et al. [40] for the detection of RVA using the NSP3 segment of RVA as the target gene sequence. The assay was conducted in a mixture containing: RNAse-free H 2 O, TaqMan RT-PCR Mix (2x), TAqMan RT Enzyme Mix (40x), primers for the NSP3 gene, Primer NSP3 Forward (20mM), Primer NSP3 Reverse (20mM), probe NSP3 S (10nm), Template (RNA) 3μL, having a total reaction volume of 17μL and reverse transcription cycling of 50˚C, 30 minutes, denaturation of 95˚C, 10 minutes, annealing of 45 cycles of 95˚C, 15 seconds and extension of 60˚C, 1 minute. The analyzes were considered positive when presenting the cycle threshold (CT) � 40. In order to guarantee a reliable test result, the measurements of contamination control were performed with the use of positive animal control (SA11 prototype) and a negative control (ultrapure water). All RVA-positive samples were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) according to Mijatovic et al [41] to genotyping low viral loads samples. First round was performed with consensus primers N-VP4F1/N-VP4R1 and the Nested-PCR was conducted with N-VP4F2/N-VP4R2 primers to amplify VP4 gene. Amplicons were purified and sequencing for VP4 gene using the same primers of Nested-PCR. The sequences were collected from an automated ABI Prism 3130xl DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The sequence fragments were assembled and edited using the Geneious Bioinformatics software platform v.8.1.7. Posteriorly, the data were compared with othersequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database using BLAST alignment tool to elucidate the RVA genotype of the samples. From October 2014 to April 2016, a total of 648 fecal samples of wild and domestic animals belonging to three forest fragments areas were tested for the NSP3 gene by qualitative qPCR, and 178 (27.5%) were positive for RVA, distributed among the species: birds (23.6%), canines (21.35%), bats (17.98%), cattle (14.6%), horses (8.43%), small rodents (6.74%), swine (3.93%) and felines (3.37%). The CT interval ranged from 28. 47 It was possible to detect viral strains in all genders of animals studied and in the harvesting period none of the animals showed signs of acute infection and / or diarrhea. Rotavirus A (RVA) detected in the present study of wild and domestic animals belonging to the three areas of forest fragment, according to Fig 2. In relation to the evaluated bovines, only in the city of Viseu, these species were studied because they were created extensively. In addition, most of the animals were young with ages varying from 1 day to 8 yearsold, history of deficient vaccination, lack of technical assistance and raised in the form of subsistence. The animals showed no symptoms of diarrhea, only low weight performance and poor sanitary management status. In relation to chiroptera, 32 (17.98%) positive samples for RVA were distributed among Carollia perspicillata species, with 12 (37.5%) being all adults, 9 (28.12%) Desmodus rotundus samples (4 young and 5 adults), 5 (15.6%) of Uroderma bilobata (15.62%), 3 (9.37%) of Artibeus lituratus and the species Artibeus Planirostus, Diaemus iyoug and Glossophagine with 1 (3.12%) each. These animals came from areas of forest fragments located near bovine and equine farms, in addition to inhabiting small chicken farms. Fig 3 shows the results obtained for all the species of animals investigated in the forest fragment as well as in the peridomicillus area. The anthropic variables were analyzed for the three cities studied, as well as the use of the soil within the range of the animals, obeying the domicile, the peridomicile and the forest fragment where the traps of small rodents, birds and various species of animals were captured (Fig  4 and Fig 5) . Considering the factors related to the anthropic activities in the three studied areas within the three cities of the present study, it was observed that the city of Santa Bárbara is the one that has a better area of preserved forest and the city of Viseu a smaller area. However, in the city of Santa Bárbara, a greater concentration of occupations was observed around the area of forest fragment. It was observed in this chosen area of the city, the presence of different families living in a rural settlement, surviving from the exploitation of forest resources and the creation of small animals for subsistence, such as poultry and fish farming, as well as family farming products. The breeding of animals in native pastures was only observed in the cities of Peixe Boi and Viseu. Extensive livestock farming was practiced with beef cattle, equines for work and small animals (swine and goats). In relation to the most preserved pasture area, the city of Peixe Boi had the largest area, according to the data shown in Fig 5, however, in the city of Viseu, a higher regeneration was observed in the pastures during the period of the study, with significant secondary vegetation. When comparing the climates of the three areas it was observed that the predominant climate is megathermal and humid with average annual temperature around 27˚C. The months of October, November and December are the hottest, with temperatures between 32˚C and 34˚C and absolute maximums around 41˚C. Annual rainfall is quite high, generally around 2,350 mm, but strongly concentrated from January to June (80%). From September to December, on the contrary, rainfall is rare, about 7%, with a short dry season, of moderate water deficit in those months. The relative humidity of the average air oscillates around 85%, as shown in Fig 6 [48] . The description of the accumulated precipitation in the year of capture of the fecal specimens compared to the Climatological Normals (CLINO) for the period from 1961-1990 of the PCDs closest to the locations of the Expedito Ribeiro / Santa Bárbara settlement (Belém PCD), Vila Ananim / Peixe-Boi and Açaiteua / Viseu (Tracauateua PCD) show the frequency of rainfall in the regions, which facilitates the renewal of the pastures and the regeneration of the impacted forests, being an important indicator of the reduction of the damages caused by deforestation in the region. The average deforestation index in the three study areas was calculated from data obtained from INPE information systems. It was observed that in the years of 2013 to 2014 there were no changes in these regions; in the period from 2014 to 2015 about 4.1% of the city of Viseu was changed and 1.6% of the city of Peixe Boi.Question: Is Rotavirus single or double-stranded?","answer":"double-stranded ribonucleic acid"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

This study defines the precise positions of T7 helicase and T7 DNAP at the replication fork junction with single-base resolution to create a structural model that explains the mutual stimulation of activities. Our 2-aminopurine studies show that helicase and polymerase both participate in DNA melting, but each enzyme melts the junction base pair partially. When combined, the junction base pair is melted cooperatively provided the helicase is located one nucleotide ahead of the primer-end. The synergistic shift in equilibrium of junction base pair melting by combined enzymes explains the cooperativity, wherein helicase stimulates the polymerase by promoting dNTP binding( decreasing dNTP Km), polymerase stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding rate-constant( kcat), consequently the combined enzymes unwind DNA with kinetic parameters resembling enzymes translocating on single-stranded DNA.Introduction:Replicative helicases and DNA polymerases( DNAPs) are not efficient at unwinding the duplex DNA when they are working independently. The unwinding rates are slower than their translocation rates on single-stranded( ss) DNA and slower than the rates of DNA replication( Kim et al., 1996; Delagoutte and von Hippel, 2001; Galletto et al., 2004; Stano et al., 2005; Lionnet et al., 2007; Donmez and Patel, 2008). Moreover, the unwinding rates of isolated helicases decrease steeply with increasing GC percentage in the duplex DNA, therefore, assisting forces that destabilize the junction base pairs stimulate the helicase( Galletto et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2007; Lionnet et al., 2007; Donmez and Patel, 2008). However, in the presence of an actively synthesizing replicative DNAP, the unwinding rates of the helicase become fast and GC independent( Kim et al., 1996; Delagoutte and von Hippel, 2001; Stano et al., 2005; Manosas et al., 2012b; Pandey and Patel, 2014). Similarly, replicative DNAPs on their own have limited strand displacement synthesis activity, restricted to 4–6 base pairs in T7 DNAP( Stano et al., 2005; Yuan and McHenry, 2009; Pandey and Patel, 2014). The isolated DNAPs often stall and move backward to excise the nascent DNA using their proofreading exonuclease activity when faced with downstream duplex DNA( Manosas et al., 2012a). The presence of helicase or single-stranded DNA-binding protein( SSB) inhibits processive excision of the nascent DNA and allows DNAP to catalyze fast and processive strand displacement synthesis( Manosas et al., 2012b; Pandey and Patel, 2014). Originally identified in prokaryotic systems( T7, T4 bacteriophage, Escherichia coli), this functional coupling between the helicase and DNAP is found also in eukaryotic replication systems( Kang et al., 2012). Several models have attempted to explain the functional coupling between replicative helicases and DNAPs. The underlying theme of the helicase only unwinding models is that the helicase unwinds the duplex DNA creating ssDNA template for the DNAP and the DNAP traps the displaced ssDNA through DNA synthesis( Delagoutte and von Hippel, 2001; Stano et al., 2005). Recent studies of bacteriophage T7 and T4 DNAPs suggest alternative models indicating that DNAP aids the helicase by destabilizing the first few base pairs of the double-stranded( ds) DNA( Manosas et al., 2012a, 2012b). Exonuclease mapping showed that T7 DNAP is located with the T7 helicase in close proximity to the fork junction and in a position to influence the junction base pairs( Pandey and Patel, 2014). To understand functional coupling between helicase and DNAP, we need to understand the basic mechanism of DNA unwinding by each enzyme. Although the mechanism of replicative DNAPs is well characterized on ssDNA template( Patel et al., 1991; Doublie et al., 1998; Delagoutte, 2012), there is little known about the mechanism of DNA unwinding-synthesis on duplex DNA template. Similarly, there are no structures of replisomes with the exception of a small angle X-Ray scattering structure of the T7 helicase-T7 DNAP bound to ssDNA and primer template DNA, respectively( Kulczyk et al., 2012). However, the low-resolution structure in the absence of a replication fork DNA does not provide the location of the DNAP and helicase at the replication fork junction to understand which enzyme is involved in melting the base pair at the fork junction. In addition to structural questions such as the positioning of the helicase and DNAP at the replication fork, many aspects of the mechanism of functional coupling remain unexplored. For example, T7 and E. coli DNAPs are capable of strand displacement synthesis in the presence of SSB with rates comparable to their replication rates( Yuan and McHenry, 2009; Pandey and Patel, 2014). Hence, the specific role of the helicase in stimulating the synthesis activity of DNAP remains unclear. As combined enzymes, T7 helicase and T7 DNAP exhibit highly coordinated catalysis, whereby helicase hydrolyzes one dNTP for every dNMP incorporated by the DNAP( Pandey and Patel, 2014). This implies that the two enzymes coordinate their steps of nucleotide binding( 2′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate( dTTP) binding to T7 helicase and dNTP binding to T7 DNAP) and catalysis( dTTP hydrolysis and dNMP incorporation), but there is no model that explains how these steps are coupled between the two enzymes during active leading strand synthesis. The studies in this paper use a combination of 2-aminopurine( 2-AP) fluorescence and transient-state kinetics to investigate the unwinding mechanisms of T7 DNAP and T7 helicase as isolated enzymes and as combined enzymes. The kinetics indicates that DNAP and helicase use different mechanisms to unwind DNA, but the mechanisms when coupled generate an efficient replisome. In the replisome, T7 DNAP stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding kcat, and T7 helicase stimulates the DNAP by decreasing the dNTPs Km. The 2-AP studies probe DNA melting with single base pair resolution and show that the isolated enzymes are not as efficient at melting the fork junction as compared to the combined enzymes. However, T7 DNAP with its ability to melt two base pairs ahead of the primer-end positions T7 helicase two nucleotides ahead with efficient and synergistic melting of the junction base pair. Overall, these studies provide both kinetic and structural basis to understand how helicase and polymerase mutually stimulate each other's activities during leading strand synthesis.Discussion:When DNAP is in the post-translocated state, the N + 1 templating base( blue) is positioned in the polymerase active site ready to base pair with the incoming dNTP( Figure 6, upper cartoon). After the chemical step, the DNAP translocates downstream by one nucleotide to position the next templating-base N + 2( red) in the active site( Figure 6, lower cartoon). This forward translocation step is coupled to unwinding of the N + 3 junction base pair( green). Based on our results, we propose that the DNAP by itself is not efficient at preventing junction base pair reannealing, and this unfavorable equilibrium constant for DNA melting destabilizes the post-translocated state of DNAP and competes with incoming dNTP binding. When helicase is present at the fork junction, it helps both unwind and trap the junction bases. Thus, the associated helicase stimulates dNTP binding by stabilizing the post-translocated state of T7 DNAP, and the outcome is decrease in dNTPs Km. The helicase by itself is not efficient at unwinding the fork junction. However, the associated DNAP by providing an unwound base to the helicase at the fork junction facilitates the base-capture step and drives the reactions of dTTP binding-hydrolysis-product release around the helicase ring, and the outcome is an increase in the unwinding kcat. The combined binding energy of the two enzymes bound to opposite strands is sufficient to keep the unwound bases from reannealing, explaining the fast and GC-independent unwinding rates of helicase-DNAP. Interestingly, cooperative and enhanced efficiency of base pair melting is observed only when the helicase and DNAP are within one nucleotide distance from each other. In most cases, helicase is coupled physically to the DNAP, either directly as in the case of T7 replication system or indirectly through accessory proteins( Kim et al., 1996; Hamdan et al., 2007; Gambus et al., 2009; Sengupta et al., 2013). Some of these interactions aid in the assembly of the replisome( Zhang et al., 2011) and perhaps in proper positioning of the helicase with the DNAP in the replisome, but the consequences of breaking physical interactions on synergistic melting need to be investigated. One can imagine situations where flexible positioning is needed when one or the other enzyme pauses or stalls during leading strand synthesis. Our investigation of such situations reveals that when DNAP stalls or is the slower motor, the helicase becomes functionally uncoupled and outruns the DNAP by unwinding the replication fork at the unstimulated rates. Similar behaviors were observed in other replisome studies as well( Byun et al., 2005; McInerney and O'Donnell, 2007). Whether the functionally uncoupled helicase remains physically coupled to the DNAP remains unknown. Interestingly, when the helicase slows down, the two enzymes remain functionally coupled as evident from the low dNTPs Km and that the DNAP does not outrun the helicase. In this case, the combined enzymes unwind the DNA with the stimulated rate of the helicase. Although SSB stimulates base pair melting by T7 DNAP, our studies find that the unwinding rates of T7 DNAP with SSB remain GC-sensitive at low-dNTPs concentrations. We propose that this is because SSB cannot trap the junction bases coordinately with DNA synthesis in the manner that T7 helicase does during leading strand synthesis. Similarly, it has been shown previously that SSB does not increase the unwinding rates of T7 helicase, which remain GC sensitive at all concentrations of dTTP( Donmez and Patel, 2008). These observations indicate that simply trapping the displaced strand by DNA binding is not sufficient, but coordination between the steps of junction base pair unwinding/trapping and synthesis is needed for rate acceleration. The replicative helicase is a central player in coordinating leading and lagging strand synthesis( Pandey et al., 2009). The interdependency between helicase and DNAP assures that the DNA is not unwound in an uncoupled manner leading to disruption in the coordinated synthesis of the two strands. The mechanism of DNAP is conserved in all organisms where DNAPs elongate the primer in the 3′–5′ direction. On the other hand, replicative helicases of the prokaryotes and phages unwind DNA in the 5′–3′ direction, whereas those of eukaryotes unwind DNA in the opposite 3′–5′ direction. Our studies suggest that the leading edges of the T7 helicase and T7 DNAP are close together at the fork junction and this conformation is important for functional coupling of unwinding and synthesis reactions and preventing DNA reannealing. This model of the replication fork is likely to be generally applicable to replisomes of prokaryotes as most show functional coupling between helicase and DNAP( Patel et al., 2011). In contrast to prokaryotic replisomes, the replicative helicase of eukaryotes and archaea binds to the same strand as the DNAP( O'Donnell et al., 2013). In this case, both helicase and DNAP cannot be close to the fork junction, and there must be other mechanisms to functionally couple the two activities and prevent junction base pair reannealing. It is possible that although the MCM2-7 helicase encircles the leading strand, other subunits in the CMG( Cdc45-MCM2-7-GINS) complex may interact with the lagging strand and this could be a mechanism for preventing DNA reannealing at the fork junction( Costa et al., 2014).","answer":"DNA replication is the process whereby a molecule of DNA is copied to form two identical molecules . First , an enzyme called a DNA helicase separates the two strands of the DNA double helix . This forms a structure called a replication fork that has two exposed single strands . Other enzymes called DNA polymerases then use each strand as a template to build a new matching DNA strand . DNA polymerases build the new DNA strands by joining together smaller molecules called nucleotides . One of the new DNA strands—called the ‘leading strand’—is built continuously , while the other—the ‘lagging strand’—is made as a series of short fragments that are later joined together . Building the leading strand requires the helicase and DNA polymerase to work closely together . However , it was not clear how these two enzymes coordinate their activity . Now , Nandakumar et al . have studied the helicase and DNA polymerase from a virus that infects bacteria and have pinpointed the exact positions of the enzymes at a replication fork . The experiments revealed that both the polymerase and helicase contribute to the separating of the DNA strands , and that this process is most efficient when the helicase is only a single nucleotide ahead of the polymerase . Further experiments showed that the helicase stimulates the polymerase by helping it to bind to nucleotides , and that the polymerase stimulates the helicase by helping it to separate the DNA strands at a faster rate . The next challenge is to investigate the molecular setup that allows the helicase and polymerase to increase each other's activities ."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome. Please write a few sentences synthesizing the findings of these reports, which could serve as a conclusion section for a systematic review article. Your response should not include any other text. The RCT reports are below.Title 1:The treatment of agitation during initial hospitalization after traumatic brain injury.Abstract 1:Agitation after traumatic brain injury is disruptive for patient care, distressing, and difficult to treat. The use of propranolol has been advocated to control agitation after brain injury. It reportedly lacks some of the deleterious cognitive and emotional effects of other medications and physical restraints. This study was designed to test if propranolol is effective in reducing agitated behavior. Subjects had traumatic closed-head injury treated at a combined Level I Trauma Center and Rehabilitation Center. Twenty-one subjects met the criteria of agitation and were treated with propranolol or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The intensity of agitation was significantly lower in the treatment group although the number of episodes were similar. The use of restraints was also significantly lower in the treatment group. The results support the effectiveness of propranolol in reducing the intensity of agitation during the initial hospitalization after closed-head injury.Title 2:Propranolol treatment of assaultive patients with organic brain disease. A double-blind crossover, placebo-controlled study.Abstract 2:A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted to examine the effects of long-acting propranolol in the treatment of violent behavior associated with organic brain disease in 10 patients whose symptoms had proved refractory to various conventional medications. Long-acting propranolol treatment was associated with reductions of assaultive behavior without apparent sedative effects. Cautions are noted regarding potential undesirable side effects which may necessitate careful patient monitoring during treatment.Title 3:Therapeutic effects of pindolol on behavioral disturbances associated with organic brain disease: a double-blind study.Abstract 3:A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted to examine the effects of pindolol for the treatment of 11 patients with impulsive, explosive behaviors and other emotional-behavioral abnormalities as a consequence of brain disease or injury. Pindolol treatment was associated with significant therapeutic benefits without sedation and without the use-limiting side effects that occur with propranolol.Title 4:Cognitive and behavioural efficacy of amantadine in acute traumatic brain injury: an initial double-blind placebo-controlled study.Abstract 4:The objective of the current study was to determine the efficacy of amantadine in improving cognitive and behavioural performance in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation sample. The design was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Subjects were 10 adult traumatic brain injury patients in an acute brain injury rehabilitation unit. Subjects received a 2-week trail of amantadine or placebo, followed by a 2-week washout, then a 2-week trail of the alternative (placebo or amantadine). Neuropsychological outcome measures included orientation, attention, executive function, memory, orientation, behaviour, and a composite variable. Results of repeated measures ANOVA and regression analysis of slope/change showed a main effect of time, but no significant difference for amantadine versus placebo. In conclusion, although patients generally improved, this initial exploratory study found no differences in rate of cognitive improvement between subjects given amantadine versus those given placebo. However, the small sample size, heterogeneous population, acute time course, and large number of dependent variables limit power and generalizability. Implications are discussed for further research to better answer questions regarding efficacy of amantadine post-TBI.Title 5:Treatment of behavioral problems with pindolol.Abstract 5:A study was conducted on a group of chronically hospitalized, brain-damaged male patients to assess the effectiveness of treatment with pindolol on behavioral problems. The study was conducted in two parts. The first was a double-blind, placebo-controlled analysis of the effect of pindolol on assaultive behavior, both verbal and physical. The second part was open and sought to determine whether pindolol would diminish such behaviors as resistance to care, sexual preoccupation, or provocation of others, which were sufficient to preclude placement at a lower level of care. These target behaviors and nursing interventions were monitored and clinical global assessments of improvement in behavior and of suitability for lower levels of care were developed. Eight of 13 patients were considered improved. Those with significant premorbid personality disorders showed little benefit. Pindolol appears to ameliorate some management problems and, by inference, improve the quality of life in many patients with behavioral pathology due to organic brain disease.Title 6:Effect of methylphenidate on brain injury-related anger.Abstract 6:Anger and temper outbursts can be serious clinical problems after brain injury. This study used a randomized, pretest, posttest, placebo control group, single-blind design to evaluate the therapeutic usefulness of methylphenidate to control brain-injury-related anger. The 38 subjects in the study were young adult males who had sustained serious brain injuries and who were beyond the period of rapid, spontaneous recovery. The subjects were divided into two groups, one that received 30 mg of methylphenidate per day and the placebo control group. A comparison of the drug group with the placebo group before and at the end of the six-week treatment period on all the anger outcome measures analyzed simultaneously with multivariate analysis indicated a significant drug-by-time interaction effect, F(4.33) = 5.29, p = .002, demonstrating the therapeutic effect of methylphenidate on anger. The study found that drug responders could be predicted by pretreatment level of anger with a .09 probability of misclassification. Methylphenidate also significantly reduced impairment on all of the general psychopathology outcome measures (F[3.31] = 5.42, p < .01). The drug improved memory for those subjects in the treatment response group but did not result in changes on measures of attention, nor did it have an effect on a checklist of subjective side effects, suggesting that it has minimal or absent cognitive toxicity and is likely to be tolerated well by individuals with brain injuries.","answer":"Numerous drugs have been tried in the management of aggression in ABI but without firm evidence of their efficacy. It is therefore important to choose drugs with few side effects and to monitor their effect. Beta-blockers have the best evidence for efficacy and deserve more attention.

To determine activation status of the IL-2R-associated (Jak / STAT) pathway in the HTLV-I infected cells, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3, STAT3, and STAT5 in several HTLV-I (+) T-cell lines and in uncultured leukemic T cells isolated from patients with adult T-cell lymphoma / leukemia (ATLL). Constitutive basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and, usually, STAT3 and STAT5 was detected in all four IL-2-independent cell lines tested, but in none of the three IL-2-dependent cell lines. Similarly, there was no detectable basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and STAT5 in the leukemic cells from ATLL patients (0 / 8 and 0 / 3, respectively). However, stimulation with IL-2 resulted in Jak3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in both leukemic ATLL cells and IL-2-dependent lines. Furthermore, expression of SHP-1 phosphatase which is a negative regulator of cytokine receptor signaling, was lost in most IL-2 independent cell lines (3 / 4) but not in the leukemic ATLL cells (0 / 3). Finally, the HTLV-I (+) T-cell lines (313) but not the control, HTLV-I (-) T-cell lines were resistant to rapamycin and its novel analog RAD. We conclude that (1) HTLV-I infection per se does not result in a constitutive phosphorylation of the Jak3, STAT3, and STAT5 proteins; (2) malignant transformation in at least some cases of ATLL does not require the constitutive, but may require IL-2-induced, activation of the IL-2R Jak / STAT pathway; and (3) there are major differences in T-cell immortalization mechanism (s) which appear to involve SHP-1 and target molecules for rapamycin and RAD.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"HTLV - I infected cells\\", \\"IL - 2 - dependent cell lines\\", \\"IL - 2 - dependent lines\\", \\"HTLV - I (+) , IL - 2 - independent and IL - 2 - dependent cell lines\\", \\"IL - 2 - independent cell lines\\", \\"HTLV - I (-) T - cell lines\\", \\"IL - 2 independent cell lines\\", \\"HTLV - I (+) T - cell lines\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"uncultured leukemic cells\\", \\"leukemic ATLL cells\\", \\"leukemic cells\\", \\"ATLL cells\\", \\"uncultured leukemic T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"SHP - 1 phosphatase\\", \\"STAT5\\", \\"IL - 2R associated JAK / STAT proteins\\", \\"Jak / STAT\\", \\"STAT3\\", \\"cytokine receptor\\", \\"Jak3\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"SHP - 1\\", \\"IL - 2R\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Due to their signicant importance in medicinal chemistry, developing new methods towards the synthesis of chromans and the installation of a variety of the functional groups in chroman frameworks are gaining increasing attention of the chemical community. 5  In the past few decades, a great deal of methods have been developed for the assembly of substituted chromans, and among them, the Diels-Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction provides a highly efficient synthetic platform in the construction of these functional six-membered frameworks. 6 Extensive work has been done with this strategy, resulting in a lot of signicant progress. The ortho-quinone methides (o-QMs) are generally essential dienes for the Diels-Alder reaction towards the synthesis of chromans, as they are highly reactive for rapid rearomatization via Michael addition of nucleophiles, cycloaddition with a dienophile of 2p partners or 6p-electrocyclization (Scheme 1b). 7 Herein, although various valuable chromans have been successfully synthesized with the Diels-Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction, the use of o-QMs may lead to several potential limitations in some cases. One of the potential limitations is that o-QMs are used mainly as Michael acceptor and electron-decient dienes to react only with nucleophiles and electron-rich dienophiles. In these considerations, the evolution of synthetic methods for chromans is very important and highly desirable. In particular, novel (4 + 2) cycloaddition Scheme 1 Selected bioactive molecules and the synthetic methods of chromans.</p><p>strategies capable of synthesizing chromans with the use of easily available materials and electron-decient dienophiles are of utmost interest.</p><p>On the basis of retrosynthetic analysis of chroman shown in Scheme 1c, (4 + 2) radical annulation of the corresponding carbon-centered radical R with olen would be an alternative route, which is able to overcome the above-mentioned potential limitations. Considering that radical species R is normally nucleophilic, thus, it could react with electron-decient olens affording chroman products that generally can't be synthesized by the traditional Diels-Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction involving o-QMs. Herein, we reported a highly selective (4 + 2) radical-annulation reaction to construct the chroman framework with the use of easily available NHPI ester as the radical precursor and olen as the radical acceptor under mild conditions.</p><p>Compared with other alkyl radical precursors, the redoxactive N-(acyloxy)phthalimides (NHPI esters) come to the fore, since they are cheap, stable, readily available, and non-toxic. 8 Bearing above hypothesis in mind, we commenced to investigate the (4 + 2) annulation reaction by utilizing readily available N-hydroxyphthalimide ester A 0 and commercially available ethyl acrylate as model substrates. Aer a great deal of screening on the reaction parameters, only a trace amount of the target product was detected by GC-MS. In contrast, the main product is anisole, which may result from a rapid hydrogen abstraction reaction of the unstable primary alkyl radical intermediate. To restrain the formation of this by-product, we designed Nhydroxyphthalimide esters A and A 00 , which could produce more stable tertiary radicals, for the target (4 + 2) annulation reaction instead of A 0 (Table 1). Pleasantly, with Eosin Y as the photosensitizer, 9 74% yield of ethyl-2,2-dimethylchromane-4carboxylate upon 1 was selectively obtained aer irradiation of the reaction system under blue LEDs at room temperature for 12 h, despite a little by-product (Table 1, entry 1). Control experiments showed that both Eosin Y and light are essential for the annulation reaction (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). Further investigation of the photosensitizer revealed that 4-CzIPN and Ru(bpy) 3 (PF 6 ) 2 are either ineffective or inferior in this transformation (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). Other solvents were also evaluated. A poor yield was observed when MeCN was used instead of DMAc, meanwhile, the target product was not detected in DCE (Table 1, entries 6 and 7). This radical annulation reaction was sensitive to air, and dramatically decreased yield was obtained when the reaction was carried out under air (Table 1, entry 8).</p><p>In order to explore the substrate scope of the (4 + 2) annulation reaction, we commenced to scrutinize the generality and selectivity with respect to N-hydroxyphthalimide esters. The functional group applicability of N-hydroxyphthalimide esters was investigated by the examination of various electron donating/withdrawing substituents at the varying positions, as illustrated in Scheme 2. Gratifyingly, we found that substances bearing electron-donating substituents (Me, OMe, t Bu, SMe, OPh, OBn, and Ph) at the para-position could smoothly be transformed into the corresponding chromans with satisfactory yields (2-8). N-Hydroxyphthalimide esters with halogen substituents, such as uoride, chloride, bromide and iodide are suitable to produce the corresponding chromans in satisfactory yields, which enable potential application in further functionalization (9)(10)(11)(12). Surprisingly, electron-withdrawing substituents, such as MeCO, OCF 3 , and CF 3 , were also tolerated under standard conditions (13-15). This reaction could proceed effectively with N-hydroxyphthalimide esters containing one group or multiple groups in different positions, which delivered a variety of chroman compounds in moderate to good yields (16)(17)(18)(19)(21)(22)(23). The annulation reaction is not limited to the construction of benzene compounds, as ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-2,3dihydro-1H-benzo[f]chromene-1-carboxylate was also obtained in 68% yield (20). Aer the simple esterication, drug molecules, such as clobric acid, fenobric acid and ciprobrate, could be transformed into the corresponding N-hydroxyphthalimide esters, further engaging with ethyl acrylate (10 and 24-25), which highlighted the synthetic applicability of this protocol.</p><p>Next, we shied attention to the scope with respect to a wide range of acrylates, as shown in Scheme 3. Methyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were well amenable with N-hydroxyphthalimide esters (26-27). Other acrylates, such as cyclohexyl, tert-butyl and phenyl, were also competent reaction partners with a satisfactory efficiency (28-30). Ethyl (E)-but-2-enoate was tolerant to afford the desired chroman product, albeit in 29% yield (31). It is particularly noteworthy that dimethyl maleate was demonstrated to be a suitable substrate, leading to the formation of sterically hindered product (32). The sensitive benzylic C-H bond and the fragile furan and thiophene moieties could be retained in the radical cascade reaction, providing a series of functionalized chromans (33)(34)(35). Alkoxy and aligned alkoxy on substances did not reduce the reaction efficacy (36-37). Chromans possessing various subtle trimethylsilyl, hydroxyl, primary/secondary bromoalkene, cyano and thiomethylene were accessed in reasonable yields, which provided the basis for late-stage derivatization of products (38)(39)(40)(41)43). Owing to the superiority of lipophilicity, permeability and metabolism, we tried to introduce triuoromethyl into chroman skeletons. To our delight, 2,2,2-triuoroethyl acrylate gave rise to the corresponding chromans with 52% yield (42). The unactivated alkynyl moiety and alkenyl moiety survived in the photoredox catalysis (44)(45)(46).</p><p>It is well-known notorious that compounds possessing nitrogen atoms are a very important class of biologically active and functional molecules. Thus, we turned our attention from acrylates to acrylamide derivatives. We were delighted to nd that N,N-dimethylacrylamide was a suitable radical receptor to give the target molecule in moderate yield (47). Similarly, a series of chroman products were obtained with cyclic and acyclic acrylamides (48-51). Subsequently, we continued to investigate the reaction of different secondary acrylamides with N-hydroxyphthalimide ester A. These secondary acrylamides bearing NH-isopropyl, -cylopropyl, -benzyl, -phenylethyl and -aryl functionalities, could smoothly be transformed into the desired (4 + 2) annulation products under standard conditions (52-57). Besides acrylates and acrylamides, this method was successfully applied to other Michael acceptors resulting in the synthesis of various functionalized chromans (58-61). In order to demonstrate the potential applicability of this methodology, a variety of natural products, their derivatives and functional molecules, such as isoborneol (62), cedrol (63), citronellol (64), cholesterol (65), and dehydroabietylamine (66), were examined, and all these structures could be embedded into target products in 56-70% yields.</p><p>The (4 + 2) annulation protocol is not limited to the synthesis of chromans. Under standard conditions, the thiochromane derivative could be formed, although less efficiently (Scheme 4a). With curiosity, we tried to use the commercially available pinacol vinylboronate instead of acrylates for this transformation because of the widespread use of organoboron compounds in organic synthesis. The target compound 2-(2,2dimethylchroman-4-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane, which is a versatile building block in functionalization of chromans, was obtained in 48% yield under the slightly revised conditions (Scheme 4b). It is noting that the reaction could be conducted smoothly to afford 60% yield under sunlight irradiation, showing the potential of industrial application (Scheme 4c). Furthermore, the versatility of chroman 1 was also explored. The oxidative dehydrogenation process of 1 led to the formation of value-added ethyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-chromene-4-carboxylate 69 by using DDQ as the oxidant (Scheme 4d). 1 could also be reduced to (2,2-dimethylchroman-4-yl)methanol 70 with lithium aluminum hydride in ethyl ether (Scheme 4d).</p><p>To further gain mechanistic insights into this process, a series of experiments were conducted. When the model reaction was performed under standard conditions but in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) as a radical scavenger, the target product was not detected (Scheme 5a). Notably, when butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added to this reaction system, the annulation reaction was signicantly suppressed, meanwhile, a coupling product was detected by GC-MS and HRMS (Scheme 5b). These results indicated a radical-involved pathway for this transformation. Subsequently, the carbon radical was captured by an intramolecular aromatic ring, giving the cyclization product 69 in excellent yield (Scheme 5c). Moreover, the intermolecular kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiment was carried out by using A and A-d5 as competitive substrates. Under standard conditions, a KIE value of 1.05 was observed, indicating that the cleavage of the aromatic C-H bond might not be the ratedetermining step in the transformation (Scheme 5d).</p><p>On the basis of the above experimental results, we proposed a possible mechanism cycle for the reaction, as shown in</p>Conclusions<p>In summary, a novel (4 + 2) radical annulation approach has been established for the synthesis of diverse chromans from readily available redox-active esters and olens. This method operates under mild conditions and provides reactivity with a broad range of N-hydroxyphthalimide esters and electron-decient olens. The demonstrated late-stage utility of this protocol makes it particularly promising as a versatile tool to generate diverse valuable chroman structures for drug discovery and chemical biology. Compared with the traditional Diels-Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of ortho-quinone methides with electron-rich dienophiles, this protocol opens a new pathway for the synthesis of chromans that generally can't be accessed by the use of ortho-quinone methides. We anticipate that the (4 + 2) radical annulation reaction will continue to be developed and deployed for the synthesis of highly functionalized six-membered rings, ideally providing synthetic chemists access to diverse drug and natural product derivatives by the utilization of readily available starting materials.</p>","answer":"Due to the importance of chroman frameworks in medicinal chemistry, the development of novel synthetic methods for these structures is gaining increasing interest of chemists.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  We designed a model-based analysis to predict the occurrence of population patterns in distributed spiking activity. Using a maximum entropy principle with a Markovian assumption, we obtain a model that accounts for both spatial and temporal pairwise correlations among neurons. This model is tested on data generated with a Glauber spin-glass system and is shown to correctly predict the occurrence probabilities of spatiotemporal patterns significantly better than Ising models only based on spatial correlations. This increase of predictability was also observed on experimental data recorded in parietal cortex during slow-wave sleep. This approach can also be used to generate surrogates that reproduce the spatial and temporal correlations of a given data set. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Neuronal spike trains display correlations at diverse timescales throughout the nervous system. The functional significance of these correlations is largely unknown, and computational investigations can help us understand their role. In order to generate correlated spike trains with given statistics, several case-specific methods have been described in the litterature. This letter presents two general methods to generate sets of spike trains with given firing rates and pairwise correlation functions, along with efficient simulation algorithms. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Spike trains recorded from populations of neurons can exhibit substantial pairwise correlations between neurons and rich temporal structure. Thus, for the realistic simulation and analysis of neural systems, it is essential to have efficient methods for generating artificial spike trains with specified correlation structure. Here we show how correlated binary spike trains can be simulated by means of a latent multivariate gaussian model. Sampling from the model is computationally very efficient and, in particular, feasible even for large populations of neurons. The entropy of the model is close to the theoretical maximum for a wide range of parameters. In addition, this framework naturally extends to correlations over time and offers an elegant way to model correlated neural spike counts with arbitrary marginal distributions. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Information is carried in the brain by the joint activity patterns of large groups of neurons. Understanding the structure and function of population neural codes is challenging because of the exponential number of possible activity patterns and dependencies among neurons. We report here that for groups of ~100 retinal neurons responding to natural stimuli, pairwise-based models, which were highly accurate for small networks, are no longer sufficient. We show that because of the sparse nature of the neural code, the higher-order interactions can be easily learned using a novel model and that a very sparse low-order interaction network underlies the code of large populations of neurons. Additionally, we show that the interaction network is organized in a hierarchical and modular manner, which hints at scalability. Our results suggest that learnability may be a key feature of the neural code. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  We present a method to estimate Gibbs distributions with textit{spatio-temporal} constraints on spike trains statistics. We apply this method to spike trains recorded from ganglion cells of the salamander retina, in response to natural movies. Our analysis, restricted to a few neurons, performs more accurately than pairwise synchronization models (Ising) or the 1-time step Markov models (cite{marre-boustani-etal:09}) to describe the statistics of spatio-temporal spike patterns and emphasizes the role of higher order spatio-temporal interactions. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  We statistically characterize the population spiking activity obtained from simultaneous recordings of neurons across all layers of a cortical microcolumn. Three types of models are compared: an Ising model which captures pairwise correlations between units, a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) which allows for modeling of higher-order correlations, and a semi-Restricted Boltzmann Machine which is a combination of Ising and RBM models. Model parameters were estimated in a fast and efficient manner using minimum probability flow, and log likelihoods were compared using annealed importance sampling. The higher-order models reveal localized activity patterns which reflect the laminar organization of neurons within a cortical column. The higher-order models also outperformed the Ising model in log-likelihood: On populations of 20 cells, the RBM had 10% higher log-likelihood (relative to an independent model) than a pairwise model, increasing to 45% gain in a larger network with 100 spatiotemporal elements, consisting of 10 neurons over 10 time steps. We further removed the need to model stimulus-induced correlations by incorporating a peri-stimulus time histogram term, in which case the higher order models continued to perform best. These results demonstrate the importance of higher-order interactions to describe the structure of correlated activity in cortical networks. Boltzmann Machines with hidden units provide a succinct and effective way to capture these dependencies without increasing the difficulty of model estimation and evaluation. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  Recent experimental results based on multi-electrode and imaging techniques have reinvigorated the idea that large neural networks operate near a critical point, between order and disorder. However, evidence for criticality has relied on the definition of arbitrary order parameters, or on models that do not address the dynamical nature of network activity. Here we introduce a novel approach to assess criticality that overcomes these limitations, while encompassing and generalizing previous criteria. We find a simple model to describe the global activity of large populations of ganglion cells in the rat retina, and show that their statistics are poised near a critical point. Taking into account the temporal dynamics of the activity greatly enhances the evidence for criticality, revealing it where previous methods would not. The approach is general and could be used in other biological networks. 8. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB008):  The brain has no direct access to physical stimuli, but only to the spiking activity evoked in sensory organs. It is unclear how the brain can structure its representation of the world based on differences between those noisy, correlated responses alone. Here we show how to build a distance map of responses from the structure of the population activity of retinal ganglion cells, allowing for the accurate discrimination of distinct visual stimuli from the retinal response. We introduce the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine to learn the spatiotemporal structure of the population activity, and use this model to define a distance between spike trains. We show that this metric outperforms existing neural distances at discriminating pairs of stimuli that are barely distinguishable. The proposed method provides a generic and biologically plausible way to learn to associate similar stimuli based on their spiking responses, without any other knowledge of these stimuli.Literature Review:","answer":"A natural way to generalize models for single time bins to responses spanning B time bins is to consider that each neuron in each time bin as a different neuron. We obtain a population of N B activity units, to which we can apply any model of activity proposed for a single time bin. This process is sometimes called time spatialization BIB001 ). There are several examples of this strategy, such as the spatio-temporal Ising model BIB005 BIB007 BIB002 , the spatio-temporal reliable interaction model BIB005 or the spatio-temporal restricted Boltzmann machine and semi-restricted Boltzmann machine . This approach has a major drawback: it cannot be used to describe stationary activity (invariant to time translation). It cannot be used to generate longer spike trains than B, or to evaluate their likelihood. Other models for spatio-temporal interactions are specifically designed for stationary distributions. BIB006 presented the general form of ME models with temporal interactions for stationary distributions: The sum over time in the exponential ensures that this distribution is invariant to time translations, and is a general feature of ME models for stationary distributions. Constraining ME models to account for temporal stationarity reduces the number of parameters to learn compared to time spatialization. All time bins share the same field h and the coupling weight J only depend on the time delay τ . The model was applied to the salamander retina using brute-force gradient descent. It was shown that interactions over a 30 ms delay could predict well cross-correlations in the activity with a longer delay, up to 120 ms. Although  described Monte Carlo methods to infer the parameters of these models, this inference procedure is computationally very intensive and has only been applied to small populations of neurons. A simpler alternative is to focus on the evolution of the population count K t = K(σ t ) instead of tracking individual neurons. BIB008 proposed a ME model reproducing the temporal correlations of the population count over a finite delay, P (K t , K t+τ ) for τ = 1, .., u: where the function h controls the distribution of the population count, and the function J τ controls its temporal correlation at a delay τ . Functions h and J are learned jointly from data. The model was used to show that for a population of 185 neurons in the rat retina, a memory span of only u = 4 time bins corresponding to a 40 ms delay described well the dynamics of the population count, and in particular the durations and sizes of neural avalanches. This model can be further simplified by considering the spike count as a continuous variable, and constrain only its mean and covariance. The corresponding ME model is then equivalent to a Gaussian process in the spike count K t , which can be described by a Gaussian autoregressive process with memory u . This simplification makes the model very easy to learn, but results in a poor description of the spike count distribution. Restricted Boltzmann machines can also be adapted to stationary distributions. The temporal restricted Boltzmann machine BIB009 , is a model with hidden units in each time bin, witch can interact with neurons in different time bins: 26) It is a convolutional RBM, so interactions between neurons and hidden units only depend on the delay τ between them, not on their absolute time. Importantly, once the model parameters are learned, they can be used to model responses of any time length. BIB009 found that this model was an accurate description of temporal correlations for a population of neurons in the rat retina. Furthermore, they showed that much information about the stimulus could be easily read out from the activity of hidden units. Finally, it should be noted that the common-input models presented earlier for the synchronous activity can also be adapted to model stationary temporal correlations. BIB003 presented spike train mixture methods to generate responses with fixed autocorrelations and cross-correlations between neurons, even in the case of non-binned spike trains. The dichotomized Gaussian model can also be generalized to account for temporal correlations BIB004 )."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

This is mainly due to a considerable amount of research on network structure. In this study, instead of focusing on architectures, we focused on the convolution unit itself. The existing convolution unit has a fixed shape, and is limited to observing restricted receptive fields. In an earlier work, we proposed the active convolution unit (ACU), which can freely define its shape and learn by itself. In this paper, we propose a detailed analysis of the proposed unit and show that it is an efficient representation of a sparse weight convolution. Furthermore, we expand the unit to a grouped ACU, which can observe multiple receptive fields in one layer. We found that the performance of a naive grouped convolution is degraded by increasing the number of groups; however, the proposed unit retains the accuracy even though the number of parameters reduces. Based on this result, we suggest a depthwise ACU, and various experiments have shown that our unit is efficient and can replace the existing convolutions.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30 relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3 . Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http: www.cs.berkeley.edu rbg rcnn.[2]: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown state of the art performance in high level vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called \\"semantic image segmentation\\"). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our \\"DeepLab\\" system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6 IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU.[3]: In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First , we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or ‘atrous convolution’, as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second , we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third , we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed “DeepLab” system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online.[4]: We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For (300 300 ) input, SSD achieves 74.3 mAP on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for (512 512 ) input, SSD achieves 76.9 mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size. Code is available at https: github.com weiliu89 caffe tree ssd.[5]: [6]: Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build \\"fully convolutional\\" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20 relative improvement to 62.2 mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.[7]:","answer":"Our approach is based on the success of CNN for image classifications.

The acute toxicity of organophosphorus (OP) compounds in mammals is due to their irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the nervous system, which leads to increased synaptic acetylcholine levels. The protective actions of intravenously (i.v.) administered pyridostigmine, physostigmine, eptastigmine, and an organophosphate hydrolase, phosphotriesterase, in acute sarin intoxication were studied in mice. The acute intragastric (i.g.) toxicity (LD50) of sarin with and without the pretreatments was tested by the up-and-down method. The mice received pyridostigmine (0.06 mg/kg body weight), physostigmine (0.09 mg/kg body weight), the physostigmine derivative eptastigmine (0.90 mg/kg body weight) or phosphotriesterase (104 U/g, 10.7 microg/g body weight) 10 min prior to the i.g. administration of sarin. Physostigmine was also administered with phosphotriesterase. Phosphotriesterase was the most effective antidote in sarin intoxication. The LD50 value for sarin increased 3.4-fold in mice receiving phosphotriesterase. Physostigmine was the most effective carbamate in sarin exposure. The protective ratios of physostigmine and pyridostigmine were 1.5- and 1.2-1.3-fold, respectively. Eptastigmine did not give any protection against sarin toxicity. Both the phosphotriesterase and physostigmine treatments protected the brain AChE activities measured 24 h after sarin exposure. In phosphotriesterase and physostigmine-treated mice, a 4- and 2-fold higher sarin dose, respectively, was needed to cause a 50% inhibition of brain AChE activity. Moreover, the combination of phosphotriesterase-physostigmine increased the LD50 value for sarin 4.3-fold. The animals pretreated with phosphotriesterase-ephysostigmine tolerated four times the lethal dose in control animals, furthermore their survival time was 2-3 h in comparison to 20 min in controls. In conclusion, phosphotriesterase and physostigmine were the most effective treatments against sarin intoxication. However, eptastigmine did not provide any protection against sarin toxicity.","answer":"[[\\"sarin\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"AChE\\"], [\\"acetylcholine\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"AChE\\"], [\\"organophosphorus\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"acetylcholinesterase\\"], [\\"organophosphorus\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"AChE\\"], [\\"sarin\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"AChE\\"], [\\"acetylcholine\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"acetylcholinesterase\\"], [\\"physostigmine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"AChE\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

AIM During the last decade laparoscopic techniques have been applied to the treatment of inguinal hernia to combine tension-free technique , esthetic , and functional benefits of mini-invasive surgery . Anyway controversy persists regarding the most effective inguinal hernia repair . The aim of this study is to compare the open technique and the laparoscopic approach concerning : complications , recurrences , recovery time and return to usual activity . METHODS A randomized prospective analysis of 121 consecutive inguinal hernia repairs was performed over a 12-month period . Male well-informed patients with primary monolateral inguinal hernia ( ASA I-II ) were divided into 2 groups and consecutively treated ; group A was treated with laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal approach ( TAPP ) ( median age 47+/-7 years , 57 patients ) , group B with open mesh herniorrhaphy ( 45+/-6 years , 64 patients ) . RESULTS Complication rate was 5.26 % for group A ( none needed conversion ) and 4.68 % for group B . All complications were considered minor . No recurrences were observed over a 12-month follow-up in both groups . Post-operative hospital stay and return to activity show statistically significant differences . Median post-hospital stay was 1.7 days for group A while it was longer ( 2.9 days ) for group B . Significant difference was observed in the duration of convalescence too ( group A 9.3+/-7.2 days ; group B 12.1+/-7 . 1 days ) . CONCLUSION On the basis of our experience , even if a longer follow-up is needed , the validity of laparoscopic approach to inguinal hernia is confirmed . General anesthesia and higher costs are reasonable compromises for a shorter period of discomfort in patients with a low ASA index and busy job/sport activity .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"laparoscopic approach to inguinal hernia\\", \\"laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal approach\\", \\"inguinal hernia repairs\\", \\"open mesh herniorrhaphy\\", \\"open inguinal hernia repair ]\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"duration of convalescence\\", \\"Median post-hospital stay\\", \\"period of discomfort\\", \\".\\", \\"inguinal hernia\\", \\"recurrences , recovery time and return to usual activity\\", \\"Complication rate\\", \\"Post-operative hospital stay and return to activity\\", \\"recurrences\\", \\"complications\\", \\",\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"consecutive inguinal hernia repairs was performed over a 12-month period .\\", \\"Male\\", \\"randomized prospective analysis of\\", \\"well-informed patients with primary monolateral inguinal hernia ( ASA I-II )\\", \\"121\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

H2O2 is an early danger cue required for innate immune cell recruitment to wounds. To date, little is known about whether H2O2 is required for the migration of human adaptive immune cells to sites of inflammation. However, oxidative stress is known to impair T cell activity, induce actin stiffness, and inhibit cell polarization. In this study, we show that low oxidative concentrations of H2O2 also impede chemokinesis and chemotaxis of previously activated human T cells to CXCL11, but not CXCL10 or CXCL12. We show that this deficiency in migration is due to a reduction in inflammatory chemokine receptor CXCR3 surface expression and cellular activation of lipid phosphatase SHIP-1. We demonstrate that H2O2 acts through an Src kinase to activate a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, SHIP-1 via phosphorylation, providing a molecular mechanism for H2O2-induced chemotaxis deficiency. We hypothesize that although H2O2 serves as an early recruitment trigger for innate immune cells, it appears to operate as an inhibitor of T lymphocyte immune adaptive responses that are not required until later in the repair process.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"CXCL10\\", \\"Src kinase\\", \\"CXCL11\\", \\"lipid phosphatase\\", \\"SHIP-1\\", \\"CXCL12\\", \\"CXCR3\\", \\"chemokine receptor\\", \\"PI3K\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a materials science research paper.

First, 90 mL of an aqueous solution containing sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and tri-sodium citrate (TSC) at the ratio of 2:7 (1 x 10-3 mol dm-3:3.5 x 10-3 mol dm-3) was heated to 60 degC for 30 min under vigorous stirring at 300 rpm to ensure a homogenous solution. After 30 min, 4 ml of an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (4 x 10-3 mol dm-3) was added drop-wise to the mixture, and the temperature was further raised to 95 degC to make the solution boil quickly. The reaction was allowed to continue for another 30 min. Finally, the solution was cooled down to room temperature with stirring, and the NPs were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and redispersed in ethanol via sonicating for 15 min.","answer":"[{\\"arguments\\": [[\\"silver\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"implemented\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"tri-sodium citrate\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"], [\\"sodium borohydride\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"heated\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"AgNO3\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"], [\\"mixture\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"added\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"reaction\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"allowed\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"solution\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"cooled\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"NPs\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"collected\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"ethanol\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"redispersed\\"}]"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Purpose This research is novel in testing the moderating effect of SES on the relationship among intention , self-efficacy , and subsequent behavior . Methods Effects were tested on data from three prospect i ve correlational studies examining smoking initiation in adolescents ( N = 826 ) , breastfeeding in primiparous women ( N = 202 ) , and physical activity in working adults ( N = 509 ) . Results Despite examining different behaviors , sample s , time intervals , and measures of SES , each study showed significant interactions between intention and SES in predicting behavior . In all three tests , the intention – behavior relationship was attenuated among individuals from lower SES groups . No moderation effects of SES were found for self-efficacy . Conclusions The intention – health behavior relationship can be attenuated in lower SES sample s. This finding may contribute to our underst and ing of SES differences in health behaviorsTitle 2:Development and evaluation of two web-based interventions for the promotion of physical activity in older adults: study protocol for a community-based controlled intervention trialAbstract 2:Background Regular physical activity ( PA ) is a key contributor to healthy ageing . However , despite known health benefits , only one third of older adults in Germany reach the PA levels recommended for persons aged 65 years and above by the World Health Organization . The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two web-based interventions for the initiation and maintenance of regular PA ( i.e. , intervention groups 1 and 2 ) compared to a delayed intervention control group of older adults aged 65 to 75 years . Methods / Design Study participants will be r and omly assigned to one of three study arms in five communities in the Bremen-Oldenburg metropolitan region : a ) Participants in the first arm will receive access to a web-based intervention for 10 weeks allowing them to track their weekly PA ( subjective self-monitoring , intervention group 1 ) ; b ) participants in the second arm will receive access to the web-based intervention for 10 weeks and , in addition , track PA using Fitbit Zips ( objective self-monitoring , intervention group 2 ) ; c ) participants in the delayed intervention control group will receive access to the intervention implemented in the first study arm after completion of the 12-week follow-up in the other two groups within each community . In addition , weekly group meetings in the communities will be offered to study participants in the intervention groups providing the opportunity to address questions related to the use of the website and to practice PA in groups ( e.g. , neighborhood walks , strength and balance exercises ) . To evaluate short-term effects of the intervention on physical and psychological health , PA , physical fitness , and cognitive and psychological variables will be assessed at baseline and 12-week follow-up . Discussion This study will provide answers regarding acceptance and effectiveness of web-based interventions promoting uptake and maintenance of regular PA in persons aged 65–75 years . Study findings will contribute to a growing body of evidence in Germany concerning the role of community-based interventions for the promotion of PA and healthy ageing in older adults .

We examined whether different amounts and types of physical activity are associated with lower mortality and CVD  in countries at different economic levels . METHODS In this prospect i ve cohort study , we recruited participants from 17 countries ( Canada , Sweden , United Arab Emirates , Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Pol and , Turkey , Malaysia , South Africa , China , Colombia , Iran , Bangladesh , India , Pakistan , and Zimbabwe ) . Within each country , urban and rural areas in and around selected cities and towns were identified to reflect the geographical diversity . Within these communities , we invited individuals aged between 35 and 70 years who intended to live at their current address for at least another 4 years .  Total physical activity  was assessed using the  International Physical Activity Question naire ( IPQA ) . Participants with pre-existing CVD were excluded from the analyses . Mortality and CVD were recorded during a mean of 6·9 years of follow-up . Primary clinical outcomes during follow-up were mortality plus major CVD ( CVD mortality , incident myocardial infa rct ion , stroke , or heart failure ) , either as a composite or separately . The effects of physical activity on mortality and CVD were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and other risk factors taking into account household , community , and country clustering . FINDINGS Between Jan 1 , 2003 , and Dec 31 , 2010 , 168 916 participants were enrolled , of whom 141 945 completed the IPAQ . Analyses were limited to the 130 843 participants without pre-existing CVD . Compared with low physical activity ( < 600 metabolic equivalents [ MET ] × minutes per week or < 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity ) , moderate ( 600 - 3000 MET × minutes or 150 - 750 minutes per week ) and high physical activity ( > 3000 MET × minutes or > 750 minutes per week ) were associated with grade d reduction in mortality ( hazard ratio 0·80 , 95 % CI 0·74 - 0·87 and 0·65 , 0·60 - 0·71 ; p<0·0001 for trend ) , and major CVD ( 0·86 , 0·78 - 0·93 ; p<0·001 for trend  ) . Higher physical activity was associated with lower risk of CVD and mortality  in high-income , middle-income , and low-income countries . The adjusted population attributable fraction for not meeting the physical activity guidelines was 8·0 % for mortality and 4·6 % for major CVD , and for not meeting high physical activity was 13·0 % for mortality and 9·5 % for major CVD . Both recreational and non-recreational physical activity were associated with benefits . INTERPRETATION Higher recreational and non-recreational physical activity was associated with a lower risk of mortality and CVD events in individuals from low-income , middle-income , and high-income countries . Increasing physical activity is a simple , widely applicable , low cost global strategy that could reduce deaths and CVD in middle age .

Whether inequalities are measured on the absolute ( difference ) or relative ( ratio ) scale can have a significant impact on judgments about whether health inequalities are increasing or decreasing , but both of these measures are not often presented in empirical studies . In this study we investigated the impact of selective presentation of health ine quality measures on judgments of health ine quality trends among 40 university undergraduates . We r and omized participants to see either a difference or ratio measure of health ine quality alongside raw mortality rates in 5 different scenarios . At baseline there were no differences between treatment groups in assessment s of ine quality trends , but selective exposure to the same raw data augmented with ratio versus difference ine quality graphs altered participants ’ assessment s of ine quality change . When absolute ine quality decreased and relative ine quality increased , exposure to ratio measures increased the probability of concluding that ine quality had increased from 32.5 % to 70 % , but exposure to difference measures did not ( 35 % vs. 25 % ) . Selective exposure to ratio versus difference ine quality graphs thus increased the difference between groups in concluding that ine quality had increased from 2.5 % ( 95 % CI −9.5 % to 14.5 % ) to 45 % ( 95 % CI 29.4 to 60.6 ) . A similar pattern was evident for other scenarios where absolute and relative ine quality trends gave conflicting results . In cases where measures of absolute and relative ine quality both increased or both decreased , we did not find any evidence that assignment to ratio vs. difference graphs had an impact on assessment s of ine quality change . Selective reporting of measures of health ine quality has the potential to create biased judgments of progress in ameliorating health inequalitiesTitle 5:Promoting community readiness for physical activity among older adults in Germany – protocol of the ready to change intervention trialAbstract 5:Background Healthy ageing is an important concern for many societies facing the challenge of an ageing population . Physical activity ( PA ) is a major contributor to healthy ageing ; however insufficient PA levels are prevalent in old age in Germany .  Community capacity building and community involvement are often recommended as key strategies to improve equitable access to prevention and health promotion . However , evidence for the effectiveness of these strategies is scarce . This study aims to assess the community readiness for PA promotion in local environments and to analyse the utility of strategies to increase community readiness for reaching vulnerable groups . Methods / Design We design ed a mixed method intervention trial comprising three study modules . The first module includes an assessment of  community readiness for PA interventions in older adults . The assessment is carried out in a sample of 24 municipalities in the Northwest of Germany using structured key informant interviews . In the second module , eight municipalities with the low community readiness are selected from the sample and r and omly assigned to one of two study groups : active enhancement of community readiness ( intervention ) versus no enhancement ( control ) . After enhancing community readiness in the active enhancement group , older adults in both study groups will be recruited for participation in a PA intervention .  Participation rates are compared between the study groups to evaluate the effects of the intervention . In addition , a cost-effectiveness analysis is carried out calculating recruitment costs per person reached in the two study groups . In the third module , qualitative interviews are conducted with participants and non- participants of the PA intervention exploring reasons for participation or non-participation . Discussion This study offers the potential to contribute to the evidence base of reaching vulnerable older adults for PA interventions and provide ideas on how to reduce participation barriers . Its findings will inform governmental authorities , professionals , academics , and NGOs with an estimate of re sources necessary to achieve equitable access to physical activity programs for vulnerable older adults .

Physical activity promotion programs for older adults are often not successful , one reason is insufficient relevance of intervention measures for the study population . Community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) is a possible key strategy for tailoring more meaningful intervention programs to a specific community . However , evidence for the effectiveness of CBPR in the general population is scarce . This study aims to formally evaluate the efficacy of a CBPR approach for developing and implementing an outdoor physical activity program for older adults . Methods / design The OUTDOOR ACTIVE intervention trial is a cluster-r and omised intervention study carried out in a r and om sample of eight subdistricts in the city of Bremen , Germany . The eight subdistricts are grouped into four homogenous pairs with regard to socioeconomic level and l and use mix of the subdistrict . Within the pairs , the subdistricts are assigned r and omly to the two study arms : participatory development and implementation of a community-based program to promote outdoor physical activity ( intervention ) versus no intervention ( controls ) . For evaluation , a survey is carried out before ( baseline ) and after ( follow-up ) the intervention period .

The appearance of PSAH is commonly associated with poor clinical outcome due to refractory cerebral edema. Recent clinical trials have favored hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as a promising therapeutic strategy for adult patients with severe head injuries. The present report describes a pediatric case of diffuse brain edema characterized by the radiological appearance of PSAH successfully treated with HBOT. An adolescent boy collapsed unconscious following convulsion for 3-5 min with fever and headache for 2 days. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan provided an image compatible with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Lumbar puncture was conducted on admission to hospital and showed no evidence of SAH. The CT scan was again considered and eventually interpreted as PSAH. The patient received drug treatment including acyclovir and mannitol, but the condition deteriorated rapidly. HBOT was administered at 72 h post admission and the condition was clearly improved following the initial therapy. The patient was discharged with 20 sessions of HBOT and recovered completely after 1 year. The appearance of PSAH indicates severe cerebral edema refractory to treatment with conventional internal medicine. HBOT maybe an effective therapeutic strategy for this condition.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"PSAH\\", \\"brain edema\\", \\"Pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage\\", \\"SAH\\", \\"refractory cerebral edema\\", \\"pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage\\", \\"subarachnoid hemorrhage\\", \\"cerebral edema refractory\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"radiological\\", \\"conventional internal medicine\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"acyclovir\\", \\"mannitol\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"Successful treatment\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"collapsed\\", \\"present\\", \\"convulsion\\", \\"fever\\", \\"improved\\", \\"clinical outcome\\", \\"deteriorated\\", \\"unconscious\\", \\"neuroradiological finding\\", \\"headache\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"Lumbar puncture\\", \\"brain computed tomography (CT) scan\\", \\"CT scan\\", \\"drug treatment\\", \\"patient was discharged\\", \\"therapy\\", \\"treatment\\", \\"HBOT\\", \\"hyperbaric oxygen therapy\\", \\"admission to hospital\\", \\"treated with\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"head injuries\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"report\\", \\"image\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"clinical trials\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"diffuse\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine (10-40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity. 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity. Moreover, detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients. Visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan-type dyschromatopsy, sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits. Auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid- to high-frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type. Desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3, and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3. This toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels. The data indicate that audiovisual toxicity is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine. Periodical audiovisual monitoring should be performed on hemodialyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"desferrioxamine\\", \\"aluminium\\", \\"Desferrioxamine\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"dyschromatopsy\\", \\"hearing loss\\", \\"neurosensorial hearing loss\\", \\"audiovisual toxicity\\", \\"Ocular toxicity\\", \\"Visual toxicity\\", \\"Ocular and auditory toxicity\\", \\"visual or auditory toxicity\\", \\"Auditory toxicity\\", \\"a loss of visual acuity\\", \\"toxicity\\", \\"pigmentary retinal deposits\\", \\"visual toxicity\\", \\"auditory toxicity\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

They have been linked to the population firing rate of neurons, with individual neurons firing in a close-to-irregular fashion at low rates. Using a combination of mean-field and linear response theory we predict the spectra generated in a layered microcircuit model of V1, composed of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and based on connectivity compiled from anatomical and electrophysiological studies. The model exhibits low- and high-γ oscillations visible in all populations. Since locally generated frequencies are imposed onto other populations, the origin of the oscillations cannot be deduced from the spectra. We develop an universally applicable systematic approach that identifies the anatomical circuits underlying the generation of oscillations in a given network. Based on a theoretical reduction of the dynamics, we derive a sensitivity measure resulting in a frequency-dependent connectivity map that reveals connections crucial for the peak amplitude and frequency of the observed oscillations and identifies the minimal circuit generating a given frequency. The low-γ peak turns out to be generated in a sub-circuit located in layer 2/3 and 4, while the high-γ peak emerges from the inter-neurons in layer 4. Connections within and onto layer 5 are found to regulate slow rate fluctuations. We further demonstrate how small perturbations of the crucial connections have significant impact on the population spectra, while the impairment of other connections leaves the dynamics on the population level unaltered. The study uncovers connections where mechanisms controlling the spectra of the cortical microcircuit are most effective.Introduction:Understanding the origin and properties of oscillations[see 1, for a review] is of particular interest due to their controversially discussed functional roles, such as binding of neurons into percepts and selective routing of information[reviewed in 2, esp. part VI]. Specific frequencies have been localized in different layers and linked to top-down and bottom-up processes[3, 4]. Oscillations in population signals correlate with multi-unit spiking activity[5], predominantly at high frequencies[6, 7], while firing probabilities relate to the phase of low frequency oscillations[8]. Coherent oscillations at the population level can arise from clock-like firing cells[9, 10] and more robustly[11] from irregularly firing neurons synchronizing weakly[12, 13]. Neurons in vivo tend to fire irregularly[14] and population oscillations resemble filtered noise rather than clock-like activity[15, 16]. Balanced random networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons in the asynchronous irregular( AI) regime can sustain such weakly synchronized oscillatory states[17] and reproduce the stochastic duration and power spectra of γ oscillations[18, 19]. Focusing on the network aspect, rather than on intrinsic cell properties, the PING and ING mechanisms have been suggested to underlie the generation of low- and high-γ frequencies[20, reviewed in 21]. Inter-neuron γ( ING) consists of a self-coupled inhibitory population producing an oscillation frequency primarily determined by the time course of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential( IPSP), the dynamical state of the neurons[20, 22, 10, 23] and the delays[24], constraining the generated frequency to the high-γ( > 70 Hz) range. Lower-γ frequencies( 30–70 Hz) arise from the interplay of pyramidal- and inter-neurons( PING) with the frequency determined by the dynamical state of the neurons and the connection parameters[25, 26, 27, 28]. Early network models combining ING and PING motifs[29], as well as self-coupled excitatory populations( studied later in[30]), enabled the phenomenological study of γ oscillations. The two mechanisms were originally formulated for the fully synchronized regime and the analytical treatment of weakly synchronizing networks is restricted to at most two populations[17, 31], neglecting the variety of dynamical states of neuronal populations embedded in a larger circuitry. Modeling studies considering neurons of various level of detail assess the link between network structure and induced oscillations[32]. Experiments find specific frequencies at different depths of the layered cortex[33], while these locations in the tissue are characterized by distinct connectivity patterns[34]. Pronounced slow oscillations( < 1 Hz) are found in deeper layers, such as layer 5[35, 36], and hypotheses regarding their origin range from intrinsic cell mechanisms[37] to network phenomena[38, 39]. In contrast, fast oscillations in the γ and high-γ range are primarily observed in the upper layers[40, 41] and show different phase relationships than the γ oscillations in the lower layers[42]. To the best of our knowledge, theoretical descriptions of coexisting oscillations requiring complicated network structures, as well as a method identifying these structures in a given circuit have not yet been established. The present work sheds light on the influence of sub-circuits integrated in larger networks and the properties of individual connections relevant for the emergence of specific oscillations.Discussion:The sensitivity measure reveals that the peak in the low-γ range is generated by a sub-circuit consisting of layer 2/3, layer 4 and the connections from layer 4 to 2/3E and from 2/3E to 4I. This finding is in agreement with experimental literature locating γ oscillations in the upper layers. Furthermore, we identify the feedback connection from 2/3E to 4I and the feed-forward connections from layer 4 to layer 2/3 as crucial for the amplitude of the peak. The oscillation generated by the cooperation of the two upper layers is of lower frequency than the oscillation produced by the layers in isolation. A hint on layers 2/3 and 4 teaming up to generate a low frequency γ peak has been found in Ainsworth et al.[58]. The frequency of the peak is predominantly determined by connections within the input layer 4. This implies that excitation of the column will be reflected in a frequency shift of the γ peak, which results from an alteration of the dynamical state of the populations and therefore of the effective connectivity. The variability of the generated frequency caused by inputs to layer 4 has been demonstrated experimentally[18, 59]. The collective oscillations could also be shaped by alterations of the synaptic efficacies between layers 2/3 and 4( e. g. by short term plasticity). Further experimental studies need to probe the influence of perturbations in weight and number of synapses on the amplitude and frequency of γ peaks in the population rate spectra. The sensitivity measure can be utilized to verify the parameters used in the model and to reveal shortcomings of the theoretical description, which potentially arise from the assumptions of simplified neuron-models and negligible auto-correlations. High-γ peaks are found to be generated in the I-I-loops of each layer, with the loop in layer 4 dominating the spectra. This mechanism, termed ING, has been analyzed previously[20] and experimentally located in upper layers. In the microcircuit, the second largest contribution arises from the I-I-coupling in layer 6; we hence propose to target this layer experimentally to test this hypothesis. Connections determining slow rate fluctuations and the stability of the circuit are identified by the sensitivity measure at zero frequency. The measure shows that connections within layer 5 as well as the connections from population 2/3E and 4E to layer 5 are crucial. We conclude that there are too few connections from 5E to 5I to counteract the rate fluctuations which accumulate due to the amplification within the strong 5E-5E loop. Our findings are in good agreement with experimental results demonstrating the initiation of slow frequency oscillations in layer 5, as well as the stronger amplification of low frequency oscillations in response to a stimulus applied to layer 5 than to a stimulation of layer 2/3[38]. Given the dynamical state of 5E, the circuit is stabilized when removing connections from 2/3E to 5E, resulting in a decrease of slow rate fluctuations. In contrast, an impairment of the connections from 4E to 5E has the effect of strengthening the self-amplification of fluctuations and therefore strengthens slow oscillations. With the emerging optogenetic toolbox it may be possible to experimentally test these two predictions in the future. Our analysis suggests a refinement of the parameters of the microcircuit model, which are so far deduced from direct measurements of anatomical and physiological connectivity alone[34]. Experimental studies show that the amplitude of γ oscillations depends on the stimulus strength[60], suggesting that the current microcircuit model captures the cortical tissue in a semi-stimulated regime. Lowering the external input to the excitatory neurons in layer 4 decreases the low-γ power in the idle state, which in addition sensitizes population 4E to evoke γ oscillations when stimulated. Synaptic delays do not influence the stationary state of the network, characterized by the time-averaged firing rates of all populations, but crucially shape the fluctuations around this stationary set point. We provide an intuitive understanding of the influence of delays on oscillations with parametric plots of the eigenvalues of the activity modes determining the spectra of the circuit. Small delays cause fast oscillations, while long delays support slow ones. Larger delays move the network towards the regime of sustained oscillations, which is counteracted by heterogeneity in the delays. The frequency of the oscillation is highly sensitive to the delays, but the static properties of the circuit, which depend on the dynamic state of the neurons and the anatomical connectivity, determine whether a network displays fast or extremely slow oscillations. The newly derived sensitivity measure determines crucial connections for the frequency and amplitude of population rate oscillations. Since its applicability is not constrained to the analysis of indegrees, it permits a systematic investigation of complicated networks with respect to parameters such as the synaptic delay, connection weight, or excitation-inhibition balance. In these pages we exemplified its use by the analysis of a particular model, but it can in principle be utilized to identify dynamically relevant circuits embedded in any high-dimensional network. Our work thus extends existing methods analyzing single- or two-population network models to more intricate structures. The significance of the identified connections is validated by demonstrating how small changes in the number of synapses can have a large impact on the spectra of all populations. The formalism requires the neurons to work in a regime where the activity fluctuations of the inputs are summed linearly on the considered time scale. Simulations of networks of LIF-model neurons confirm the validity of the linear approximation. Experimental evidence supports the existence of cortical networks operating in this regime[61, 62, 63, 64]. Since the sensitivity measure can be applied to any network whose dynamics can be approximated by a linear rate model, the applicability goes beyond circuits composed of LIF-model neurons. For example, responses of modified IF models have been shown to approximate neural responses in vivo[65]. Several studies treat the stationary and dynamical properties of these models in the linear regime( see[66] for EIF and[67] for QIF). Grabska-Barwinska et al.[68] emphasize that theoretical predictions for networks composed of QIF neurons in the asynchronous regime, by trend, also hold in networks operating in a more synchronized regime, in which individual neurons are exposed to larger input fluctuations. For neuron models with conductance-based synapses a reduction to effective current based synapses exists[69, 70] and therefore enables the usage of the theoretical framework developed in[13, 12]. Furthermore, networks of current and conductance based model neurons have been pointed out to be qualitatively comparable( see section 3. 5. 3. in[65]). Alternatively the measure can be fed with experimentally obtained firing rates and transfer functions[71, 61, 72] of neuronal populations to analyze the underlying circuits generating the oscillations. The proposed method also finds application in systems where the non-linearities affect the dynamics on a slower time scale than the considered oscillation. Such non-linearities can be taken into account by reevaluating the measure for different mean-inputs corresponding to different phases of the slow input fluctuations. Employing the measure in the described iterative fashion results in a phase-dependent identification of relevant connections for the generation of the fast rhythm and thus sheds light on the anatomical origin of phase-amplitude coupling[reviewed in 21]. The method can also be exploited in reverse to engineer circuits with a desired oscillatory behavior in a top-down fashion. The results presented here lead to clear interpretations of experimental data on network activity and to new hypotheses. It should be noted, however, that the model of the microcircuit represents an early draft and was purposefully designed by its authors as a minimal model with respect to the number of populations and the heterogeneity in the neuronal dynamics. Therefore, failure in the reproduction of certain phenomena found in nature or in the confirmation of a hypothesis should not be attributed to the mathematical method developed here, but to shortcomings of the investigated model. The method is applicable to any update of the original model as structural data and single neuron properties become more refined, given that the assumptions underlying the mean-field and linear response theory are still met. One potential extension is the subdivision of the inhibitory neurons into multiple populations representing different types of inter-neurons, with connection probabilities that yield specific connectivity motifs, as recently reported in[73]. The sensitivity measure uncovers the contribution of the laminar structure to the population rate spectra and produces predictions which can be tested experimentally by comparing the spectra generated by different species or brain areas with distinct laminar structures. In summary the current work introduces a method which elucidates the relation between anatomy and dynamical observables of layered cortical networks. Even though a specific model is used to exemplify the method and to derive concrete predictions, the novel method provides a general framework for the systematic integration of the anatomical and physiological data progressively becoming available into ever more consistent models of cortical circuitry.","answer":"Recordings of brain activity show multiple coexisting oscillations .

The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviou r later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid- to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5–6 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2,5], and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2]. Text: It is now 6 weeks since Chinese health authorities announced the discovery of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1] causing a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the major transport hub of central China. The earliest human infections had occurred by early December 2019, and a large wet market in central Wuhan was linked to most, but not all, of the initial cases [2] . While evidence from the initial outbreak investigations seemed to suggest that 2019-nCoV could not easily spread between humans [3] , it is now very clear that infections have been spreading from person to person [2] . We recently estimated that more than 75,000 infections may have occurred in Wuhan as at 25 January 2020 [4] , and increasing numbers of infections continue to be detected in other cities in mainland China and around the world. A number of important characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection have already been identified, but in order to calibrate public health responses we need improved information on transmission dynamics, severity of the disease, immunity, and the impact of control and mitigation measures that have been applied to date. Infections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person, and in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days [2] . The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. r later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid-to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5-6 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2, 5] , and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2] . Chains of transmission have now been reported in a number of locations outside of mainland China. Within the coming days or weeks it will become clear whether sustained local transmission has been occurring in other cities outside of Hubei province in China, or in other countries. If sustained transmission does occur in other locations, it would be valuable to determine whether there is variation in transmissibility by location, for example because of different behaviours or control measures, or because of different environmental conditions. To address the latter, virus survival studies can be done in the laboratory to confirm whether there are preferred ranges of temperature or humidity for 2019-nCoV transmission to occur. In an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases of infection, 73% of cases with illness onset between 12 and 22 January reported no exposure to either a wet market or another person with symptoms of a respiratory illness [2] . The lack of reported exposure to another ill person could be attributed to lack of awareness or recall bias, but China's health minister publicly warned that pre-symptomatic transmission could be occurring [6] . Determining the extent to which asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission might be occurring is an urgent priority, because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control. Data on viral shedding dynamics could help in assessing duration of infectiousness. For severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset [7] , consistent with the peak in viral load at around that time [8] . This allowed control of the SARS epidemic through prompt detection of cases and strict isolation. For influenza virus infections, virus shedding is highest on the day of illness onset and relatively higher from shortly before symptom onset until a few days after onset [9] . To date, transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV appear more similar to influenza, with contagiousness occurring around the time of symptom onset, rather than SARS. Transmission of respiratory viruses generally happens through large respiratory droplets, but some respiratory viruses can spread through fine particle aerosols [10] , and indirect transmission via fomites can also play a role. Coronaviruses can also infect the human gastrointestinal tract [11, 12] , and faecal-oral transmission might also play a role in this instance. The SARS-CoV superspreading event at Amoy Gardens where more than 300 cases were infected was attributed to faecal-oral, then airborne, spread through pressure differentials between contaminated effluent pipes, bathroom floor drains and flushing toilets [13] . The first large identifiable superspreading event during the present 2019-nCoV outbreak has apparently taken place on the Diamond Princess cruise liner quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan, with at least 130 passengers tested positive for 2019-nCoV as at 10 February 2020 [14] . Identifying which modes are important for 2019-nCoV transmission would inform the importance of personal protective measures such as face masks (and specifically which types) and hand hygiene. The first human infections were identified through a surveillance system for pneumonia of unknown aetiology, and all of the earliest infections therefore had Modelling studies incorporating healthcare capacity and processes pneumonia. It is well established that some infections can be severe, particularly in older adults with underlying medical conditions [15, 16] , but based on the generally mild clinical presentation of 2019-nCoV cases detected outside China, it appears that there could be many more mild infections than severe infections. Determining the spectrum of clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infections is perhaps the most urgent research priority, because it determines the strength of public health response required. If the seriousness of infection is similar to the 1918/19 Spanish influenza, and therefore at the upper end of severity scales in influenza pandemic plans, the same responses would be warranted for 2019-nCoV as for the most severe influenza pandemics. If, however, the seriousness of infection is similar to seasonal influenza, especially during milder seasons, mitigation measures could be tuned accordingly. Beyond a robust assessment of overall severity, it is also important to determine high risk groups. Infections would likely be more severe in older adults, obese individuals or those with underlying medical conditions, but there have not yet been reports of severity of infections in pregnant women, and very few cases have been reported in children [2] . Those under 18 years are a critical group to study in order to tease out the relative roles of susceptibility vs severity as possible underlying causes for the very rare recorded instances of infection in this age group. Are children protected from infection or do they not fall ill after infection? If they are naturally immune, which is unlikely, we should understand why; otherwise, even if they do not show symptoms, it is important to know if they shed the virus. Obviously, the question about virus shedding of those being infected but asymptomatic leads to the crucial question of infectivity. Answers to these questions are especially pertinent as basis for decisions on school closure as a social distancing intervention, which can be hugely disruptive not only for students but also because of its knock-on effect for child care and parental duties. Very few children have been confirmed 2019-nCoV cases so far but that does not necessarily mean that they are less susceptible or that they could not be latent carriers. Serosurveys in affected locations could inform this, in addition to truly assessing the clinical severity spectrum. Another question on susceptibility is regarding whether 2019-nCoV infection confers neutralising immunity, usually but not always, indicated by the presence of neutralising antibodies in convalescent sera. Some experts already questioned whether the 2019-nCoV may behave similarly to MERS-CoV in cases exhibiting mild symptoms without eliciting neutralising antibodies [17] . A separate question pertains to the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection or of disease [18, 19] . If either of these were to be relevant, the transmission dynamics could become more complex. A wide range of control measures can be considered to contain or mitigate an emerging infection such as 2019-nCoV. Internationally, the past week has seen an increasing number of countries issue travel advisories or outright entry bans on persons from Hubei province or China as a whole, as well as substantial cuts in flights to and from affected areas out of commercial considerations. Evaluation of these mobility restrictions can confirm their potential effectiveness in delaying local epidemics [20] , and can also inform when as well as how to lift these restrictions. If and when local transmission begins in a particular location, a variety of community mitigation measures can be implemented by health authorities to reduce transmission and thus reduce the growth rate of an epidemic, reduce the height of the epidemic peak and the peak demand on healthcare services, as well as reduce the total number of infected persons [21] . A number of social distancing measures have already been implemented in Chinese cities in the past few weeks including school and workplace closures. It should now be an urgent priority to quantify the effects of these measures and specifically whether they can reduce the effective reproductive number below 1, because this will guide the response strategies in other locations. During the 1918/19 influenza pandemic, cities in the United States, which implemented the most aggressive and sustained community measures were the most successful ones in mitigating the impact of that pandemic [22] . Similarly to international travel interventions, local social distancing measures should be assessed for their impact and when they could be safely discontinued, albeit in a coordinated and deliberate manner across China such that recrudescence in the epidemic curve is minimised. Mobile telephony global positioning system (GPS) data and location services data from social media providers such as Baidu and Tencent in China could become the first occasion when these data inform outbreak control in real time. At the individual level, surgical face masks have often been a particularly visible image from affected cities in China. Face masks are essential components of personal protective equipment in healthcare settings, and should be recommended for ill persons in the community or for those who care for ill persons. However, there is now a shortage of supply of masks in China and elsewhere, and debates are ongoing about their protective value for uninfected persons in the general community. The Table summarises research gaps to guide the public health response identified. In conclusion, there are a number of urgent research priorities to inform the public health response to the global spread of 2019-nCoV infections. Establishing robust estimates of the clinical severity of infections is probably the most pressing, because flattening out the surge in hospital admissions would be essential if there is a danger of hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients who require inpatient care, not only for those infected with 2019-nCoV but also for urgent acute care of patients with other conditions including those scheduled for procedures and operations. In addressing the research gaps identified here, there is a need for strong collaboration of a competent corps of epidemiological scientists and public health workers who have the flexibility to cope with the surge capacity required, as well as support from laboratories that can deliver on the ever rising demand for diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV and related sequelae. The readiness survey by Reusken et al. in this issue of Eurosurveillance testifies to the rapid response and capabilities of laboratories across Europe should the outbreak originating in Wuhan reach this continent [23] . In the medium term, we look towards the identification of efficacious pharmaceutical agents to prevent and treat what may likely become an endemic infection globally. Beyond the first year, one interesting possibility in the longer term, perhaps borne of wishful hope, is that after the first few epidemic waves, the subsequent endemic re-infections could be of milder severity. Particularly if children are being infected and are developing immunity hereafter, 2019-nCoV could optimistically become the fifth human coronavirus causing the common cold.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a clinical challenge due to the aggressive nature of the disease and a lack of targeted therapies. Constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has been linked to chemoresistance and metastatic progression through distinct mechanisms, including activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) when cells adopt a motile and invasive phenotype through loss of epithelial markers (CDH1), and acquisition of mesenchymal markers (VIM, CDH2). Although MAPK/ERK1/2 kinase inhibitors ( MEKi ) are useful antitumor agents in a clinical setting , including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MEK1,2 dual inhibitors cobimetinib and trametinib , there are limitations to their clinical utility , primarily adaptation of the BRAF pathway and ocular toxicities . The MEK5 (HGNC: MAP2K5) pathway has important roles in metastatic progression of various cancer types, including those of the prostate, colon, bone and breast, and elevated levels of ERK5 expression in breast carcinomas are linked to a worse prognoses in TNBC patients. The purpose of this study is to explore MEK5 regulation of the EMT axis and to evaluate a novel pan-MEK inhibitor on clinically aggressive TNBC cells. Our results show a distinction between the MEK1/2 and MEK5 cascades in maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype, suggesting that the MEK5 pathway may be necessary and sufficient in EMT regulation while MEK1/2 signaling further sustains the mesenchymal state of TNBC cells. Furthermore, additive effects on MET induction are evident through the inhibition of both MEK1/2 and MEK5. Taken together, these data demonstrate the need for a better understanding of the individual roles of MEK1/2 and MEK5 signaling in breast cancer and provide a rationale for the combined targeting of these pathways to circumvent compensatory signaling and subsequent therapeutic resistance.sentence: Although MAPK/ERK1/2 kinase inhibitors ( MEKi ) are useful antitumor agents in a clinical setting , including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MEK1,2 dual inhibitors cobimetinib and trametinib , there are limitations to their clinical utility , primarily adaptation of the BRAF pathway and ocular toxicities .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Nicotine withdrawal is associated with deficits in neurocognitive function including sustained attention, working memory, and response inhibition. Several convergent lines of evidence suggest that these deficits may represent a core dependence phenotype and a target for treatment development efforts. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying withdrawal-related cognitive deficits may lead to improve nicotine dependence treatment. We begin with an overview of the neurocognitive effects of withdrawal in rodent and human models, followed by discussion of the neurobehavioral mechanisms that are thought to underlie these effects. We then review individual differences in withdrawal-related neurocognitive effects including genetics, gender, and psychiatric comorbidity. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research for developing improved therapies, both pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments, that target cognitive symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"nicotine\\", \\"Nicotine\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

In theirwork, they generated adversarial examples using box-constrained L-BFGS. Later inBID1 , a fast gradient sign method (FGSM) that uses gradients of a loss function to determine in which direction the pixels intensity should be changed is presented. It is designedto be fast not optimize the loss function. Kurakin et al.introduced in BID13 a straightforward simple improvement of this method where instead of taking a single step of size in the direction of the gradient-sign, multiple smaller steps are taken, and the result is clipped in the end. Papernot et al.introduced in BID3 an attack, optimized under L0 distance, known as the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA). Another simpleattack known as Deepfool is provided in [34] . It is an untargetedattack technique optimized for the L2 distance metric. It is efficient andproduces closer adversarial examples than the L-BFGS approach discussed earlier. Evolutionary algorithmsare also used by authors in BID14 to find adversarial example while maintaining the attack close to the initial data. More recently, Carliniand Wagner introduced in BID0 the most robust attack known to date as pointed out in BID5 . They consider differentoptimization functions and several metrics for the maximum perturbation. Their L2-attack defeatedthe most powerful defense known as distillation BID7 . However, authors in BID6showed that feature squeezing managed to destroy most of the C&W attacks. Many other defenses havebeen published, like adversarial training BID3 , gradient masking BID9 , defenses based on uncertainty using dropout BID10 as done with Bayesian networks, based on statistics BID11 , BID12 , or principal components BID22 , BID23 . Later, while we were carryingout our investigation, paper BID16 showed that not less than ten defense approaches, among which are the previously enumerated defenses, can be defeated by C&W attacks. It also pointed out that featuresqueezing also can be defeated but no thorough investigation actually was presented. Another possible defense but notinvestigated is based on JPEG encoding when dealing with images. It has never been explicitly attackedeven after it is shown in BID13 that most attacks are countered by this defense. Also, to our knowledge, no investigationhas been conducted when dealing with ensemble defenses. Actually, attacks transferability betweenmodels that is well investigated and demonstrated in BID19 in the presence of an oracle (requesting defense to get labels to train a substitute model) is not guaranteed at all when it is absent. Finally, when the maximum perturbation addedto the original data is strictly limited, clipping is needed at the end of training (adversarial crafting) even if C&W attacks are used. The quality of crafted attacks is thereforedegraded as the brought perturbation during the training is brutally clipped. We tackle all these points in our work whileintroducing a new attack we call Centered Initial Attack (CIA). This approach considers the perturbation limitsby construction and consequently no alteration is done on the CIA resulting examples.To make it clearer for the reader, an example is given below to illustrate the clipping issue. FIG0 shows a comparison between CIA and C&W L2attack before and after clipping on an example, a guitar targeted as a potpie with max perturbation equal to 4.0 (around 1.5%). The same number of iterations FORMULA4 is consideredfor both methods. As can be seen on FIG0 , CIA generates the best attackwith 96% confidence. C&W is almost as good with a score of 95% but it is degradedto 88% after applying the clipping to respect the imposed max perturbation. Avoiding this degradation due to clipping is the core motivationof our investigation.The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section I presents some mathematical formulations and the principleof CIA strategy. Then Section II investigates the application of CIA against ensembledefense, feature squeezing and JPEG encoding defenses. Then Section III provides some guidelines to limit the impact of CIAattacks. Finally, we give some possible future investigations in the conclusion.In this paper we presented a new strategy called CIA for crafting adversarial examples while insuring the maximum perturbation added to the original data to be smaller than a fixed threshold.We demonstrated also its robustness against some defenses, feature squeezing, ensemble defenses and even JPEG encoding.For future work, it would be interesting to investigate the transferability of CIA attacks to the physical world as it is shown in BID13 that only a very limited amount of FGDM attacks, around 20%, survive this transfer.Another interesting perspective is to consider partial crafting attacks while selecting regions taking into account the content of the data.With regard to images for instance, this would be interesting to hide attacks with big but imperceptible perturbations.","answer":"In this paper, a new method we call Centered Initial Attack (CIA) is provided.

Through a series of experiments, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we quantitatively show that GM-GANs outperform baselines, both when evaluated using the commonly used Inception Score, and when evaluated using our own alternative scoring method.In addition, we qualitatively demonstrate how the unsupervised variant of GM-GAN tends to map latent vectors sampled from different Gaussians in the latent space to samples of different classes in the data space.We show how this phenomenon can be exploited for the task of unsupervised clustering, and provide quantitative evaluation showing the superiority of our method for the unsupervised clustering of image datasets.Finally, we demonstrate a feature which further sets our model apart from other GAN models: the option to control the quality-diversity trade-off by altering, post-training, the probability distribution of the latent space.This allows one to sample higher quality and lower diversity samples, or vice versa, according to one's needs.Generative models have long been an important and active field of research in machine-learning.Generative Adversarial Networks BID6 include a family of methods for learning generative models where the computational approach is based on game theory.The goal of a GAN is to learn a Generator (G) capable of generating samples from the data distribution (p X ), by converting latent vectors from a lower-dimension latent space (Z) to samples in a higher-dimension data space (X ).Usually, latent vectors are sampled from Z using the uniform or the normal distribution.In order to train G, a Discriminator (D) is trained to distinguish real training samples from fake samples generated by G. Thus D returns a value D(x) ∈ [0, 1] which can be interpreted as the probability that the input sample (x) is a real sample from the data distribution.In this configuration, G is trained to obstruct D by generating samples which better resemble the real training samples, while D is continuously trained to tell apart real from fake samples.Crucially, G has no direct access to real samples from the training set, as it learns solely through its interaction with D. Both D and G are implemented by deep differentiable networks, typically consisting of multiple convolutional and fully-connected layers.They may be alternately trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent.In the short period of time since the introduction of the GAN model, many different enhancement methods and training variants have been suggested to improve their performance (see brief review below).Despite these efforts, often a large proportion of the generated samples is, arguably, not satisfactorily realistic.In some cases the generated sample does not resemble any of the real samples from the training set, and human observers find it difficult to classify synthetically generated samples to one of the classes which compose the training set (see illustration in FIG0 ).Figure1: Images generated by different GANs trained on MNIST (top row), CelebA (middle row) and STL-10 (bottom row). Red squaremark images of, arguably, low quality (best seen in color).This problemworsens with the increased complexity of the training set, and specifically when the training set is characterized by large inter-class and intra-class diversity. In this workwe focus on this problem, aiming to improve the performance of GANs when the training dataset has large inter-class and intra-class diversity.Related Work. In an attemptto improve the performance of the original GAN model, many variants and extensions have been proposed in the past few years. These includearchitectural changes to G and D as in BID26 , modifications to the loss function as in BID20 ; BID7 , or the introduction of supervision into the training setting as in BID22 ; BID24 . Another branchof related work, which is perhaps more closely related to our work, involves the learning of a meaningfully structured latent space. Thus Info-GANdecomposes the input noise into an incompressible source and a \\"latent code\\", Adversarial Auto-Encoders BID19 employ GANs to perform variational inference, and BID16 combine a Variational Auto-Encoder with a Generative Adversarial Network (see Appendix A for a more comprehensive description).Our Approach.Although modificationsto the structure of the latent space have been investigated before as described above, the significance of the probability distribution used for sampling latent vectors was rarely investigated. A common practice todayis to use a standard normal (e.g. N (0, I)) or uniform (e.g. U [0, 1]) probability distribution when sampling latent vectors from the latent space. We wish to challenge thiscommon practice, and investigate the beneficial effects of modifying the distribution used to sample latent vectors in accordance with properties of the target dataset.Specifically, many datasets, especially those of natural images, are quite diverse, with high interclass and intra-class variability. At the same time, the representationsof these datasets usually span high dimensional spaces, which naturally makes them very sparse. Intuitively, this implies that the underlyingdata distribution, which we try to learn using a GAN, is also sparse, i.e. it mostly consists of low-density areas with relatively few areas of high-density.We propose to incorporate this prior-knowledge into the model, by sampling latent vectors using a multi-modal probability distribution which better matches these characteristics of the data space distribution. It is important to emphasize that this architecturalmodification is orthogonal to, and can be used in conjunction with, other architectural improvements such as those reviewed above (see for instance FIG6 in Appendix D.) Supervision can be incorporated into this model by adding correspondence (not necessarily injective) between labels and mixture components.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we describe the family of GM-GAN models. In Section 3 we offer an alternative method which focuseson measuring the trade-off between sample quality and diversity of generative models. In Section 4 we empirically evaluate our proposed model usingvarious diverse datasets, showing that GM-GANs outperform the corresponding baseline methods with uni-modal distribution in the latent space. In Section 5 we describe a method for clustering datasets usingGM-GANs, and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various datasets of real images.","answer":"Multi modal Guassian distribution of latent space in GAN models improves performance and allows to trade-off quality vs. diversity"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

So far, few cis expression quantitative trait loci( eQTLs) have been reliably related to disease susceptibility. Trans-regulating mechanisms may play a more prominent role in disease susceptibility. We analyzed 12, 808 genes detected in at least 5% of circulating monocyte samples from a population-based sample of 1, 490 European unrelated subjects. We applied a method of extraction of expression patterns—independent component analysis—to identify sets of co-regulated genes. These patterns were then related to 675, 350 SNPs to identify major trans-acting regulators. We detected three genomic regions significantly associated with co-regulated gene modules. Association of these loci with multiple expression traits was replicated in Cardiogenics, an independent study in which expression profiles of monocytes were available in 758 subjects. The locus 12q13( lead SNP rs11171739), previously identified as a type 1 diabetes locus, was associated with a pattern including two cis eQTLs, RPS26 and SUOX, and 5 trans eQTLs, one of which( MADCAM1) is a potential candidate for mediating T1D susceptibility. The locus 12q24( lead SNP rs653178), which has demonstrated extensive disease pleiotropy, including type 1 diabetes, hypertension, and celiac disease, was associated to a pattern strongly correlating to blood pressure level. The strongest trans eQTL in this pattern was CRIP1, a known marker of cellular proliferation in cancer. The locus 12q15( lead SNP rs11177644) was associated with a pattern driven by two cis eQTLs, LYZ and YEATS4, and including 34 trans eQTLs, several of them tumor-related genes. This study shows that a method exploiting the structure of co-expressions among genes can help identify genomic regions involved in trans regulation of sets of genes and can provide clues for understanding the mechanisms linking genome-wide association loci to disease.Introduction:Owing to the development of genome-wide association studies( GWAS), the last two years have witnessed spectacular successes in the identification of new loci involved in the susceptibility to complex diseases[1]. However, most of these associations have yet to be translated into a full understanding of the genetic mechanisms that are mediating disease susceptibility. The possibility of assaying genome-wide expression( GWE) and genome-wide variability( GWV) simultaneously in large-scale studies opens new perspectives for unravelling these mechanisms[2]. Several studies on the genetics of expression have shown that a considerable number of genes are regulated by expression SNPs and that cis expression quantitative loci( eQTLs) largely outnumber trans eQTLs[3]–[8]. A reason for this imbalance might be that trans eQTLs are beneath the level of detection of most studies because, unlike cis eQTLs, they do not directly influence gene expression. Moreover, trans associations are more sensitive to confounding factors including technical experimental effects and stratification of the cell population[9]. Large-scale transcriptional modules, i. e. sets of genes highly co-regulated, which are thought to be involved in pathophysiological processes[10], have been described in yeast[11],[12], Drosophila[13], mice[14]–[16] and humans[6]. Identification of trans-acting SNPs affecting such transcriptional modules might enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in pathophysiological processes. Since such trans-acting SNPs are expected to have pleiotropic effects on a large number of genes, each being modestly affected, their statistical mapping may be facilitated by prior recognition of subsets of co-regulated genes. In the present study, we have analyzed 12, 808 genes expressed in circulating monocytes in relation to GWV in a population-based sample of 1, 490 unrelated subjects participating in the Gutenberg Health Study( GHS). We applied first a method of extraction of expression patterns – independent component analysis( ICA)[17]–[19] – in order to identify sets of co-regulated genes. These patterns were then related to 675, 350 SNPs to identify major trans-acting regulators. We identified three genomic regions, centered on the ERBB3, SH2B3 and LYZ-YEATS4 genes respectively, that were associated to expression patterns. Connecting these results with recent GWAS findings provided potential clues for better understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases.Discussion:Various methods have been proposed to detect sets of co-expressed genes, including nonnegative matrix factorization[49], connectivity-based approaches such as WGCNA[6],[46]–[48],[50] or Bayesian networks[7],[10],[12],[51]. The ICA method[18],[19] used in the present study is based on the assumption that the co-expression of genes may be described by a small number of latent features exerting independent influences on expression. Ideally, these features may be related to distinct biological causes of variation, like regulators of gene expression, cellular functions or response to environment[19]. ICA has been applied to different types of microarray data, in particular to identify expression signatures in cancer[52]–[54]. Most of the components extracted by ICA could be characterized by a specific module of genes. A GO enrichment analysis indicated that two thirds of these modules were enriched in GO categories, thus highlighting the ability of ICA to recover biologically meaningful covariation. The proportion of enriched modules might be artificially inflated by the fact that ICA allows for modules of overlapping gene sets, leading to similarity between modules. However, the pairwise overlap between modules was generally limited( ranging from 1 to 20%, median 6%). In addition, most of the GO categories that were shared between similar modules were relatively large categories( e. g. immune response or intracellular components) and it may be hypothesized that the corresponding modules reflected specific aspects of a more general process. As pointed out by others[13], modules can help in functional annotation of genes of unknown function based on known annotations of other genes in the module, such as CCDC4 in the RPS26-associated module. Patterns of co-expression might be confounded by systematic variations introduced during sample processing or microarray measurements and by heterogeneity of the cell population[9],[24]. In particular, patterns observed in unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or whole tissues are more likely to reflect variations in the tissue composition rather than true cell-specific co-expression. In the present study, monocytes were isolated by negative selection. The choice of the method for separation of leukocytes is a matter of debate. Negative selection results in lower cell purity, while positive selection may induce cellular activation and altered transcription due to cross-linking cell surface antigens. A comparison of the two methods in 6 subjects suggested that positive selection did not induce important changes in gene expression[24]. However, the study had little power to detect modest variations such as those involved in trans associations. Thanks to the recent advances in the characterization of genes specific of the different blood cell lineages[25], it is now possible to better control in silico for potential heterogeneity of the cell population under study. We used this information to test the robustness of the SNP-pattern associations after adjustment for surrogate variables of contamination( S. Maouche et al. In preparation). It was not possible, however, to adjust expression data prior to ICA since we observed that such adjustment could induce other artifactual correlations, probably because genes supposed to be specific of a given cell type may also be expressed, although at lower levels, in the monocyte. Since none of the presently available methods yields an 100% purity, in silico adjustment appears as a solution for post hoc controlling the robustness of associations as recently proposed[55],[56]. Using this robust approach, we investigated trans associations of pattern of co-expression in a large population-based study, the Gutenberg Health Study( GHS). We replicated significant trans associations( but not entire modules) detected in the GHS in an independent study, Cardiogenics. Our results showed three genomic regions associated in trans with modules of co-expressed genes. For two of these regions, the trans effects appeared to be mediated by one( or two) cis eQTLs( RPS26 and LYZ/YEATS4) while in the third case( SH2B3), the trans associations were likely to be explained by an alteration of the intracellular signaling. The biological hypotheses raised by these findings will have to be replicated in further experimental studies. In conclusion, the present study shows that a method exploiting the structure of co-expressions among genes such as ICA can help identify genomic regions involved in trans regulation of sets of genes and provide clues for understanding the mechanisms linking GWAS loci to disease. It also suggests that trans associations involving large sets of gene expressions may reflect stratification of the cell population that can be controlled for by in silico adjustment.","answer":"One major expectation from the transcriptome in humans is to help characterize the biological basis of associations identified by genome-wide association studies .

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: However, some sporadic cases seemed to be a result of human to human transmissions  [1, 2] . In contrast to pandemic viruses which fulminantly enter the human population and cause high mortality rates, seasonal influenza viruses generally cause uncomplicated and transient infections in humans, with virus replication localized to the upper respiratory tract [3, 4] . However, in its fully developed form influenza is an acute respiratory disease resulting in hospitalizations and deaths mainly among high-risk groups. Worldwide, annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [5] . For this reason WHO [6] and CDC [7] recommend antiviral treatment for any patient with suspected influenza who is at risk for influenza complications without previous laboratory confirmation. It is known that influenza virus infections are often accompanied by other viral pathogens [8] . Depending on the detection method (qRT-PCR or immunofluorescence) different ratios of co-infections have been found. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that 54.5-83.3% of influenza A or B positive patients were found to have at least one concomitant respiratory viral infection [9] [10] [11] [12] . The detection frequency with immunofluorescence was found to be even higher (90-100%) [13, 14] . Potential concomitant viral pathogens of influenza virus infections include human rhinovirus (hRV), respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [14, 15] . As a result of the multiple infections, a specific anti-influenza mono-therapy treats the influenza virus infection only, but not the infection with the concomitant viral pathogen. Hence, the therapy often fails to sufficiently resolve symptoms. This is also reflected by the fact that neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) are highly efficacious in animal models investigating influenza mono-infections [16, 17] but show lower efficacy against influenza symptoms in clinical trials in adults with natural infections [18] . Therefore, there is a high medical need for a broadly acting antiviral therapy in combination with a specific anti-influenza therapy for treatment of patients suffering from upper respiratory tract symptoms. Ideally, the substances present in the combination complement each other by different modes of action, leading to a treatment that provides full protection against a broad range of different respiratory viruses as well as different influenza strains with a low probability to induce escape mutations. One approach for a broad antiviral therapy is the creation of a protective physical barrier in the nasal cavity using carrageenan. Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed (Rhodophyceae) that has been extensively used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry and is generally recognized as safe by the FDA (GRAS) (reviewed in [19] ). Three main forms of carrageenans are commercially used: kappa, iota and lambda. They differ from each other in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties [20] . The antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment; as a consequence, viral entry is inhibited [21, 22] . Its antiviral activity is dependent on the type of polymer as well as the virus and the host cells [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and has been reviewed in [33] [34] [35] . We published that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of hRV [36] and influenza A [37] replication and demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of iota-carrageenan against common cold viruses by intranasal application in several randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trials [38] [39] [40] . The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus, who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo treated patients in the intention-to-treat population [41, 42] . The anti-influenza activity was shown by subgroup analysis of 49 influenza infected patients who benefited from a 3.3 days faster recovery from symptoms. The use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a significant reduction of the influenza viral load in nasal fluids and a significant increase in the number of virus free patients within the treatment period of 7 days. In good accordance Prieschl-Grassauer are co-founders of Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH. Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH had a role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, preparation of the manuscript and is financing the processing charge of the manuscript. with the literature [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] we observed that the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR. Carrageenan containing nasal sprays are already marketed for the treatment of respiratory viral infections under different brand names in 18 countries. At present the only available effective drugs for treatment and post exposure prevention of influenza are the NI (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir worldwide; Peramivir in Japan and South Korea). Since the large-scale use of M2 blockers for prophylaxis and treatment in humans [43] and farming [44] , the currently circulating influenza viruses already lack sensitivity to this drug group [45] . We have already shown an additive therapeutic effect of a combination therapy with intranasally applied iota-carrageenan and orally administered Oseltamivir in lethally H1N1 A/PR/ 8/34 infected mice and a treatment start 48 hours post infection (hpi) [37] . Due to these very promising results we further developed the concept of combining carrageenan with an NI therapy. In contrast to Oseltamivir, which needs to be activated by metabolic conversion, Zanamivir is directly applied as active drug and can also be administered intranasally [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . The potential of an intranasal administration of Zanamivir was investigated by GlaxoSmithKline. In seven clinical challenge trials 66 volunteers were infected with influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and 213 with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1). 156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy [46, 47, 53, 54] . These challenge trials showed that treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness as well as a reduction in viral titers, duration of shedding and symptoms. In total, safety data from 1092 patients after intranasal application of Zanamivir were published and no evidence for Zanamivir induced adverse events or increased frequencies of local nasal intolerance in comparison to placebo groups was found [46, 49, 52] . Taken together, the combination of a carrageenan nasal spray that provides broad antiviral activity against upper respiratory infections-including influenza-with Zanamivir, a specific anti-influenza drug, meets the existing medical need to treat multiple viral infections. In the present work we investigate the therapeutic effect of a combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir in-vitro and in an animal model. Kappa-carrageenan and iota-carrageenan were purchased from FMC Biopolymers (Philadelphia, PA). The identity, purity (>95%) of carrageenan subtypes and the molecular weight (>100,000) was confirmed by NMR analysis as described elsewhere [55] and the presence of lambda-carrageenan was below the detection limit of 3%. The dry polymer powders were dissolved in aqua bidest (Fresenius Kabi, Austria) to a final concentration of 2.4 mg/ml iota-and 0.8 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan. This 2x stock solution was sterile filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (PAA, Switzerland) and stored at room temperature until use. For further testing the stock solution was diluted to a mixture containing 1.2 mg/ml iota-carrageenan and 0.4 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan (hereinafter referred to as \\"carrageenan\\"). Zanamivir was purchased as powder (Haosun Pharma, China) and the identity and purity was confirmed by NMR analysis. Zanamivir was either dissolved in carrageenan or placebo solutions, followed by sterile filtration through a 0.22 μm filter (Sarstedt, Germany). For in-vivo studies all Zanamivir containing solutions were freshly prepared. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultivated in a 37°C incubator (Sanyo, Japan; CO 2 : 5%, relative humidity: >95%). MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential (DMEM) high glucose medium (PAA, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA, Austria; heat inactivated). Influenza virus A/Hansa Hamburg/01/09 (H1N1(09)pdm) was kindly provided by Peter Staeheli Department of Virology, University of Freiburg, Germany and previously described in [56] ; A/Teal/Germany/Wv632/05 (H5N1) previously published in [57] (accession numbers CY061882-9) and A/Turkey/Germany/R11/01 (H7N7) (taxonomy ID 278191, accession number AEZ68716) were supplied by courtesy of Martin Beer, Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Riems, Germany; A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) was purchased from the ATCC. All influenza viruses were propagated in MDCK cells at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in influenza medium [Opti-Pro serum free medium (Gibco, Austria) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine (PAA, Austria), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mix (PAA, Austria) and 5 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma Aldrich, Austria)]. To determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) and the combination effect of carrageenan and Zanamivir, a semi-liquid plaque assay was developed. Into 96 well tissue culture plates 1.7x10 4 MDCK cells/well were seeded and infected at 90% confluence (24-28 hours later). Serial dilutions of carrageenan and Zanamivir were prepared in assay medium (influenza medium without trypsin). For infection, viruses were diluted to an MOI of 0.003 (H1N1(09)pdm and H3N2 Aichi), 0.015 (H5N1) or 0.004 (H7N7), respectively, in assay medium and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 min with the serial dilutions of carrageenan and/or Zanamivir, respectively. For evaluation of the combination effect of carrageenan and Zanamivir, viruses were diluted in assay medium containing constant concentrations of either carrageenan or Zanamivir. The other substance was serially diluted and used for virus incubation. Cells were infected in 6 replicates/compound dilution, respectively, and incubated at RT for 45 min before inoculum removal. Cells were further incubated with the respective concentration of the investigated substances present in the overlay [influenza medium with 2.25% Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, Fluka, Austria)] for 30-42 hours at 37°C. Evolving plaques were evaluated after methanol/acetone cell fixation by immune staining with antibodies either directed against the influenza A nucleoprotein (AbD Serotec, Germany) (for H1N1(09)pdm, H5N1 and H7N7) or the hemagglutinin (AbD Serotec, Germany) (for H3N2). Analysis was done with a HRP labeled detection antibody (Thermo Scientific, Germany) using TMB (Biolegend, Germany) as substrate and a microplate reader at 450 nm. The reduction of detected signal represents a reduction in the number and size of plaques and indicates suppression of viral replication during infection and cultivation. After the immunostaining cells were stained with 0.005% crystal violet solution to assess the condition of the cell layer and the toxicity of the compounds. IC 50 values and standard deviations were calculated for a sigmoidal dose response model using XLfit Excel add-in version 5.3.1.3. All animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of the \\"European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes\\" and the Austrian law for animal experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Veterinary University of Vienna institutional ethics committee and performed under the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research experimental animal license numbers BMWF-68.205/0262-II/3b/2011 and BMWF-68.205/0142-II/3b2012. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Janvier Labs, France and maintained under standard laboratory conditions in the animal facilities of the Veterinary University of Vienna. For euthanasia and anesthesia asphyxiation through CO 2 was used and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. For infection experiments, 3-5 weeks old female mice were intranasally inoculated with 50 μl influenza virus solution (25 μl/nostril) containing 2.27x10 3 or 1.65x10 3 plaque-forming unit of H1N1(09)pdm or H7N7, respectively. Subsequently, treatment started 24, 48 or 72 hpi, as indicated for the different experiments. Treatment was performed intranasally either with 50 μl therapeutic solution or placebo twice per day for 5 days.Question: Can influenza a virus subtype h7n9 be transmit human to human?","answer":"some sporadic cases seemed to be a result of human to human transmissions"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Both use a flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer for actuation. In one case, overlapping multilayer soft lithography channel structures are used to form normally open microvalves in which a pressure applied to one channel expands into and pinches off the second channel. In contrast, normally closed monolithic membrane valves employ glass-PDMS-glass hybrid8, 19, 20 or PMMA-PDMS-PMMA structures with featureless membrane layers.21 This type of valve effectively closes against high pressures and enables precise control of nanoliter scale volumes. However, integration of these structures with downstream analyses often requires the fabrication of via holes in the solid substrates for access between layers.22 The resulting increases in the dead volumes of the device and fabrication complexity are often problematic. Furthermore, patterning of surfaces within a microchannel with additional structures often requires intensive fabrication, and limits the reusability of the device.23</p><p>Recently, a different normally-closed, pneumatically actuated microvalve design has been proposed by the Kenis group and utilized to control vacuum driven fluid flow.24 This valve structure utilizes a flexible PDMS membrane with microfabricated barrier features (gates) that are lifted away from a substrate by vacuum to enable fluid flow. However, integrated fluid pumping and transport has not been demonstrated or characterized with this microvalve design.</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate and characterize the integrated pumping capabilities of lifting gate microvalves (Figure 1A) and demonstrate the utility of these structures for facile integration with patterned, solid substrates. A pump is formed using a linear array of three microvalves in series with cyclic actuation. These unique structures enable direct integration with a broad range of substrates, thereby reducing microfabrication complexity. To demonstrate the utility of these microvalves and pumps, we perform an automated microparticle based immunoassay using a polyester terephthalate (PET) substrate. These microvalves and pumps are capable of highly efficient, automated fluidic transport and address several limitations of multilayer PDMS valves and monolithic membrane valves described above.</p>Fabrication of lifting gate microvalves and pumps<p>A soft-lithography method using SU-8 molds was used to prepare channel features in PDMS layers. Figure 2 presents the steps employed for device fabrication and assembly. For fluidic and pneumatic layers, SU-8 molds were fabricated to obtain a 25 urn and 60 urn feature height, respectively. After silanizing the SU-8 molds using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the mold for the fluidic layer was spin-coated with a 10 (base material): 1(curing agent) ratio of PDMS (Dow Corning, USA) and thermally cured at 65 °C. PDMS thickness as a function of angular velocity was characterized to fabricate this system. (Figure S-1) In this study, the fluidic mold was spun with 350 rpm to fabricate the 200 μm thick PDMS membrane structure. For the pneumatic layer mold, PDMS was poured on the mold and cured on a 65 °C hotplate for one hour. Holes were punched in the PDMS replica for pneumatic connections and then it was permanently bonded to a PDMS channel layer using oxygen plasma activation (PETS Inc., USA). To evaluate the valving and pumping efficiency, the microvalves and pump structures were then bonded to the glass substrate by UV- ozone treatment.25</p>Operation and characterization<p>Lifting gate microvalves and pumps were operated by applying a vacuum or pressure to inlets on the pneumatic layer (Figure 1B). The valves are actuated by a series of off-chip solenoid controllers using a vacuum pump (-87 kPa) and various closing pressures. Prior to operation of the devices, all microvalves were opened in the absence of fluid to reduce the bonding between glass and PDMS to increase the ease of actuation. To measure the break-through pressure of the micro valve, inlet and outlet valves were opened and the middle valve was held closed with various pressures (5∼60 kPa). By varying the fluidic pressure on the inlet side, we determined the critical pressure required to initiate flow through the 2.25 mm diameter valve. To evaluate the pumping capability, five different sized pumps were used to characterize the dependence of displacement chamber volume on pump performance. As described previously, the volume pumped per cycle depends on the volume of the center valve (manifold valve) in a three valve pump. The theoretical maximum volume pumped per cycle (Vmax) also depends to a lesser extent on the volume of the fluidic region on the downstream side of the gate since the PDMS can be deflected into this region. Taking this into account, Vmax was calculated as:</p><p>where dmaniflod, Dchamber, dfiuidic and Ai are the depth of the manifold valve displacement chamber, diameter of the manifold valve displacement chamber, depth of fluidic channel, and a half area of fluidic chamber, respectively (Figure 1 and Table S-1). Each of the input and output valves has an identical diameter (Dchamber = 750 μm). Standard 5-step pumping programs19 were used and volumetric flow rates were adjusted by changing the actuation time and closing pressure during the pumping programs.</p>Automated microparticle label immunoassay<p>To demonstrate the utility of the lifting-gate microvalves for integration and reusability with plastic substrates, a device was designed and fabricated as described above. In the first step of the assay, 100 μg/mL of streptavidin (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was non-specifically adsorbed onto the polyester terephthalate (PET) film (Rogers Corp., IL, USA) for 2 hours in a 37 °C oven prior to assembly of the device. After UV ozone treatment of the PDMS layer, it was attached to the streptavidin treated polyester terephthalate (PET) substrate. One percent bovine serum albumin (BSA), biotinylated capture antibodies (Anti-mouse IgG–Fc specific from Thermo-Fisher Scientific Inc., USA), target sample (Mouse IgG, Thermo-Fisher Scientific Inc., USA), anti-mouse IgG conjugated microparticles (Abcam Inc. and MyOne Invitrogen Inc., USA) and washing buffer were selected via bus valves and pumped to the reactor to perform the immunoassay. To remove the unbound beads, hydrodynamic washing was performed for 2 minutes with a flow rate of 2.2 μL/min. After collecting the images using a bright field microscope (Nikon Eclipse E800), the number of beads was counted using a segmentation algorithm in a Matlab program. To reuse the microfluidic control system, the solid substrate is peeled away from the fluidic layers, and the fluidic device is rinsed with IPA and DI water sequentially. For the next assay, a new solid substrate is bonded as described above.</p>Results and Discussion<p>Lifting gate microvalves and pumps were developed and characterized for break-through pressure and pumping efficiency. Figure 3 presents a characterization of the fluid flow through a lifting gate microvalve. The closing pressure required to hold off an applied fluidic pressure increases linearly with the applied pressure. The maximum break-through pressure observed was 65 kPa with a 50 kPa closing pressure.</p><p>Pumping rates (nL/s) as a function of closing pressure and actuation time were measured gravimetrically (see supporting information). The actuation time is the length of time each valve remains opened or closed for a given step of the program. The volume pumped per cycle was then calculated using the measured pumping rate. Figure 4A shows volume pumped per cycle as a function of actuation time and closing pressure for the pump containing a 3.75 mm diameter diaphragm valve (pump 5 in Figure 1B). At fixed actuation times, the volume pumped per cycle increases with increasing closing pressure. It can be inferred that low closing pressure results in some backflow in the pump while high closing pressure increases the efficiency of fluid transfer between valves. When the closing pressure approached 45 kPa and the actuation time exceeded 600 ms, the volume pumped per cycle reaches a maximum level of 680 ±2.4 nL(86.2 ±0.72 % Vmax) This maximum efficiency is slightly higher than that previously reported for monolithic membrane valves (82% Vmax).19 At fixed closing pressures greater than 10 kPa, the volume pumped per cycle increased with increasing actuation time and approached the maximum efficiency since sufficient actuation time is required for complete filling or emptying of the diaphragm valve. As the closing pressure increased, the actuation time required for maximum efficiency decreased as expected. In addition, the diameter of the diaphragm valve was found to affect the pumping efficiency in terms of volume pumped per cycle. As the diameter of diaphragm valve decreases, the actuation time required for maximum efficiency decreases (Figure S-2). Smaller sized microvalves have sufficient time to transfer the liquid while closing the gate structure under lower closing pressure. As expected, a longer actuation time is necessary to achieve maximum efficiency for larger microvalves at low closing pressure.</p><p>The maximum volume pumped per cycle was determined for each pump by varying the actuation time at 30 kPa closing pressure. The maximum volume pumped per cycle increases linearly with the volume of the diaphragm displacement chamber. Regardless of diaphragm valve size, the maximum volume pumped per cycle was found to be 86.2% Vmax (Figure 4B). Using this relationship, we can design the required chamber size for precise metering of nanoliter scale volumes.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of the lifting gate microvalves and pumps, we fabricated a programmable sample processing system with an integrated bioreactor for solid phase capture immunoassays (Figure 5). In this example, the lifting gate microvalves were used to automate each of the steps in a microparticle label immunoassay for mouse IgG detection. Using streptavidin functionalized PET as a solid support, biotinylated anti-mouse Ig-Fc, 1% BSA, mouse IgG and anti-mouse IgG conjugated microparticle were pumped sequentially through reaction chamber. Washing of unbound microparticles was performed hydrodynamically by pumping buffer through the reaction chamber. Figure 5B shows the results of the 15 minute assay for a negative and 1 μg/mL mouse IgG target concentration using a single device. Using this device, a signal to noise of 7.39 ±0.37 was achieved. These results indicated that the lifting gate microvalves are useful for automated immunoassay applications with significantly reduced fabrication complexity. The increase in bead density for the positive sample can also be observed with the naked eye, enabling rapid and portable biomarker analysis. Since lifting gate microvalves can be directly bonded to a variety of substrates, they can be used as a control system for other microdevices using this modular assembly. We previously demonstrated an automated, microfluidic microparticle labeled immunoassay platform using normally closed monolithic membrane valves.10 This microfluidic platform required additional layers for integration and more complex fabrication processes such as glass etching, thin PDMS film formation, and drilling via-holes in glass. The lifting gate microfluidic control system has significantly reduced fabrication complexity, facile integration with plastic substrates, and high-performance bioassay capabilities.</p><p>We have demonstrated that pneumatically actuated lifting gate microvalves and pumps can be directly integrated with a wide range of substrates. The use of closing pressures in the range of 30-45 kPa significantly reduces the hysteresis previously reported for similar microvalves26 and enables high-efficiency, integrated pumping operations. These structures also enable separate fabrication of the microfluidic platform and functional surface, thereby simplifying the process for device fabrication and assembly. The modular design and assembly of such systems provides an appropriate format for a disposable microfluidic sample processing system and/or a point-of-care diagnostic device. Furthermore, by adjusting the height of the lifting gate, we can fabricate both normally-closed and normally-open microvalves. This ability is especially useful for the filtration of particles such as cells by precisely controlling the actuation pressure.</p>","answer":"We describe the development and characterization of pneumatically actuated xe2x80x9clifting gatexe2x80x9d microvalves and pumps. A fluidic layer containing the gate structure and a pneumatic layer are fabricated by soft-lithography in PDMS and bonded permanently with an oxygen plasma treatment. The microvalve structures are then reversibly bonded to a featureless glass or plastic substrate to form hybrid glass-PDMS and plastic-PDMS microchannel structures. The breakthrough pressures of the microvalve increase linearly up to 65 kPa as the closing pressure increases. The pumping capability of these structures ranges from the nanoliter to microliter scale depending on the number of cycles and closing pressure employed. The micropump structures exhibit up to 86.2% pumping efficiency from flow rate measurements. The utility of these structures for integrated sample processing is demonstrated by performing an automated immunoassay. These lifting gate valve and pump structures enable facile integration of complex microfluidic control systems with a wide range of lab-on-a-chip substrates."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Little attention has been paid so far to physiological signals for emotion recognition compared to audiovisual emotion channels such as facial expression or speech. This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological dataset to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological dataset from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method which spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate lab setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. Improved recognition accuracy of 95% and 70% for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Stress is a growing problem in society and can, amongst others, induce musculoskeletal complaints, related to sustained muscle tension. The ability to measure stress with a wireless system would be useful in the prevention of stress-related health problems. The aim of this experiment was to derive stress levels of subjects from electromyography (EMG) signals of the upper trapezius muscle. Two new stress tests were designed for this study, which aimed at creating circumstances that are similar to work stress. An experiment is described in which EMG signals of the upper trapezius muscle were measured during three different stressful situations. Stress tests included a calculation task (the Norinder test), a logical puzzle task and a memory task, of which the last two were newly designed. The results show significantly higher amplitudes of the EMG signals during stress compared to rest and fewer gaps (periods of relaxation) during stress. Also, mean and median frequencies were significantly lower during stress than during rest. The differences in EMG features between rest and stress conditions indicate that EMG is a useful parameter to detect stress. These results show opportunities for the inclusion of EMG sensors in a wireless system for ambulatory monitoring of stress levels. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  We present a multimodal data set for the analysis of human affective states. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals of 32 participants were recorded as each watched 40 one-minute long excerpts of music videos. Participants rated each video in terms of the levels of arousal, valence, like/dislike, dominance, and familiarity. For 22 of the 32 participants, frontal face video was also recorded. A novel method for stimuli selection is proposed using retrieval by affective tags from the last.fm website, video highlight detection, and an online assessment tool. An extensive analysis of the participants' ratings during the experiment is presented. Correlates between the EEG signal frequencies and the participants' ratings are investigated. Methods and results are presented for single-trial classification of arousal, valence, and like/dislike ratings using the modalities of EEG, peripheral physiological signals, and multimedia content analysis. Finally, decision fusion of the classification results from different modalities is performed. The data set is made publicly available and we encourage other researchers to use it for testing their own affective state estimation methods.Literature Review:","answer":"Muscle activity is measured using surface electromyogram (EMG). For this purpose, a pair (or array) of electrodes is attached to the skin above the muscle under consideration. The electrical potential is generated when the muscle cells are activated and the surface electrodes are used to recorded changes in the electric potential. The frequency range of the muscle activity ranges from 15 to 500 Hz BIB001 . Hence, in order to capture the full spectral range, the minimal sampling rate of the EMG modality should be around 1000 Hz. One source of noise in surface EMG are potential changes in adjacent muscles and cardiac activity. Depending on the measurement position, the QRS complex (indicating depolarization of the cardiac ventricles and the following contraction) can cause artefacts which require postprocessing beyond normal filtering. Considering related work in AR literature, EMG electrodes are often placed in the face (e.g., on the zygomaticus major BIB004 ) or on the shoulder (e.g., on the upper trapezius muscle BIB002 BIB004 BIB003 )."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Despite advances in the management of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the treatment of relapsed and primary refractory disease remains a major challenge. High-dose chemotherapy or radio-chemotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a potentially curative treatment approach; however, the applicability of this approach is restricted to patients responding to second-line chemotherapy. Thus, second-line therapy must be both efficacious and without stem cell or organ toxicity that would compromise the ability to proceed to SCT. The ifosfamide , carboplatin and etoposide ( ICE ) regimen was developed to address these challenges . In a series of prospective clinical trials, 222 patients were treated with the ICE regimen. with an overall response rate of 72%. The mobilization of stem cells with this regimen was excellent,with 86% of patients mobilizing at least 2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg. The incidence of treatment-related toxicity precluding SCT after ICE is very low.

We further explain how this FacePoseNet (FPN) can be used to align faces in 2D and 3D as an alternative to explicit facial landmark detection for these tasks. We claim that in many cases the standard means of measuring landmark detector accuracy can be misleading when comparing different face alignments. Instead, we compare our FPN with existing methods by evaluating how they affect face recognition accuracy on the IJB-A and IJB-B benchmarks: using the same recognition pipeline, but varying the face alignment method. Our results show that (a) better landmark detection accuracy measured on the 300W benchmark does not necessarily imply better face recognition accuracy. (b) Our FPN provides superior 2D and 3D face alignment on both benchmarks. Finally, (c), FPN aligns faces at a small fraction of the computational cost of comparably accurate landmark detectors. For many purposes, FPN is thus a far faster and far more accurate face alignment method than using facial landmark detectors.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: We present a unified model for face detection, pose estimation, and landmark estimation in real-world, cluttered images. Our model is based on a mixtures of trees with a shared pool of parts; we model every facial landmark as a part and use global mixtures to capture topological changes due to viewpoint. We show that tree-structured models are surprisingly effective at capturing global elastic deformation, while being easy to optimize unlike dense graph structures. We present extensive results on standard face benchmarks, as well as a new “in the wild” annotated dataset, that suggests our system advances the state-of-the-art, sometimes considerably, for all three tasks. Though our model is modestly trained with hundreds of faces, it compares favorably to commercial systems trained with billions of examples (such as Google Picasa and face.com).[3]: Computer Vision has recently witnessed great research advance towards automatic facial points detection. Numerous methodologies have been proposed during the last few years that achieve accurate and efficient performance. However, fair comparison between these methodologies is infeasible mainly due to two issues. (a) Most existing databases, captured under both constrained and unconstrained (in-the-wild) conditions have been annotated using different mark-ups and, in most cases, the accuracy of the annotations is low. (b) Most published works report experimental results using different training testing sets, different error metrics and, of course, landmark points with semantically different locations. In this paper, we aim to overcome the aforementioned problems by (a) proposing a semi-automatic annotation technique that was employed to re-annotate most existing facial databases under a unified protocol, and (b) presenting the 300 Faces In-The-Wild Challenge (300-W), the first facial landmark localization challenge that was organized twice, in 2013 and 2015. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort towards a unified annotation scheme of massive databases and a fair experimental comparison of existing facial landmark localization systems. The images and annotations of the new testing database that was used in the 300-W challenge are available from http: ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk resources 300-W_IMAVIS .[4]: We address the problem of interactive facial feature localization from a single image. Our goal is to obtain an accurate segmentation of facial features on high-resolution images under a variety of pose, expression, and lighting conditions. Although there has been significant work in facial feature localization, we are addressing a new application area, namely to facilitate intelligent high-quality editing of portraits, that brings requirements not met by existing methods. We propose an improvement to the Active Shape Model that allows for greater independence among the facial components and improves on the appearance fitting step by introducing a Viterbi optimization process that operates along the facial contours. Despite the improvements, we do not expect perfect results in all cases. We therefore introduce an interaction model whereby a user can efficiently guide the algorithm towards a precise solution. We introduce the Helen Facial Feature Dataset consisting of annotated portrait images gathered from Flickr that are more diverse and challenging than currently existing datasets. We present experiments that compare our automatic method to published results, and also a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of our interactive method.[5]: We present a novel approach to localizing parts in images of human faces. The approach combines the output of local detectors with a nonparametric set of global models for the part locations based on over 1,000 hand-labeled exemplar images. By assuming that the global models generate the part locations as hidden variables, we derive a Bayesian objective function. This function is optimized using a consensus of models for these hidden variables. The resulting localizer handles a much wider range of expression, pose, lighting, and occlusion than prior ones. We show excellent performance on real-world face datasets such as Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and a new Labeled Face Parts in the Wild (LFPW) and show that our localizer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the less challenging BioID dataset.","answer":"Applications of facial landmark detectors.

Seeking to optimise the simultaneous use of two antibiotics, we use the minimal dose at which clearance is observed in an in vitro experimental model of antibiotic treatment as a criterion to distinguish the best and worst treatments of a bacterium, Escherichia coli. Our aim is to compare a combination treatment consisting of two synergistic antibiotics to so-called sequential treatments in which the choice of antibiotic to administer can change with each round of treatment. Using mathematical predictions validated by the E. coli treatment model, we show that clearance of the bacterium can be achieved using sequential treatments at antibiotic dosages so low that the equivalent two-drug combination treatments are ineffective. Seeking to treat the bacterium in testing circumstances, we purposefully study an E. coli strain that has a multidrug pump encoded in its chromosome that effluxes both antibiotics. Genomic amplifications that increase the number of pumps expressed per cell can cause the failure of high-dose combination treatments, yet, as we show, sequentially treated populations can still collapse. However, dual resistance due to the pump means that the antibiotics must be carefully deployed and not all sublethal sequential treatments succeed. A screen of 136 96-h-long sequential treatments determined five of these that could clear the bacterium at sublethal dosages in all replicate populations, even though none had done so by 24 h. These successes can be attributed to a collateral sensitivity whereby cross-resistance due to the duplicated pump proves insufficient to stop a reduction in E. coli growth rate following drug exchanges, a reduction that proves large enough for appropriately chosen drug switches to clear the bacterium.Introduction:Bacteria have a remarkable capacity to adapt and evolve. It is probably unsurprising in retrospect that resistance has developed to every antibiotic in clinical use[1], with the genes responsible disseminated globally[2, 3]. Antibiotic resistance, therefore, has the potential to become a very grave problem. Bacteria evolve so rapidly, in fact, that whole-genome sequencing studies have been able to elucidate dozens of de novo drug-resistance mutations occurring at high frequency within a clinical patient’s infection during a 12-wk treatment[4]. Given this, the following seems an important question: what ways of combining antibiotics might be used to combat infection even when the bacterial species in question exhibits rapid decreases in drug susceptibility during treatment? Or, to put it differently, how can we enlarge the “optimisation space” of antibiotic combinations and search within those for novel, effective treatments? One possibility may lie with so-called sequential treatments. They have been the subject of several recent laboratory studies[5–7] and clinical trials[8, 9] in which the idea is to alternate the use of different antibiotic classes through time. Thus, if, for example, two antibiotics are available and n rounds of treatment are to be given, then there are 2n different ways of administering the drugs. Our hypothesis states that this exponentially large optimisation space can contain more effective treatments than the equivalent two-drug combination treatment when the same dosages of each antibiotic are applied. We demonstrate the veracity of this claim in one particular in vitro laboratory model that mimics something of the gravity of the situation we now face by using a bacterium that possesses a scalable drug efflux mechanism that quickly reduces the efficacy of the antibiotics at our disposal. Despite this mechanism, we show that sequential treatments can clear the bacterium when the equivalent combination treatment fails to, provided, that is, that the drugs are deployed in a suitably optimised, sequential manner. To demonstrate this, we use the following laboratory system. Escherichia coli K12( AG100) is targeted with two antibiotics, erythromycin( a macrolide, ERY) and doxycycline( a tetracycline, DOX), that bind to different ribosomal RNA subunits, thereby inhibiting translation. While this is a nonclinical drug pairing, the commercial drug Synercid( comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin) also targets ribosomal RNA combinatorially[10]. Moreover, some clinical combinations have ambiguous pharmacological interactions that can appear antagonistic in vitro[11, 12], whereas the ERY—DOX pairing has an established synergy[13, 14]. Before continuing, we need to declare a standard notational device that we will use throughout. It defines how antibiotic efficacy is measured, independently of the drug under study. Thus, ICx will denote the antibiotic concentration that reduces the density of the ancestral bacterial strain( AG100), rather than( for example) any other fitness measure, exponential growth rate, or area under a growth curve, by a factor x% relative to that produced without antibiotic in any single period of bacterial growth. Now, E. coli is known to decrease susceptibility to ERY and DOX by amplifying a genomic region that contains the operon acrRAB because a multidrug pump is formed from the products of acrRAB and tolC[13, 15]. Selection for amplification mutations occurs even when the drugs are combined at high concentrations whereupon pump duplications and triplications are observed[16]. The triplications permit bacteria subjected to 5 d of combination treatment at twice IC95 dosages, and thus at very low population densities, to eventually restore their growth rates and population densities to almost untreated levels[16]. In these circumstances, the successful clearance of E. coli using sublethal dosages of ERY and DOX appears implausible. Low-dose monotherapies are unlikely to work[17], and combining the antibiotics into a synergistic IC50 cocktail( that achieves IC90 overall because of the synergy) is known to be futile because of resistance increases provided by the pump duplications[13]. We therefore turn to sequential treatments, an approach that has been used to treat cancers[18–20] and some clinical infections[9]. These might also appear predestined to fail; after all, cross drug collateral sensitivities are believed to be the basis of successful sequential treatments[7], whereas our model system, by contrast, has a scalable multidrug pump at its disposal. Nevertheless, to evaluate the impact of extended antibiotic treatments, we propagated populations of E. coli in 96-well microtitre plates containing liquid medium supplemented with antibiotics based on 12-h cycles, aka seasons, of growth. Thus, two drug treatments per day were administered. At the end of each season, 1% of the spent liquid media, containing biomass, was transferred to a plate containing fresh medium and antibiotics, where growth could resume. The media was supplemented with enough glucose that this protocol would not clear the bacterium in the absence of drug but would instead establish a near-constant, season-by-season total observed population density of about 108 cells per ml in stationary phase( as can be discerned from Fig S1 and Fig S7 in S1 Text). Given this model, we sought antibiotic treatments capable of clearing the bacterium.Discussion:Despite the ability of bacteria to adapt to an antibiotic challenge, our laboratory model shows that one can exploit a sensitising property of fluctuating environments to eliminate a bacterium eventually at dosages that only inhibit growth by 70% initially. However, ours is a very simple treatment model inspired by bacterial infections, and we do not wish to overstate its predictive power in relation to the treatment of humans. In particular, the loss of slow-growing cells from our microcosm is not representative of the in vivo conditions in which slow-growing, antibiotic-tolerant phenotypes can be responsible for recalcitrance to treatment[32]. Our model is also limited because it lacks an immune response or any of the environmental complexity found in the human body. The clinical practise of how antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections begins with the minimal inhibitory concentration( MIC), the minimal drug concentration at which no visible growth of a bacterium is observed after overnight culture in vitro[33, 34]. After determining the MIC, antibiotics are deployed at high enough dosages so that peak concentrations are achieved in vivo well in excess of this number[35]. Experience has shown that super-MIC dosages are necessary for successful recovery from infection when using combination treatment and monotherapy[33–39], although there is recent evidence of effective lower-dose antifungal, anti-MRSA( methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and antimalarial treatments in vivo[40–42]. However, so few sequential treatments have been trialled in the clinic that there is little accumulated data on or understanding of what dosing or scheduling criteria might be needed when using sequential treatments in vivo. Furthermore, not all IC70 sequential treatments lead to clearance, and some drug sequences produced higher population densities than the equivalent combination treatment( Fig. 2A). The reasons for this are not clear, although both data and the theoretical efflux model do exhibit large between-treatment variation( Fig. 2A, Fig S18 in S1 Text, section 5). A prior hypothesis states that greater antibiotic heterogeneities in the bacterial environment should diminish the rate of drug-resistance adaptation[43]. This would mean, for example, that bacteria adapt more readily to an EEEEDDDD treatment( one drug switch) than to EDEDEDED( seven switches). We therefore sought a relationship between bacterial population densities and the number of drug switches implemented in different sequential treatments but found no evidence of the predicted correlation( Fig S11 in S1 Text, section 3). It is well known that the use of low dosages can select for resistant strains when they are competed in co-culture with susceptible strains[17]. However, that mid-dose clearance is still possible has a simple explanation in principle: the antibiotic sequences eventually reduce, and then maintain, Malthusian fitness of the evolving population below zero. To examine this in the simplest of theoretical contexts, suppose Bn represents bacterial population density after n rounds of treatment where 1-I, with 0<I<1, is an expected fraction of cells that are not cleared by the treatment but instead lost because of other effects( for example, host immunity) each treatment. Indeed, granulocyte-mediated clearance has been shown to achieve a two-log10 reduction in bacterial load in a 24 h period using a murine model[44], giving a value of I≈1/100. At any sublethal dosage, whereby exponential population growth( at rate r) occurs between treatments spaced T time units apart( cf. Fig. 1A), it follows for a bacteriostatic antibiotic at a dose of “A units” that Bn+1 = I∙Bne( r-A) T. Bacterial clearance is assured when the population decays eventually; this happens when Bn+1/Bn<1, which is equivalent to the condition A>r-( log( I-1)) /T. Note that this value is less than r by an amount that depends on I. If we now define an analogy of the MIC as, say, the IC99 in this toy model, which is the antibiotic dose that reduces bacterial growth by 99% after one treatment, the condition on A to achieve IC99 is e( r-A) T<1/100, or A>r+( log 100) /T. This value is greater than r and therefore effective therapeutically, but it is not representative of the critical minimal dose needed to clear the bacterium[45]. The absence of visual eradication overnight in vitro should not, according to this argument, itself be used as a rationale to preclude the practical use of an antibiotic drug. Indeed, the antifungal azole drugs are used to treat Candida albicans clinically at dosages that do not always eliminate population growth after overnight culture in vitro[45–47]. In our in vitro study, we needed to keep the rate of adaptation low for the above theoretical rationale to work, and only certain sequential treatments were able to do this( Fig. 3A and 3B). The requirement for low rates of adaptation likely needs the mutations and physiological changes that arise early during treatment, when population sizes are large, to provide no benefit, or even be deleterious later during treatment and so prevent recovery when population size, and mutational supply, is small. There have been clinical successes for one particular sequential treatment: Helicobacter pylori infection has improved eradication rates for a sequential treatment relative to a combination therapy at the same dose[8, 9], although geographical variations in successes have been observed and attributed to pathogen strain differences[48]. We hypothesise that the treatment of other clinical pathogens may be possible using sequential antibiotic treatments. We note that low dosing is used to treat some bacterial infections. The ability of antibiotics to act as modulators of gene expression at low doses[49] can be exploited, for example when certain drug classes( including macrolides) are used to control the expression of virulence factors in MRSA[50]. Moreover, the use of β-lactam antibiotics as a low-dose adjuvant is a novel strategy in the treatment of recalcitrant MRSA infection[51, 52], even though MRSA is resistant to most of these drugs. The β-lactam does not target the cell directly; rather, it enhances the activity of host peptides that are not antimicrobial per se but which modulate the host immune response[53]. However, it is not our intention to advocate for the indiscriminate clinical use of low-dose regimens. Rather, we are claiming that sequential dosing strategies exist for administering antibiotics that are sufficiently potent, and which prevent adaptation enough, to clear a bacterium when the equivalent dose combination treatment fails to do so. That this can be done even though the bacterium has a scaleable multidrug resistance mechanism in its chromosome gives us cause to hypothesise that new ways of optimising antibiotic use in vivo can be found by alternating them as part of treatment.","answer":"So-called “cocktail” treatments are often proposed as a way of enhancing the potency of antibiotics , based on the idea that multiple drugs can synergise when used together as part of a single combined therapy . We investigated whether any other multidrug deployment strategies are as effective as—or perhaps even better than—synergistic antibiotic combinations at reducing bacterial densities . “Collateral sensitivities” between antibiotics are frequently observed; this is when measures taken by a bacterium to counter the presence of one antibiotic sensitise it to the subsequent use of another . Our approach was to see if we could exploit these sensitivities by first deploying one drug , then removing it and instead deploying another , and then repeating this process . This is not an entirely new idea , and there is a precedence for this form of treatment that has been trialled in the clinic for Helicobacter pylori infection . The idea we pursued here is an extension of “sequential treatment”; we investigated whether with two antibiotics and n rounds of treatment , if we search within the set of all possible 2n “sequential treatments”—including the two single-drug monotherapies—there might be treatments within that set that are more effective than the equivalent two-drug cocktail . Using a simple in vitro treatment model , we show that some sequential-in-time antibiotic treatments are successful under conditions that cause the failure of the cocktail treatment when implemented at the equivalent dosage ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

Though corelease of glutamate or GABA with acetylcholine has been reported within the cholinergic system, the full extent is unknown. To explore synaptic signaling of cholinergic forebrain neurons, we activated choline acetyltransferase expressing neurons using channelrhodopsin while recording post-synaptic currents( PSCs) in layer 1 interneurons. Surprisingly, we observed PSCs mediated by GABAA receptors in addition to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Based on PSC latency and pharmacological sensitivity, our results suggest monosynaptic release of both GABA and ACh. Anatomical analysis showed that forebrain cholinergic neurons express the GABA synthetic enzyme Gad2 and the vesicular GABA transporter( Slc32a1). We confirmed the direct release of GABA by knocking out Slc32a1 from cholinergic neurons. Our results identify GABA as an overlooked fast neurotransmitter utilized throughout the forebrain cholinergic system. GABA/ACh corelease may have major implications for modulation of cortical function by cholinergic neurons.Introduction:For many years, neurons were thought to release only a single fast neurotransmitter( Strata and Harvey, 1999). This assumption led to classifying neuronal subtypes based on released neurotransmitter, a convention which helped predict a neuron's circuit function. However, many neuronal subtypes that release multiple fast neurotransmitters have now been described( Hnasko and Edwards, 2012). In some cases, the coreleased neurotransmitters have similar post-synaptic effects, such as inhibition mediated by GABA and glycine from spinal interneurons( Jonas et al., 1998). In other instances, the effects of the two neurotransmitters may be different and synergistic. For example, coreleased GABA and glutamate are thought to control the balance of excitation and inhibition in the lateral habenula( Root et al., 2014; Shabel et al., 2014). In neuromodulatory systems, synaptic release of fast neurotransmitters along with slow neuromodulators has emerged as a common theme. In addition to the impact of dopamine, stimulation of dopaminergic terminals from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra compacta activates glutamate-mediated excitatory currents in the nucleus accumbens( Stuber et al., 2010; Tecuapetla et al., 2010) and GABA-mediated inhibitory currents in the striatum( Tritsch et al., 2012, 2014). Likewise, serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe can trigger glutamate-mediated currents in post-synaptic neurons of the ventral tegmentum and nucleus accumbens which contributes to the signaling of reward( Liu et al., 2014). Several cholinergic neuron populations also release multiple neurotransmitters. Retinal starburst amacrine cells( SACs) differentially release GABA and acetylcholine( ACh) based on the pattern of light stimulation( Lee et al., 2010). In the central brain, selective activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons results in cholinergic and glutamatergic responses( Gras et al., 2008; Higley et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2014). Similarly, the cholinergic projection from habenula excites interpeduncular neurons through glutamate and ACh( Ren et al., 2011). Some evidence suggests that the basal forebrain cholinergic( BFC) system, which provides the major source of ACh to cortex, may corelease GABA. The dorsal-most BFC neurons, which belong to the globus pallidus externus( GP), express molecular markers for GABA synthesis and vesicular packaging and trigger GABAA receptor currents in GP and cortex when activated( Tkatch et al., 1998; Saunders et al., 2015). We therefore asked whether GABA corelease was a general feature of forebrain cholinergic neurons. To address this question, we selectively activated cholinergic fibers in the cortex, with the goal of identifying synaptic events triggered by endogenous release from forebrain cholinergic neurons. Recording from layer 1 interneurons, we observed not only the expected excitatory post-synaptic currents( EPSCs) mediated by nicotinic ACh receptors( nAChRs), but an unexpected inhibitory post-synaptic current( IPSC) mediated by GABAA receptors. IPSCs insensitive to nAChR antagonists had onset latencies slightly faster than the nicotinic EPSCs( nEPSCs), and could be directly evoked under pharmacological conditions in which action potentials were blocked, suggesting cholinergic neurons were directly releasing GABA in addition to ACh. Indeed, we found that cholinergic neurons throughout the forebrain commonly coexpressed the GABA synthetic enzyme GAD65( Gad2), and the vesicular GABA transporter( Slc32a1), indicating that these neurons possess the necessary cell machinery for GABA transmission. Finally, we show that conditional deletion of Slc32a1 selectively in cholinergic neurons eliminates monosynaptic IPSCs while leaving nEPSCs intact, confirming the direct release of GABA from cholinergic terminals. These experiments suggest a previously overlooked capability of the cholinergic system to use GABA in synaptic signaling.Discussion:Here, we provide evidence that the cortical cholinergic system is capable of GABAergic neurotransmission. In response to optogenetic stimulation of neurons expressing endogenous Chat, we observed PSCs mediated by both nAChRs and GABAA receptors in layer 1 interneurons. A subset of the evoked IPSCs appeared to be monosynaptic, based on latency and pharmacological analyses. In support of their GABAergic nature, the ChAT+ neurons which innervate cortex—local interneurons and subcortical projections arising from the GP/NB—express Gad2 and Slc32a1, the canonical molecular machinery for GABA synthesis and vesicular packaging. Indeed, conditional knock-out of Slc32a1 selectively in cholinergic neurons eliminates light-evoked monosynaptic IPSCs. These genetic results confirm that cholinergic neurons release GABA directly. Cholinergic GABA release is likely to be a feature of most, but not all, central cholinergic neurons: the ChAT+ neurons of the MS and DBB—which innervate the hippocampus—also express Gad2 and Slc32a1, whereas those of the midbrain PPN do not. The mode of neurotransmitter corelease can vary across neuron classes. In some instances, both neurotransmitters are released from the same synaptic vesicles. This is the case for GABA/glutamate corelease onto neurons of the lateral habenula, where individual miniature EPSCs can be observed with dual GABA/glutamate components( Shabel et al., 2014). Copackaging in individual vesicles is also the case when the same vesicular transporter loads both neurotransmitters. For example, GABA is packaged in dopaminergic neurons by VMAT2, which also packages dopamine( Tritsch et al., 2012). Similarly, both GABA and glycine packaging in spinal interneurons rely on VGAT( Wojcik et al., 2006). However, corelease from separate pools of synaptic vesicles also occurs. In retinal SACs, release of GABA and ACh can be functionally separated through patterned light stimulation or pharmacology. In Chat+ GP axons in cortex, GABA and ACh appear to be released from distinct vesicular pools which can be located within the same or neighboring pre-synaptic terminals( Saunders et al., 2015). Though the precise mechanism by which each forebrain cholinergic population coreleases GABA and ACh remain unclear and further experiments are merited to explore how GABA/ACh cotransmission is regulated, the differences in the proportion of layer 1 interneurons showing ACh and GABA responses suggest some form of segregated release. The cholinergic system's function in promoting attention, alertness, and learning has classically been attributed to acetylcholine and its action as a diffuse volume transmitter, affecting cortical activity at relatively slow time scales. This model is supported by anatomical evidence showing widespread distribution of cholinergic fibers through all cortical layers with significant separation between the sites of release and ACh receptors( Descarries and Mechawar, 2000; Mechawar et al., 2000). In addition, many in vitro pharmacological experiments have shown that ACh receptors can shape the signaling of other neurotransmitter systems, by altering properties of presynaptic release, synaptic plasticity, or the intrinsic excitability of targeted neurons( Picciotto et al., 2012). However, more recent work has focused on the participation of ACh in rapid, wired neurotransmission, acting at tightly apposed synapses( Sarter et al., 2009; Poorthuis et al., 2014; Sarter et al., 2014). Behaviorally relevant sensory cues can cause a fast, time-locked spike in ACh concentration, suggesting that ACh may mediate detection of that cue( Parikh et al., 2007). In addition, fast onset currents mediated by nAChRs can be recorded in cortical interneurons following optogenetic activation of cholinergic fibers( Arroyo et al., 2012; Bennett et al., 2012). Our finding that cholinergic neurons also elicit fast-onset synaptic GABAA responses lends further support to the notion that the cholinergic system can rapidly affect cortical computations by acting at classical synapses. GABA corelease from cholinergic forebrain neurons may affect cortical function in several ways. First, at the circuit level, GABA release could act in a manner that reinforces the emerging concept that the cholinergic system disinhibits cortical firing. ACh release from basal forebrain neurons excites layer 1 and VIP+ interneurons, which in turn inhibit local interneurons that target principle neurons of the cortex( Letzkus et al., 2011; Pinto et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2014). Depending on the timing and targeted cell types, GABA corelease could conceivably enhance this effect by inhibiting local interneurons, thereby promoting cortical activity. Second, nAChRs can regulate both pre and post-synaptic GABAergic signaling. For example, in hippocampal interneurons, post-synaptic nAChRs are present in inhibitory synapses( Fabian-Fine et al., 2001) and when activated, reduce GABAA receptor-mediated IPSCs in a Ca2+ and PKC-dependent manner( Wanaverbecq et al., 2007; Zhang and Berg, 2007). Thus coreleased ACh and GABA could interact to modulate local synaptic signaling. Lastly, experiments poisoning or stimulating the basal forebrain cholinergic system have demonstrated that activity within this projection is necessary and sufficient for plasticity in sensory cortices( Kilgard and Merzenich, 1998; Weinberger, 2004; Ramanathan et al., 2009). While ACh alone can induce functional changes in cortical circuits( Metherate and Weinberger, 1990), GABA may also contribute to synaptic rewiring in vivo. Addressing these questions experimentally will benefit from future work to clarify the basic synaptic anatomy and biochemical regulation of ACh/GABA corelease. Given the presence of GABA signaling machinery throughout the distinct forebrain cholinergic systems, corelease likely has a significant and fundamental effect on brain activity and cognition.","answer":"Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses . When an electrical signal arrives at the presynaptic cell , it triggers the release of molecules called neurotransmitters into the synapse . These molecules then bind to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic cell , starting a chain of events that leads to the regeneration of the electrical signal in the second cell . Broadly speaking , neurotransmitters are either excitatory , which means that they increase the electrical activity of the postsynaptic neurons , or they are inhibitory , meaning that they reduce postsynaptic activity . Initially , it was thought that neurons release only one type of neurotransmitter , but it is now known that this is not always the case . Many neurons within the spinal cord , for example , release two different inhibitory neurotransmitters , GABA and glycine , while some neurons in the midbrain release GABA and an excitatory neurotransmitter called glutamate . Saunders , Granger , and Sabatini now provide the first direct evidence that cholinergic neurons in different regions of the forebrain also release two neurotransmitters . Collectively known as the ‘forebrain cholinergic system’ , these cells are best known for producing the excitatory transmitter acetylcholine . However , Saunders et al . now show that this system also produces an enzyme that manufactures GABA , as well as a protein that pumps GABA into structures called vesicles , which are then released into the synapse . Although this is not concrete evidence for the release of GABA , Saunders et al . also show—with a technique called optogenetics , which involves the use of light to control neuronal activity—that some of the neurons in this system can trigger inhibitory responses in postsynaptic cells . Moreover , these responses can be blocked using drugs that occupy GABA receptors , or by using genetic techniques to delete the GABA-pumping protein from cholinergic neurons . Taken together , the results of these experiments strongly suggest that the cholinergic neurons throughout the forebrain—unlike , for example , the cholinergic neurons in the midbrain , the region of the brain that controls movement—possess the molecular machinery needed to produce and release GABA , in addition to acetylcholine . Given that the cholinergic system has a key role in cognition and is particularly susceptible to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease , the ability of these neurons to release GABA release could have widespread implications for the study and understanding of brain function ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Both of the cell lines were previously selected by continuous exposure to 9-nitro-CPT. The RC0.1 and RC1 cells have high cross-resistance to CPT derivatives including SN-38 and topotecan , but are not cross-resistant to the non-top1 inhibitors etoposide , doxorubicin , and vincristine . Although the top1 protein levels were not decreased in the resistant cells compared with the parental cells, CPT-induced DNA cleavage was markedly reduced in the RC0.1 and RC1 nuclear extracts. The resistant-cell-line nuclear extracts also demonstrated top1 catalytic activity and resistance to CPT, in in vitro assays. Reverse transcription-PCR products from the resistant cell lines were sequenced, and revealed a point mutation resulting in a R364H mutation in the top1 of both RC0.1 and RC1. No wild-type top1 RNA or genomic DNA was detected in the resistant cell lines. Using a purified recombinant R364H top1, we found that the R364H mutant top1 was CPT resistant and fully active. In the published top1 crystal structure, the R364H mutation is close to the catalytic tyrosine and other well-known mutations leading to CPT resistance.sentence: The RC0.1 and RC1 cells have high cross-resistance to CPT derivatives including SN-38 and topotecan , but are not cross-resistant to the non-top1 inhibitors etoposide , doxorubicin , and vincristine .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

An experimental strategy based on solution viscosity perturbation allowed us to study the energetics of amide-substrates, p-aminobenzamidine (p-ABZ) and proflavin binding to the catalytic site of two proteolyzed forms of alpha-thrombin, i.e. zeta- and gamma T-thrombin. These thrombin derivatives are cleaved at the Leu144-Gly150 loop and at the fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), respectively. A phenomenological analysis of thermodynamic data showed that the amide substrates and p-ABZ interactions with zeta-thrombin were respectively, associated with a chemical compensation (i.e. the linear relationship between entropy and enthalpy of binding) and a hydrophobic phenomenon (i.e. a change in the standard heat capacity). The latter was slightly lower than that previously observed for a alpha-thrombin (0.78 + /- 0.25 versus 1.01 + /- 0.17 kcal/mol K). Both phenomenon were absent in gamma T-thrombin. The interaction of a alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin with macromolecular substrates that \\" bridge-bind \\" to both the catalytic site (CS) and fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), such as fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor (CPR), was also evaluated. These interactions were studied by following fibrinopeptide A (FpA) release and by measuring intraplatelet Ca2 + changes induced by thrombin-CPR interaction. It was found that the free energy of activation (RT ln Kcat/Km) for both fibrinogen and CPR hydrolysis followed the same hierarchy, i.e. alpha > zeta > gamma. Moreover, the values of delta Cp for alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin interaction with p-ABZ were found to be linearly correlated to the free energy of activation for both fibrinogen and CPR cleavage. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that: (1) the Leu144-Gly150 loop and the FRS are both involved in the conformational transition linked to the binding of p-aminobenzamidine to the thrombin active site; (2) the extent of thrombin 's capacity to undergo conformational transitions in alpha-, zeta- and gamma T forms is positively correlated to the free energy of activation for hydrolysis of macromolecular substrates interacting with both the catalytic domain and the FRS.","answer":"[[\\"p-ABZ\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"zeta-thrombin\\"], [\\"p-aminobenzamidine\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"thrombin\\"], [\\"proflavin\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"alpha-thrombin\\"], [\\"p-aminobenzamidine\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"alpha-thrombin\\"], [\\"p-ABZ\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"alpha-thrombin\\"]]"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Effective treatment requires drugs that can simultaneously protect by reversible binding to the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and blocking cascades of seizure related brain damage, inflammation, neuronal degeneration as well as promoting induction of neuroregeneration. [-]-Huperzine A ([-]-Hup A), is a naturally occurring potent reversible AChE inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. It also has several neuroprotective effects including modification of beta-amyloid peptide, reduction of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and induction and regulation of nerve growth factor. Toxicities at higher doses restrict the neuroporotective ability of [-]-Hup A for treatment. The synthetic stereoisomer, [+]-Hup A, is less toxic due to poor AChE inhibition and is suitable for both pre-/post-exposure treatments of nerve agent toxicity. [+]-Hup A block the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizure in rats, reduce excitatory amino acid induced neurotoxicity and also prevent soman induced toxicity with minimum performance decrement. Unique combinations of two stereo-isomers of Hup A may provide an excellent pre/post-treatment drug for the nerve agent induced seizure/status epilepticus. We investigated a combination of [+]-Hup A with a small dose of [-]-Hup A ([+] and [-]-Hup A) against soman toxicity. Our data showed that pretreatment with a combination [+] and [-]-Hup A significantly increased the survival rate and reduced behavioral abnormalities after exposure to 1.2×LD50 soman compared to [+]-Hup A in guinea pigs. In addition, [+] and [-]-Hup A pretreatment inhibited the development of high power of EEG better than [+]-Hup A pretreatment alone. These data suggest that a combination of [+] and [-]-Hup A offers better protection than [+]-Hup A and serves as a potent medical countermeasure against lethal dose nerve agent toxicity in guinea pigs.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"[+] and [-]-Hup A\\", \\"N-methyl-d-aspartate\\", \\"NMDA\\", \\"Hup A\\", \\"amino acid\\", \\"[-]-Huperzine A\\", \\"[+]-Huperzine A\\", \\"soman\\", \\"[+]-Hup A\\", \\"[-]-Hup A\\", \\"[+] and [-]-Huperzine A\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"acetylcholinesterase\\", \\"AChE\\", \\"beta-amyloid peptide\\", \\"nerve growth factor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In the Barents Sea, the limited data on biological relevant indicators and their responses to various anthropogenic stressors have hindered the development of a consistent scientific basis for selecting indicator species and developing practical procedures for environmental monitoring. Accordingly, the main aim of the present study was to develop a common set of baseline values for contaminants and biomarkers in three species, and to identify their strengths and limitations in monitoring of the Barents Sea. Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), Icelandic scallop (Chlamys islandica) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were sampled from a north Norwegian fjord in March, June, September and December 2010. Digestive glands from the bivalve species and liver from Atlantic cod were analysed for biomarkers of oxidative stress (catalase [CAT], glutathione peroxidase [GPX], glutathione-S-transferase activities [GST], lipid peroxidation as thiobarbituric reactive substances [TBARS] and total oxyradical scavenging capacity [TOSC]), biotransformation (ethoxyresorufine-O-deethylase activity [EROD]) and general stress (lysosomal membrane stability [LMS]). Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals in the bivalves and PAH metabolites in fish bile were quantified. Finally, energy reserves (total lipids, proteins and carbohydrates) and electron transport system (ETS) activity in the digestive gland of the bivalves and liver of Atlantic cod provided background information for reproductive cycle and general physiological status of the organisms. Blue mussel and Icelandic scallop showed very similar trends in biological cycle, biomarker expression and seasonality. Biomarker baselines in Atlantic cod showed weaker seasonal variability. However, important biological events may have been undetected due to the large time intervals between sampling occasions. Physiological biomarkers such as energy reserves and ETS activity were recommended as complementary parameters to the commonly used stress biomarkers, as they provided valuable information on the physiological status of the studied organisms. Interpretation of the seasonality in oxidative stress biomarkers was in general difficult but TOSC and lipid peroxidation were preferred over the antioxidant enzyme activities. This study is the first reporting seasonal baseline in these three species in a sub-Arctic location. Overall, the Icelandic scallop was considered the most adequate organism for environmental monitoring in the Barents Sea due to the interpretability of the biomarker data as well as its abundance, ease to handle and wide distribution from the southern Barents Sea to Svalbard.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"glutathione\\", \\"O\\", \\"thiobarbituric\\", \\"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\\", \\"S\\", \\"PAHs\\", \\"PAH\\", \\"ethoxyresorufine\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Reactive microglia are found in increased numbers in aging brain and are prominently associated with lesions in such age-related degenerative conditions as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In vitro, stimulated microglia or microglial-like cells secrete neurotoxic materials and are generators of free radicals through their respiratory burst system. Agents that suppress microglial activation are therefore candidates for neuroprotection. We have developed quantitative in vitro assays for measuring neurotoxicity of microglia or other mononuclear phagocytes. Neuronal like SH-SY5Y cells are cultured in supernatants from activated cells of the human monocytic THP-1 line and their survival is followed. Respiratory burst is directly measured on the activated cells. We tested inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX) or the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways as possible neuroprotective agents. The COX pathway generates inflammatory prostaglandins, while the 5-LOX pathway generates inflammatory leukotrienes. We found that inhibitors of both these pathways suppressed neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. They included the COX-1 inhibitor indomethacin; the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398; the mixed COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor ibuprofen; the nitric oxide (NO) derivatives of indomethacin, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen; the 5-LOX inhibitor REV 5901; and the 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor MK-886. The FLAP inhibitor also reduced respiratory burst activity in a more potent manner than indomethacin. Combinations of COX and 5-LOX inhibitors were more effective than single inhibitors. The data suggest that both COX inhibitors and 5-LOX inhibitors may be neuroprotective in vivo by suppressing toxic actions of microglia/macrophages, and that combinations of the two might have greater therapeutic potential than single inhibitors of either class.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"NS-398\\", \\"MK-886\\", \\"prostaglandins\\", \\"indomethacin\\", \\"flurbiprofen\\", \\"ibuprofen\\", \\"nitric oxide\\", \\"leukotrienes\\", \\"REV 5901\\", \\"NO\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"COX-2\\", \\"5-lipoxygenase\\", \\"COX\\", \\"5-LOX activating protein\\", \\"Cyclooxygenase\\", \\"cyclooxygenase\\", \\"COX-1\\", \\"5-LOX\\", \\"FLAP\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We examined asymmetry of lumbopelvic movement timing during a clinical test of active hip abduction in back-healthy people who developed LBP symptoms during standing (Pain Developers; PDs) compared to back-healthy people who did not develop LBP symptoms during standing (Non Pain Developers, NPDs). Participants completed the hip abduction test while movement was recorded with a motion capture system. Difference in time between start of hip and lumbopelvic movement was calculated (startdiff). PDs moved the lumbopelvic region earlier during left hip abduction than right hip abduction. There was no difference between sides in NPDs. In PDs, the amount of asymmetry was related to average symptom intensity during standing. Asymmetric lumbopelvic movement patterns may be a risk factor for LBP development during prolonged standing.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"hip\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"movement\\", \\"understand\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"low back pain\\", \\"developed\\", \\"symptoms\\", \\"movement patterns\\", \\"risk factors\\", \\"hip abduction\\", \\"LBP\\", \\"risk factor\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"abduction\\", \\"abduction test\\", \\"calculated\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [\\"motion capture system\\"], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"people\\", \\"Participants\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"region\\", \\"lumbopelvic\\", \\"standing\\", \\"back\\", \\"asymmetry\\", \\"Asymmetry\\", \\"Asymmetric\\", \\"between\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

The specific regulatory interactions between these factors, many key upstream and downstream genes, and the enhancers that mediate all these interactions remain mostly uncharacterized. We perform p300 ChIP-seq to identify over 6, 600 candidate enhancers active in the dorsal cerebral wall of embryonic day 14. 5( E14. 5) mice. Over 95% of the peaks we measure are conserved to human. Eight of ten( 80%) candidates tested using mouse transgenesis drive activity in restricted laminar patterns within the neocortex. GREAT based computational analysis reveals highly significant correlation with genes expressed at E14. 5 in key areas for neocortex development, and allows the grouping of enhancers by known biological functions and pathways for further studies. We find that multiple genes are flanked by dozens of candidate enhancers each, including well-known key neocortical genes as well as suspected and novel genes. Nearly a quarter of our candidate enhancers are conserved well beyond mammals. Human and zebrafish regions orthologous to our candidate enhancers are shown to most often function in other aspects of central nervous system development. Finally, we find strong evidence that specific interspersed repeat families have contributed potentially key developmental enhancers via co-option. Our analysis expands the methodologies available for extracting the richness of information found in genome-wide functional maps.Introduction:Among all vertebrates, the developing central nervous system segments into a forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord[1]. The forebrain is further segmented into the telencephalon and diencephalon. In mammals, the dorsal portion of the telencephalon gives rise to the neocortex( isocortex). The mature neocortex is a complex six-layered structure unique to mammals[2],[3]. It has been associated with higher cognitive functions[4], and defects in this structure are the likely source for many neurologic and psychiatric diseases[5]. Early in development, this region consists of a layer of progenitor cells lining the ventricles called the ventricular zone( VZ). Progenitor cells of the VZ produce intermediate progenitor cells that migrate out of the VZ to form the subventricular and intermediate zones( SVZ-IZ); daughter cells from both areas migrate past the SVZ-IZ to form the laminar structure of the cortical plate( CP), in an inside out fashion[6],[7]( Figure 1A). While the anatomy, histology, and gene expression patterns of the developing neocortex and its progenitor populations have all been well studied, attention is only starting to focus on gene regulation during neocortex development[8]. The advent of chromatin immunoprecipitation and related capture technologies, coupled with deep sequencing( ChIP-seq) allows us to obtain whole genome maps of active enhancers through development, and beyond. The study of enhancers provides several advantages: First, it reveals a sizable layer of genomic susceptibility to disease that extends beyond protein coding sequence, and has remained almost invisible hitherto. Second, because enhancers integrate signals from upstream transcription factors and signaling pathways, enhancer maps can unravel the causality of gene expression and developmental processes. Finally, observing enhancer sequence and function change between humans and related species promises to provide additional insights into the evolution of our brain. Here, we produce an active enhancer map in the dorsal cerebral wall at E14. 5 using ChIP-seq to assay for the enhancer-associated co-activator protein p300. We proceed to validate multiple enhancers next to genes of particular interest to neocortical development. We also develop a series of computational analyses that demonstrate the riches of information exposed by this type of assay for studies of neocortex development and evolution. Our methodology can be combined with current research in other tissues to advance our understanding of the complex regulatory networks that underlie organ development.Discussion:In this study, we have identified the first genome-wide set of p300 bound regions specific to E14. 5 dorsal cerebral wall. We have shown using GREAT and by sampling candidates experimentally that the set we obtained is highly enriched in active enhancers for neocortex development. This set of candidate enhancers provides a rich source for studying neocortex development and evolution. Three major cell populations contribute critically to neocortex development at E14. 5( Figure 1A). By curating population specific gene expression data into a GREAT ontology, we show that enhancers serving all three major populations are enriched within our set. We also used other GREAT ontologies to subdivide the large enhancer mass into subsets that serve specific processes of interest in different dorsal cerebral wall populations at this stage, strongly suggesting that despite the heterogeneity of input material, numerous insights can be had into the different processes taking place in this developing tissue( Table 1). Key transcription factors( TFs) often bind directly( both proximally and distally) next to a large number of genes in their relevant context[11]. This allows us to utilize motif discovery to predict key TFs and TF dimers found in a large number of our active enhancers( Figure 3). In circuit design terminology this property is known as large “fan out”( in this case of regulatory interactions) from TF to target genes( via binding sites and enhancers). When we turn our point of view from regulators to regulated genes, we first looked for target genes with large “fan in”, namely genes in whose regulatory domains lie a larger than expected number of p300 peaks( Figure 4). The mammalian genome is known to contain multiple large gene deserts carrying numerous conserved and likely cis-regulatory sequences[34]. However, one cannot deduce from sequence patterns alone how many cis-regulatory regions are active simultaneously in any given functional context. Here we show that a number of genes carry dozens of p300 peaks in their regulatory domains during neocortex development, many more than would be expected by chance. It has been hypothesized that multiple seemingly-redundant enhancers co-exist in order to generate expression patterns that are robust to environmental variation[35],[36]. Multiple enhancers targeting the same gene also likely reduce the variability associated with stochastic gene regulation[37]. Finally, it is also possible that different enhancers target different cell populations during neocortex development. In focusing on the ten most heavily regulated genes( Table 2), we discover three well known genes in the context of neocortex development, and three additional genes already suspected of playing an important role because of their restricted expression pattern during neocortex development and correlations with neocortical-associated diseases. We also find two intriguing gene deserts, dense in p300 elements, that are flanked by two pairs of genes with no known role in neocortex development. In both cases, transcriptional evidence is not seen for other, possibly non-coding, transcripts within the gene deserts, and in both cases only one of the two flanking genes appears to be expressed in the neocortex( Figure 4). In both cases this gene is either a known transcription regulator( Mn1), or is suspected of being one( the coiled-coil Gse1 gene). Perhaps one of the most challenging questions to ask from enhancer data such as ours lies at the intersection of genomics and genetics. Namely, which enhancers form the “weak points” of the network, or in other words, which enhancers will cause a clear developmental defect when mutated? The Fezf2 E4 enhancer provides one such example in the context of the neocortex( Figure 7). The Fezf2 gene belongs to a small network of transcription factors that controls cell fate determination within the neocortex[38]. Scanning the p300 landscape around the other genes in this network we find a particularly compelling landscape around the Tbr1 gene, with a single peak proximal to this key target gene, and few others further away( including elt4 from Figure 2, over 50 kb upstream). At the center of the proximal peak lies a co-opted instance of AmnSine1. Strikingly, AmnSine1 overlapping p300 peaks are found next to several additional key genes for early neocortex development, suggesting that perhaps a subset of AmnSine1 co-option events were crucial in laying out the cortical projection network as we know it today[39]. Members of multiple interspersed repeat families have likely contributed important enhancers during genome evolution( Figure 6). This contribution has been previously noted based on the large intersection between conserved non-coding sequence and sequences from mobile element origins[30]. The functional roles of the co-opted loci, however, could not be easily deduced from sequence alone. By intersecting mobile elements with functional data, we are able to assign specific functions to subsets of loci. This allows us to highlight several poorly studied repeat families in the context of neocortex development, as well as shed new light on cases such as the MER121 family, which was previously studied in sequence[40], but can now be implicated in contributing to limb development( Figure 6). Interestingly, nearly half of AmnSine1 and MER121 human instances were very recently found to overlap open chromatin from 41 cell types, suggesting possible enhancer activity in multiple additional contexts[41]. Two of our tested enhancers – elt4 and elt7 – drive expression in the most superficial cells of the developing neocortex( Figure 2). These patterns match a domain of the expression and functional activity of Tbr1 and Bhlhb5, their nearby and likely respective target genes[42],[43]. The other six enhancers are active primarily in the CP and SVZ-IZ. In total, six of the eight positive enhancers drive expression largely within the domain of activity of the putative target gene[14],[44]. Two enhancers drive expression patterns that include a zone outside the detected expression regions of the putative target. These elements – elt1 and elt6 – drive expression in the CP and SVZ-IZ although their putative target genes( Eomes/Tbr2 and Id4) are expressed primarily in the SVZ-IZ and VZ. These elements may regulate a different nearby gene or their in vivo expression pattern may be modified by flanking regulatory sequence or epigenetic state not captured in our transgenic constructs. Interestingly, our validated enhancers mostly drive expression outside the VZ. Our statistical analysis suggests that our full set is strongly enriched near genes expressed predominantly in the VZ( Table 1). Moreover, of 40 enhancers showing expression in the VZ of the dorsal pallium at E11. 5[15], 26( 65%) are marked by p300 peaks in our E14. 5 set. Finally, as the large( but far from exhaustive) number of vignettes in our paper illustrates, the biggest challenge for the study of functional genomic data is twofold: First, to develop a set of approaches and tools to mine these datasets and their combinations for the almost staggering wealth of information they offer. Second, a broader challenge relates to the coming together of different disciplines of researchers, including functional genomicists, computational biologists, developmental biologists, geneticists, and more, so that the mining of this data is maximized.","answer":"Sequencing based technologies provide global snapshots of transcriptional regulation .

Clark et al., 2018) , image alignment (Antonakos et al., 2015) , optical flow (Zikic et al., 2010; Baker & Matthews, 2004; Rosman et al., 2011) ) are posed as nonlinear optimization problems.Before the resurgence of the machine learning era, the dominant family for solving such optimization problems 1 was numerical optimization, e.g, Gauss-Newton (GN).Recently, it was proposed that the GN steps, called descent directions, can be learned and represented as a cascade regression to solve non-linear least square problems (Xiong & De la Torre, 2013) .With the advent of deep learning, the aforementioned ideas were combined with learnable feature representations using deep convolutional neural networks for solving problems such as alignment and stereo (Trigeorgis et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2018) .In this paper, we first try to draw similarities between learning descent directions and the structure of the popular residual networks.Motivated by that, we further extend residual learning by adopting ideas from Newton's numerical optimization method, which exhibits faster convergence rate than Gauss-Newton based methods (both theoretically and empirically as we show in our experiments).ResNet (He et al., 2016) is among the most popular architectures for approximating non-linear functions through learning.The core component of ResNet is the residual block which can be seen as a linear difference equation.That is, the t th residual block is expressed as x t\`1 \\" x t\`C x t for input x t .By considering the residual block as a discretization of Euler ODEs (Haber et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018) , each residual block expresses a learnable, first order descent direction.We propose to accelerate the convergence (i.e., employ fewer residual blocks) in approximation of non-linear functions by introducing a novel residual block that exploits second-order information in analogy to Newton's method in non-linear optimization.Since the (second order) derivative is not analytically accessible, we rely on the idea of Xiong & De la Torre (2014) to learn the descent directions by exploiting second order information of the input.We build a deep model, called Newton-ResNet, that involves the proposed residual block.Newton-ResNet requires less residual blocks to achieve the same accuracy compared to original ResNet.This is depicted in Fig. 1 ; the contour 2 shows the loss landscape near the minimum of each method and indeed the proposed method requires fewer steps.Our contributions are as follows:• We first establish a conceptual link between residual blocks in deep networks and standard optimization techniques, such as Gauss-Newton.This motivates us to design a novel residual block that learns the descent directions with second order information (akin to Newton steps in nonlinear optimization).A deep network composed of the proposed residual blocks is coined as Newton-ResNet.• We show that Newton-ResNet can effectively approximate non-linear functions, by demonstrating that it requires less residual blocks and hence significantly less parameters to achieve the performance of the original ResNet.We experimentally verify our claim on four different datasets of images and speech in classification tasks.Additionally, we conduct experiments on image generation with Newton-ResNet-based GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014) .• We empirically demonstrate that Newton-ResNet is a good function approximator even in the absence of activation functions, where the corresponding ResNet performs poorly.In this work, we establish a link between the residual blocks of ResNet architectures and learning decent directions in solving non-linear least squares (e.g., each block can be considered as a decent direction).We exploit this link and we propose a novel residual block that uses second order interactions as reminiscent of Newton's numerical optimization method (i.e., learning Newton-like descent directions).Newton-type methods are likely to converge faster than first order methods (e.g., Gauss-Newton).We demonstrate that in the proposed architecture this translates to less residual blocks (i.e., less decent directions) in the network for achieving the same performance.We conduct validation experiments on image and audio classification with residual networks and verify our intuition.Furthermore, we illustrate that with our block it is possible to remove the non-linear activation functions and still achieve competitive performance.","answer":"We demonstrate how residual blocks can be viewed as Gauss-Newton steps;

Animal studies implicate the AP-1 ( activator protein-1 ) pro-inflammatory pathway as a promising target in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease . It is , however , unclear whether these observations apply to human atherosclerosis . Therefore we evaluated the profile of AP-1 activation through histological analysis and tested the potential benefit of AP-1 inhibition in a clinical trial . AP-1 activation was quantified by phospho-c-Jun nuclear translocation ( immunohistochemistry ) on a biobank of aortic wall samples from organ donors . The effect of AP-1 inhibition on vascular parameters was tested through a double blind placebo-controlled cross-over study of 28 days doxycycline or placebo in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease . Vascular function was assessed by brachial dilation as well as by plasma samples analysed for hs-CRP ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ) , IL-6 ( interleukin-6 ) , IL-8 , ICAM-1 ( intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ) , vWF ( von Willebrand factor ) , MCP-1 ( monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ) , PAI-1 ( plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ) and fibrinogen . Histological evaluation of human atherosclerosis showed minimal AP-1 activation in non-diseased arterial wall ( i.e . vessel wall without any signs of atherosclerotic disease ) . A gradual increase of AP-1 activation was found in non-progressive and progressive phases of atherosclerosis respectively ( P < 0.044 ) . No significant difference was found between progressive and vulnerable lesions . The expression of phospho-c-Jun diminished as the lesion stabilized ( P < 0.016 ) and does not significantly differ from the normal aortic wall ( P < 0.33 ) . Evaluation of the doxycycline intervention only revealed a borderline-significant reduction of circulating hs-CRP levels ( -0.51 μg/ml , P=0.05 ) and did not affect any of the other markers of systemic inflammation and vascular function .

Yet, it remains an open question whether the initial, positive results extrapolate to real-world scenarios of learning translations between low-resource language pairs. recentlypresented results suggesting that UBDI is challenged by some language pairs exhibiting very different morphosyntactic properties, as well as when the monolingual corpora are very different. In thispaper, we identify easy, hard, and impossible instances of GAN-based UBDI, and apply a simple test for discriminating between them. The hardcases exhibit instability, i.e. their success depends heavily on initialization. We set upa series of experiments to investigate these hard cases.Our contributions We introduce a distinction between easy, hard, and impossible alignment problems over pairs of word vector spaces and show that a simple linearity test can be used to tell these cases apart. We show thatthe impossible cases are caused not necessarily by linguistic differences, but rather by properties of the corpora and the embedding algorithms. We also showthat in the hard cases, the likelihood of being trapped in local minima depends heavily on the shape and density of the vector sets, but not on noise. Changes in thenumber of parameters, batch size, and learning rate do not alleviate the instability. Yet, using anunsupervised model selection method over N different initializations to select the best generators, leads to a 6.74% average error reduction over standard MUSE.Structure of the paper §2 presents MUSE BID6 , an approach to GAN-based UBDI. Here we alsodiscuss theoretical results from the GAN literature, relevant to our case, and show a relation to a common point set registration method. In §3, we usea test based on Procrustes Analysis to discriminate between easy, hard, and impossible cases, discussing its relation with tests of isomorphism and isospectrality. We then focuson the hard cases, where linear transformations provably exist, but GANs exhibit considerable instability. Through a seriesof experiments, we analyze what affects the instability of GAN-based UBDI. §4 presents ourunsupervised best-of-N model selection method for stabilizing GAN-based UBDI.Some pairs of word vector spaces are not alignable based on distributional information alone.For other pairs, GANs can be used to induce such an alignment, but the degree of instability is very susceptible to the shape and density of the word vector spaces, albeit not to noise.Instability is caused by local optima, but not remedied by standard techniques such as over-parameterization, increasing the batch size or decreasing the learning rate.We propose an unsupervised model selection criterion that enables stable learning, leading to a~7% error reduction over MUSE, and present further observations about the alignability of word vector distributions.","answer":"An empirical investigation of GAN-based alignment of word vector spaces, focusing on cases, where linear transformations provably exist, but training is unstable."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

A review of four prospective randomized trials including 253 patients with borderline tumors.Abstract 1:The optimal treatment of early-stage ovarian borderline tumors is controversial. Only a few randomized trials evaluating adjuvant treatment for this disease have been published. Between 1970 and 1988 four consecutive randomized trials, including patients with ovarian borderline tumors, were conducted at the Norwegian Radium Hospital. After surgery, 253 stage I-II borderline tumors without residual disease were randomly allocated to these protocols. The adjuvant treatment in the four trials consisted of [1] external irradiation (Ext) combined with intraperitoneal instillation of radioactive gold (198Au) or Ext alone, [2] intraperitoneal radioactive therapy followed by thio-TEPA or no further treatment, [3] thio-TEPA or no adjuvant therapy, and [4] cisplatin or 32P treatment. The patients were equally distributed according to prognostic variables within the eight randomization groups. The overall corrected and crude survival were 99 and 94%, respectively. In 83% of the patients a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy was performed. None of the patients with less extensive surgery relapsed. Adjuvant therapy did not seem to improve the overall corrected survival. On the contrary, toxicity was added with small bowel complications after radiation therapy, neurotoxicity after cisplatin treatment, and bone marrow toxicity after thio-TEPA therapy. It is concluded that stage I borderline tumors should not receive any adjuvant treatment.Title 2:Stage I borderline ovarian tumors.Abstract 2:nanTitle 3:Comparison of two fertility-sparing approaches for bilateral borderline ovarian tumours: a randomized controlled study.Abstract 3:During the childbearing years, the standard fertility-sparing treatment for bilateral borderline ovarian tumours (BOTs) is the unilateral oophorectomy plus controlateral cystectomy. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of two laparoscopic fertility-sparing surgical procedures for the treatment of bilateral BOTs on recurrence and fertility in young women who desire to conceive as soon as possible.                Thirty-two women affected by bilateral early-stage BOTs who desired to conceive were randomized to receive bilateral cystectomy (experimental group, n=15) or oophorectomy plus controlateral cystectomy (control group, n=17). At the first recurrence after childbearing completion, each patient was treated with non-conservative standard treatment. Recurrences and reproductive events were recorded.                After a follow-up period of 81 months (19 inter-quartile; 60-96 range), the cumulative pregnancy rate (CPR) (14/15 versus 9/17; P=0.003) and the cumulative probability of first pregnancy (P= 0.011) were significantly higher in the experimental than in control group. No significant (P=0.358) difference between groups was detected in cumulative probability of first recurrence.                The laparoscopic bilateral cystectomy followed by non-conservative treatment performed at the first recurrence after the childbearing completion is an effective surgical strategy for patients with bilateral early-stage BOTs who desire to conceive as soon as possible.Title 4:Stage III ovarian tumors of low malignant potential treated with cisplatin combination therapy (a Gynecologic Oncology Group study).Abstract 4:By serendipity we have had the opportunity to evaluate cis-platin-based chemotherapy in ovarian tumors of low malignant potential (LMP). Optimal (less than 1 cm residual disease) FIGO stage III ovarian carcinomas were randomly assigned to treatment with cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide with or without doxorubicin on a prospective Gynecologic Oncology Group Study. On review by the Gynecologic Oncology Group Pathology Committee, 32 of these cases were determined to represent low malignant potential tumors. Mean age of patients with these lesions was 48 years (range, 25-75 years). After initial cytoreduction, 19 patients had residual disease less than 1 cm and 13 had no residual. Twenty (62.5%) received cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide and 12 cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin chemotherapy; 75% of patients received six or more courses. Second-look surgery was done in 15 cases; only six were negative. However, with a median follow-up of 31.7 months (range, 1-75), only 1 patient has died; no cancer was found at autopsy. The remaining patients are alive without clinical evidence of disease at a median of 30 months. The need for adjunctive therapy in patients with advanced LMP tumors remains speculative.","answer":"We did not find evidence to support the use of any specific type of adjuvant therapy for borderline ovarian tumours. RCTs evaluating the benefit of adjuvant therapy with optimally dosed chemotherapy and newer targeted drugs are necessary, particularly for advanced borderline ovarian tumours. The low mortality from borderline ovarian tumours should make recurrence-free survival, time to recurrence and morbidity important end points in such trials.Bilateral cystectomy may be offered to women with bilateral borderline ovarian tumours diagnosed intra-operatively who are wishing to preserve their fertility. Similarly, women who had RCTs comparing radical with conservative surgery and comparing laparoscopy with laparotomy are needed."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

BACKGROUND: Portal hypertension is a clinically important consequence of cirrhosis that can lead to morbidities such as variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites. All of these outcomes carry high mortality rates. There have been several drugs created to assist with endoscopic therapy for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding. Recently, vapreotide has been studied in patients to evaluate its efficacy as treatment for acute variceal hemorrhage. Although no comparisons have been made between vapreotide and other somatostatin analogues, this drug has been shown to have efficacy in the control of acute variceal bleeding as well as reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding and death, especially when started prior to endoscopy. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the literature regarding the basic science and clinical efficacy of vapreotide in acute variceal bleeding. METHODS: We used a PubMed/Medline search in order to review the literature regarding the drug, vapreotide. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Vapreotide appears to have benefit in the control of acute variceal bleeding. It is easy to administer and has few side effects, which are minor. These findings endorse the need for future trials to evaluate vapreotide and its use in acute variceal hemorrhage, a morbidity among patients with cirrhosis.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of raloxifene on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal estrogen therapy or tamoxifen. METHODS: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomly assigned to raloxifene 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d or placebo. Outcomes included venous thromboembolism, cataracts, gallbladder disease, and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8). The excess event rate was 1.8 per 1,000 woman-years (95% CI -0.5-4.1), and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 (95% CI 100-582) over 3.3 years. Risk in the raloxifene group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years, but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter. Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.1), gallbladder disease (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.3), endometrial hyperplasia (RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.4-5.1), or endometrial cancer (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-2.7).

Multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (Mrp3; Abcc3) expression and activity are up-regulated in rat liver after in vivo repeated administration of ethynylestradiol (EE), a cholestatic synthetic estrogen, whereas multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) is down-regulated. This study was undertaken to determine whether Mrp3 induction results from a direct effect of EE, independent of accumulation of any endogenous common Mrp2/Mrp3 substrates resulting from cholestasis and the potential mediation of estrogen receptor (ER). In in vivo studies, male rats were given a single, noncholestatic dose of EE (5 mg/kg s.c.), and basal bile flow and the biliary excretion rate of bile salts and glutathione were measured 5 hours later. This treatment increased Mrp3 mRNA by 4-fold, detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction, despite the absence of cholestasis. Primary culture of rat hepatocytes incubated with EE (1-10 µM) for 5 hours exhibited a 3-fold increase in Mrp3 mRNA (10 µM), consistent with in vivo findings. The increase in Mrp3 mRNA by EE was prevented by actinomycin D, indicating transcriptional regulation. When hepatocytes were incubated with an ER antagonist [7α,17β-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-Pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (ICI182/780), 1 µM], in addition to EE, induction of Mrp3 mRNA was abolished, implicating ER as a key mediator. EE induced an increase in ER-α phosphorylation at 30 minutes and expression of c-Jun, a well-known ER target gene, at 60 minutes, as detected by Western blotting of nuclear extracts. These increases were prevented by ICI182/780. In summary, EE increased the expression of hepatic Mrp3 transcriptionally and independently of any cholestatic manifestation and required participation of an ER, most likely ER-α, through its phosphorylation.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"glutathione\\", \\"7u03b1,17u03b2-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-Pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol\\", \\"ethynylestradiol\\", \\"ICI182/780\\", \\"actinomycin D\\", \\"bile salts\\", \\"estrogen\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Using a forward genetic screen in Drosophila, we identified an E3 ligase, Ubr3, as an essential gene for auditory organ development. Ubr3 negatively regulates the mono-ubiquitination of non-muscle Myosin II, a protein associated with hearing loss in humans. The mono-ubiquitination of Myosin II promotes its physical interaction with Myosin VIIa, a protein responsible for Usher syndrome type IB. We show that ubr3 mutants phenocopy pathogenic variants of Myosin II and that Ubr3 interacts genetically and physically with three Usher syndrome proteins. The interactions between Myosin VIIa and Myosin IIa are conserved in the mammalian cochlea and in human retinal pigment epithelium cells. Our work reveals a novel mechanism that regulates protein complexes affected in two forms of syndromic deafness and suggests a molecular function for Myosin IIa in auditory organs.Introduction:Mechanosensory receptor cells have organelles derived from modified cilia or microvilli that contain protein complexes dedicated to the detection of, and adaptation to, mechanical force. Myosins, a family of eukaryotic actin-dependent motor proteins, play key roles in the assembly and function of mechanosensory protein complexes. In humans, pathogenic variants of six different myosin genes cause syndromic and non-syndromic deafness, and in many cases these myosins regulate either the assembly of the mechanotransduction apparatus of sensory hair cells, or constitute an integral part of the mechanotransduction complex itself( Petit and Richardson, 2009). For example, Myosin VIIa is a motor protein present in the tips of hair cell stereocilia where mechanotransduction occurs but it is also present in the cuticular plate that is important for the growth and stability of the stereociliary hair bundle( Ahmed et al., 2013). Pathogenic variants of MYO7A, the human homologue of myosin VIIa, can cause Usher syndrome, the leading cause of deaf-blindness( Bonnet and El-Amraoui, 2012), as well as the non-syndromic forms of deafness DFNA11( Liu et al., 1997) and DFNB2( Weil et al., 1997). Dominant mutations in MYH9, which encodes Myosin IIa, cause a number of syndromes which are now grouped as 'MYH9-related disorders'( Seri et al., 2003). Many MYH9-related disorder patients exhibit sensorineural deafness, and variants of MYH9 have also been reported in non-syndromic deafness DFNA17( Lalwani et al., 2000). However, the cellular basis of deafness in pathogenic variants of MYH9 is unclear as MYH9 is widely expressed within the inner ear( Etournay et al., 2010; Lalwani et al., 2000; Meyer Zum Gottesberge and Hansen, 2014; Mhatre et al., 2006). One approach to identifying new genes that regulate the development and function of mechanosensory organs is to exploit the power of Drosophila to conduct forward genetic screens. The auditory organ of Drosophila, Johnston’s organ, is localized in the second antennal segment. Johnston’s organ responds to near-field sound, gravity and wind flow transduced by motion of the third antennal segment( Boekhoff-Falk and Eberl, 2014; Gopfert and Robert, 2001; Kamikouchi et al., 2009; Yorozu et al., 2009). Although the organs and cells that mediate hearing in vertebrates and Drosophila are morphologically different, they share a striking evolutionary conservation of molecular and functional properties( Albert and Gopfert, 2015; Boekhoff-Falk and Eberl, 2014). The transcriptional cascades that control key aspects of chordotonal development in flies and hair cell development in vertebrates are regulated by conserved transcription factors, such as the Atonal/Atoh1 family proteins( Jarman et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2002). In addition, myosins such as Myosin VIIa, encoded by the gene crinkled in Drosophila, that function in mammalian hair cell mechanotransduction, are also conserved in Drosophila and are required for hearing( Todi et al., 2005b, 2008). Therefore, other molecular pathways and regulatory protein partners that function in hearing are also likely to be shared between insects and vertebrates. Here, we describe a novel ubiquitination pathway in Drosophila that functions to regulate the activity and physical interaction of two proteins implicated in deafness, Myosin II and Myosin VIIa. We identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubr3, from a collection of lethal mutations on the Drosophila X chromosome( Haelterman et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2014), whose loss of function causes morphological defects in the Johnston’s organ. Ubr3 negatively regulates the mono-ubiquitination of Myosin II and modulates Myosin II-Myosin VIIa interactions, which are required for normal development of Johnston’s organ. We show that ubr3 mutations are phenotypically similar to known pathogenic variants of Myosin II and that Ubr3 physically and genetically interacts with Drosophila homologues of the Usher syndrome proteins Protocadherin 15( Pcdh15) and Sans. We also show that Myosin IIa interacts with Myosin VIIa in the mouse cochlea and human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Our study reveals a novel conserved ubiquitination pathway in the auditory organs of flies and mammals.Discussion:Functional and molecular homologies between hearing organs of Drosophila and mammals have allowed the use of Drosophila to identify new genes involved in hearing( Boekhoff-Falk and Eberl, 2014; Senthilan et al., 2012). Using a forward genetic screen based on the phenotype associated with the loss of MyoVIIa( Todi et al., 2005a, 2008), we identified a set of proteins that affect ubiquitination and regulate the function of MyoVIIa. We discovered that ubr3 mutations increase the mono-ubiquitination of MyoII and the association of MyoII and MyoVIIa. This increased association causes defects consistent with a reduction of MyoVIIa function, namely the detachment of scolopidia from the cuticle of Johnston’s organ. Significantly, over-expressing either myosin in Johnston’s organ has no effect unless ubr3 is also mutated, suggesting that it is not the absolute levels of either myosin that are important for their function in Johnston’s organ, but rather the level of their ubiquitin-dependent interaction. Myosins are known to be regulated by phosphorylation through their regulatory light chain( Ito et al., 2004). However, far less is known about the post-translational regulation of myosin heavy chains. Ubiquitination as a regulator of myosin function has not yet been reported. When we knocked down UBR3 in human ARPE-19 cells, we observed defects similar to inhibition of MyoII by blebbistatin, suggesting that a certain threshold of mono-ubiquitination is sufficient to attenuate the activity of MyoII. Thus, it is possible that phosphorylation and ubiquitination function respectively as an 'accelerator' and 'brake' for MyoII activity. Our data suggests that ubiquitination of MyoII is regulated by multiple E3 ligases( Figure 7A–A’), in which Ubr3 negatively regulates the Cul1-SCF complex directly or indirectly. This complex probably regulates an E3 ligase that directly ubiquitinates MyoII. 10. 7554/eLife. 15258. 015Figure 7. A novel ubiquitination pathway regulates MyoII-MyoVIIa interactions in the auditory sensory organs of Drosophila and mammals.( A) In Drosophila, MyoVIIa and MyoII are present in the apical regions of scolopidia of Johnston’s organ and are enriched in the tips of the scolopale cells where they contact the cap cell. Ubiquitination of MyoII promotes its interaction with MyoVIIa, the precise level of which is crucial for anchoring the apical junction complexes of the scolopidia. It is possible that the motor activity of either myosin is necessary to transport the complex to the tips of the scolopale cell. Both MyoVIIa and MyoII likely bind to the actin bundles in the scolopale cells and regulate apical attachment of scolopidia. Two Drosophila homologues of Usher syndrome type I proteins, Cad99C( Pcdh15) and Sans, interact with MyoVIIa, Ubr3 and Cul1 in a protein complex. It is not clear whether Cad99C mediates attachment to the cap cells as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with another adhesion molecule.( A’) Ubr3 negatively regulates the level of Cul1 protein. Both Ubr3 and Cul1 inhibit ubiquitination of MyoII indirectly through a pathway involving a third unknown E3 ligase.( A’’) MyoVIIa, Cad99C, Sans, Ubr3 and Cul1 interact as a protein complex.( B) In mammalian hair cells, an USH1 protein complex which includes MyoVIIa, Sans, Harmonin and Cadherin-23 is present close to the stereocilia tips. We speculate that MyoII interacts with MyoVIIa, and that this interaction is promoted by ubiquitination of MyoII. The motor activity of MyoII or MyoVIIa may be required for transport of the MyoVIIa-MyoII-USH1 protein complex to the stereocilia tips. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 15258. 015 We were surprised to find that MyoII ubiquitination appears to be regulated by a series of E3 ligases including Ubr3 and Cul1. Either these E3 ligases function in a sequential order, or alternatively, function collaboratively( Metzger et al., 2013). A previous study showed that Fbx2, an F-box protein that binds Skp1 in SCF E3 ligase complex, is specifically expressed in mouse cochlea, and that Fbx2 deficient mice exhibit selective cochlear degeneration( Hartman et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2007). Our results argue that the SCF E3 ligase regulates auditory function through MyoIIa and MyoVIIa, two proteins associated with deafness and expressed in hair cells. In addition, multiple E3 ligases, including Ubr3 and a yet unknown E3 ligase that directly ubiquitinates MyoIIa, function in this pathway. It is interesting that Ubr3 and Cul1 can bind to a complex containing MyoVIIa, Cad99C and Sans in Drosophila S2 cells. It is possible that Ubr3, Cul1 and the unknown E3 ligase that mono-ubiquitinates MyoII all interact in a protein complex, and that the Usher proteins Cad99C or Sans may facilitate ubiquitination of MyoII or may be ubiquintinated themselves. It is currently unclear whether MyoII and MyoVIIa interact directly or indirectly as part of a protein complex in Johnston’s organ. Since both MyoII and MyoVIIa are localized in adjacent zones in the tips of scolopale cells in Johnston’s organ( Figure 7A), it is possible that either myosin is required for the subcellular transport or localization of the MyoVIIa – MyoII complex. The precise mechanical function performed by these two myosins in the scolopale cells of Johnston’s organ involves other homologues of Usher syndrome type I genes given that the morphological phenotype of ubr3 mutants is enhanced by loss of either Sans or Cad99C( Figure 7A, A’’). We have shown that homologues of three Usher syndrome genes interact together in Drosophila to cause a mechanical failure phenotype which appears to be orthologous to that seen in the mechanosensory hair cells of vertebrates( Figure 7B). Moreover, by revealing a physical interaction between MyoII and MyoVIIa in the hearing organs of insects and mammals and by recapitulating morphological defects in Johnston’s organ by overexpressing Drosophila versions of known pathogenic human MYH9 variants, our study offers a potential mechanism for the hearing deficits associated with MYH9-related disorders.","answer":"Over half of the world’s population has hearing loss by the age of 65 , and inherited forms of deafness are responsible for many of the hearing impairments in newborn children . Because the auditory organs that enable insects and mammals to hear work in similar ways , we have learnt a lot about genetic forms of deafness from identifying faulty genes in humans and mice , and studying their effects in model organisms . Sensory cells in the inner ear respond to sound by detecting vibrations in the air and converting them into electrical impulses . A family of motor proteins called myosins play key roles in this conversion process . Mutations in the gene that produces one of these proteins , called myosin VIIa , cause an inherited deaf-blind disorder called Usher syndrome . Mutations in the gene for another type of myosin protein , called myosin II , also cause disorders associated with hearing loss , but it is not clear how they produce such effects . Li et al . have used Drosophila fruit flies to explore the role of myosin proteins in hearing by looking for genes that prevent the insect's auditory organ from developing or working properly . The search identified one gene called E3 ubiquitin ligase ( ubr3 ) , which is required for the auditory organ to develop normally and had not previously been implicated in deafness . Mutating the ubr3 gene caused a defect similar to that seen for mutations in the gene that produces the fruit fly equivalent of myosin VIIa . Through genetic and biochemical studies , Li et al . found that in the fruit flies , myosin VIIa interacts with myosin II . This interaction is regulated by a chemical modification of myosin II that is controlled by ubr3 . Li et al . showed that the equivalent mammalian proteins display the same behaviour in the cells of mammals . Therefore , mutations that affect myosin II alter how the protein interacts with myosin VIIa , which explains why myosin II is associated with deafness in humans . In addition , Li et al . found that three other proteins that have been shown to cause Usher syndrome in humans have equivalents in flies and play a role in fly hearing . This will allow the Drosophila auditory organ to be further developed as a model system for future studies of deafness genes , and should provide insights into how specific genes are required for proper hearing in mammals ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: The first work in this area showed as proof-of-concept that phage encoding a GFP expression cassette and displaying a HER2specific scFv on all copies of pIII were internalized into breast tumor cells, resulting in GFP expression (Poul and Marks, 1999) . M13 or fd phage displaying either a targeting peptide or antibody fragment and tethered to chloramphenicol by a labile crosslinker  were more potent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus growth than high-concentration free chloramphenicol (Yacoby et al., 2006; Vaks and Benhar, 2011) . M13 phage loaded with doxorubicin and displaying a targeting peptide on pIII specifically killed prostate cancer cells in vitro (Ghosh et al., 2012a) . Tumorspecific peptide:pVIII fusion proteins selected from \\"landscape\\" phage (Romanov et al., 2001; Abbineni et al., 2010; Fagbohun et al., 2012 Fagbohun et al., , 2013 Lang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014a) were able to target and deliver siRNA-, paclitaxel-, and doxorubicincontaining liposomes to tumor cells (Jayanna et al., 2010a; Wang et al., 2010a Wang et al., ,b,c, 2014b Bedi et al., 2011 Bedi et al., , 2013 Bedi et al., , 2014 ; they were non-toxic and increased tumor remission rates in mouse models (Jayanna et al., 2010b; Wang et al., 2014b,c) . Using the B16-OVA tumor model, Eriksson et al. (2007) showed that phage displaying peptides and/or Fabs specific for tumor antigens delayed tumor growth and improved survival, owing in large part to activation of tumor-associated macrophages and recruitment of neutrophils to the tumor site (Eriksson et al., 2009) . Phage displaying an scFv against β-amyloid fibrils showed promise as a diagnostic (Frenkel and Solomon, 2002) and therapeutic (Solomon, 2008) reagent for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease due to the unanticipated ability of the phage to penetrate into brain tissue (Ksendzovsky et al., 2012) . Similarly, phage displaying an immunodominant peptide epitope derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein depleted pathogenic demyelinating antibodies in brain tissue in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis (Rakover et al., 2010) . The advantages of the filamentous phage in this context over traditional antibody-drug or protein-peptide conjugates are (i) its ability to carry very high amounts of drug or peptide, and (ii) its ability to access anatomical compartments that cannot generally be reached by systemic administration of a protein. Unlike most therapeutic biologics, the filamentous phage's production in bacteria complicates its use in humans in several ways. First and foremost, crude preparations of filamentous phage typically contain very high levels of contaminating LPS, in the range of ∼10 2 -10 4 endotoxin units (EU)/mL (Boratynski et al., 2004; Branston et al., 2015) , which have the potential to cause severe adverse reactions. LPS is not completely removed by polyethylene glycol precipitation or cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (Smith and Gingrich, 2005; Branston et al., 2015) , but its levels can be reduced dramatically using additional purification steps such as size exclusion chromatography (Boratynski et al., 2004; Zakharova et al., 2005) , polymyxin B chromatography (Grabowska et al., 2000) , and treatment with detergents such as Triton X-100 or Triton X-114 (Roehnisch et al., 2014; Branston et al., 2015) . These strategies routinely achieve endotoxin levels of <1 EU/mL as measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, well below the FDA limit for parenteral administration of 5 EU/kg body weight/dose, although concerns remain regarding the presence of residual virion-associated LPS which may be undetectable. A second and perhaps unavoidable consequence of the filamentous phage's bacterial production is inherent heterogeneity of particle size and the spectrum of host cellderived virion-associated and soluble contaminants, which may be cause for safety concerns and restrict its use to high-risk groups. Many types of bacteriophage and engineered phage variants, including filamentous phage, have been proposed for prophylactic use ex vivo in food safety, either in the production pipeline (reviewed in Dalmasso et al., 2014) or for detection of foodborne pathogens post-production (reviewed in Schmelcher and Loessner, 2014) . Filamentous phage displaying a tetracysteine tag on pIII were used to detect E. coli cells through staining with biarsenical dye . M13 phage functionalized with metallic silver were highly bactericidal against E. coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis . Biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (Nanduri et al., 2007) , piezoelectric transducers (Olsen et al., 2006) , linear dichroism (Pacheco-Gomez et al., 2012) , and magnetoelastic sensor technology (Lakshmanan et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009) were devised using filamentous phage displaying scFv or conjugated to whole IgG against E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Bacillus anthracis with limits of detection on the order of 10 2 -10 6 bacterial cells/mL. Proof of concept has been demonstrated for use of such phage-based biosensors to detect bacterial contamination of live produce (Li et al., 2010b) and eggs (Chai et al., 2012) . The filamentous phage particle is enclosed by a rod-like protein capsid, ∼1000 nm long and 5 nm wide, made up almost entirely of overlapping pVIII monomers, each of which lies ∼27 angstroms from its nearest neighbor and exposes two amine groups as well as at least three carboxyl groups (Henry et al., 2011) . The regularity of the phage pVIII lattice and its diversity of chemically addressable groups make it an ideal scaffold for bioconjugation (Figure 3) . The most commonly used approach is functionalization of amine groups with NHS esters (van Houten et al., 2006 (van Houten et al., , 2010 Yacoby et al., 2006) , although this can result in unwanted acylation of pIII and any displayed biomolecules. Carboxyl groups and tyrosine residues can also be functionalized using carbodiimide coupling and diazonium coupling, respectively (Li et al., 2010a) . Carrico et al. (2012) developed methods to specifically label pVIII N-termini without modification of exposed lysine residues through a two-step transamination-oxime formation reaction. Specific modification of phage coat proteins is even more easily accomplished using genetically modified phage displaying peptides (Ng et al., 2012) or enzymes (Chen et al., 2007; Hess et al., 2012) , but this can be cumbersome and is less general in application. For more than a decade, interest in the filamentous phage as a building block for nanomaterials has been growing because of its unique physicochemical properties, with emerging applications in magnetics, optics, and electronics. It has long been known that above a certain concentration threshold, phage can form ordered crystalline suspensions (Welsh et al., 1996) . Lee et al. (2002) engineered M13 phage to display a ZnS-binding peptide on pIII and showed that, in the presence of ZnS nanoparticles, they selfassemble into highly ordered film biomaterials that can be aligned using magnetic fields. Taking advantage of the ability to display substrate-specific peptides at known locations on the phage filament Hess et al., 2012) , this pioneering FIGURE 3 | Chemically addressable groups of the filamentous bacteriophage major coat protein lattice. The filamentous phage virion is made up of ∼2,500-4,000 overlapping copies of the 50-residue major coat protein, pVIII, arranged in a shingle-type lattice. Each monomer has an array of chemically addressable groups available for bioorthogonal conjugation, including two primary amine groups (shown in red), three carboxyl groups (show in blue) and two hydroxyl groups (show in green). The 12 N-terminal residues generally exposed to the immune system for antibody binding are in bold underline.

Using hybrid M13 phage displaying Co 3 O 4 -and gold-binding peptides on pVIII as a scaffold to assemble nanowires on polyelectrolyte multilayers, Nam et al. (2006) produced a thin, flexible lithium ion battery, which could be stamped onto platinum microband current collectors (Nam et al., 2008) . The electrochemical properties of such batteries were further improved through pIII-display of single-walled carbon nanotube-binding peptides (Lee et al., 2009) , offering an approach for sustainable production of nanostructured electrodes from poorly conductive starting materials. Phagebased nanomaterials have found applications in cancer imaging (Ghosh et al., 2012b; Yi et al., 2012) , photocatalytic water splitting (Nam et al., 2010a; Neltner et al., 2010) , light harvesting (Nam et al., 2010b; Chen et al., 2013) , photoresponsive technologies (Murugesan et al., 2013) , neural electrodes (Kim et al., 2014) , and piezoelectric energy generation (Murugesan et al., 2013) . Thus, the unique physicochemical properties of the phage, in combination with modular display of peptides and proteins with known binding specificity, have spawned wholly novel materials with diverse applications. It is worth noting that the unusual biophysical properties of the filamentous phage can also be exploited in the study of structures of other macromolecules. Magnetic alignment of high-concentration filamentous phage in solution can partially order DNA, RNA, proteins, and other biomolecules for measurement of dipolar coupling interactions (Hansen et al., 1998 (Hansen et al., , 2000 Dahlke Ojennus et al., 1999) in NMR spectroscopy. Because of their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes and ease of manipulation, various filamentous and non-filamentous bacteriophages have been used as models of experimental evolution (reviewed in Husimi, 1989; Wichman and Brown, 2010; Kawecki et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2013) . The filamentous phage has additional practical uses in protein engineering and directed protein evolution, due to its unique tolerance of genetic modifications that allow biomolecules to be displayed on the virion surface. First and foremost among these applications is in vitro affinity maturation of antibody fragments displayed on pIII. Libraries of variant Fabs and single chain antibodies can be generated via random or sitedirected mutagenesis and selected on the basis of improved or altered binding, roughly mimicking the somatic evolution strategy of the immune system (Marks et al., 1992; Bradbury et al., 2011) . However, other in vitro display systems, such as yeast display, have important advantages over the filamentous phage for affinity maturation (although each display technology has complementary strengths; Koide and Koide, 2012) , and regardless of the display method, selection of \\"improved\\" variants can be slow and cumbersome. Iterative methods have been developed to combine computationally designed mutations (Lippow et al., 2007) and circumvent the screening of combinatorial libraries, but these have had limited success to date. Recently, Esvelt et al. (2011) developed a novel strategy for directed evolution of filamentous phage-displayed proteins, called phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), which allows multiple rounds of evolution per day with little experimental intervention. The authors engineered M13 phage to encode an exogenous protein (the subject for directed evolution), whose functional activity triggers gene III expression from an accessory plasmid; variants of the exogenous protein arise by random mutagenesis during phage replication, the rate of which can be increased by inducible expression of error-prone DNA polymerases. By supplying limiting amounts of receptive E. coli cells to the engineered phage variants, Esvelt et al. (2011) elegantly linked phage infectivity and production of offspring with the presence of a desired protein phenotype. Carlson et al. (2014) later showed that PACE selection stringency could be modulated by providing small amounts of pIII independently of protein phenotype, and undesirable protein functions negatively selected by linking them to expression of a truncated pIII variant that impairs infectivity in a dominant negative fashion. PACE is currently limited to protein functions that can be linked in some way to the expression of a gene III reporter, such as protein-protein interaction, recombination, DNA or RNA binding, and enzymatic catalysis (Meyer and Ellington, 2011) . This approach represents a promising avenue for both basic research in molecular evolution (Dickinson et al., 2013) and synthetic biology, including antibody engineering. Filamentous bacteriophage have been recovered from diverse environmental sources, including soil (Murugaiyan et al., 2011) , coastal fresh water (Xue et al., 2012) , alpine lakes (Hofer and Sommaruga, 2001) and deep sea bacteria (Jian et al., 2012) , but not, perhaps surprisingly, the human gut (Kim et al., 2011) .Question: What were more potent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus growth than high-concentration free chloramphenicol?","answer":"M13 or fd phage displaying either a targeting peptide or antibody fragment and tethered to chloramphenicol by a labile crosslinker"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

However, the pressing need for the development of robust and inexpensive solutions to meet the demands of practical NLP systems encouraged many researchers to move away from extensive domain and linguistic knowledge and to embark instead upon knowledge-poor anaphora resolution strategies. Much of the earlier work in anaphora resolution heavily exploited domain and linguistic knowledge (Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Carbonell and Brown 1988), which was difficult both to represent and to process, and which required considerable human input.Citation Sentence:A number of proposals in the 1990s deliberately limited the extent to which they relied on domain and/or linguistic knowledge and reported promising results in knowledge-poor operational environments ( Dagan and Itai 1990 , 1991 ; Lappin and Leass 1994 ; Nasukawa 1994 ; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996 ; Williams , Harvey , and Preston 1996 ; Baldwin 1997 ; Mitkov 1996 , 1998b ) .Context after the citation:The drive toward knowledge-poor and robust approaches was further motivated by the emergence of cheaper and more reliable corpus-based NLP tools such as partof-speech taggers and shallow parsers, alongside the increasing availability of corpora and other NLP resources (e.g., ontologies).

We perform sphere rendering (see Sec 3) at different volume resolutions. Note that we use spheres for this discretization as they are view-invariant. In particular, this helps regularize out potential noise or irregularities in real-world scanned data (relative to synthetic training data), enabling robust performance on real-world scans. Note that our 3D multi-resolution filtering is different from classical 2D multi-resolution approaches, since the 3D filtering respects the distance in 3D.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Do players find it more enjoyable to win, than to play even matches? We have made a study of what a number of players expressed after playing against computer opponents of different kinds in an RTS game. There were two static computer opponents, one that was easily beaten, and one that was hard to beat, and three dynamic ones that adapted their strength to that of the player. One of these three latter ones intentionally drops its performance in the end of the game to make it easy for the player to win. Our results indicate that the players found it more enjoyable to play an even game against an opponent that adapts to the performance of the player, than playing against an opponent with static difficulty. The results also show that when the computer player that dropped its performance to let the player win was the least enjoyable opponent of them all. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Games are played by a wide variety of audiences. Different individuals will play with different gaming styles and employ different strategic approaches. This often involves interacting with nonplayer characters that are controlled by the game AI. From a developer's standpoint, it is important to design a game AI that is able to satisfy the variety of players that will interact with the game. Thus, an adaptive game AI that can scale the difficulty of the game according to the proficiency of the player has greater potential to customize a personalized and entertaining game experience compared to a static game AI. In particular, dynamic game difficulty scaling refers to the use of an adaptive game AI that performs game adaptations in real time during the game session. This paper presents two adaptive algorithms that use ideas from reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation to improve player satisfaction by scaling the difficulty of the game AI while the game is being played. The effects of varying the learning and mutation rates are examined and a general rule of thumb for the parameters is proposed. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated to be capable of matching its opponents in terms of mean scores and winning percentages. Both algorithms are able to generalize well to a variety of opponents. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Generally, the difficulty level of a therapeutic game is regulated manually by a therapist. However, home-based rehabilitation games require a technique for automatic difficulty adjustment. This paper proposes a personalized difficulty adjustment technique for a rehabilitation game that automatically regulates difficulty settings based on a patient's skills in real-time. To this end, ideas from reinforcement learning are used to dynamically adjust the difficulty of a game. We show that difficulty adjustment is a multiple-objective problem, in which some objectives might be evaluated at different periods. To address this problem, we propose and use Multiple-Periodic Reinforcement Learning (MPRL) that makes it possible to evaluate different objectives of difficulty adjustment in separate periods.

A game AI that is adaptive, therefore, can create varied gaming experiences for different playing styles and thus add interest and repeatability of play to a game. Such mechanisms have been studied with interest in recent years. For example, evolutionary algorithms by Togelius et al. BIB001 were used to create racing tracks that were popular with players. Hagelback and Johansson BIB002 in a study observed that players enjoy playing an evenly matched game against opponents who adapt to their styles. To this end, Tan, Tan, and Tay BIB003 developed an adaptive AI for games that promotes even play rather than beating opponents. Here, a dynamic computer controlled opponent adapts its behavior, according to its opponent's moves. This DDA technique uses adaptive AI in the game to adjust game behaviors and parameters in real time automatically in response to the skill of the player. It can keep the player engrossed for longer periods and enhance their experience. As mentioned, here, DDA is carried out in real time. The adaptive AI of the game requires being adept enough to make unforeseeable but rational judgments like human players but must not display the overtly thoughtless behavior. The AI also needs to be able to correctly assess its opponent in the beginning of the game itself and adjust its playing style to opponent's skill. This study proposed two adaptive algorithms, adaptive unichromosome controller (AUC) and the adaptive duochromosome controller (ADC) that utilized concepts from evolutionary computation and reinforcement learning BIB003 to adaptively play in real-time. Two metrics, winning percentage difference (|W-L| and D to be minimized, where W, L, and D are wins, losses, and draws) and mean score difference (|s1-s2| to be minimized and max(s1,s2), where s denotes scores of players 1 and 2), were used as indicators of entertainment value. First, the game is so designed that the AI has the capability to beat the player. Second, the game AI can make deliberate mistakes, termed as artificial stupidity; therefore, the players remain interested in the game. The training and adaptation of the AUC take place in real time when the game is in session. As its name suggests, AUC stores a single chromosome that maps to seven numbers, one corresponding to each behavior component. Each number indicates the probability of deploying a behavior component when a waypoint is crossed. The expected behavior mapped by this chromosome exemplifies a victory strategy. The chromosome tailors the proficiency of the opponent by mapping a behavior set which would be sufficient to beat him. The chromosome is initialized randomly at the beginning of every game. Whenever a waypoint is crossed, a set of rules updates the chromosome. The assumption here is that the complement of an expected victorious strategy is a losing one. The ADC and AUC are similar except that the former does not assume that the complement of an expected victorious strategy is a losing one. Instead, two sets of chromosomes are maintained, one winning and one losing chromosome, all through the game. The chromosomes are updated by different rules for wins and losses. These controllers were tested against static controllers of varied driving traits to simulate various styles of play like heuristic controllers, neural network controllers, reverse enabled controllers, predictive fast controllers, etc. The effects of changing the mutation and learning rate were studied for both controllers (algorithms). The pattern of the difference of scores was assessed and both achieved score differences of 4 or less in at least 70.22% of the games. Wins and losses were also well scattered across the sequence of games played consecutively. It was also seen that the AUC had a low memory footprint, and the ADC was capable of maintaining a lesser number of drawn games, which could keep the player interested. The final values of the chromosomes showed that the algorithms choose various combinations of behavior components to deal with different opponents. Both controllers were able to learn proper sets of behavior components for the various opponents by way of winning percentage and mean score. Also, both were able to generalize satisfactorily to different opponents. Sekhavat BIB004 suggested a personalized DDA method for a rehab game that manages difficulty settings automatically, based on a real-time patient's skills. Concepts of reinforcement learning were used as a DDA technique. It was shown that DDA has multiple objectives, in which objectives could be evaluated at different times. To solve this issue, it was proposed to use Multiple-Periodic Reinforcement Learning (MPRL) which enables the evaluation of various objectives of DDA in separate time periods. The experiments showed that MPRL performed better than available Multiple-Objective Reinforcement Learning methods in user satisfaction and enhancing the patient motor skills."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Here we present evidence that courtship memory in Drosophila relies on the recurrent circuit between mushroom body gamma( MBγ), M6 output, and aSP13 dopaminergic neurons. We demonstrate persistent neuronal activity of aSP13 neurons and show that it transiently potentiates synaptic transmission from MBγ>M6 neurons. M6 neurons in turn provide input to aSP13 neurons, prolonging potentiation of MBγ>M6 synapses over time periods that match short-term memory. These data support a model in which persistent aSP13 activity within a recurrent circuit lays the foundation for a short-term memory.Introduction:As animals pursue their goals, their behavioral decisions are shaped by memories that encompass a wide range of time scales: from fleeting working memories relevant to the task at hand, to short-term and long-term memories of contingencies learned hours, days, or even years in the past. Working memory is thought to reflect persistent activity generated within neural networks, including recurrent circuits( Wang, 2001). In contrast, short-term memory( STM) and long-term memory( LTM) involves changes in synaptic efficacy due to functional and structural modification of synaptic connections( Kandel, 2001). However, the neural circuit mechanisms involved in the formation, persistence and transitions between these distinct forms of memory are not fully known. A robust form of memory in Drosophila is courtship memory, which can last from minutes to days, depending on the duration and intensity of training( Siegel and Hall, 1979; McBride et al., 1999). Naïve Drosophila males eagerly court both virgin females, which are generally receptive, and mated females, which are not( Manning, 1967; Wolfner, 2003). However, upon rejection by mated females, they become subsequently less likely to court other mated females( Tompkins, 1984). This selective suppression of courtship towards mated females, called courtship conditioning, can be attributed to the enhanced sensitivity of experienced males to an inhibitory male pheromone deposited on the female during mating, cis-vaccenyl acetate( cVA)( Keleman et al., 2012). Olfactory memory in insects relies on the function of a central brain structure called the mushroom body( MB)( de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994; Heisenberg et al., 1985). The principal MB cells, the cholinergic Kenyon cells( KCs)( Barnstedt et al., 2016), receive input from sensory pathways in the dendritic calyx region and from dopaminergic neurons( DANs) in the axonal lobes of the MB. These MB lobes are compartmentalized, with each compartment innervated by specific classes of DANs and MB output neurons( MBONs)( Aso et al., 2014a; Mao and Davis, 2009). MBONs receive input from both KCs and DANs( Takemura et al., 2017). We previously established that short-term courtship conditioning is mediated by the aSP13 class of DANs( also known as the PAM-γ5 neurons,[Aso et al., 2014a]), which innervate the MBγ5 compartment. The activity of aSP13 neurons is essential for courtship conditioning in experienced males and sufficient to induce conditioning in naïve males( Keleman et al., 2012). Here we demonstrate that courtship memory also requires the corresponding MBγ KCs and the MBγ5 MBONs, the glutamatergic M6 neurons( also known as MBON-γ5β’2a neurons[Aso et al., 2014a]). Furthermore, we present evidence that MBγ, M6, and aSP13 neurons form a recurrent circuit and that persistent activity of the aSP13 neurons mediates plasticity at the MBγ to M6 synapses that can last from minutes to hours. Consistent with this model, M6 activity is required not only for memory readout but also, like aSP13, for memory formation. These data support a model in which persistent aSP13 activity within the MBγ>M6>aSP13 recurrent circuit lays the foundation for short-term courtship memory.Discussion:In this study we have identified and characterized a tripartite MBγ>M6>aSP13 recurrent circuit that is essential for courtship memory in Drosophila. Our behavioral and physiological data suggest the following model for the function of this feedback loop in short-term courtship memory. When a naïve male courts a mated female, the aSP13 and MBγ neurons may both be activated, perhaps in response to behavioral rejection and olfactory stimuli presented by the female, respectively. Dopamine released by aSP13 neurons potentiates transmission from MBγ to M6 neurons, which in turn provide a recurrent excitatory glutamatergic input back onto aSP13 neurons. Upon activation by M6, aSP13 activity persists for several minutes, providing a short time window during which continued MBγ activity can further drive M6 and aSP13. Thus sustained, aSP13 activity can lead to a longer-lasting accumulation of dopamine in the γ5 compartment, facilitating MBγ>M6 neurotransmission for up to 2–3 hr. The timescales for these physiological processes in ex vivo brain preparations broadly match the dynamics of courtship training and short-term memory formation. In our standard training paradigm, the male typically courts the female over several minutes, during which he performs a series of courtship bouts, each lasting for several seconds. As a result, a behavioral memory forms that lasts for several hours( Keleman et al., 2012). Memory formation during training requires both M6 and aSP13, consistent with the notion that it reflects activation of the recurrent circuit( Figure 4 and[Keleman et al., 2012]). Memory readout requires M6 but not aSP13( Figure 4 and[Keleman et al., 2012]), and so evidently does not involve the recurrent circuit. We infer that M6 suppresses courtship through other, aSP13-independent, pathways, and that its ability to do so is independent of experience. The consequence of training is to provide MBγ neurons with access to this M6-dependent courtship suppression pathway( Figure 1). Two important open questions are, first, what mechanism underlies the persistent calcium response in aSP13, and second, how does potentiation of MBγ>M6 synapses result in enhanced sensitivity to cVA, the hallmark of courtship memory( Keleman et al., 2012). The persistent response in aSP13 is evidently not an intrinsic property of aSP13, as it is not induced when aSP13 neurons themselves are activated. This observation would also likely exclude reciprocal excitation between aSP13 and other DANs( Plaçais et al., 2012). Persistent aSP13 activity is induced in response to transient M6 activation, and is not associated with any persistent activity of M6 neurons themselves. Thus, it is also unlikely to involve feedback from aSP13 and M6, although aSP13 >M6 synapses likely do exist( Eichler et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2007). One possibility is that aSP13 persistence reflects unusually prolonged activation of the glutamatergic M6 >aSP13 synapses, or perhaps lies within interposed but still unidentified circuit elements. Given that M6 neurons activate a courtship suppression pathway, the potentiation of MBγ>M6 neurotransmission may explain why MBγ activation suppresses courtship in trained but not naïve flies. But MBγ neurons likely do not specifically respond to cVA( Caron et al., 2013; Gruntman and Turner, 2013), so this change alone cannot account for the enhanced sensitivity of trained flies to cVA. A small and variable subset of MB γneurons do receive input from the olfactory pathway that processes cVA, but cVA is not required during training( Keleman et al., 2012) and it is difficult to envision any other mechanism by which aSP13-dependent plasticity could be specifically restricted to the cVA-responsive MBγ neurons. It is formally possible that, despite the broad potentiation of MBγ output synapses upon training, it is only the contribution of the cVA-responsive MBγ neurons that drives courtship suppression when the male subsequently encounters as mated female. Alternatively, it has been suggested that M6 neurons encode a generic aversive signal( Aso et al., 2014b), and so specificity to cVA might instead arise in downstream circuits that selectively integrate M6 output with the innate cVA-processing pathway from the lateral horn. In this regard, it is interesting to note that other MBONs have been implicated in courtship learning( Montague and Baker, 2016) or general aversion( Aso et al., 2014b), but M6 is the only MBON common to both. Late activation of the same aSP13 neurons in the time window of 8–10 hr after training is both necessary and sufficient to consolidate STM to LTM( Krüttner et al., 2015). Thus, in the time window when STM would otherwise decay( Keleman et al., 2007), reactivation of the same MBγ>M6>aSP13 recurrent circuit may instead consolidate it into LTM. The mechanism by which aSP13 neurons are reactivated is unknown, but is evidently dependent upon their activation within the MBγ>M6>aSP13 recurrent circuit during training. It will be interesting to find out how this late aSP13 reactivation mechanism might relate to the mechanism that underlies persistent aSP13 activity during training. In summary, our data suggest that a brief persistent activity of aSP13 neurons represents a neural correlate of courtship working memory, while the prolonged potentiation of MBγ>M6 synapses corresponds to STM. We propose that persistent activity of the dopaminergic neurons in the MBγ>M6>aSP13 feedback loop lays the foundation for formation of short-term courtship memory in Drosophila, and that later reactivation of the same recurrent circuit consolidates STM into LTM. Thus, in contrast to the prevailing view of memory progression in the Drosophila MB that distinct memory phases are located in different compartments or lobes( Aso and Rubin, 2016; Davis, 2011; Pascual and Préat, 2001), our data suggest that in the context of courtship conditioning, working memory, STM, and LTM all reside in the same γ5 compartment. Our conclusions do not preclude however, the involvement of other MB neurons in courtship memory( Montague and Baker, 2016) as it is conceivable that modulation, potentially of the opposite sign, of the appetitive memory pathways could be critical for courtship learning( Perisse et al., 2016). We therefore envision that distinct courtship memory types are not located in distinct circuits, but rather mediated by distinct processes within a common circuit. Encoding distinct memory phases within a common circuit may be an efficient mechanism for encoding memories for which the behavioral consequence is largely independent of timing and context( Fusi et al., 2005).","answer":"Memories help to shape behavior , and can last from a few seconds to an entire lifetime .

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Time synchronization plays a key role in the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Time synchronization is realized by those messages that are time-stamped. But there are several delay times during transmission after time stamping. Most of them are uncertain and contribute directly to synchronization error. The uncertainties include send time, channel access time, transmission time, and receive time. In addition to the uncertainties, clock drift is also a main source of time synchronization error. In this paper, we present a time synchronization protocol that can be applied in the multi-hop WSNs. The proposed protocol estimates the clock drift between two nodes to keep them synchronized for duration after once synchronizing. It uses lower communication overhead and establishes more robust synchronization situations for all nodes in the network. By periodical re-synchronization, the un-synchronization conditions such as nodes failures or topology change can be easily overcome. We implement our protocol in the Berkeley MICAz platform. The experimenting scenarios are 5-node and 18-node multi-hop topologies, and the re-synchronization periods are 30-second and 300-second. The experiment results show that the average synchronization errors of all nodes run with our protocol are ranged within several micro-seconds which are better than the previous protocol. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Energy consumption remains as a major obstacle for full deployment and exploitation of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology nowadays. This paper presents the design and implementation of an energy-aware sensor node, which can help in constructing energy-efficient WSNs. An energy-efficient strategy, which aims at minimizing energy consumption from both the sensor node level and the network level in a WSN, is proposed. To minimize the communication energy consumption of the sensor node, the distance between the transmitter and the receiver is estimated before available transmission, and then, the lowest transmission power needed to transmit the measurement data is calculated and determined. The sensor nodes are also set to sleep mode between two consecutive measurements for energy saving in normal operating conditions. Furthermore, energy saving can be achieved by estimating the energy consumption within the whole network under different network configurations and then by choosing the most energy-efficient one.Literature Review:","answer":"Ratio-based time Synchronization Protocol (RSP) BIB002 is a tree-based structure and all the nodes in the network get synced with the root of the tree. However, the tree is formed during synchronization operation like BIB001 . The main idea is that the root node sends two messages continuously, and nodes in the broadcast range of the root node receive the two messages and update their clock value according to BIB003 . RSP believes that, due to lack of strong computational resources on the sensor nodes, a short period of resynchronization affects the accuracy because of the numbers after the decimal point. On the other hand, long period of resynchronization affects the accuracy due to clock drift. Therefore, it requires a threshold to update the clock value. If the value of 3 − 1 is more than the threshold, it uses previous data point recorded in the memory of the node (in which 3 − 2 is more than threshold ) to apply in (6)"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A total of 31 homozygous deletions and 36 point alterations were identified. Point mutations were scattered along the coding sequence and included 15 nonsense, 15 frameshift, three splice site, two missense and one editing mutations. Mutations were retrieved in most rhabdoid tumors, whatever their sites of occurrence, indicating the common pathogenetic origin of these tumors. Recurrent hSNF5/INI1 alterations were also observed in choroid plexus carcinomas and in a subset of central primitive neuroectodermal tumors (cPNETs) and medulloblastomas. In contrast, hSNF5/INI1 point mutations were not detected in breast cancers, Wilms tumors, gliomas, ependymomas, sarcomas and other tumor types, even though most analyzed cases harbored loss of heterozygosity at 22q11. 2 loci. These results suggest that rhabdoid tumors, choroid plexus carcinomas and a subset of medulloblastomas and cPNETs share common pathways of oncogenesis related to hSNF5/INI1 alteration and that hSNF5/INI1 mutations define a genetically homogeneous family of highly aggressive cancers mainly occurring in young children and frequently, but not always, exhibiting a rhabdoid phenotype","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"rhabdoid tumors\\", \\"neuroectodermal tumors\\", \\"gliomas\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"malignant rhabdoid tumors\\", \\"cancer\\", \\"ependymomas\\", \\"cancers\\", \\"choroid plexus carcinomas\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"sarcomas\\", \\"medulloblastomas\\", \\"breast cancers\\", \\"rhabdoid\\", \\"Wilms tumors\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Three sputum specimens of all suspected cases were collected and sent for smear microscopy and culture. RESULTS: Adjusted prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 34 per 100,000 for adults in Shandong in 2010. Compared to the 2000 survey, TB prevalence has declined by 80%. 53% of bacteriologically confirmed cases did not present persistent cough. The yield of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 47% by symptom screening and 95% by CXRAY. Over 50% of TB cases were among over 65’s. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was significantly reduced compared with 2000. The survey raised challenges to identify TB cases without clear symptoms. Text: China, with an estimated prevalence of all TB cases of 108 per 100,000 in 2010, has the second highest TB burden in the world, accounting for 13% of all cases worldwide [1] . The World Health organization (WHO) estimated that China had reached the targets of 85% treatment success by 1993 and 70% case detection rate by 2005 [2] . National TB prevalence surveys were conducted in China in 1979 China in , 1990 China in , 2000 , and 2010 [4] . Survey results provide more accurate estimates for TB prevalence rates than the WHO estimates and can be used to assess the likelihood of China achieving global targets for TB prevalence. Shandong province has a population of 94 million. It is a relatively developed province with a per capita GDP 1.6 times of the national average in 2010 [5] . The prevalence rate of TB in Shandong was lower compared with the average rate of China in 2000 [3] . Population representative samples were drawn in Shandong in the surveys of 2000 and 2010 using similar methods. The study aimed to estimate the TB prevalence in Shandong based on the 2010 survey, and compare results of the two cross sectional surveys. The target population of the TB prevalence survey was residents of 15 years old or above who had lived in the selected clusters for more than 6 months. A population based, cross-sectional survey was conducted using multistage random cluster sampling method. The survey employed the same sampling methods as the China national survey in 2010, which was similar to the sampling methods used in 2000 [6] . The design of the surveys was in accordance with WHO recommendations [7] . The design effect factor due to cluster sampling was estimated at 1.28 [8] . A sample size of 52500 adults (≧15 years old), in 35 clusters, was calculated based on detecting a change of 20% in prevalence rate of TB smear positive cases compared with the rate of the 2000 survey (95 per 100,000), with a probability greater than 95% and 95% power, accounting for 90% response rate of participants [9] . A stratified multi stage random sampling was used to select the 35 clusters within 17 prefectures in Shandong province. The number of clusters was randomly allocated in proportion to the provincial population at the prefectural, county/district and township levels. A cluster was defined as a community (a village in the rural area or a resident community in an urban area) with a population of 1250 to 1750 adults (i.e., those of 15 years or older). If the community contained less than 1250 adult residents, the neighboring community to the north was annexed. If the community or combined communities containing more than 1750 adults, we randomly selected households and then included all adults in the household for the survey until the total number of selected adults reached 1750. Military barracks and prisons  located in the cluster were excluded [7] . The survey was conducted from March to June 2010 by survey teams consisting of clinicians, public health doctors, radiologists, laboratory technicians and nurses. Local media was used to promote awareness of the survey. Community workers conducted a house-to-house census to update the database of residents, inform survey participants and obtain informed consent. The study did not involve children under 15 years old. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants of 16 years old or above. While from those of 15 years old, written informed consents were obtained from their parents or guardians. All documents were properly stored in the Shandong Chest Hospital. Ethical approvals for the study and consent procedures were obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Shandong Chest Hospital (NIH register numberIRB00006010). Those who agreed to participate in the survey were invited to the county TB dispensary, where they completed a consultation with a trained clinical TB doctor regarding any symptoms suggestive of TB, such as persistent cough (lasting two weeks or longer), haemoptysis, weight loss and fever. All participants had a chest X-ray (CXRAY) taken that then were reviewed by a panel of radiologists. Those with symptoms or CXRAY films suggestive of TB were classified as suspected TB cases. All suspected cases were asked to produce three sputum samples, one at the time of consultation, another at night and the third in the early morning of the following day. Identified suspects completed an additional questionnaire regarding their social-economic situation, smoking status, and the presence of TB related symptoms in the preceding six months (cough, fever, weight loss, chest pain and haemoptysis). Sputum smears were conducted in local TB dispensaries. All sputum samples were cultured using the Löwenstein-Jensen medium in the provincial laboratory within 24 hours using cold chain transportation. Samples were excluded from TB when non-tuberculosis bacilli were identified from the culture. All sputum smear and culture were conducted strictly according the national TB laboratory external quality control measure, which is in consistent with the WHO TB prevalence survey guideline [7] . TB classification was made according to the China national TB guideline [10] . A positive smear had at least one acid fast bacillus identified during examination of at least 100 fields. Participants with positive sputum smear specimens were classified as sputum positive cases. Those with positive smear or culture sputum specimens were classified as sputum bacteriologically confirmed cases. Those being culture negative with abnormal CXRAY suggestive of TB and having been ruled out from other diseases by clinicians and radiologists were classified as CXRAY suggestive bacteriologically negative cases. Due to resource limitations the recommendation of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents to confirm the diagnosis of negative TB cases was not applied in this survey [11] . Newly diagnosed cases were distinguished from previously diagnosed cases through checks during the interviews and against the TB registration system. Initial diagnosis was made by a group of local clinicians and radiologists. Subsequently, samples and CXRAY films of all suspected and confirmed cases were re-assessed by a group of senior clinicians and radiologists at provincial and national levels. CXRAY films of 100% of those scored as abnormal and 10% random sampling of those scored as normal were transferred for independent reading. The provincial laboratory team randomly examined one slide from the three samples of sputum positive cases, all three samples of CXRAY suggestive TB cases, and randomly selected 10% of the non-TB cases. Prevalence estimates of sputum positive, bacteriologically confirmed and all TB cases were calculated. In all analyses, population weightings were employed to adjust for the stratified multi-stage sampling design effect [8] . The survey results in 2010 and 2000 were standardized against the age structures of China's census population in 2010. The 2000 TB prevalence survey included all age groups [12] . The WHO recommended method was used to enable comparison between the two surveys that prevalence rates of child TB were assumed to reduce to the same extent as adult TB from 2000 to 2010 [13] . Subgroup analysis in gender, age groups and urban/rural residence were conducted. Case identification rate was calculated as the number of cases identified by a screening method over all suspected cases found by the method. Yields of the symptom consultation and CXRAY were calculated as a proportion of the total number of bacteriologically confirmed cases. The survey selected 17 urban clusters and 18 rural clusters. It covered a total population of 89,093, of which 56,671 were eligible for the survey (Figure 1 ). The response rate ranged from 95% to 97% in different clusters. 54,279 participants attended clinical consultation and were examined by CXRAY. Among them, 47% were males. The average age was 46 years with 14% of 65 years and older. A total of 572 suspected TB cases were found. Of these, 264 (46%) were identified based on CXRAY abnormalities, 228 (40%) were based on persistent cough, 80 (14%) were based on both. The survey diagnosed 172 new cases, including 19 new bacteriologically confirmed cases (including 11 sputum and culture positive cases, and 8 sputum negative but culture positive cases) and 153 CXRAY suggestive bacteriologically negative cases. The survey also identified 11 existing cases registered on the national TB program. In addition, the survey found four cases with culture positive non-tuberculosis bacilli, and excluded them from TB patients. All participants of the survey were first screened by symptoms and CXRAY. Those who had symptoms of consistent cough or haemoptysis, or CXRAY abnormalities were then screened by smear and culture. Case identification rates of new bacteriologically confirmed cases from the suspected cases were significantly higher with CXRAY as a primary tool (Figure 1 , 3.8%, P = 0.012) and further increased by both symptom screen of persistent cough and CXRAY (10%, P < 0.001) compared with symptom screen alone (0.4%). The same pattern of case identification rate was observed in the sputum positive cases (7.5%, 1.9% and 0% respectively). The proportion reporting persistent cough was not significantly higher among bacteriologically confirmed cases compared with other suspects (P = 0.565). The symptom consultation alone identified 308 suspects, including 6 (1.9%) sputum smear positive TB and 9 (2.9%) bacteriologically confirmed TB. Among the 344 suspects with CXRAY abnormalities, 11 (3.2%) had sputum positive TB and 18 (5.2%) had bacteriologically confirmed TB. The yield of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 47.4% by screening consultation and 94.7% by CXRAY. In the population of over 65 years old, symptom consultation and the CXRAY identified 174 and 182 suspected cases respectively, yielding5 (2.9%) and 9 (4.9%) of bacteriologically confirmed cases. Yields of bacteriologically confirmed cases were 55.6% by symptom consultation and 100% by CXRAY among over 65's. Of the 512 suspected cases that completed the additional questionnaire, 42% were farmers and 31% were current smokers (Table 1) . Per capita household income of bacteriologically confirmed cases was less than 50% of that of the non-TB cases (P < 0.05). Though smoking rate was higher among TB cases compared with non-TB cases, no significant differences were found (P > 0.05). Of the ten bacteriologically confirmed cases not presenting with persistent cough at the prevalence survey, one coughed for two days, one had chest pain, and the other eight had no symptoms of TB in the last six months. The crude prevalence rate in Shandong in 2010 of sputum positive cases was 22.1 (95% CI: 9.6-34.6), bacteriologically confirmed cases was 36.8 (95% CI: 17.8-55.8), and all cases were 337.1 (95% CI: 254.1-420.0) per 100,000 in adult population ( Table 2 ). The adjusted prevalence rates of the whole population in Shandong were17.8 (95% CI: 8.3-17.5), 27.8 (95% CI: 14.8-28.0) and 239.4 (95% CI: 179.9-298.9) per 100,000 in 2010. A remarkable decline of 82.0%, 80.2% and 31.4% was observed in TB prevalence rates of sputum positive, bacteriologically confirmed, and all cases, respectively, compared to the adjusted rates in 2000 [12] . Large declines were observed in males between 40 and 65 years old, and in females over 60 years old ( Figure 2) . The adjusted prevalence rates in the adult population were 21.4 (95% CI: 10.0-32.8), 33.5 (95% CI: 17.8-49.2) and 285.8 (95% CI: 254.2-356.4) for sputum positive cases, bacteriologically confirmed cases and all cases, respectively. Significant differences regarding adjusted TB prevalence rates were observed between males and females, over 65's and 15 to 64 years old, in rural and urban areas ( Table 2 , P < 0.001). The male to female ratios were 5.5 in sputum positive cases and 2.8 in bacteriologically confirmed cases, while the ratios climbed to 6.0 and 4.1, respectively, among those over 65 years. The majority of TB patients, 54.5% of sputum positive cases and 47.3% of bacteriologically confirmed cases, were from people 65 years or older. The ratio between over 65's and 15 to 64 years old was 8.4 in sputum positive cases and 5.9 in bacteriologically confirmed cases. The ratio between rural and urban areas was 2.7 in sputum positive cases and 4.8 in bacteriologically confirmed cases. The most striking finding was that a large proportion of TB patients did not present consistent cough. Passive case finding is the routine practice in developing countries where sputum microscopy is performed to identify TB cases among people with persistent cough. A large proportion of TB cases may be missed using this method as 53% of bacteriologically confirmed cases and 45% sputum positive cases in this study had no persistent cough but were identified through abnormal CXRAY. Nearly half of bacteriologically confirmed cases reported no symptoms in the last six months. This finding, although initially surprising, is consistent with reports from Vietnam (47% of bacteriologically confirmed cases not presenting persistent cough) [14] , Myanmar (38%) and Ethiopia (48%) [13] .Question: Who was excluded from the study?","answer":"Military barracks and prisons"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

The aim of this study was to address the role of pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules in diabetic retinopathy in the aqueous humor of the eye. Aqueous humor was collected at cataract surgery from 19 diabetic patients and from 13 age- and sex-matched normoglycemic controls. Levels of pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenic inhibitor pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) were determined. Angiogenic activity of the aqueous humor was quantified by measuring its effect on the migration of capillary endothelial cells. In the aqueous fluid, VEGF levels were increased in diabetics (mean values: 501 vs. 367 pg/ml; p = 0.05), compared to controls. PEDF was found to be decreased in diabetics (mean values: 2080 vs. 5780 ng/ml; p = 0.04) compared to controls. In seven diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy, the most profound finding was a significant decrease of the PEDF level (mean value: 237 ng/ml), whereas VEGF levels were comparable to diabetic patients without proliferation (mean value: 3153; p = 0.003). Angiogenic activity in samples of patients from the control group was generally inhibitory due to PEDF, and inhibition was blocked by neutralizing antibodies to PEDF. Likewise, in diabetics without proliferation, angiogenic activity was also blocked by antibodies to PEDF. We will demonstrate here that the level of the natural ocular anti-angiogenic agent PEDF is inversely associated with proliferative retinopathy. PEDF is an important negative regulator of angiogenic activity of aqueous humor. Our data may have implications for the development of novel regimens for diabetic retinopathy.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"aqueous humor\\", \\"microvascular\\", \\"eye\\", \\"capillary endothelial cells\\", \\"aqueous fluid\\", \\"ocular\\", \\"Aqueous humor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Minimal residual disease (mrd) is a useful tool for predicting leukemia relapse. However, there is no consensus on how to treat children with elevation of BCR-ABL transcripts but no evidence of hematologic relapse during chemotherapy combined with imatinib. Here, we report the case of a child with Ph+ all who had persistent elevation of mrd, but no evidence of hematologic relapse while receiving imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy. dasatinib was substituted for imatinib because no suitable donor for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (hsct) was available. Less-intensive chemotherapy with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine was administered concomitantly. No serious adverse events were encountered. With continuous dasatinib combined with chemotherapy, but no allogeneic hsct, our patient reached complete molecular remission and has been in complete molecular remission for more than 13 months. This report is the first about the long-term use of dasatinib in patients with Ph+ all and mrd elevation but hematologic remission during imatinib chemotherapy . In a similar situation, chemotherapy combined with dasatinib instead of allogeneic hsct could be considered to avoid hsct-related mortality and morbidity.

Relevance to Catalytic Methane FunctionalizationPaper sections:Introduction<p>Methane is the primary component of natural gas, an abundant domestic energy resource.</p><p>The process of catalytic methane functionalization has several significant industrial implications.</p><p>First, the facile conversion of methane into methanol would provide a more efficient and cleaner source of energy than current methods of burning coal, petroleum or natural gas. Second, methanol -a liquid at ambient conditions -would be more convenient to transport than methane, as the latter it is quite costly to transport in its natural gaseous form. Third, methanol is itself a useful industrial chemical. Because of the thermodynamic strength and kinetic inertness of methane's C-H bonds, methane functionalization is presently infeasible without the aid of catalysts.</p><p>One area of research that has long focused on the potential applications of methane functionalization is the field of organometallic catalysis. While there have been many advances in developing such catalysts, there are still several challenges in being able to create catalysts that can selectively activate and functionalize methane. 1,2 With the many transition metals that can be used to define a catalyst's active site(s) and the near limitless combinations of supporting ligands, substituents, etc. that could be tested, it is not practical to evaluate each possibility, even with a search strategy largely or even completely limited to computational chemistry. Utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms is, therefore, an attractive solution to the combinatorial problem of catalyst design. Machine learning is a broad field of techniques designed to discern relationships and patterns in data that are not immediately apparent via traditional analysis techniques. Ideally, ML allows one to produce predictions or decisions without humans providing explicit rules or instructions on how to do so. ML can also reveal important links between catalyst structure and catalyst performance, which itself is a great aid in the design scenario, indicating novel directions for both future computational and experimental research in catalysis. Thus, it is of interest to investigate how potential catalyst candidates for methane activation can be identified using machine learning algorithms. In this study, several machine learning algorithms were investigated to determine the influence that various molecular properties of 3d metal ion complexes have on the calculated pKa of the C-H bonds of coordinated methyl and methane ligands. Part and parcel of this study is the underlying hypothesis that the intrinsic acid/base properties of a hydrocarbon/hydrocarbyl C-H bond -and how these are controlled within the coordination sphere of a metal catalyst -are an important indicator of catalyst activity and/or selectivity. A recent study as well as several classical studies have indicated just such a link. 3,4,5 A recent DFT and coupled cluster study of methane adducts showed a direct connection between enhanced acidity of a methane C-H bond upon ligation to a 3d metal and a reduction in the subsequent barrier to C-H activation. 5 Fallah et al. likewise showed that deprotonation of methyl C-H bonds was a competing side-reaction to methyl-X functionalization, implying that the acid-base properties of hydrocarbyl C-H bonds impact catalyst selectivity. 6 More recent research by Grumbles and Cundari indicates that metal and supporting ligand effects on organometallic pKa(C-H) values of methyl ligands are commensurate with, if not greater than, traditional inductive and resonance effects for organic acids. 7 In all, six different machine learning models were tested in this research: neural network, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), Bayesian ridge regression, least squares linear regression, and random forest techniques. All models were trained on a data set of pKa(C-H) values derived from density functional theory calculations on 91 transition metal methane/methyl structures, with a 75%/25% training-testing split. The data points were sequestered randomly into training and testing sets, with a set random seed for reproducibility. To facilitate comparison among the different ML techniques, twenty-one (21) input features were chosen to be utilized in the training of each model (Figure 1). These are typical and easily obtained atomic and molecular descriptors that one may assume to inform the resulting acid/base properties of a C-H bond within an organometallic environment.</p>Figure 1. Representative diagram of a ML model generating organometallic pKa(C-H) predictions by using twenty-one features as inputs.<p>To calculate the pKa(C-H) values, all structures were modeled in the context of a Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction, in which a 3d transition metal methane adduct (or methyl complex) is deprotonated by a DMSO solvent molecule, resulting in the formation of a methyl (or methylidene) conjugate base and the conjugate acid of DMSO (Figure 2). Figure 2. A representative Co-methyl \\"acid\\" modeled in this study (CSD refcode: AGODAC 8 ), left. Its conjugate base is the corresponding anionic methylidene complex, right.</p>Computational Methods<p>All structures studied in this investigation were optimized with the Gaussian 09/16 software packages, 9 , 10 using the BMK/6-31+G(d) level of theory. The pKa of methyl 5 and methane 7 C-H bonds for each structure was calculated using the following equations:</p><p>with a linear correction factor derived from the work of Nazemi and Cundari. 11 While many strategies for feature selection have been reported in the literature, in the present work a simple strategy was selected. A Python program was developed to automate the extraction of these features from the Gaussian output of the DFT-optimized structures. All metalmethyl complexes submitted to quantum calculations were found in the Cambridge Structural Database, 8 while all metal-methane complexes used for this study were sourced from a previous study. 5 However, one of the features, termed CCSE, was not directly extracted from the DFToptimized structures. It was devised to account for electrostatic effects that different modes of coordination have on the pKa(C-H). This feature was calculated with the following equation, using the computed Mulliken charges extracted from the DFT-optimized acid structures:</p><p>𝑀𝑀 𝐶𝐶 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 denotes the Mulliken charge on the metal center of the complex, while 𝑀𝑀 𝐶𝐶 𝑖𝑖 denotes the Mulliken charge on the 𝑖𝑖 𝑚𝑚ℎ atom in the complex, which is distance 𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖 away from the metal center.</p>Results and Discussion<p>In Figure 3    Using RMSE as a performance metric, the RF technique had the best performance in terms of generalization, i.e., the ability to reproduce DFT-calculated pKa(C-H) values of testing set methane/methyl complexes. It is worth noting that even with modern multi-core, high performance computing resources typical DFT geometry optimization/frequency protocols -assuming no complications from spurious imaginary frequencies, SCF convergence difficulties, etc. -take roughly a day per calculation. A typical training/testing simulation -after identification of appropriate ML architectures and protocols -takes on the order of a few seconds per simulation.</p><p>As an additional test, the six ML models investigated in this study were evaluated on a separate data set of Sc-methyl complexes to gauge the generalization power of each, given that there were no scandium-methyl complexes in the original training/testing sets. All complexes were found in the Cambridge Structural Database (Figure 4) and their pKa(C-H) values calculated using the same procedures summarized in Computational Methods. 8 While sparse, the external test set illustrates that all models perform reasonably well on previously unseen data (Figure 5). However, the random forest model performs exceedingly well on this external test set with an RMSE of 1½ pKa units, Figure 5, roughly one-third of any other method tested herein.</p><p>While an ML model that can both memorize (training) and generalize (testing) the subject database is valuable for understanding trends in a given data set, it is as important in a catalyst design scenario that chemical insight be extracted from such simulations. Therefore, each ML model was further evaluated to determine the features most important to the prediction process.</p><p>Feature importance was assessed by iteratively removing each of the 21 input features, Figure 1, shuffling the order of the remaining features, and retraining the model and calculating the percent increase in the root mean square error (RMSE). This error metric was obtained by performing a leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation on each model. Examining these evaluations (Figure 6), results show that nearly all models agreed that the 𝐄𝐄 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 energy of the conjugate base was the most important feature in determining pKa(C-H). Interestingly, after the evaluation process, the two lowest performing models, NN and kNN, both indicated a number of redundant features with much higher percent decreases in RMSE as compared to other models. Another point of interest is that both the LSLR and BRR models demonstrate striking similarities in their ranking of features' importance; this is likely due to the similar nature of these linear models.

Features suffixed with \\"A\\" represent features extracted from the DFT-optimized acid structure, and likewise those suffixed with \\"CB\\" refer to features extracted from the DFT-optimized conjugate base structure. \\"Vib Frequency\\" features refer to the calculated IR stretching frequencies for each structure's target methane/methyl/methylidene ligand. Each \\"Vib Frequency\\" feature includes a suffixed number as well, which represents the original order of the frequencies in the DFT optimization (lowest to highest). \\"MC\\" is the abbreviation for the DFT-calculated Mulliken charge on the complex's metal center. Metal refers to the atomic number of each complex's metal center. \\"CCSE\\" is an abbreviation of calculated coordination sphere effects; its calculation can be referenced in Computational Methods. In a similar fashion, the models were also evaluated to determine whether the acid or conjugate base species was more important to generating predictions. Interestingly, from the data in Figure 7, in all cases, conjugate base input features were overwhelmingly more important than acid descriptors.</p>Summary and Conclusions<p>In conclusion, we have observed that several common machine learning models and one more unconventional (random forest) technique all have extraordinary predictive power in approximating the pKa(C-H) values of organometallic methane and methyl complexes. This is clearly evidenced by the low RMSE metrics and high positive R 2 correlations obtained, despite the modest amount of data available to train on. Moreover, it is interesting to note how accurate both linear models (least squares linear regression and Bayesian ridge regression) are compared to the other more complex ML techniques.

From a chemical perspective, this may hint, for example, that the stability of the metal-methylidene moiety is most critical in determining the acidity of its metal-methyl conjugate acid. A final point of interest lies in the fact that feature importance evaluations revealed that overall, 𝐄𝐄 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 energy of the conjugate base was the single most important feature.</p><p>The present study has focused on uncovering how effective machine learning algorithms are in predicting acid-base properties of coordinated methane and methyl.

Results illustrate that the machine learning models are quite promising, with RMSE metrics ranging from 4.6 to 8.8 pKa units, despite the relatively modest amount of data available to train on. Importantly, the machine learning models agreed that (a) conjugate base properties were more impactful than those of the corresponding conjugate acid, and (b) the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital conjugate base was the most significant input feature in the prediction of pKa(C-H). Furthermore, results from additional testing conducted using an external dataset of Sc-methyl complexes demonstrated the robustness of all models, with RMSE metrics ranging from 1.5 to 6.6 pKa units.In all, this research demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in organometallic catalyst development."},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

optical quantum gates achieve the non - linearity necessary for the interaction between qubits by means of the non - linearity of quantum measurement . unfortunately , quantum measurement is not only non - linear but also probabilistic. therefore linear - optical implementations of quantum gates are mostly probabilistic too  their operation sometimes fails .partly , this is a fundamental limitation .but in many cases when data qubits appear in an improper state after the measurement on an ancillary system they can still be corrected by applying a proper unitary transformation which depends only on the measurement result . in these situations ,implementation of the feed forward can increase the probability of success of the gate @xcite . in the present paper, we apply this approach to a linear - optical programmable quantum gate .the most of conventional computers use fixed hardware and different tasks are performed using different software .this concept can be , in principle , applied to quantum computers as well : the executed unitary operation can be determined by some kind of a program . however , in 1997 nielsen and chuang @xcite showed that an @xmath1-qubit quantum register can perfectly encode at most @xmath2 distinct quantum operations .although this bound rules out perfect universally - programmable quantum gates ( even unitary transformations on only one qubit form a group with uncountably many elements ) , it is still possible to construct approximate or probabilistic programmable quantum gates and optimize their performance for a given size of the program register .such gates can either operate deterministically , but with some noise added to the output state @xcite , or they can operate probabilistically , but error free @xcite. combination of these regimes is also possible .a probabilistic programmable phase gate was proposed by vidal , masanes , and cirac @xcite .it carries out rotation of a single - qubit state along the @xmath0-axis of the bloch sphere .the angle of rotation ( or the phase shift ) is programmed into a state of a single - qubit program register .it is worth noting that an exact specification of an angle of rotation would require infinitely many classical bits .but here the information is encoded into a single qubit only .the price to pay is that the success probability of such a gate is limited by 50% @xcite .the programmable phase gate was experimentally implemented for the first time in 2008 @xcite .however , the success probability of that linear - optical implementation reached only 25% .in the present paper we will show how to increase the success probability of this scheme to its quantum mechanical limit of 50% by means of electronic feed forward .the programmable phase gate works with a data and program qubit .the program qubit is supposed to contain information about the phase shift @xmath3 encoded in the following way : @xmath4 the gate performs a unitary evolution of the data qubit which depends on the state of the program qubit : @xmath5 without loss of generality we can consider only pure input states of the data qubit : @xmath6so the output state of the data qubit reads : @xmath7    experimentally the programmable phase gate can be implemented by an optical setup shown in fig .[ fig - scheme ] .each qubit is represented by a single photon which may propagate in two optical fibers .the basis states @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the presence of the photon in the first or second fiber , respectively .when restricted only to the cases where a single photon emerges in each output port , the conditional two - photon output state reads ( the normalization reflects the fact that the probability of this situation is @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 ,  ] ] where @xmath12 . if we make a measurement on the program qubit in the basis @xmath13 then also the output state of the data qubit collapses into one of the two following states according to the result of the measurement : @xmath14 . if the measurement outcome is @xmath15 then the unitary transformation @xmath16 has been applied to the data qubit .if the outcome is @xmath17 then the state acquires an extra @xmath18 phase shift , i.e. , @xmath19 has been executed .this is compensated by a fast electro - optical modulator which applies a corrective phase shift @xmath20 ( in practice we apply phase shift @xmath18 what is equivalent ) .the scheme of the setup is shown in fig .[ fig - scheme ] .pairs of photons are created by type - ii collinear frequency - degenerate spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in a two - millimeter long bbo crystal pumped by a diode laser ( coherent cube ) at 405 nm .the photons are separated by a polarizing beam splitter and coupled into single - mode fibers . using fiber polarization controllers the same polarizationsare set on the both photons . by means of fiber couplers andelectro - optical phase modulators the required input states of the program and data qubits are prepared . to prepare state ( [ eq - prog_qubit ] ) of the program qubit a fiber coupler ( fc ) with fixed splitting ratio 50:50 is used .an arbitrary state of the data qubit ( [ eq - dat_qubit_in ] ) is prepared using electronically controlled variable ratio coupler ( vrc ) .all employed phase modulators ( eo space ) are based on the linear electro - optic effect in lithium niobate .their half - wave voltages are about 1.5v .these phase modulators ( pm ) exhibit relatively high dispersion .therefore one pm is placed in each interferometer arm in order to compensate dispersion effects . because the overall phase of a quantum state is irrelevant it is equivalent to apply either a phase shift @xmath21 to @xmath9 or @xmath22 to @xmath8 .the gate itself consists of the exchange of two rails of input qubits and of the measurement on the data qubit ( see fig .[ fig -

packets representing data qubits are retarded by fiber delay lines ( one coil of fiber of the length circa 8 m in each interferometer arm ) .timing of the feed - forward pulse and the photon arrival was precisely tuned .coherence time of photons created by our spdc source is only several hundreds of femtoseconds .the right - most block in fig .  [ fig - scheme ] enables us to measure the data qubit at the output of the gate in an arbitrary basis .these measurements are necessary to evaluate performance of the gate .the whole experimental setup is formed by two mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzi ) .the length of the arms of the shorter mzi is about 10.5 m ( the upper interferometer in fig .[ fig - scheme ] ) .the length of the arms of the longer one is about 21.5 m ( the lower interferometer one in fig .[ fig - scheme ] ) . to balance the arm lengths we use motorized air gaps with adjustable lengths . inside the air gaps , polarizers and wave platesare also mounted .they serve for accurate setting of polarizations of the photons ( to obtain high visibilities the polarizations in the both arms of each mzi must be the same ) .    to reduce the effect of the phase drift caused by fluctuations of temperature and temperature gradients we apply both passive and active stabilization .the experimental setup is covered by a shield minimizing air flux around the components and the both delay fiber loops are winded on an aluminium cylinder which is thermally isolated . besides , after each three seconds of measurement an active stabilization is performed .it measures intensities for phase shifts 0 and @xmath29 and if necessary it calculates phase compensation and applies corresponding additional corrective voltage to the phase modulator .this results in the precision of the phase setting during the measurement period better than @xmath30 . for the stabilization purposes we use a laser diode at 810 nm . to ensure the same spectral range ,both the laser beam and spdc generated photons pass through the same band - pass interference filter ( spectral fwhm 2 nm , andover ) . during the active stabilizationthe source is automatically switched from spdc to a laser diode .any quantum operation can be fully described by a completely positive ( cp ) map . according to the jamiolkowski - choi isomorphismany cp map can be represented by a positive - semidefinite operator @xmath31 on the tensor product of input and output hilbert spaces @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .the input state @xmath34 transforms according to @xmath35. ] ] combinations of different input states with measurements on the output quantum system represent effective measurements performed on @xmath36 .a proper selection of the input states and final measurements allows us to reconstruct matrix @xmath31 from measured data using maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation technique @xcite .    for each phase shift ,i.e , for a fixed state of the program qubit , we used six different input states of the data qubit , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for each of these input states the state of the data qubit at the output of the gatewas measured in three different measurement basis , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .each time we simultaneously measured two - photon coincidence counts between detectors d@xmath24 & d@xmath25 , d@xmath24 & d@xmath26 , d@xmath28 & d@xmath25 , d@xmath28 & d@xmath26 in 12 three - second intervals. the unequal detector efficiencies were compensated by proper rescaling of the measured coincidence counts . from these datawe have reconstructed choi matrices describing the functioning of the gate for several different phase shifts . in figs .[ fig - choi - halfpi ] and [ fig - choi - pi ] there are examples of the choi matrices of the gate for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .    reconstructed : ideal : +   +    reconstructed : ideal : +   +    to quantify the quality of gate operation we have calculated the process fidelity . if @xmath43 is a one - dimensional projector then the common definition of process fidelity is @xmath44 / ( mathrm{tr}[chi]mathrm{tr}[chi_{mathrm{id}}]). ] ] here @xmath43 represents the ideal transformation corresponding to our gate . in particular , @xmath45 where @xmath46 stays for the unitary operation ( [ eq - uphi ] ) applied by the gate .we have also reconstructed density matrices of the output states of the data qubit corresponding to all input states and calculated fidelities and purities of the output states . the fidelity of output state @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the ( pure ) input state . the purity of the output state is defined as @xmath50  ] .if the input state is pure the output state is expected to be pure as well .table  [ tab - withff ] shows process fidelities for seven different phase shifts .it also shows the average and minimal values of output state fidelities and average and minimal purities of output states .fidelities and purities are averaged over six output states corresponding to six input states described above .also the minimum values are related to these sets of states ..process fidelities ( @xmath51 ) , average ( @xmath52 ) and minimal ( @xmath53 ) output - state fidelities , average ( @xmath54 ) and minimal ( @xmath55 ) output - state purities for different phases ( @xmath3 ) _ with _ feed forward ( @xmath56 ) .

Reactive Jammer 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Reactive jamming is not only cost effective, but also hard to track and remove due to its intermittent jamming behaviors. Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) have been widely used to defend against jamming attacks. However, both will fail if the jammer jams all frequency channels or has high transmit power. In this paper, we propose BitTrickle, an anti-jamming wireless communication scheme that allows communication in the presence of a broadband and high power reactive jammer by exploiting the reaction time of the jammer. We develop a prototype of BitTrickle using the USRP platform running GNURadio. Our evaluation shows that when under powerful reactive jamming, BitTrickle still maintains communication, whereas other schemes such as 802.11 DSSS fail completely.Literature Review:","answer":"The reactive jammer starts to transmit its jamming signal only when it detects that the legitimate node is transmitting data packets BIB002 , BIB001 . This type of jammer first senses the wireless channel and upon detecting that the channel is busy, implying that the legitimate user is active, it transmits a jamming signal for the sake of corrupting the data reception at the legitimate receiver. The success of a reactive jammer depends on its sensing accuracy concerning the legitimate user's status. For example, when the legitimate signal received at a reactive jammer is weak (e.g., due to fast fading and shadowing effects) and hence cannot be detected, the reactive jammer then becomes ineffective in jamming the legitimate transmissions. In contrast to both constant and intermittent jammers that attempt to block the wireless channel regardless of the legitimate traffic activity on the channel, the reactive jammer remains quiet when the channel is idle and starts emitting its jamming signal only when the channel is deemed to be busy. This implies that the reactive jammer is more energy-efficient than both the constant and the intermittent jammers. The detection of the presence of a reactive jammer is typically harder than that of the constant and intermittent jammers. As discussed above, the constant and intermittent jammers both intend to interfere with the reception of a legitimate data packet as well as to hinder the transmission of the legitimate packets by maliciously seizing the wireless channel. By contrast, a reactive jammer inflicts less damage, since it corrupts the reception without affecting the legitimate transmitter's activity to gain access to the wireless channel. This means that the CST becomes an ineffective measurement for detecting the reactive jammer. Since the reception of legitimate wireless communications will be affected in the presence of a reactive jammer, we can still consider the employment of RSS and PER based techniques for the detection of the reactive jammer. Generally, an abnormal increase of the RSS and/or a surprisingly high PER indicate the presence of a reactive jammer. An effective technique of preventing a reactive jammer from disrupting communications is to assist the legitimate user in becoming undetectable, because then the jammer remains silent. Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)  techniques spread the radio signal over a very wide frequency bandwidth, so that the signal has a low power spectral density (PSD), which may even be below the background noise level. This makes it difficult for a reactive jammer to differentiate the DSSS modulated legitimate signal from the background noise. In this way, the reactive jammer may become unable to track the legitimate traffic activity and thus cannot disrupt the legitimate transmissions. Additionally, the aforementioned frequency hopping technique is also effective in guarding against a reactive jamming attack, as long as the hopping rate is sufficiently high (e.g., faster than the jammer reacts)."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients). Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24 + 39) was higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34 + 39) from patient 2, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract. Altogether, our results confirmed the presence of virus RNA in extra-pulmonary sites. Text: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), originally outbreaking from Wuhan China, has transmitted in an extremely short period to 25 countries and infected over 31 000 individuals as of Feb 06, 2020, causing an international alarm. Basic scientific research has achieved significantly in the investigation of viral origination [1, 2] , transmission and evolution [3] , and unprecedented public health control actions in China have been activated and effectively prevented the otherwise dramatic spread. The 2019-nCoV virus seems more infectious in its public transmission capacity compared to the well-known 2003 SARS virus in spite of the unavailability of convincingly scientific evidence. The mechanism of viral transmission is still worthy of further exploration. Currently, one urgent and critical challenge is to treat infected patients and save their lives. Several studies have roughly described the overall clinical features of 2019-nCoV patients [4, 5] . However, the more specific and classified clinical characteristics of the infected patients still require further investigation, particularly for those with severe symptoms, which is roughly estimated to be approximately 15-20 percent of totally confirmed cases based on the local data in our hospital. Clinically, for those severe patients, the main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are fever, decreased white blood cell and lymphocyte count, increased C reaction protein and abnormally expressed cytokines [6] . One remaining question to be resolved is whether the 2019-nCoV virus can replicate in extra-pulmonary sites, which might account for the deteriorated clinical manifestation. In this study, we investigated whether the patients with severe clinical symptoms exhibited special profiles of virus replication or/and distribution compared to those only with mild symptoms. Patients, who were confirmed to be infected by the 2019-nCoV virus, were firstly enrolled in or transferred to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital for treatment purposes. This study followed the guideline of the Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. All blood, pharyngeal swab, and anal swab samples were collected for diagnostic purposes in the laboratory and our study added no extra burden to patients. Viral RNA was extracted with Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Da'an Gene Corporation, Cat: DA0630) on an automatic workstation Smart 32 (Da'an Gene Corporation) following the guidelines. Real-time reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagent (Da'an Gene cooperation, Cat DA0930) was employed for viral detection per the protocol. In brief, two PCR primer and probe sets, which target orf1ab (FAM reporter) and N (VIC reporter) genes separately, were added in the same reaction tube. Positive and negative controls were included for each batch of detection. Samples were considered to be viral positive when either or both set(s) gave a reliable signal(s). All patients had pneumonia-based diseases but with diversified clinical manifestation. To simplify data analysis, the patients were only classified as either mild or severe clinical symptom groups based on the guideline newly released by Chinese government. Patients who were with at least one of the following symptom should be diagnosed to be severe case, 1) distress of respiratory with respiratory rate > = 30/min; 2) Oxygen saturation < = 93% in the rest state, and 3) arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO₂) of less than 300 mm Hg. In the blood detection cohort (Figure 1 (A)), patients who had at less one serum sample measurement with the PCR method were included. In the 57, 6 cases were detected to be blood positive, all of them (100%) were severe in symptom requiring special care attention, and the blood of the rest 51 cases was without detectable virus in the blood, only 12 of them (23.5%) were severe cases. The ratio of severe symptoms between these two groups was significantly different (p value = 0.0001). In the anal swab cohort (Figure 1 (B)), 11 of 28 cases were detected to be anal swab positive, 8 of them (72.7%) were with severe symptoms, which was significantly higher than that 4 (23.5%) of the rest 17 cases without detectable virus in anal were severe cases. Fortunately, two cases with detectable virus both in blood and anal swab cohort were recorded. Patient 1 (Figure 2 (A)) was admitted to ICU after enrollment evaluation and was highly suspected infection with 2019-nCoV because of his recent travelling from Wuhan and of confirmed pneumonia by radiographic diagnosis with 5-day fever and 1-day continuous dry coughing. He was then confirmed to be infected by the 2019-nCoV virus on illness day 6 by CDC. High concentrations of the viral RNA were detected in the pharyngeal swabs on illness days 5 (Ct = 17 + 25), 7, 8 (Ct = 25 + 26), and 11 (Ct = 15 + 25). In the blood, no viral RNA was detected on day 5 but the sample on day 6 gave a weak positive signal (Ct = Neg+39), and then the signal was gone again on day 8. On day 9, a low level of viral RNA (Ct = 36 + 41) was detected again in the blood. On day 12, the blood lost signal again. A high concentration of virus RNA (Ct = 23 + 27) was detected in the anal sample on day 13, on the day the 2019-nCoV virus was not detected in the pharyngeal swab. Unfortunately, he was transferred out to another hospital after an emergency expert consultation. Patient 2 (Figure 2 (B)), who had a clear infection history and started fever 5-day ago and dry coughing 2-day ago, was admitted with clinically highly suspect of 2019-nCoV infection, considering the radiographical diagnosis which indicated clear pneumonia in the bilateral lung lobes. The virus was detected in his blood on illness day 7 (Ct = 34 + 36) and 8 (Ct = 38 + 38). His infection was also informed by the CDC on day 8. Because his disease advanced very fast, he was transferred to the ICU ward for special medical care requirements on day 9, on which day high titers of virus (Ct = 25 + 36) were detected in the pharyngeal sample. Importantly, virus RNA was detected in all pharyngeal (Ct = 23 + 24), blood (Ct = 34 + 39) and anal (Ct = 24 + 29) samples on day 10. He was transferred out to another hospital after an emergency expert consultation. Finally, we described here the four patients with detectable serum viral RNA. Patient 3 (Figure 3(A) ) was transferred to the ICU directly on illness day 11 because of his severe condition, the 2019-nCoV virus was laboratory detected both in pharyngeal (Ct = 30 + 30) and blood samples (Ct = 37 + 39) on day 12, And his infection was confirmed by CDC on day 13. Pharyngeal samples were PCR positive on days 14 and 17 and became negative on day 22. Patient 4 (Figure 3(B) ) was transferred to the ICU ward on the illness day 6 with a CDC confirmation. His disease advanced pretty fast and became severe on day 7 and he was transferred to ICU after his blood sample was detected to be virus-positive (Ct = 32 + 37). On day 9, he was transferred out. Patient 5 (Figure 3(C) ) was admitted on illness day 4 and his blood sample was virus-positive (Ct = 38 + Neg) on day 6. Her disease progressed rapidly to a severe stage within the next 3 days. Patient 6 ( Figure 3 (D)) with a clear history of virus infection was confirmed to be infected on infection day 7. Viral RNA was detected in his blood sample on day 9, one day ahead of his transfer into ICU. As his condition worsens, he was transferred out on day 13. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the PCR data of virus detection in different tissues in our laboratory. Firstly, our observation indicated that the presence of viral RNA outside of the respiratory tract might herald the severity of the disease and alarm the requirement of special care. In the blood test cohort, all the 6 infected patients were in (or later progressed to) severe disease stage when serum viral RNA became detectable, which showed a significant difference compared to the blood negative group (p = 0.0001). Patient 2 (Figure 2(B) ), 5 (Figure 3 (C)) and 6 ( Figure 3(D) ) all had detectable viral RNA in the serum before they progressed to the clinical severe symptom stage. Unfortunately, we missed the earlier time points of patient 1 (Figure 2(A) ) and 3 (Figure 3(A) ) who were directly admitted to ICU on transfer to our hospital because of severe condition, of patient 4 (Figure 3(B) ) who had serum sample collected one day post the diagnosis of severe illness. We, fortunately, observed high serum viral load in serum within their severe illness stage. In the anal swab cohort, we found that the presence of virus RNA in the anal digestive tract was also positively correlated with disease severity (p = 0.0102). The 3 patients detected with anal virus RNA but in mild stage should be monitored whether they will progress to the severe stage. We have summarized the information of approximately 70 percent of the patients in Guangzhou city, and the study represented nearly the whole picture of this region. However, the virus outbroke in such an emergence, allowing no delay in waiting for more patients to further confirm the findings. Secondly, a high concentration of viral RNA in anal swabs suggested the digestive tract might be one extrapulmonary site for virus replication . For patient 1, a high concentration of viral RNA (Ct = 23 + 27, on day 13) was detected in anal swab but not in pharyngeal (the same day) and blood (1 d ahead). For patient 2, higher concentrations of viral RNAs were detected in anal swab (Ct = 24 + 39) and pharyngeal swab (Ct = 23 + 24) than in the blood (Ct = 34 + 39) on the same day. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) still is one of the receptors for 2019-nCoV attachment and entry [2] . Intensive structural analysis of the S protein of 2019-nCoV with the SARS-Coronavirus suggested that several critical residues in the viral spike protein might confer favourable interaction with human ACE2 [7] . Of note, ACE2 is also abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the small intestine besides the respiratory tract and is ubiquitously present in endothelial cells [8] , which might provide possible routes of transmission, and might account for the high transmission capacity of the new virus. We propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body. Then the virus succeeds in establishing reinfection in the digestive tract by using the highly expressed ACE2 receptor, which exacerbated the disease vice versa. Bat originated coronavirus was found to replicate in the swine digestive tract recently, also suggesting the potential replication possibility in the human digestive tract [9] . Nevertheless, confirmation of virus transmission through the digestive tract warrants further virus isolation from the anal swab in high safety level lab. Unfortunately, in our study, we did not collect stool samples from patients and did not pursue viral RNA in the stool. But we believe the existence of virus RNA in the stool samples from these patients because that a large amount of viral RNA was detected in anal swabs and that viral RNA had also been detected in a case reported from the United States [10] . Also, we didn't collect sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for virus detection because that the dry coughing characteristic of patients infected with 2019-nCoV prevents producing enough amount of sputum and that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collection requires a sophisticated operation which increases virus exposure possibility of care providers to high concentrations of virus-containing aerosol. In summary, we find that the presence of viral RNA in the blood and anal swab is positively correlated with the severe disease stage and that early monitoring of virus RNA in blood and the digestive tract on top of the respiratory tract might benefit the disease prediction.Question: What could be the implication of 2019-nCOV virus in anal swabs?","answer":"digestive tract might be one extrapulmonary site for virus replication"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper. Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:Semantic parsing which maps a natural language sentence into a formal machine-readable representation of its meaning, is highly constrained by the limited annotated training data.Inspired by the idea of coarse-to-fine, we propose a general-to-detailed neural network(GDNN) by incorporating cross-domain sketch(CDS) among utterances and their logic forms.For utterances in different domains, the General Network will extract CDS using an encoder-decoder model in a multi-task learning setup.Then for some utterances in a specific domain, the Detailed Network will generate the detailed target parts using sequence-to-sequence architecture with advanced attention to both utterance and generated CDS.Our experiments show that compared to direct multi-task learning, CDS has improved the performance in semantic parsing task which converts users' requests into meaning representation language(MRL).We also use experiments to illustrate that CDS works by adding some constraints to the target decoding process, which further proves the effectiveness and rationality of CDS.Recently many natural language processing (NLP) tasks based on the neural network have shown promising results and gained much attention because these studies are purely data-driven without linguistic prior knowledge.Semantic parsing task which maps a natural language sentence into a machine-readable representation BID6 ), as a particular translation task, can be treated as a sequence-to-sequence problem BID3 ).Lately, a compositional graph-based semantic meaning representation language (MRL) has been introduced BID14 ), which converts utterance into logic form (action-object-attribute), increasing the ability to represent complex requests.This work is based on MRL format for semantic parsing task.Semantic parsing highly depends on the amount of annotated data and it is hard to annotate the data in logic forms such as Alexa MRL.Several researchers have focused on the area of multi-task learning and transfer learning BID10 , BID6 , BID15 ) with the observation that while these tasks differ in their domains and forms, the structure of language composition repeats across domains BID12 ).Compared to the model trained on a single domain only, a multi-task model that shares information across domains can improve both performance and generalization.However, there is still a lack of interpretations why the multi-task learning setting works BID26 ) and what the tasks have shared.Some NLP studies around language modeling BID18 , BID29 , BID2 ) indicate that implicit commonalities of the sentences including syntax and morphology exist and can share among domains, but these commonalities have not been fully discussed and quantified.To address this problem, in this work, compared to multi-task learning mentioned above which directly use neural networks to learn shared features in an implicit way, we try to define these cross-domain commonalities explicitly as cross-domain sketch (CDS).E.g., Search weather in 10 days in domain Weather and Find schedule for films at night in domain ScreeningEvent both have action SearchAction and Attribute time, so that they share a same MRL structure like SearchAction(Type(time@?)), where Type indicates domain and ?indicates attribute value which is copying from the original utterance.We extract this domain general MRL structure as CDS.Inspired by the research of coarse-to-fine BID4 ), we construct a two-level encoder-decoder by using CDS as a middle coarse layer.We firstly use General Network to get the CDS for every utterance in all domains.Then for a single specific domain, based on both utterance and extracted CDS, we decode the final target with advanced attention while CDS can be seen as adding some constraints to this process.The first utterance-CDS process can be regarded as a multi-task learning setup since it is suitable for all utterances across the domains.This work mainly introducing CDS using multi-task learning has some contributions listed below:1) We make an assumption that there exist cross-domain commonalities including syntactic and phrasal similarity for utterances and extract these commonalities as cross-domain sketch (CDS) which for our knowledge is the first time.We then define CDS on two different levels (action-level and attribute-level) trying to seek the most appropriate definition of CDS.2) We propose a general-to-detailed neural network by incorporating CDS as a middle coarse layer.CDS is not only a high-level extraction of commonalities across all the domains, but also a prior information for fine process helping the final decoding.3) Since CDS is cross-domain, our first-level network General Network which encodes the utterance and decodes CDS can be seen as a multi-task learning setup, capturing the commonalities among utterances expressions from different domains which is exactly the goal of multi-task learning.In this paper, we propose the concept of cross-domain sketch (CDS) which extracts some shared information across domains, trying to fully utilize the cross-domain commonalities such as syntactic and phrasal similarity in human expressions.We try to define CDS on two levels and give some examples to illustrate our idea.We also present a general-to-detailed neural network (GDNN) for converting an utterance into a logic form based on meaning representation language (MRL) form.The general network, which is meant to extract cross-domain commonalities, uses an encoderdecoder model to obtain CDS in a multi-task setup.Then the detailed network generates the final domain-specific target by exploiting utterance and CDS simultaneously via attention mechanism.Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CDS and multi-task learning.CDS is able to generalize over a wide range of tasks since it is an extraction to language expressions.Therefore, in the future, we would like to perfect the CDS definition and extend its' ontology to other domains and tasks.Besides, in this paper, we use attention mechanism to make use of CDS which is still a indirect way.We would like to explore more effective ways such as constraint decoding to further enhance the role of CDS.","answer":"General-to-detailed neural network(GDNN)  with Multi-Task Learning

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: However, as both CD8 + T cell and neutralizing antibody responses are generated by the vector and vaccine antigens, immunological memory to these components can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use  [48] . One drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, so alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus vectors include those from non-human primates (NHP), dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, birds and others [48, 55] . These vectors can infect a variety of cell types, but are generally attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. Swine, NHP and bovine adenoviruses expressing H5 HA antigens have been shown to induce immunity comparable to human rAd5-H5 vaccines [33, 56] . Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses from low-prevalence serotypes have also been shown to be efficacious. Low prevalence serotypes such as adenovirus types 3, 7, 11, and 35 can evade anti-Ad5 immune responses while maintaining effective antigen delivery and immunogenicity [48, 57] . Prime-boost strategies, using DNA or protein immunization in conjunction with an adenovirus vaccine booster immunization have also been explored as a means to avoided preexisting immunity [52] . Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were first explored as gene therapy vectors. Like rAd vectors, rAAV have broad tropism infecting a variety of hosts, tissues, and proliferating and non-proliferating cell types [58] . AAVs had been generally not considered as vaccine vectors because they were widely considered to be poorly immunogenic. A seminal study using AAV-2 to express a HSV-2 glycoprotein showed this virus vaccine vector effectively induced potent CD8 + T cell and serum antibody responses, thereby opening the door to other rAAV vaccine-associated studies [59, 60] . AAV vector systems have a number of engaging properties. The wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans and the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated [61] . As members of the parvovirus family, AAVs are small non-enveloped viruses that are stable and amenable to long-term storage without a cold chain. While there is limited preexisting immunity, availability of non-human strains as vaccine candidates eliminates these concerns. Modifications to the vector have increased immunogenicity, as well [60] . There are limited studies using AAVs as vaccine vectors for influenza. An AAV expressing an HA antigen was first shown to induce protective in 2001 [62] . Later, a hybrid AAV derived from two non-human primate isolates (AAVrh32.33) was used to express influenza NP and protect against PR8 challenge in mice [63] . Most recently, following the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, rAAV vectors were generated expressing the HA, NP and matrix 1 (M1) proteins of A/Mexico/4603/2009 (pH1N1), and in murine immunization and challenge studies, the rAAV-HA and rAAV-NP were shown to be protective; however, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + NP + M1 had the most robust protection. Also, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + rAAV-NP + rAAV-M1 were also partially protected against heterologous (PR8, H1N1) challenge [63] . Most recently, an AAV vector was used to deliver passive immunity to influenza [64, 65] . In these studies, AAV (AAV8 and AAV9) was used to deliver an antibody transgene encoding a broadly cross-protective anti-influenza monoclonal antibody for in vivo expression. Both intramuscular and intranasal delivery of the AAVs was shown to protect against a number of influenza virus challenges in mice and ferrets, including H1N1 and H5N1 viruses [64, 65] . These studies suggest that rAAV vectors are promising vaccine and immunoprophylaxis vectors. To this point, while approximately 80 phase I, I/II, II, or III rAAV clinical trials are open, completed, or being reviewed, these have focused upon gene transfer studies and so there is as yet limited safety data for use of rAAV as vaccines [66] . Alphaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Togaviridae family. A variety of alphaviruses have been developed as vaccine vectors, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis (SIN) virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus, as well as chimeric viruses incorporating portions of SIN and VEE viruses. The replication defective vaccines or replicons do not encode viral structural proteins, having these portions of the genome replaces with transgenic material. The structural proteins are provided in cell culture production systems. One important feature of the replicon systems is the self-replicating nature of the RNA. Despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels [67] . SIN, SFV, and VEE have all been tested for efficacy as vaccine vectors for influenza virus [68] [69] [70] [71] . A VEE-based replicon system encoding the HA from PR8 was demonstrated to induce potent HA-specific immune response and protected from challenge in a murine model, despite repeated immunization with the vector expressing a control antigen, suggesting preexisting immunity may not be an issue for the replicon vaccine [68] . A separate study developed a VEE replicon system expressing the HA from A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) and demonstrated varying efficacy after in ovo vaccination or vaccination of 1-day-old chicks [70] . A recombinant SIN virus was use as a vaccine vector to deliver a CD8 + T cell epitope only. The well-characterized NP epitope was transgenically expressed in the SIN system and shown to be immunogenic in mice, priming a robust CD8 + T cell response and reducing influenza virus titer after challenge [69] . More recently, a VEE replicon system expressing the HA protein of PR8 was shown to protect young adult (8-week-old) and aged (12-month-old) mice from lethal homologous challenge [72] . The VEE replicon systems are particularly appealing as the VEE targets antigen-presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, priming rapid and robust immune responses [73] . VEE replicon systems can induce robust mucosal immune responses through intranasal or subcutaneous immunization [72] [73] [74] , and subcutaneous immunization with virus-like replicon particles (VRP) expressing HA-induced antigen-specific systemic IgG and fecal IgA antibodies [74] . VRPs derived from VEE virus have been developed as candidate vaccines for cytomegalovirus (CMV). A phase I clinical trial with the CMV VRP showed the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and potent T cell responses. Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and considered safe [75] . A separate clinical trial assessed efficacy of repeated immunization with a VRP expressing a tumor antigen. The vaccine was safe and despite high vector-specific immunity after initial immunization, continued to boost transgene-specific immune responses upon boost [76] . While additional clinical data is needed, these reports suggest alphavirus replicon systems or VRPs may be safe and efficacious, even in the face of preexisting immunity. Baculovirus has been extensively used to produce recombinant proteins. Recently, a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use and was first available for use in the United States for the 2013-2014 influenza season [4] . Baculoviruses have also been explored as vaccine vectors. Baculoviruses have a number of advantages as vaccine vectors. The viruses have been extensively studied for protein expression and for pesticide use and so are readily manipulated. The vectors can accommodate large gene insertions, show limited cytopathic effect in mammalian cells, and have been shown to infect and express genes of interest in a spectrum of mammalian cells [77] . While the insect promoters are not effective for mammalian gene expression, appropriate promoters can be cloned into the baculovirus vaccine vectors. Baculovirus vectors have been tested as influenza vaccines, with the first reported vaccine using Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) expressing the HA of PR8 under control of the CAG promoter (AcCAG-HA) [77] . Intramuscular, intranasal, intradermal, and intraperitoneal immunization or mice with AcCAG-HA elicited HA-specific antibody responses, however only intranasal immunization provided protection from lethal challenge. Interestingly, intranasal immunization with the wild type AcNPV also resulted in protection from PR8 challenge. The robust innate immune response to the baculovirus provided non-specific protection from subsequent influenza virus infection [78] . While these studies did not demonstrate specific protection, there were antigen-specific immune responses and potential adjuvant effects by the innate response. Baculovirus pseudotype viruses have also been explored. The G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus controlled by the insect polyhedron promoter and the HA of A/Chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1) HPAIV controlled by a CMV promoter were used to generate the BV-G-HA. Intramuscular immunization of mice or chickens with BV-G-HA elicited strong HI and VN serum antibody responses, IFN-γ responses, and protected from H5N1 challenge [79] . A separate study demonstrated efficacy using a bivalent pseudotyped baculovirus vector [80] . Baculovirus has also been used to generate an inactivated particle vaccine. The HA of A/Indonesia/CDC669/2006(H5N1) was incorporated into a commercial baculovirus vector controlled by the e1 promoter from White Spot Syndrome Virus. The resulting recombinant virus was propagated in insect (Sf9) cells and inactivated as a particle vaccine [81, 82] . Intranasal delivery with cholera toxin B as an adjuvant elicited robust HI titers and protected from lethal challenge [81] . Oral delivery of this encapsulated vaccine induced robust serum HI titers and mucosal IgA titers in mice, and protected from H5N1 HPAIV challenge. More recently, co-formulations of inactivated baculovirus vectors have also been shown to be effective in mice [83] . While there is growing data on the potential use of baculovirus or pseudotyped baculovirus as a vaccine vector, efficacy data in mammalian animal models other than mice is lacking. There is also no data on the safety in humans, reducing enthusiasm for baculovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza at this time. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes disease in poultry. NDV has a number of appealing qualities as a vaccine vector. As an avian virus, there is little or no preexisting immunity to NDV in humans and NDV propagates to high titers in both chicken eggs and cell culture. As a paramyxovirus, there is no DNA phase in the virus lifecycle reducing concerns of integration events, and the levels of gene expression are driven by the proximity to the leader sequence at the 3' end of the viral genome. This gradient of gene expression enables attenuation through rearrangement of the genome, or by insertion of transgenes within the genome. Finally, pathogenicity of NDV is largely determined by features of the fusion protein enabling ready attenuation of the vaccine vector [84] . Reverse genetics, a method that allows NDV to be rescued from plasmids expressing the viral RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid proteins, was first reported in 1999 [85, 86] . This process has enabled manipulation of the NDV genome as well as incorporation of transgenes and the development of NDV vectors. Influenza was the first infectious disease targeted with a recombinant NDV (rNDV) vector. The HA protein of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) was inserted into the Hitchner B1 vaccine strain. The HA protein was expressed on infected cells and was incorporated into infectious virions. While the virus was attenuated compared to the parental vaccine strain, it induced a robust serum antibody response and protected against homologous influenza virus challenge in a murine model of infection [87] . Subsequently, rNDV was tested as a vaccine vector for HPAIV having varying efficacy against H5 and H7 influenza virus infections in poultry [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . These vaccines have the added benefit of potentially providing protection against both the influenza virus and NDV infection. NDV has also been explored as a vaccine vector for humans. Two NHP studies assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of an rNDV expressing the HA or NA of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; VN1203) [95, 96] . Intranasal and intratracheal delivery of the rNDV-HA or rNDV-NA vaccines induced both serum and mucosal antibody responses and protected from HPAIV challenge [95, 96] . NDV has limited clinical data; however, phase I and phase I/II clinical trials have shown that the NDV vector is well-tolerated, even at high doses delivered intravenously [44, 97] . While these results are promising, additional studies are needed to advance NDV as a human vaccine vector for influenza. Parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) is a paramyxovirus vaccine vector being explored for delivery of influenza and other infectious disease vaccine antigens. PIV5 has only recently been described as a vaccine vector [98] . Similar to other RNA viruses, PIV5 has a number of features that make it an attractive vaccine vector. For example, PIV5 has a stable RNA genome and no DNA phase in virus replication cycle reducing concerns of host genome integration or modification. PIV5 can be grown to very high titers in mammalian vaccine cell culture substrates and is not cytopathic allowing for extended culture and harvest of vaccine virus [98, 99] .Question: What is the disadvantage of inclusion of non-HA  antigens to HA based vaccines?","answer":"as both CD8 + T cell and neutralizing antibody responses are generated by the vector and vaccine antigens, immunological memory to these components can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The topology of the second extracellular loop (ECL2) and its interaction with ligands is unique in each G protein-coupled receptor. When the orthosteric ligand pocket located in the transmembrane (TM) domain is occupied, ligand-specific conformational changes occur in the ECL2. In more than 90% of G protein-coupled receptors, ECL2 is tethered to the third TM helix via a disulfide bond. Therefore, understanding the extent to which the TM domain and ECL2 conformations are coupled is useful. To investigate this, we examined conformational changes in ECL2 of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) by introducing mutations in distant sites that alter the activation state equilibrium of the AT1R. Differential accessibility of reporter cysteines introduced at four conformation-sensitive sites in ECL2 of these mutants was measured. Binding of the agonist angiotensin II (AngII) and inverse agonist losartan in wild-type AT1R changed the accessibility of reporter cysteines, and the pattern was consistent with ligand-specific \\" lid \\" conformations of ECL2. Without agonist stimulation, the ECL2 in the gain of function mutant N111 G assumed a lid conformation similar to AngII-bound wild-type AT1R. In the presence of inverse agonists, the conformation of ECL2 in the N111 G mutant was similar to the inactive state of wild-type AT1R. In contrast, AngII did not induce a lid conformation in ECL2 in the loss of function D281A mutant, which is consistent with the reduced AngII binding affinity in this mutant. However, a lid conformation was induced by [ Sar (1),Gln (2),Ile (8) ] AngII, a specific analog that binds to the D281A mutant with better affinity than AngII. These results provide evidence for the emerging paradigm of domain coupling facilitated by long range interactions at distant sites on the same receptor.","answer":"[[\\"cysteines\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"AT1R\\"], [\\"losartan\\", \\"AGONIST-INHIBITOR\\", \\"AT1R\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Sex hormone expression is altered among patients with autoimmune disease, and this variation of expression contributes to immune dysregulation.ex hormones affect the function of the mammalian immune system, and sex hormone expression is different in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus than in healthy subjects. Sex hormones play a role in the genesis of autoimmunity.Most recently, sex chromosome abnormalities and skewed X chromosome inactivation have been suggested as novel players, particularly in later-onset diseases.As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.The gut microbiome, which impacts the innate and adaptive branches of immunity, not only influences the development of autoimmune disorders but may interact with sex-hormones to modulate disease progression and sex-bias.Recent studies investigating the origins of sex bias in autoimmune disease have revealed an extensive and interconnected network of genetic, hormonal, microbial, and environmental influences. Investigation of sex hormones has moved beyond profiling the effects of hormones on activity and prevalence of immune cell types to defining the specific immunity-related genes driving these changes","answer":"Female"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a materials science research paper.

Zn(NO3)2 (1 mmol) dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water with continuous stirring. NaOH solution was added into the drop by drop until the pH of the solution became 12. The resulting white particles were washed three times with distilled water and dried for 24 h at 80 degC. At this point, the white product did not show high crystallinity since it consisted of ZnO and Zn(OH)2. Calcining at 500 degC for 1 h was necessary to obtain high crystalline ZnO [30].Synthesis of CuxZn1-xO (1% Cu-doped) nanopowder was carried out using a modified procedure [23] and [24]. The targets were specifically designed using high purity Zn(NO3)2*6H2O (99.99%) and CuSO4*5H2O (99%) powders. The Cu-doped ZnO catalyst was prepared by a two-step procedure: (1) preparation of the precursor by co-precipitation; (2) formation of the Cu/ZnO nanopowder by thermal decomposition. This method has been considered to be efficient and inexpensive, allowing for the production of high purity, homogeneous, and fine crystalline powders.Stoichiometric quantities of Zn and Cu salts were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized double distilled water (solution A). Separately, a solution was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of NaOH and Na2CO3 in deionized double distilled water (solution B). Solution A was heated to 85 degC and solution B was added dropwise into it with constant stirring. The temperature was maintained at 85 degC and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h and refluxed through a water condenser. The resulting solution was cooled to room temperature and the green precipitate that formed was washed with 3 x 20 mL of de-ionized water and dried under vacuum overnight at 50 degC. Finally, the precursors were calcined at 450 degC for 90 min in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere to obtain the nanocrystalline Cu/ZnO powder.","answer":"[{\\"arguments\\": [[\\"ZnO\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"prepared\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"Zn(NO3)2\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"], [\\"water\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"dissolved\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"NaOH\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"added\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"solution\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"became\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"particles\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"], [\\"water\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"washed\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"product\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"show\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"ZnO\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"obtain\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"CuxZn1-xO\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"Synthesis\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"CuSO4*5H2O\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"], [\\"targets\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"], [\\"Zn(NO3)2*6H2O\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"designed\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"ZnO\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"prepared\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"Cu/ZnO\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"formation\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"precursor\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"co-precipitation\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"powders\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"production\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"Zn\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"], [\\"Cu\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"], [\\"water\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"dissolved\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"solution\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"prepared\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"Na2CO3\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"], [\\"NaOH\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"], [\\"water\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"dissolving\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"Solution A\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"heated\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"solution B\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"added\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"mixture\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"stirred\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"solution\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"cooled\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"precipitate\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"formed\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"water\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"washed\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"air\\", \\"Atmospheric_Material\\"], [\\"precursors\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"calcined\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"Cu/ZnO\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"obtain\\"}]"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein acts as a potent proinflammatory cytokine and is involved in the pathogenesis of several vascular diseases, such as, systemic vasculitis and sepsis. Emodin-6-O-β-D-glucoside (EG) is a new active compound from Reynoutria japonica, and its biologic activities have not been previously investigated. In this study, we first investigated the antiinflammatory activities of EG on HMGB1-mediated proinflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) -model of sepsis in mice. EG was found to suppress the release of HMGB1, the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by HMGB1 in HUVECs, and to inhibit HMGB1-mediated hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration in mice. In the CLP model, HMGB1 was highly released, but this release was prevented by EG. Furthermore, EG also increased the survival times of CLP administered mice. Collectively, this study shows EG can protect barrier integrity and inhibit HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses, which suggests a potential use as a therapy for sepsis or septic shock.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We investigated the composition of essential oil from fingered citron (Citrus medica L. var. sarcodactylis) (FCEO) peels by GC-MS and its anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells. Fifteen compounds, representing 98.97% of the essential oil, were tentatively identified; the main constituents were limonene (52.44%) and γ-terpinene (28.41%). FCEO significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by suppressing the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, respectively. Additionally, FCEO suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. FCEO attenuated LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation via inhibition of inhibitor κB-α phosphorylation. Furthermore, FCEO blocked activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not that of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results indicate that FCEO inhibits LPS-stimulated inflammation by blocking the NF-κB, JNK, and ERK pathways in macrophages, and demonstrate that FCEO possesses anti-inflammatory properties.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"u03b3-terpinene\\", \\"PGE2\\", \\"prostaglandin E2\\", \\"nitric oxide\\", \\"limonene\\", \\"NO\\"]}"},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

n = 72 ) and the indeterminate / asymptomatic form ( asy ; n = 40 ) .the patients were recruited from the heart institute ( incor ) , university of sao paulo school of medicine .chronic chagas cardiomyopathy ( ccc ) subjects fulfilled the following diagnostic criteria : positive t. cruzi serology , typical ecg abnormalities ( left anterior hemiblock and/or right bundle branch hemiblock ) , with or without varying degrees of ventricular dysfunction , with all other etiologies of ventricular dysfunction / heart failure excluded .indeterminate / asymptomatic subjects ( asy ) showed positive t. cruzi serology but normal ecg and bidimensional echocardiography .the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the university of so paulo school of medicine .all patients had given informed consent for the use of their blood samples for research .dr typing was performed by low - resolution pcr - ssp as previously described [ 2022 ] .dqa1 , and dqb1 typing was performed by pcr - sso using generic primers for exon-2 amplification .96-well polystyrene plates ( corning , usa ) were coated with 30  ng / well of recombinant b13 protein in carbonate - bicarbonate buffer , ph 9.6 , for 16  h at 4c .serum samples at 1/50 dilution were incubated for 1  h at 37c . after ten washing cycles with pbs-0.1% tween 20 ( pbs - t ), wells were incubated with hrp - conjugated anti - human igg for 30 at 37c .after ten additional washing cycles with pbs - t , samples were incubated with substrate solution ( 4  mg opd in 10  ml citrate buffer , ph 5.0 ) for 30 at 37c .anti - b13 antibody subclass measurement was carried out by elisa following essentially the same protocol described above except that a concentration curve was made by incubating different concentrations of igg subclass ( igg1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) standards .we also used hrp conjugated mouse anti - human igg1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ( pharminrgen bd ) diluted in pbs containing 1% calf serum pbs - t that was added to each well ( dilution of 1  :  1,000 ) .after 1-hr incubation at 37c , plates were incubated with substrate solution ( 4  mg opd in 10  ml citrate buffer , ph 5.0 ) for 30 at 37c .the cutoff value was determined as the mean value of optical densities from control sera plus 3 standard deviations .groups were compared by a nonparametrical test ( mann - whitney rank sum test ) with graphpad instat software ( version 5.0 ; graphpad ) .we divided the 112 t. cruzi - infected patients into two groups , 76 subjects bearing one or more of the hla alleles required for presentation of b13 to t cells ( hla - dq7 , dr1 , and dr2 ) , termed hla+ , and 36 subjects lacking these alleles , hla.   figure 1 shows that there was no significant difference in total igg reactivity to b13 between hla+ and hla patients .we then subdivided the group of subjects into different clinical presentations of chagas disease , ccc ( n = 72 ) and asy ( n = 40 ) .sera from ccc patients displayed a significantly higher total igg anti - b13 reactivity than asy patients , although there was some overlap between samples in both groups ( figure 2 ) .when we further stratified the clinical groups in hla+ and hla patients , we observed no significant difference in total igg anti - b13 reactivity between samples from hla+ to hla patients from the ccc and asy groups ( figure 3 ) .we evaluated whether the presence or absence of the relevant hla alleles was associated with differences in distribution among the four igg subclasses analyzing 87 subjects ( hla+ ; n = 53 , and hla ; n = 34 ) .  figure 4 shows that there were no differences in the distribution of igg subclasses between groups , with igg subclass levels ranking from igg1 >we further stratified the subjects in our study separating them into the two clinical forms of chagas disease , ccc ( n = 32 ) and asy ( n = 39 ) , inside the two hla groups ( hla+ and hla ) , but no significant difference was observed ( figure 5 ) .in this study , we further analyzed the magnitude of igg responses and igg subclasses to the t. cruzi tandemly repetitive b13 antigen in chagas patients .we demonstrated that there is no difference in anti - b13 igg antibody levels between patients carrying the b13 presenting hla class ii molecules , associated to t cell responses ( hla+ ) and those carrying other alleles ( hla ) .nevertheless , we found increased anti - b13 igg levels in sera from ccc as compared to asy patients , but no differences in anti - b13 igg levels were observed between hla+ and hla patients in the ccc and asy groups . regarding igg subclasses , there was a predominance of igg1 against b13 protein antigen , in both patient groups ( hla+ and hla ) ; we also found no difference in levels of any of the igg subtypes in the ccc and asy groups , regardless of their hla type .the finding that anti - b13 igg antibody levels of patients carrying the b13-presenting hla class ii molecules , associated to t cell responses , are similar to those carrying other alleles argues against a role for genetically restricted ( thus , cognate ) t cell help to anti - b13 antibody production . on the other hand , the igg subclass distribution of anti - b13 antibodies predominantly igg1argues against its being a strict t - independent ( t1 - 2 ) antigen , since , even though it shows no genetic restriction , it fails to induce igg2 antibodies as descript for tandemly repetitive carbohydrate antigens [ 46 ] .antibodies against nonrepetitive ( and presumably t - dependent ) recombinant proteins   or t. cruzi epimastigote homogenate   in sera from chronic chagasic patients were essentially of the igg1 and igg3 subclasses .our finding that the predominant igg subclass in the anti - b13 response is igg1 supports the idea that the igg antibodies may be generated under noncognate t cell help .this is further supported by the absence of genetic restriction of the anti - b13 igg antibody responses .it is conceivable that b13-specific b cells may receive noncognate help from t cells specific for other t. cruzi proteins , cointernalized with b13 , during t. cruzi infection .the same mechanism has been observed in systemic lupus erythematosus , where dna - specific b cells may be helped by t cells specific for histones or other nuclear proteins .however , since the nature of the b13 protein available for endocytosis by b cells during t. cruzi infection is unknown , this argument remains speculative .the significant difference found in anti - b13 igg antibody levels in ccc as compared to asy is striking .this has also been reported for a few other recombinant t. cruzi antigens , such as antigens jl5 ,b13 and jl5 have been described as cross - reactive with cardiac myosin [ 2830 ] and cardiovascular beta - adrenergic and cholinergic receptors respectively .it is possible that the higher levels displayed in sera from ccc patients of these two potentially pathogenic cross - reactive antibody systems are biologically relevant in the generation of pathological autoimmunity .our results indicate that , even though b13 protein is a tandemly repetitive , ti antigen , the detectable igg response to it apparently depends on noncognate t cell help .further studies , including assessing direct b - cell activation by b13 , may be necessary to definitively establish the nature of the serum igg response to b13 found in chronic chagas disease patients .","answer":"the tandemly repetitive trypanosoma cruzi b13 protein is an immunodominant antigen among chagas disease patients .  such repetitive domains may behave as t - independent antigens .  however , t cells can recognize b13 epitopes in an hla class ii - restricted fashion and could potentially provide cognate t cell help and boost antibody titers .  we assessed whether the presence of hla class ii molecules able to present b13 epitopes to t cells could affect anti - b13 igg levels in a cognate fashion , in both major clinical forms of chronic chagas disease .  we found no difference between anti - b13 igg antibody levels between patients carrying hla class ii molecules associated to t cell responses or other alleles .  the predominant anti - b13 igg subclass was igg1 , with negligible igg2 , suggesting a t - dependent , noncognate help for antibody production .  in addition , the finding of increased anti - b13 igg levels in sera from ccc patients indicates that clinical presentation is associated with increased anti - b13 antibody levels ."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

We retrospectively obtained microbiology laboratory and hospital databases of nine public hospitals in northeast Thailand from 2004 to 2010, and linked these with the national death registry to obtain the 30-day mortality outcome. The 30-day mortality in those with MDR community-acquired bacteraemia, healthcare-associated bacteraemia, and hospital-acquired bacteraemia were 35%( 549/1555), 49%( 247/500), and 53%( 640/1198), respectively. We estimate that 19, 122 of 45, 209( 43%) deaths in patients with hospital-acquired infection due to MDR bacteria in Thailand in 2010 represented excess mortality caused by MDR. We demonstrate that national statistics on the epidemiology and burden of MDR in LMICs could be improved by integrating information from readily available databases. The prevalence and mortality attributable to MDR in Thailand are high. This is likely to reflect the situation in other LMICs.Introduction:The emergence of antimicrobial resistance( AMR) is of major medical concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries( LMICs)( World Health Organization, 2014; Laxminarayan et al., 2013). In LMICs, antibiotic use is increasing with rising incomes, affordable antimicrobials and the lack of stewardship in hospital and poor control of over-the-counter sales. This is driving the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant( MDR) pathogens in community and hospital settings. Hospital data from LMICs suggest that the cumulative incidence of community-acquired Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase( ESBL) producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections are increasing over time( Kanoksil et al., 2013; Ansari et al., 2015). A recent report from the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium( INICC) also showed that the prevalence of AMR organisms causing hospital-acquired infections( HAI) in ICUs in LMICs is much higher than those in the United States( US)( Rosenthal et al., 2014). Attributable mortality, generally defined as the difference in mortality between those with and without the condition of interest, is an important parameter used to estimate the burden of AMR. In the US, it is estimated that mortality from infection attributable to AMR is 6. 5%,( Roberts et al., 2009) leading to an estimate of 23, 000 deaths attributable to AMR each year( Center for Disease Controls and Prevention and U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2013). In the European Union, it is estimated that the number of deaths attributable to selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria is about 25, 000 each year( European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and European Medicines Agency, 2009). There is limited information on mortality attributable to AMR in LMICs. The mortality attributable to ventilator-associated pneumonia in ICUs in Colombia, Peru, and Argentina is estimated to be 17%, 25%, and 35%, respectively, and is associated with a high percentage of AMR organisms( Moreno et al., 2006; Cuellar et al., 2008; Rosenthal et al., 2003). The mortality attributable to ESBL and methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus( MRSA) is estimated to be 27% and 34% in neonatal sepsis in Tanzania, respectively,( Kayange et al., 2010) which has been used to postulate an estimate that 58, 319 deaths could be attributable to ESBL and MRSA in India alone( Laxminarayan et al., 2013). In an effort to harmonize the surveillance systems of AMR, a joint initiative between the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control( ECDC) and the Centres for Disease Prevention and Control( CDC) have developed standard definitions of multidrug-resistance( MDR)( Magiorakos et al., 2012). We recently combined large data sets from multiple sources including microbiology databases, hospital admission databases, and the national death registry from a sample of ten public hospitals in northeast Thailand from 2004 to 2010( Kanoksil et al., 2013; Hongsuwan et al., 2014). We defined community-acquired bacteraemia( CAB) as the isolation of a pathogenic bacterium from blood taken in the first 2 days of admission and without a hospital stay in the 30 days prior to admission, healthcare-associated bacteraemia( HCAB) as the isolation of a pathogenic bacterium from blood taken in the first 2 days of admission and with a hospital stay within 30 days prior to the admission, and hospital-acquired bacteraemia( HAB) as the isolation of a pathogenic bacterium from blood taken after the first 2 days of admission( Kanoksil et al., 2013; Hongsuwan et al., 2014). We reported an increase in the incidence of CAB, HCAB and HAB over the study period, and that bacteraemia was associated with high case fatality rates( 37. 5%, 41. 8% and 45. 5%, respectively)( Kanoksil et al., 2013; Hongsuwan et al., 2014). Here, we apply ECDC/CDC standard definitions of MDR to this large data set to evaluate the prevalence, trends, and mortality attributable to MDR bacteria isolated from the blood. We then estimate the number of deaths attributable to MDR in Thailand nationwide.Discussion:This study presents detailed antimicrobial susceptibility data on common pathogenic bacteria, the association of MDR with infection acquisition( community-acquired, healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired), and excess mortality from MDR in a developing country. Our estimate of excess deaths caused by MDR in HAI patients in Thailand( 19, 122 deaths per year in a country of about 66 million population in 2010) is large compared to those estimated in USA( 23, 000 death per year in a country of 316 million population in 2013)( Center for Disease Controls and Prevention and U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2013) and the European Union( 25, 000 deaths per year in EU of about 500 million population in 2007)( European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and European Medicines Agency, 2009). Our study highlights the need for public health officials and international health organizations to improve systems to track and reduce the burden of AMR in LMICs. Our estimated mortality for those with MDR HAI( 45, 209, Table 2) is higher than those previously published by Pumart et al.( 38, 481)( Pumart et al., 2012), probably because we used 30-day mortality rather than in-hospital mortality. Acinetobacter spp. is increasingly recognized as an important cause of HAI,( Munoz-Price and Weinstein, 2008; Peleg and Hooper, 2010) and our study confirms the importance of this species as a leading cause of hospital-acquired MDR infection in a developing tropical country( Hongsuwan et al., 2014; Nhu et al., 2014). The high mortality observed in MDR Acinetobacter spp. bacteraemia is because treatment options are limited and those available are associated with toxicity( Fishbain and Peleg, 2010). The high proportions of S. aureus, E. coli and K. pneumoniae bactaeremia being caused by MRSA and E. coli and K. pneumoniae non-susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, respectively, are consistent with previous reports from other tropical countries( Moreno et al., 2006; Cuellar et al., 2008; Rosenthal et al., 2003). The rising proportions of community-acquired E. coli and K. pneumoniae bacteraemia being caused by E. coli and K. pneumoniae non-susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and the rising proportion of hospital-acquired Acinetobacter bacteraemia being causing Acinetobacter non-susceptible to carbapenem suggest that the burden of AMR in Thailand is deteriorating over time. A limitation of this study is that more complete clinical data were not available. Mortality attributable to MDR could be overestimated if MDR infection was associated with more severely ill patients in ICUs. However, our estimated attributable mortality is comparable to the previous reports. For example, our estimated mortality attributable to MDR Acinetobacter bacteraemia( 40. 6%) is comparable to the mortality attributable to imipenem resistant Acinetobacter bacteraemia reported by Kwon et al. in Korea( 41. 1%), which was adjusted by severity of illness( Kwon et al., 2007; Falagas and Rafailidis, 2007). In addition, data on hospitalization in other hospitals not participating in the study( for example, a smaller community hospital or a private hospital in the province) were not available, which could have resulted in a misclassification of CAB, HCAB and HAB in some cases. We also note that data on attributable mortality from different countries is difficult to compare because of the differing study designs. For example, our mortality outcome is the overall 30-day mortality, including both directly and indirectly contributed to MDR, while an EU study only considered directly attributable deaths( European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and European Medicines Agency, 2009). The p values for trends were generated by the stratification method; therefore, the analysis was not biased towards the increasing availability of the hospital data over the study period. Nonetheless, the trends could be affected by an increasing use of blood culture, changes in antimicrobial agents tested for susceptibility, and greater standardization of laboratory methodologies over time( Opartkiattikul and Bejrachandra, 2002). It is likely that the burdens of MDR similar to that observed in our study are present in many secondary and tertiary hospitals in tropical LMICs, particularly where extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem are widely used. Nonetheless, resources for diagnostics, methodologies used in the laboratories, and study designs need to be carefully considered when performing a comparison between different settings. Despite the increasing global focus on AMR in LMICs, considerable gaps remain in our understanding of the scale of the problem. We have demonstrated that the integration of information from readily available routinely collected databases can provide valuable information on the trends and mortality attributable to AMR in Thailand. The methodology used in our study could be applied to explore the burden of AMR in other LMICs where microbiological facilities and hospital admission database are available.","answer":"Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem . Each year , an estimated 23 , 000 deaths in the United States and 25 , 000 deaths in the European Union are extra deaths caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics . People in low- and middle-income countries are also using more antibiotics , in part because of rising incomes , lower costs of antibiotics , and a lack of control of antimicrobial usage in the hospitals and over-the-counter sales of the drugs . These factors are thought to be driving the development and spread of bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics in countries such as China , India , Indonesia and Thailand . However , a lack of information makes it difficult to estimate the size of the problem and , then , to track how antimicrobial resistance and multi-drug resistance is changing over time in these and other low- and middle-income countries . Now , by integrating routinely collected data from a range of databases , Lim , Takahashi et al . estimate that around an extra 19 , 000 deaths are caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria in Thailand each year . Thailand has a population of about 70 million , and so , per capita , this estimate is about 3 to 5 times larger than those for the United States and European Union ( which have a populations of about 300 million and 500 million , respectively ) . Lim , Takahashi et al . also show that more of the bacteria collected from patients are resistant to multiple antimicrobial drugs and that the burden of antimicrobial resistance in Thailand is worsening over time . These findings suggest that more studies with a systematic approach need to be done in other low- and middle-income countries , especially in countries where microbiological laboratories are readily available and routinely used . Further work is also needed to identify where resources and attentions are most needed to effectively fight against antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

T1) directs male-specific axonal pruning in mice. It is unknown whether other cues modulate these processes. We detected specific, non-dimorphic, expression of Semaphorin family members in the mouse mammary gland, which signal through PlexinA4. PlexinA4 deletion in both female and male embryos caused developmental hyperinnervation of the gland, which could be reduced by genetic co-reduction of BDNF. Moreover, in males, PlexinA4 ablation delayed axonal pruning, independently of the initial levels of innervation. In support of this, in vitro reduction of BDNF induced axonal hypersensitivity to PlexinA4 signaling. Overall, our study shows that precise sensory innervation of the mammary gland is regulated by the balance between trophic and repulsive signaling. Upon inhibition of trophic signaling, these repulsive factors may promote axonal pruning.Introduction:During development of the peripheral nervous system, specific neuronal connections are being established to ensure its proper function. Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia( DRG) initially extend their axons toward their targets by responding to attractive and repulsive cues expressed in the extracellular environment along their trajectory( Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011). Once axons reach the targets, limiting amounts of neurotrophic factors control target innervation by regulating axonal growth, neuronal cell death, and pruning( Huang and Reichardt, 2001). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor( BDNF) acts as a survival factor for specific subsets of sensory neurons during development( Kirstein and Fariñas, 2002), and regulates mechanosensation( Carroll et al., 1998). During early development of the mammary gland, BDNF is required to establish and maintain sensory innervation in both female and male embryos. In males only, at later stages of development, sequestering of BDNF by a truncated form of TrkB( TrkB. T1) results in elimination of the axons innervating the gland. This elimination is not blocked in the Bax knockout( KO), suggesting that it occurs through axonal pruning rather than cell death( Liu et al., 2012). As a result, a sexually dimorphic pattern of mammary gland sensory innervations is formed. Whether other cues operate in concert with BDNF, both in females and males, is unknown. The Semaphorins belong to a large family of secreted and membrane-bound guidance cues. The 27 family members are divided into\uFEFF 8 subclasses according to structural homology( Pasterkamp, 2012). Initially characterized for their importance in axonal guidance during development, Semaphorins are now known to be involved in multiple developmental processes including axonal fasciculation, pruning, dendritic guidance, and modulation of the immune system( Pasterkamp and Kolodkin, 2003; Yazdani and Terman, 2006; Tang et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008). Two receptor families have been implicated in mediating Semaphorin family functions: Plexins and Neuropilins( Fujisawa and Kitsukawa, 1998). Most class 3 Semaphorins bind to Neuropilins, which associate with type A Plexin family members to transduce their signals through the plasma membrane. Other members of the Semaphorin family bind and signal directly through Plexin receptors( Yoshida, 2012). Moreover, previous in vitro and overexpression studies demonstrated a crosstalk between class 3 Semaphorins and neurotrophins( Dontchev and Letourneau, 2002; Atwal et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2004; Ben-Zvi et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2007; Ben-Zvi et al., 2008). Here we show that opposing effects of neurotrophic( BDNF) and repulsive( Semaphorins) factors regulate the sensory innervation of the mammary gland, and that the repulsive factors may promote axonal pruning once trophic signaling is inhibited.Discussion:The process of target innervation by sensory axons during embryonic development is largely regulated by neurotrophic factors secreted by the target in limited amounts. Studies of NGF have demonstrated a strong correlation between its expression and the innervation density of the skin( Davies et al., 1987), and that overexpression of NGF results in hyperinnervation of the target organ( Albers et al., 1994). However, there is growing evidence that additional target-derived cues are involved in specifying innervation, some through interaction with the neurotrophin signaling pathways( Guha et al., 2004; Bäumer et al., 2014; Wheeler et al., 2014). The mammary gland serves as a unique model for sexually dimorphic target innervation controlled by BDNF, but whether other factors regulate this process jointly with BDNF was not known. Through the studies described here, we discovered a critical role for the Semaphorin-PlexinA4 signaling pathway in axonal innervation restriction and possibly pruning promotion. Our studies uncovered a non-dimorphic expression of several members of the Semaphorin family in the mammary gland that signal through PlexinA4. Since the Androgen receptor is not expressed in DRG neurons( Liu et al., 2012), it is likely that PlexinA4 is expressed in non-dimorphic manner as well. In vivo ablation of PlexinA4 caused hyperinnervation of the gland in female embryos. This effect of PlexinA4 ablation was reversed by genetic reduction of BDNF levels in PlexinA4 KO/BDNF Het embryos, which exhibited normal innervation of the mammary gland, indistinguishable from WT levels, at late E14. These results suggest that although BDNF is expressed in limited amounts, its physiological levels are sufficient to sustain high levels of innervation, which are curbed by Semaphorin signaling. In male embryos, ablation of PlexinA4 resulted in initial hyperinnervation of the gland. Co-reduction of BDNF with PlexinA4 ablation dramatically reduced the initial hyperinnervation at late E12, although this was not observed in females at the same stage. The basis for this difference is currently unclear, however, it may reflect an intrinsic hypersensitivity of the male axons to BDNF levels, which is only revealed on the background of PlexinA4 KO. This hypersensitivity may help to promote pruning once BDNF is sequestered. We detected delayed pruning of the fibers innervating the gland in the PlexinA4 KO and the PlexinA4 KO/BDNF het, supporting a model in which PlexinA4 promotes pruning independently of the initial levels of innervation. However, we cannot exclude the idea that the excess initial axonal innervation by itself generates a protective mechanism against pruning, for example by axon-axon adhesion as was observed in flies( Bornstein et al., 2015). Lastly, while our results show that ablation of PlexinA4 does not affect the expression of TrkB. T1, we were not able to visualize BDNF at the gland by immunostaining. Therefore, we cannot completely dismiss the possibility that ablation of PlexinA4 affects the expression of BDNF. Using in vitro growth cone collapse assays with low levels of BDNF resulted in hypersensitivity to PlexinA4 signaling, showing that inhibition of BDNF signaling renders the axons more sensitive to PlexinA4. Although this assay is mainly correlated with growth inhibition by the Semaphorins and not axonal pruning, a recent study suggested that growth cone collapse is an early and critical step in axonal degeneration in response to trophic deprivation( Unsain et al., 2018). Therefore, the hypersensitivity to PlexinA4-induced growth cone collapse may reflect promotion of the pruning process. Interestingly, while BDNF counteracts PlexinA4 effects, our results suggest that PlexinA4 and the BDNF receptor isoform TrkB. T1 operate in the same pathway of axonal elimination, since co-ablation of the two did not have any additive effect. This result supports previous data that TrkB. T1 antagonizes BDNF signaling in the mammary gland( Liu et al., 2012). Nevertheless, neither ablation of PlexinA4 or of TrkB. T1 was able to prevent pruning at late E14, when the innervation density drops sharply. During mammary organogenesis, the mammary gland of male embryos starts to regress as a result of Androgen release by the male gonads at E13( Robinson, 2007), and this regression probably forces elimination of the axons. Altogether, our study shows that developmental innervation of the mammary gland is regulated by a balance between BDNF, which promotes the initial ingrowth of the sensory fibers, and constant Semaphorin signaling, which restricts innervation( Figure 8A). Upon inhibition of BDNF-TrkB signaling, Semaphorin-PlexinA4 signaling may promote axonal pruning( Figure 8B). A previous in vitro study has demonstrated that the class 3 Semaphorins inhibit neurotrophin signaling and that this inhibition is a part of the mechanism by which they induce growth cone collapse( Atwal et al., 2003). Our results also support the idea that neurotrophins signaling suppresses the Semaphorin signaling, and once this suppression is relieved, the axons become hypersensitive to Semaphorins, as was proposed by Dontchev and Letourneau( Dontchev and Letourneau, 2002). Overall, our work provides the first clear evidence that the balance between these two cues plays a role in accurate wiring of the nervous system during development, and that physiologically tipping this balance may induce axonal pruning. The Semaphorins have been previously implicated in pruning of hippocampal axons, where developmental expression of Sema3F was proposed to largely regulate this process( Bagri et al., 2003). In contrast, in the mammary gland, we did not detect any dimorphic or temporal expression of Semaphorins or PlexinA4; instead, our results suggest that their ability to prune axons in male embryos is gated by inhibition of BDNF signaling. Whether there are equivalent mechanisms that gate Semaphorin-dependent axonal pruning in the hippocampus remains to be discovered. Expression of Semaphorins and Plexins has been previously demonstrated in the developing mammary gland postnatally, and was suggested to affect ductal growth and morphogenesis of the gland( Morris et al., 2006). Here we present new data that show expression of Sema3D and Sema6A in the mammary epithelium during embryonic development, and their involvement in regulation of the mammary gland innervation through the PlexinA4 receptor. We also detected expression of Sema3F in the mammary epithelium, but in vitro it had no effect on growth cone collapse of BDNF-responsive sensory neurons, suggesting it is not involved in target innervation. It may have a role in the regulation of ductal directional outgrowth and branching morphogenesis during later development. This is supported by the fact that Neuropilin2, which serves as the binding receptor of Sema3F( Yoshida, 2012), promotes postnatal branching morphogenesis of the mammary gland( Goel et al., 2011). Together, these results suggest that the Semaphorins play a dual role in mammary gland development, determining the extent of sensory innervation density prenatally and promoting gland morphogenesis postnatally. Intriguingly, the neurotrophins and the Semaphorins continue to be expressed in peripheral tissues throughout the life of the organism, and their expression may be altered in pathological conditions( Apfel, 1999; Yamaguchi et al., 2008; Tominaga et al., 2009). Our findings raise the possibility that altered expression of these cues could induce aberrant innervation in mature animals, causing either hypersensitivity or reduced sensation, depending on the balance between these pathways.","answer":"Almost every action an animal can perform in its life will rely on its nervous system being wired correctly . Before the animal is born , nerve cells next to the spinal cord send out long fibers – called axons – to connect with different parts of its body . These nerves will help relay sensations to the brain . The ends of the nerve fibers follow trails of signals that guide them to the correct targets . When the axon arrives in the right place , it can receive further signals called neurotrophic factors . These signals keep the axon alive , but they are in short supply . Not every axon will receive the signal , and , without it , the nerve fiber dies back . This phenomenon , known as pruning , helps to make sure that nervous system does not form more connections than it needs . In mammals , the mammary gland is an example of a part of the body where nerve endings are pruned during development . Axons that connect to this milk-producing gland depend on a neurotrophic factor called BDNF to survive , and BDNF is controlled differently in males and females . In male mammals , another protein grabs hold of the BDNF signal and hides it away before development is complete . After this happens , the axons start to die , however it was not clear if other signals are also involved . Sar Shalom et al . have now examined if proteins called Semaphorins – which guide axons to their target locations and influence pruning too – also control how many nerves end up connected to the mammary gland . The experiments used nerve cells grown in the laboratory and genetically modified mice , and suggested that the nerves in the mammary gland would only develop correctly if the BDNF and Semaphorins signals were properly balanced . When the lab-grown nerve cells encountered Semaphorins , their growing axons collapsed . Yet unlike for BDNF , the levels of Semaphorins were the same in male and female mice . Further experiments showed that if a protein receptor that detects the Semaphorins was deleted , the nerve cells stopped responding to the signal , and their axons did not collapse . In mice lacking this receptor , both sexes ended up with more axons in their mammary glands . Too many axons grew in the female mice , while the pruning of excess axons was delayed in the males . Reducing the levels of BDNF in these mice helped to return axon growth to normal . Together , these findings suggest that a balance between the BDNF and the Semaphorins sets the correct number of nerves . They also suggest that once the BNDF signal is removed during the normal development of males , it is the Semaphorins that help the axons in the mammary gland to be pruned . Lastly , neurotrophic factors and Semaphorins are not just important during development; indeed cells make them well into adulthood . Altered patterns of these signals in mature animals could change the shapes of nerve networks . As such , future work may help scientists to understand why tissues can become too sensitive or lose sensation ."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

A long-standing question in neurodevelopment is how neurons develop a single axon and multiple dendrites from common immature neurites. Long-range inhibitory signaling from the growing axon is hypothesized to prevent outgrowth of other immature neurites and to differentiate them into dendrites, but the existence and nature of this inhibitory signaling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that axonal growth triggered by neurotrophin-3 remotely inhibits neurite outgrowth through long-range Ca(2+) waves, which are delivered from the growing axon to the cell body. These Ca(2+) waves increase RhoA activity in the cell body through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I. Optogenetic control of Rho-kinase combined with computational modeling reveals that active Rho-kinase diffuses to growing other immature neurites and inhibits their outgrowth. Mechanistically, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I phosphorylates a RhoA-specific GEF, GEF-H1, whose phosphorylation enhances its GEF activity. Thus, our results reveal that long-range inhibitory signaling mediated by Ca(2+) wave is responsible for neuronal polarization.Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota influences immune function in the brain and may play a role in neurological diseases.

Unlike bilateral negotiation between two individuals, this type of negotiations entails to adopt an intra-team strategy for negotiation teams in order to make team decisions and accordingly negotiate with the opponent. It is crucial to be able to negotiate successfully with heterogeneous opponents since opponents’ negotiation strategy and behavior may vary in an open environment. While one opponent might collaborate and concede over time, another may not be inclined to concede. This paper analyzes the performance of recently proposed intra-team strategies for negotiation teams against different categories of opponents: competitors, matchers, and conceders. Furthermore, it provides an extension of the negotiation tool Genius for negotiation teams in bilateral settings. Consequently, this work facilitates research in negotiation teams.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: It has been documented in the social sciences that cultural factors affect how people negotiate and behave in negotiations. Despite the importance of culture in the business world and politics, there is a lack of computational models that help to analyze how cultural factors affect negotiation. Moreover, while many negotiations take place between teams, there is a dearth of computational models for team negotiations. In this paper we present the first attempt to provide a computational model which takes into account cultural factors in a team negotiation setting. The model considers how two important cultural dimensions, power distance and individualism collectivism, affect team negotiation dynamics and negotiation outcomes. We conducted experiments in high low intra-team conflict scenarios. The results are compatible with social sciences findings from team decision making.[2]: In this article, an agent-based negotiation model for negotiation teams that negotiate a deal with an opponent is presented. Agent-based negotiation teams are groups of agents that join together as a single negotiation party because they share an interest that is related to the negotiation process. The model relies on a trusted mediator that coordinates and helps team members in the decisions that they have to take during the negotiation process: which offer is sent to the opponent, and whether the offers received from the opponent are accepted. The main strength of the proposed negotiation model is the fact that it guarantees unanimity within team decisions since decisions report a utility to team members that is greater than or equal to their aspiration levels at each negotiation round. This work analyzes how unanimous decisions are taken within the team and the robustness of the model against different types of manipulations. An empirical evaluation is also performed to study the impact of the different parameters of the model.[3]: [4]: In this article we study the impact of the negotiation environment on the performance of several intra-team strategies (team dynamics) for agent-based negotiation teams that negotiate with an opponent. An agent-based negotiation team is a group of agents that joins together as a party because they share common interests in the negotiation at hand. It is experimentally shown how negotiation environment conditions like the deadline of both parties, the concession speed of the opponent, similarity among team members, and team size affect performance metrics like the minimum utility of team members, the average utility of team members, and the number of negotiation rounds. Our goal is identifying which intra-team strategies work better in different environmental conditions in order to provide useful knowledge for team members to select appropriate intra-team strategies according to environmental conditions.","answer":"As far as we are concerned, only our previous works [3] [2] [1] [4] have considered negotiation teams in computational models. More specifically, the four different computational models introduced in this article are analyzed in different negotiation conditions when facing opponents governed by time tactics. However, the analysis does not include variability with respect to the strategy carried out by the opponent like the experiments carried out in this present article."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventy-four patients with carcinomas of the esophagus ( n = 43 ) or gastroesophageal junction ( n = 31 ) were studied . All patients underwent attenuation-corrected FDG-PET imaging , a spiral computed tomography ( CT ) scan , and an endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) . RESULTS FDG-PET demonstrated increased activity in the primary tumor in 70 of 74 patients ( sensitivity : 95 % ) . False-negative PET images were found in four patients with T1 lesions . Thirty-four patients ( 46 % ) had stage IV disease . FDG-PET had a higher accuracy for diagnosing stage IV disease compared with the combination of CT and EUS ( 82 % v 64 % , respectively ; P : = .004 ) . FDG-PET had additional diagnostic value in 16 ( 22 % ) of 74 patients by upstaging 11 ( 15 % ) and downstaging five ( 7 % ) patients . Thirty-nine ( 53 % ) of the 74 patients underwent a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy in conjunction with primary curative esophagectomy . In these patients , tumoral involvement was found in 21 local and 35 regional or distant lymph nodes ( LN ) . For local LN , the sensitivity of FDG-PET was lower than EUS ( 33 % v 81 % , respectively ; P : = .027 ) , but the specificity may have been higher ( 89 % v 67 % , respectively ; P : = not significant [ NS ] ) . For the assessment of regional and distant LN involvement , compared with the combined use of CT and EUS , FDG-PET had a higher specificity ( 90 % v 98 % , respectively ; P : = . 025 ) and a similar sensitivity ( 46 % v 43 % , respectively ; P : = NS ) . CONCLUSION PET significantly improves the detection of stage IV disease in EC compared with the conventional staging modalities . PET improves diagnostic specificity for LN stagingTitle 2:18F-FDG PET in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing curative surgery: prognostic implications.Abstract 2:UNLABELLED We investigated whether the st and ardized uptake value ( SUV ) of the primary tumor , the tumor length measured on a PET image , the number of (18)F-FDG PET-positive nodes , and the PET stage were independent prognostic predictors over other clinical variables in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who were undergoing curative surgery . METHODS Sixty-nine patients with newly diagnosed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent preoperative (18)F-FDG PET and curative esophagectomy were included . The events for survival analysis were defined as recurrence or metastasis and cancer-related death . The disease-free and overall survival rates of each variable were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method . The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate independent prognostic variables for multivariate survival analysis . RESULTS Using univariate survival analysis , the presence of adjuvant therapy , pathologic stage , number of CT-positive nodes ( 0 , 1 , > or = 2 ) , tumor length on PET ( cutoff : 3 cm , 5 cm ) , number of PET-positive nodes ( 0 , 1 , 2 , > or = 3 ) , and PET stage ( N0 M0 , N1 M0 , M1 ) were significant prognostic predictors for disease-free survival . However , only the number of PET-positive nodes was an independent significant prognostic predictor for disease-free survival in multivariate analysis ( hazard ratio = 1.87 , P < 0.001 ) . In univariate survival analysis , the sex , presence of adjuvant therapy , clinical and pathologic stages , number of CT-positive nodes , maximum SUV of the primary tumor ( cutoff : 6.3 , 13.7 ) , tumor length on PET , number of PET-positive nodes , and PET stage were significant prognostic predictors for overall survival . In contrast , the clinical stage ( hazard ratio = 0.53 , P < 0.05 ) , pathologic stage ( hazard ratio = 3.14 , P < 0.005 ) , tumor length by PET ( hazard ratio = 2.74 , P = 0.01 ) , and number of PET-positive nodes ( hazard ratio = 1.71 , P < 0.05 ) were independent significant prognostic predictors for overall survival in multivariate analysis . CONCLUSION In addition to the pathologic stage , (18)F-FDG PET provides noninvasively independent prognostic information using the number of positive lymph nodes and the tumor length on the PET image in preoperative esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . A revised TNM classification system for esophageal carcinoma may consider tumor length and the number of positive lymph nodes as important prognostic factorsTitle 3:Pattern of recurrence after surgery in adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction.Abstract 3:AIMS This study reports mode , timing and predictive factors of recurrence after  curative surgery for cardia cancer . METHODS A prospect i ve study in a series of 92 curatively ( R0 ) resected patients from 1988 to 2002 . RESULTS The 5-year recurrence rate was 71 % . Lymph node involvement was the only predictor of recurrence . No patients with more than 6 metastatic nodes were free from relapse 2 years after surgery . Locoregional , peritoneal and haematogenous relapses showed a similar median recurrence time ( 12 , 10 and 12 months , respectively ) , 80 % occurred within 24 months . CONCLUSIONS Few patients can be cured by surgery , lymph nodal involvement is the only predictor of recurrenceTitle 4:Significant clinical impact and prognostic stratification provided by FDG-PET in the staging of oesophageal cancerAbstract 4:Purpose To evaluate the clinical impact of FDG-PET in staging oesophageal cancer and whether this information improves prognostic stratification . Methods Impact was based on comparison of a prospect ively recorded pre-PET plan with post-PET treatment in 68 consecutive patients undergoing primary staging .  Survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and the Cox proportional hazards regression model . Results FDG-PET findings impacted on the management of 27/68 patients ( 40 % ) : in 12 therapy was changed from curative to palliative and in three from palliative to curative , while in 12 other patients there was a change in the treatment modality or delivery but not in the treatment intent . The median survival was 21 months , with post-PET stage and treatment intent both strongly associated with survival ( p<0.001 ) . Conventional stage was not able to clearly stratify this population . Conclusion The use of FDG-PET for primary staging of oesophageal cancer changed the clinical management of more than one-third of patients and provided superior prognostic stratification compared with conventional investigationsTitle 5:A prospective evaluation of the impact of 18-F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography staging on survival for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.Abstract 5:PURPOSE To determine the impact of 18-F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) in the staging and prognosis of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer ( LAEC ) . METHODS AND MATERIAL S Between January 2000 and October 2004 , all patients with LAEC evaluated in the Department of Radiation Oncology were considered for enrollment into a Phase II trial of  preoperative chemoradiation . Entry required a staging whole-body FDG-PET scan . RESULTS One hundred ten consecutive patients were evaluated ; 38 were ineligible for reasons including treatment elsewhere , prior malignancy , or refusal of treatment . After conventional staging ( clinical examination , endoscopic ultrasound , and chest/abdominal computerized tomography ) , 33 patients were ineligible because of metastatic disease or poor performance status . Of the remaining 39 patients , 23 were confirmed to have LAEC after FDG-PET staging and were treated in the Phase II trial ( Cohort I ) . Sixteen patients , however , had FDG-PET findings consistent with occult metastatic disease and were deemed ineligible for the trial but were treated with curative intent ( Cohort II ) . The 2-year survival rate for the 23 patients in Cohort I was 64 % , compared with 17 % ( p=0.003 ) for patients in Cohort II ( FDG-PET positive ) . CONCLUSIONS More than one-third of patients determined to have LAEC with conventional staging were upstaged with the use of FDG-PET . Despite comparable therapy , upstaging with FDG-PET predicts poor 2-year survivalTitle 6:Maximum standardized uptake values on positron emission tomography of esophageal cancer predicts stage, tumor biology, and survival.Abstract 6:BACKGROUND The stage of esophageal cancer is currently determined by the anatomic TNM classification system as opposed to information about tumor biology . METHODS A retrospective review was made of a prospect i ve electronic data base . Patients had esophageal cancer , dedicated positron emission tomography ( PET ) using F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG-PET ) and maximum st and ardized uptake value ( maxSUV ) measured . Biopsies were obtained from suspicious nodal and systemic locations , and when indicated , resection with complete lymphadenectomy was performed . RESULTS There were 89 patients ( 53 men ) . The median maxSUV for patients with high grade dysplasia , stage I , IIa , IIb , III , and IVa esophageal cancer was 1.7 , 2.9 , 8.9 , 7.7 , 9.5 , and 12 , respectively . Multivariate analysis showed patients with a high maxSUV were more likely to have poorly differentiated tumors ( risk ratio 1.89 , p = 0.032 ) and advanced stage ( risk ratio 2.6 , p < 0.001 ) . The maxSUV correlated better ( r(2 ) = 0.85 ) than the current TNM staging system for survival ( r(2 ) = 0.68 ) . Receiving operator characteristics curve demonstrated a maxSUV of 6.6 to be the optimal cut-off point . The 4-year survival of patients with a maxSUV of 6.6 or less was 89 % , whereas it was only 31 % for those patients with values greater than 6.6 ( p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS The maxSUV of an esophageal cancer on dedicated FDG-PET scan is an independent predictor of stage , tumor characteristics , and survival . It predicts survival better than the current TNM staging system .

The disease is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to death usually within five years after the onset of symptoms. While most cases are sporadic, 5%-10% of cases can be associated with familial inheritance, including ALS type 6, which is associated with mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene.Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the motor system. The etiology is still unknown and the pathogenesis remains unclear. ALS is familial in the 10% of cases with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease causing motor neuron death, but a complete cure has not been developed and related genes have not been defined in more than 80% of cases.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease. The majority of cases are sporadic (sALS), while the most common inherited form is due to C9orf72 mutation (C9ALS).At least 30 genes have been implicated in familial ALS (fALS) and sporadic ALS (sALS).","answer":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the motor system.

einstein vielbein or the moving frame method . in terms of these variables in 1 + 1 dimensions one deals with so called bf gauge theory and the zero curvature equations of motion , providing a link with soliton equations @xcite .but in these variables , as the \`\` square root '' of the pseudo - riemannian metric , the soliton equations have dissipative form , this is why we called them the dissipative solitons or dissipatons @xcite .the dissipative version of the nonlinear schrodinger equation with a rich resonance dynamics @xcite is a couple of nonlinear heat and anti - heat equations , which we called the reaction - diffusion system ( rd ) @xcite , @xcite .the dissipaton of that system is the pair of two real functions , one of which is exponentially growing , and another decaying , in space and time .but the product of these two functions has the perfect soliton form .as recently realized @xcite , if dissipatons of rd evolves with additional time variable according to the next member after rd of sl(2,r ) akns hierarchy , with cubic dispersion , then this product can be considered as a soliton of 2 + 1 dimensional kadomtsev - petviashvili equation with negative dispersion ( kp - ii ) . this way the resonance behaviour of kp - ii solitons was found in terms of dissipatons of the 1 + 1 dimensional models . moreover , in this approach , the novel two resonance soliton of kp - ii with four virtual solitons was constructed and interpreted as the degenerate four soliton solution @xcite .    from another site , as was shown before @xcite , dissipative version of the derivative nonlinear schrodinger equations ( dnls ) also admits dissipative soliton solutions with resonance interaction @xcite .moreover , these resonances show the chirality properties , propagating only in one direction . in the present paper , following the strategy of paper @xcite , by the recursion operator of the kaup - newell ( kn ) hierarchy , first we construct the next dissipative system of the hierarchy with cubic dispersion . then , using these two members of sl(2,r ) kaup - newell hierarchy , we show that the product of dissipaton functions is solution of the modified kadomtsev - petviashvili equation with negative dispersion ( mkp - ii ) ( section 2 ) . in section 3 bilinearization of the two flowsallows us to find bilinear form for mkp - ii .chiral resonance dissipatons of drd and their geometrical meaning are considered in section 4 .one and two soliton solutions of mkp - ii are constructed in section 5 .we show the resonance character of these solitons interaction and the chirality property posing restriction on the soliton collision angles . in conclusionwe discuss main results of this paper .the kn hierarchy has the form @xcite @xmath0 where the operator @xmath1 is the first symplectic form , while @xmath2 is the recursion operator of the hierarchy , and @xmath3 .the second flow of the hierarchy is the system @xmath4,eqno(2.4a) ] ] @xmath5,eqno(2.4b) ] ] while the third one is @xmath6_x,eqno(2.5a) ] ] @xmath7_x,eqno(2.5b) ] ] for the sl(2,r ) case of kn hierarchy we have real time variables @xmath8 which we denote as @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in this case functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real , and we denote them as @xmath13 then we have the drd system @xcite @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17    now we consider the pair of functions of three variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 satisfying the systems ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) .these systems are compatible since they belong to the same hierarchy for different times .this can be also checked directly from compatibility condition @xmath20 by using following conservation laws for eqs.(2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) respectively @xmath21_x , eqno(2.9) ] ] @xmath22_x ] ]    * proposition 1*. let the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are solutions of the systems ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) simultaneously .then , the function @xmath23 satisfies the modified kadomtsev -

ii ( 2.10 )now we will construct bilinear representation for systems ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) to find solutions of mkp - ii according to our proposition 1 . in our paper@xcite we applied the hirota bilinear method to integrate rdr ( 2.7 ) .now we will apply the same method to eq.(2.8 ) and mkp -

ii which we can formulate as below .* proposition 2*. let the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are solutions of the systems ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) simultaneously .then , the function @xmath50 satisfies the modified kadomtsev - petviashvili equation ( mkp - ii ) ( 2.10 ) or ( 2.11 ) .    to solve the systems ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) we introduce four real functions @xmath51 according to the formulas @xmath52 or using eqs.(3.1 ) and ( 3.4 ) for the original variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 we have the following substitution @xmath53 then the system ( 3.2 ) bilinearizes in the form @xmath54@xmath55 @xmath56 in a similar way , for the system ( 3.3 ) we have the next bilinear form @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 comparing these two bilinear forms we can see that the second and the third equations in both systems ( 3.7),(3.8 ) are of the same form .this is why for simultaneous solution of both eqs.(3.2 ) , ( 3.3 ) we have the next bilinear system @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 > from the last equation we have @xmath64 which provides for solution of mkp -

After collecting four weeks of baseline data on household water quality , diarrheal disease , and other data related to water use and h and ling practice s , households were r and omly assigned to one of three groups of 60 households : those receiving a ceramic water purifier ( CWP ) , those receiving a second filter employing an iron-rich ceramic ( CWP-Fe ) , and a control group receiving no intervention .  Households were followed for 18 weeks post-baseline with biweekly follow-up . Households using either filter reported significantly less diarrheal disease during the study compared with a control group of households without filters as indicated by longitudinal prevalence ratios CWP : 0.51 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.41 - 0.63 ) ; CWP-Fe : 0.58 ( 95 % CI : 0.47 - 0.71 ) , an effect that was observed in all age groups and both sexes after controlling for clustering within households and within individuals over timeTitle 2:Solar Drinking Water Disinfection (SODIS) to Reduce Childhood Diarrhoea in Rural Bolivia: A Cluster-Randomized, Controlled TrialAbstract 2:Daniel Maeusezahl and colleagues conducted a cluster-r and omized controlled trial in rural Bolivia of solar drinking water disinfection  , and find only moderate compliance with the intervention and no evidence of reduction in diarrhea among childrenTitle 3:A randomized controlled trial of the concrete biosand filter and its impact on diarrheal disease in Bonao, Dominican Republic.Abstract 3:A number of household water treatment and safe storage technologies , such as chlorine disinfection , solar disinfection , and ceramic filtration , have been documented for their ability to reduce diarrheal disease and improve microbial water quality .  The bios and filter ( BSF ) is a promising household water treatment technology in use by > 500,000 people globally . The purpose of this research was to document the ability of BSFs to improve water quality and to reduce diarrheal disease in user compared with non-user households in a r and omized controlled trial in Bonao , Dominican Republic , during 2005 - 2006 . During the 6-month intervention period , 75 BSF households had significantly improved drinking water quality on average compared with 79 control households ( P < 0.001 ) . Based on r and om intercepts logistic regression , BSF households had 0.53 times the odds of diarrheal disease as control households , indicating a significant protective effect of the BSF against waterborne diarrheal diseaseTitle 4:An observational study on the effectiveness of point-of-use chlorination.Abstract 4:Although the efficacy of  chlorine disinfection  under controlled laboratory conditions is well known , the effectiveness of  chlorine  under field point-of-use ( POU ) conditions is still not clearly understood and may be impacted by a variety of factors . This study evaluated the effectiveness of  POU chlorine disinfection in rural Ecuador under typical use conditions and compared this effectiveness with the efficacy in controlled laboratory conditions . While reductions of indicator organisms were slightly higher in households that used chlorination , no significant differences were seen between households employing POU chlorination and the households with no chlorination ( 1 - 1.5 log10 median reductions for chlorinating households and 0.31 - 0.55 log10 for nonchlorinating households , depending on the indicator organism ) . In contrast , significant reduction of all test organisms was found when simulating POU conditions in the laboratory . This study demonstrates that POU chlorination can be considerably less effective under actual field conditions than would be predicted based on its laboratory efficacy ( 3 - 5 log10 median reductions for chlorinated and 0 - 0.3 log10 for nonchlorinated sample s ) . Human factors ( including improper storage and chlorine dosing ) and uncontrolled water quality effects are hypothesized to impact significantly the effectiveness of chlorine disinfectionTitle 5:Chlorination and safe storage of household drinking water in developing countries to reduce waterborne disease.Abstract 5:Simple , effective and affordable methods are needed to treat and safely store non-piped , gathered household water . This study evaluated point-of-use chlorination and storage in special plastic containers of gathered household water for improving microbial quality and reducing diarrhoeal illness of consumers living under conditions of poor sanitation and hygiene . Community families were recruited and r and omly divided into intervention ( household water chlorination and storage in a special container ) and  control ( no intervention ) households . Microbes in stored household water were extensively inactivated by 1 - 5-mg/L doses of hypochlorite . Escherichia coli levels in stored household waters were < 1/100 mL in most intervention households but readily detectable at high levels in control households . Stored water of intervention households was also lower in Clostridium perfringens and heterotrophic plate count bacteria than in control households . The intervention reduced household diarrhoeal illness . In Bolivia , monthly episodes of household diarrhoeal illness were 1.25 and 2.2 in intervention and control families , respectively ( P = < 0.002 ) indicating that 43 % of community diarrhoea was preventable by using the intervention . In Bangladesh , mean episodes of child diarrhoea/1,000 d were 19.6 and 24.8 in intervention and control groups respectively ( P = < 0.03 ) indicating that about 24 % of observed diarrhoea was preventable by using the intervention . Chlorine disinfection and storage in an appropriate container significantly improved the microbiological quality of non-piped household drinking water and reduced community diarrhoeal disease . Widespread use of this simple treatment and storage system for non-piped domestic water has the potential to dramatically reduce the global burden of waterborne diarrhoeal diseaseTitle 6:Use of ceramic water filtration in the prevention of diarrheal disease: a randomized controlled trial in rural South Africa and zimbabwe.Abstract 6:To determine the effectiveness of ceramic filters in reducing diarrhea , we conducted a r and omized controlled trial in Zimbabwe and South Africa , in which 61 of 115 households received ceramic filters .  Incidence of non-bloody and bloody diarrhea was recorded daily over 6 months using pictorial diaries for children 24 - 36 months of age . Poisson regression was used to compare incidence rates in intervention and control households . Adjusted for source quality , intervention household drinking water showed reduced Escherichia coli counts ( relative risk , 0.67 ; 95 % CI , 0.50 - 0.89 ) . Zero E. coli were obtained for drinking water in 56.9 % of intervention households . The incidence rate ratio for bloody diarrhea was 0.20 ( 95 % CI , 0.09 - 0.43 ; P < 0.001 ) and for non-bloody diarrhea was 0.17 ( 95 % CI , 0.08 - 0.38 ; P < 0.001 ) , indicating much lower diarrhea incidence among filter users . The results suggest that ceramic filters are effective in reducing diarrheal disease incidence","answer":"Indeed these three interventions are predicted to have the same or less effect than what may be expected due purely to reporting bias in unblinded studies With the currently available evidence ceramic filters are the most effective form of HWT in the longterm , disinfection-only interventions including SODIS appear to have poor if any longterm public health benefit"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

The increase in risk was similar for benign and malignant tumors, and was most apparent for astrocytoma.CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for maternal smoking during pregnancy in the etiology of childhood brain tumors.Maternal occupational exposure to PAH before conception or during pregnancy was rare, and this exposure was not associated with any type of childhood brain tumor.There was no association between the risk of brain tumors in the child and parental smoking prior to pregnancy, maternal smoking or regular exposure to others' cigarette smoke during pregnancy at home or at work, or passive smoking by the child during the first year of life.Maternal smoking during pregnancy and the risk of childhood brain tumors: a meta-analysis of 6566 subjects from twelve epidemiological studies.OBJECTIVE: Prior epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumors.Pooling all twelve reports yielded an RRs of 1.05 (0.90-1.21), a non-statistically significant result suggesting no clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumor development..CONCLUSION: The available epidemiological data do not support a clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and pediatric brain tumor development.We observed only few positive associations, namely, between CNS tumors and low birth weight [<2,500 g; odds ratio (OR), 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-2.84], between ependymoma and maternal smoking during pregnancy (>10 cigarettes per day: OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.69-13.1), and between astrocytoma and exposure to wood preservatives (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.22-3.01).The results on exposure to paternal tobacco smoke suggest an association with brain tumors (RR 1.22; CI, 1.05-1. 40; based on 10 studies) and lymphomas (RR 2.08; CI, 1.08-3.98; 4 studies).No association was found between the risk of CBTs and maternal or paternal smoking before pregnancy and there was no association between CBTs and maternal smoking during pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-1.3]. A slightly increased OR for CBTs was found for paternal smoking during pregnancy in the absence of maternal smoking (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.90-1.5) and for maternal exposure to passive smoke from any source (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.95-1.6). The results of this analysis are consistent with results from several prior epidemiological studies that showed no significant association between CBTs and maternal smoking before or during pregnancy or maternal exposure to passive smoke during pregnancy.No significant differences in risks were found to be associated with maternal or paternal smoking at any time (odds ratio (OR) = 0.92 for mothers and 1.06 for fathers), during the year of birth of the child (which included both the prenatal and postnatal periods) (ORs = 0.84 for<1 pack/day and 1.0 for>or = 1 pack/day for mothers, and 0.68 for<1 pack/day and 1.07 for>or = 1 pack/day for fathers), or 2 years before the child was born, i.e., the pre-conception period (ORs = 0.75 for<1 pack/day and 1.01 for>or = 1 pack/day for mothers, and 0.90 for<1 pack/day and 1.15 for>or = 1 pack/day for fathers). Mothers were also specifically asked if they smoked during the pregnancy, and no association was found compared with never smokers (OR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.45) or for ever-smokers who continued to smoke during pregnancy compared with those who stopped smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.75-1.78).The lack of an effect of parental smoking was observed for both the major histologic types and locations of brain tumors. These findings and those from earlier studies provide no support for the hypothesis that parental cigarette smoking influences the risk of brain tumors in children.Increased risk was associated with maternal contact with nitrosamine-containing substances such as burning incense (odds ratio, 3.3; p = 0.005), sidestream cigarette smoke (odds ratio, 1.5; p = 0.03), and face makeup (odds ratio, 1.6; p = 0.02); with maternal use of diuretics (odds ratio, 2.0; p = 0.03) and antihistamines (odds ratio, 3.4; p = 0.002); and with the level of maternal consumption of cured meats (p = 0.008).Prior epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumors.Studies of the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on development of brain tumors in the offspring generally have found no increase in risk but most have mainly relied on retrospective exposure assessment.No association was found between the risk of CBTs and maternal or paternal smoking before pregnancy and there was no association between CBTs and maternal smoking during pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-1.3].There was no association between the risk of brain tumors in the child and parental smoking prior to pregnancy, maternal smoking or regular exposure to others' cigarette smoke during pregnancy at home or at work, or passive smoking by the child during the first year of life.RESULTS: We found positive interaction odds ratios (ORs) for both maternal and paternal smoking during pregnancy, EPHX1 H139R, and childhood brain tumors (P(interaction) = 0.02; 0.10), such that children with the high-risk (greater PAH activation) genotype were at a higher risk of brain tumors relative to children with the low-risk genotype when exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy.Finally, no significant increase in risk of brain tumors was found for the child's passive exposure to parental smoking during the period from birth to diagnosis of the brain tumor in the case.Prior epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumors.a non-statistically significant result suggesting no clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumor development.These results support a role for maternal smoking during pregnancy in the etiology of childhood brain tumors.","answer":"Findings regarding association of maternal smoking and brain tumor risk are mixed.

Unexpectedly, the I•••O halogen bonds were absent in the structure of (mdppo)2(tfib). Instead, structure exhibited both iodine atoms of tfib engaged in I•••π interactions 34 (Fig. 1a), along with the formation of C−H•••O HB tapes between neighbouring mdppo units (Fig. 2a). The absence of I•••O bonds was particularly unexpected, as using octafluoro-1,4-diiodobutane (ofib, an aliphatic XB donor of similar length to tfib) gave a (mdppo)2(ofib) cocrystal with each donor engaged in two I•••O halogen bonds (CSD GIDRES). 31 In the course of our work on synthesizing ternary cocrystals through combining mutually orthogonal interactions, 18 we now report serendipitous discovery of two new polymorphs of (mdppo)2(tfib). The cocrystals were unexpectedly isolated from a solution of mdppo, tfib and N,N'-dimethylthiourea in acetonitrile. Crystal structure determination revealed that, unlike the previously reported cocrystal of orthorhombic (ortho) symmetry, the two new (mdppo)2(tfib) forms crystallize in the monoclinic (mono) and triclinic (tric) crystal systems. The ortho-, monoand tric-forms of (mdppo)2(tfib) represent a so far unique trimorphic set of halogen-bonded cocrystals. Specifically, we were surprised 35 4) chains and R3 2 (8) rings, identical to that seen in ortho-(mdppo)2(tfib) (Fig. 2a), as well as in the previously reported (mdppo)2(ofib) and in solid mdppo, whose structure has herein been re-determined at 123 K to facilitate comparison of HB patterns (for previous structural report, see CSD NEXBOI). 36 The C(4)R3 2 (8) pattern in mono-(mdppo)2(tfib) is generated via a twofold 21 screw axis (Fig. 2d), similar to that in (mdppo)2(ofib), and in contrast to ortho-(mdppo)2(tfib) and solid mdppo, where this motif arises as a result of glide planes (Fig. 2b). This leads to a difference in relative orientation of phenyl rings on neighboring mdppo molecules: in ortho-(mdppo)2(tfib) the phenyl groups are all located on the same side of the C-H•••O tape, whereas in mono-(mdppo)2(tfib) their positioning alternates on both sides of the supramolecular tapes (Figs. 2b,d). The C-H•••O distances in ortho-and mono-(mdppo)2(tfib) are highly similar, from 3.308(5) Å to 3.377(5) Å (Table 1), which is close to values seen in the (mdppo)2(ofib) cocrystal and pure mdppo.  8) first-order and R4 2 (8) second-order network (Fig. 2e). This pattern, which is a phosphine oxide analogue of the \\"amide ladder\\" motif, 37 is generated in this cocrystal by the inversion centres of the P1 ¯ space group. The appearance of a different HB pattern in tric-(mdppo)2(tfib) is accompanied by a notable elongation of C−H•••O bonds compared to other polymorphs and the structures of (mdppo)2(ofib) and mdppo, with C•••O separations now being effectively longer than 3.5 Å (Table 1).</p><p>Attempts at selective mechanochemical synthesis of mono-(mdppo)2(tfib) and tric-(mdppo)2(tfib) were not successful, with neat and liquid-assisted grinding 38 respectively producing mixtures of tric-and ortho-(mdppo)2(tfib) or just ortho-(mdppo)2(tfib). Subsequently, reliable procedures were devised for selective solution synthesis of the two new polymorphs. First, mdppo and tfib, in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio, were dissolved in a small amount of isobutanol with the help of an ultrasound bath and left to stand at room temperature. After one hour, the resulting crystals were filtered off and identified as mono-(mdppo)2(tfib). Placing a similarly prepared solution into a freezer at ca. −20 °C for 10 days yielded crystals of tric-(mdppo)2(tfib). Sample purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Fig. 3). It is unclear why certain conditions lead to selective formation of different (mdppo)2(tfib) polymorphs. We believe that solvent might play a significant rolea view reinforced by prior observation of a 3-component solvate of the (mdppo)(tfib) cocrystal from acetonitrile (CSD JUZSAA). 33  4). The DSC thermogram of mono-(mdppo)2(tfib) was mostly featureless, exhibiting only a sharp endothermic event at ca. 113 °C, consistent with melting. In contrast, heating of tric-or ortho-polymorphs led to a broad endothermic feature at ca. 86 or 96 °C, respectively, followed by a sharp endothermic melting signal at ca. 113 °C. These observations indicate that mono-(mdppo)2(tfib) is the thermodynamically preferred form at elevated temperature, with both ortho-and tric-forms first undergoing a transformation to mono-(mdppo)2(tfib), which melts at 113 °C.</p><p>Relative stabilities of (mdppo)2(tfib) forms were also investigated computationally, by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations using CRYSTAL17 39 with a range-separated ωB97X functional, 40 previously successfully used to rationalize stability of XB cocrystals. 41 Allelectron basis sets, specifically adapted for periodic calculations, were implemented for H, C, O, F and P, 42 and effective core potentials 43 were used to account for relativistic effects in I. 44 Lattice energy calculations on the DFT-optimised structures of the three polymorphs of (mdppo)2(tfib) revealed that ortho-(mdppo)2(tfib) should be the most stable one, with mono-(mdppo)2(tfib) and tric-(mdppo)2(tfib) higher in energy by +7.67 kJ mol −1 and +7.87 kJ mol −1 , respectively. These results are consistent with persistence of ortho-(mdppo)2(tfib) as the only or the major product in most solution and mechanochemical experiments, and with the endothermic nature of the transformation from ortho-to mono-(mdppo)2(tfib). Trimorphism of (mdppo)2(tfib) is unique among XB cocrystals, as a search of the Cambridge Structural Database revealed only 12 cases of polymorphism (all dimorphic) in over 900 structures of multi-component crystals involving perfluorinated XB donors (see ESI). Comparison of the three forms of (mdppo)2(tfib) suggests an important role for orthogonality of supramolecular interactions in generating the observed polymorphs. Specifically, the three polymorphs can be seen as related by single independent changes in either HB or XB patterns (Scheme 2). In such a scheme, mono-(mdppo)2(tfib) adopts a special place, as both the ortho-and tric-forms can be envisaged as being generated from it, either by variation of XB motifs without affecting the HB theme, or by changes in HB pattern without significant changes to XB, respectively. Scheme 2. Relationship between XB and HB motifs in polymorphs of (mdppo)2(tfib).</p><p>In summary, we presented a unique example of a trimorphic cocrystal based on halogen bonds. Importantly, a potential role of orthogonality of supramolecular interactions in polymorphism of cocrystals is revealed, as the three reported structures can be mutually related by individual and independent variation in either XB or HB patterns. The presented trimorphism contributes to unique richness of five phases for this halogen-bonded system, which now includes three polymorphs of (mdppo)2(tfib), a (mdppo)(tfib) stoichiomorph, 32 and a solvate (mdppo)(tfib)(CH3CN). 33 While orthogonality of supramolecular interactions has typically been regarded as a design element in the synthesis of complex structures, these results also suggest orthogonality as a route to extended polymorphism. We are currently investigating other chemically similar systems for further cases of polymorphism based on orthogonality of supramolecular interactions.</p>","answer":"True trimorphic cocrystals, i.e. multi-component molecular crystals of identical composition that exhibit three polymorphic structures, are exceedingly rare and so far no halogen-bonded cocrystal system was reported to exhibit trimorphism. Here, we describe a unique example of a trimorphic cocrystal exhibiting both hydrogen and halogen bonds in which the difference between polymorphs arises from their orthogonality evident by apparently independent variation of hydrogen-and halogen-bonded motifs. Main text:Over the past decade, cocrystallisation 1 has developed into an established crystal engineering strategy to generate new molecular solids with notable optical, 2 pharmaceutical, 3-5 energetic 6-8 or otherwise stimuli-responsive 9 properties. Cocrystal design relies on well-defined, robust motifs of intermolecular interactions, supramolecular synthons, driving the assembly of molecular components in a predictable manner. [10][11][12] In that context, polymorphism in cocrystals is still a poorly investigated challenge, [13][14][15] especially when different cocrystal polymorphs exhibit a different arrangement of intermolecular interactions.Here, we describe a trimorphic cocrystal system in which polymorphism stems from orthogonality of halogen-(XB) and/or hydrogen-bonding (HB) interactions. Orthogonality is a well-established concept in organic synthesis and covalent self-assembly, enabling the synthesis of complex targets and the design of one-pot and cascade synthetic strategies. 16 In solid-state supramolecular chemistry, orthogonality has been recognized as critical for the controlled assembly of complex structures from small molecule components, either via covalent bonds 17 or non-covalent interactions. 18 We now report orthogonality of supramolecular interactions as a basis of cocrystal polymorphism, with structural differences between herein reported three cocrystal polymorphs readily described by independent variation in XB and HB motifs. While dimorphic cocrystals, exhibiting two polymorphic modifications, are well-known, [19][20][21][22] the number of reported cocrystals with three (trimorphic cocrystals) or more polymorphs is much smaller, 4,23-25 making the herein reported system of particular interest. Importantly, so far there have been no reports of cocrystal trimorphism involving halogen bonds, which is of potentially broader importance due to interest in XB research 26 in the design of functional 27,28 (e.g. pharmaceutical)"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Cellular growth and differentiation are readouts of multiple signaling pathways from the intercellular and/or extracellular milieu. The extracellular matrix through the activation of cellular receptors transmits these signals. Therefore, extracellular matrix proteolysis could affect cell fate in a variety of biological events. However, the biological consequence of inadequate extracellular matrix degradation in vivo is not clear. We developed a mouse model expressing human collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1, MMP-1) under the control of Col2a1 promoter. The mice showed significant growth retardation during embryogenesis and a loss of the demarcation of zonal structure and columnar array of the cartilage. Immunological examination revealed increased degradation of type II collagen and upregulation of fibronectin and alpha (5) -integrin subunit in the transgenic cartilage. The resting zone and proliferating zone of the growth plate cartilage exhibited a simultaneous increase in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) -incorporated proliferating cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated X-dUTP nick-end labeling-positive apoptotic cells, respectively. Chondrocyte differentiation was not disturbed in the transgenic mice as evidenced by normal expression of the Ihh and type X collagen expression. These data demonstrate that type II collagen proteolysis is an important determinant for the skeletal outgrowth through modulation of chondrocyte survival and cartilagenous growth.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

BACKGROUND  Recently, mutations in the retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene which codes for peripherin-rds have been implicated as a cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Because this gene is expressed in both rods and cones, mutations in the rds gene might be expected to cause degeneration affecting either the scotopic or photopic systems. Mutations at codon 172 of the rds gene have been identified in three families with autosomal dominantly inherited, progressive macular dystrophy. METHODS  Affected individuals underwent ophthalmic examination, scotopic perimetry, dark adaptometry, measurement of color-contrast sensitivity, and electroretinography to characterize the photoreceptor dysfunction. RESULTS  In all but one affected member, symptoms of progressive central visual loss developed in the third or fourth decade of life accompanied by central scotoma and well-demarcated atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris of the macula. In general, cone and rod thresholds were elevated, and color-contrast sensitivity was absent in the central visual field. Peripherally, the scotopic sensitivities were normal, as was the recovery from bleach. Cone electroretinograms were diminished in amplitude, and delayed in all affected adults except one. Rod electroretinograms were normal or near normal in amplitude, and had normal implicit times. Affected asymptomatic children had macular changes, abnormal color-contrast sensitivity, and reduced pattern and cone electroretinograms. CONCLUSION  These results indicate that mutations in the rds gene can be expressed as a macular dystrophy, with evidence of primary cone dysfunction and preservation of peripheral rod function..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium\\", \\"macular dystrophy\\", \\"cone dysfunction\\", \\"visual loss\\", \\"retinal degeneration\\", \\"choriocapillaris of the macula\\", \\"autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa\\", \\"Macular dystrophy\\", \\"central scotoma\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

To that end, we propose techniques to represent a given subject with rare token identifiers and fine-tune a pre-trained, diffusion-based text-to-image framework that operates in two steps; generating a low-resolution image from text and subsequently applying super-resolution (SR) diffusion models. We first fine-tune the low-resolution text-to-image model with the input images and text prompts containing a unique identifier followed by the class name of the subject (e.g., “A [V] dog”). In order to prevent overfitting and language drift Lee2019CounteringLD ; lu2020countering  that cause the model to associate the class name (e.g., “dog”) with the specific instance, we propose an autogenous, class-specific prior preservation loss, which leverages the semantic prior on the class that is embedded in the model, and encourages it to generate diverse instances of the same class as our subject. In the second step, we fine-tune the super-resolution component with pairs of low-resolution and high-resolution versions of the input images. This allows the model to maintain high fidelity to small (but important) details of the subject.

Although COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory illness, other systems including gastrointestinal (GI) system and liver may be involved because of the ubiquitous nature of ACE-2 receptors in various cell lines that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes to enter host cells. It appears that GI symptoms and liver enzyme abnormalities are common in COVID-19. The involvement of the GI tract and liver correlates with the severity of disease. A minority (10-20%) of patients with COVID-19 may also present initially with only GI complaints. The most common GI symptoms are anorexia, loss of smell, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Viral RNA can be detected in stool in up to 50% of patients, sometimes even after pharyngeal clearance, but it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission occurs. Liver enzymes are elevated, usually mild (2-3 times), in a substantial proportion of patients. There are many confounding factors that could cause liver enzyme abnormalities including medications, sepsis, and hypoxia. Although infection rates in those with preexisting liver disease are similar to that of general population, once infected, patients with liver disease are more likely to have a more severe disease and a higher mortality. There is a paucity of objective data on the optimal preventive or management strategies, but few recommendations for GI physicians based on circumstantial evidence are discussed.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\", \\"Prevention\\", \\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

New PCR -based analytical strategies have been developed to address this limitation. Molecular viability testing (MVT) correlates bacterial viability with the ability to rapidly synthesize species -specific ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA) in response to brief nutritional stimulation. Previous studies demonstrated that MVT can assess bacterial inactivation by chlorine, serum, and low-temperature pasteurization. Here, we demonstrate that MVT can detect inactivation of Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Enterococcus faecalis cells by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Some UV - inactivated E. coli cells transiently retained the ability to synthesize pre-rRNA post-irradiation (generating false-positive MVT results), but this activity ceased within one hour following UV exposure. Viable but transiently undetectable (by culture) E. coli cells were consistently detected by MVT. An alternative viability testing method, viability PCR (vPCR), correlates viability with cell envelope integrity. This method did not distinguish viable from UV - inactivated bacteria under some conditions, indicating that the inactivated cells retained intact cell envelopes. MVT holds promise as a means to rapidly assess microbial inactivation by UV treatment. IMPORTANCE Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is increasingly used to disinfect water, food, and other materials for human use. Confirming the effectiveness of UV disinfection remains a challenging task. In particular, microbiological methods that rely on rapid detection of microbial DNA can yield misleading results. This is due to the detection of \\" remnant \\" DNA associated with dead microbial cells. This report describes a novel method that rapidly distinguishes living from dead microbial cells after UV disinfection.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"cell envelope\\", \\"remnant\\", \\"cell envelopes\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"E. coli\\", \\"Enterococcus faecalis\\", \\"Escherichia coli\\", \\"inactivated cells\\", \\"cells\\", \\"bacteria\\", \\"Inactivated Bacteria\\", \\"inactivated bacteria\\", \\"inactivated E. coli\\", \\"bacterial\\", \\"Aeromonas hydrophila\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"viability\\", \\"dead microbial cells\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"serum\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"ribosomal RNA\\", \\"pre-rRNA\\", \\"precursor\\", \\"bacterial DNA\\", \\"microbial DNA\\", \\"DNA\\", \\"chlorine\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"undetectable\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"human\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"false-positive MVT results\\", \\"results\\", \\"detected\\", \\"detection\\", \\"detecting\\", \\"Confirming\\", \\"detect\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"food\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"disinfect\\", \\"culture\\", \\"inactivation\\", \\"disinfection\\", \\"microbial inactivation\\", \\"activity\\", \\"bacterial inactivation\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"species\\", \\"microbiological methods\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"PCR\\", \\"polymerase chain reaction\\", \\"vPCR\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

The fragility of cancer patients is well-known, with many cases affecting aged patients or those with several comorbidities that frequently result in a loss of independency and functionality. Therefore, cancer patients have been greatly affected by this health emergency and, due to their vulnerability to COVID-19, oncologic patient visits have been often delayed or canceled leading to possible under-treatment. Different solutions can be adopted for reducing travels to cancer screening centers and the overall impact of cancer screening visits. As a consequence, it has been recommended that, when possible, the follow-up visits for cancer patients treated with oral anticancer drugs could be performed telematically. Furthermore, many patients refuse hospital visits, even if necessary, because of fear of contagion. Moreover, in some regions in Italy even the very first non-urgent visits have been postponed with the consequent delay in diagnosis, which may negatively affect disease prognosis. For these reasons, new approaches are needed such as the telemedicine tool. Throughout organized and appropriate tools, it would be possible to manage patients' visits and treatments, to avoid the dangerous extension of waiting lists when the standard activities will resume. In this context, a number of hospital visits can be substituted with visits at small local health centers, and general practitioners'office, taking in turn, advantage of well-defined telemedicine path which will be developed in the post-emergency phase.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Pasireotide has a receptor binding profile that is distinct from that of other somatostatin analogues, binding with high affinity to somatostatin receptor subtype 5, which is strongly over expressed in corticotroph adenoma cells. Pasireotide is the first pituitary-directed agent to be approved for use in Cushing's disease. In a phase III clinical trial in patients with Cushing's disease, twice-daily pasireotide 600 or 900 μg for 6 months led to normalization of urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels in up to a quarter of all patients (primary endpoint) and significantly reduced mean UFC levels. The reduction in UFC levels is rapid (within one to two months) and sustained (up to 24 months). Most patients who do not have an early response to pasireotide do not respond at a later time point. Decreases in UFC levels achieved during pasireotide treatment are accompanied by decreases in serum and salivary cortisol levels, as well as improvements in clinical signs and symptoms, including body weight, blood pressure and health-related quality-of-life. Pasireotide has a generally similar tolerability profile to that of other somatostatin analogues, but is associated with a relatively high incidence of hyperglycaemia, requiring the addition or intensification of glucose-lowering medication in a substantial proportion of patients.

Forensic medical practitioners play a significant role in diagnosing, evaluating and reporting these cases. The Jordanian judicial system is dependent on forensic reports. This study aims to assess the role of forensic medicine in evaluating the physical injuries sustained by women who are abused by their husbands. A retrospective review of 158 forensic reports of Jordanian women alleging assault by their husbands and who were seen at Jordan University Hospital over the period 2010-2015. Of the 158 women who presented, 87 had multiple injuries. The majority of injuries were soft tissue injuries, but others included fractures, tympanic membrane perforation, burns and neck contusions. Twelve women were pregnant at the time of the assessment. The period of incapacity caused by these injuries (an important factor for the Jordanian judicial system) was between 1 and 14 days. Intimate partner violence can present with a range of injuries from relatively minor to potentially disabling or life threatening. Forensic medicine has a role in documenting and evaluating these injuries and advising the judicial system in these cases. These are all key elements in increasing the awareness of the nature and extent of this behavior and its impact on women (and men) and the wider society.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"non-fatal physical violence\\", \\"awareness\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"forensic medicine\\", \\"Forensic medicine\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"diagnosing\\", \\"issue\\", \\"life threatening\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"assessment\\", \\"documenting\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"physical injuries\\", \\"neck contusions\\", \\"injuries\\", \\"multiple injuries\\", \\"tympanic membrane perforation\\", \\"burns\\", \\"soft tissue injuries\\", \\"alleging assault\\", \\"fractures\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"forensic reports\\", \\"retrospective review\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [\\"University Hospital\\", \\"wider society\\"], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"women\\", \\"men\\", \\"Jordanian women\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"Forensic medical practitioners\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"Jordan\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the activation status and proliferative capacities of splenic lymphocyte populations from a mevalonate kinase-deficient mouse model of hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS). We previously reported that murine mevalonate kinase gene ablation was embryonic lethal for homozygous mutants while heterozygotes (Mvk (+/-)) demonstrated several phenotypic features of human HIDS including increased serum levels of IgD, IgA, and TNFα, temperature dysregulation, hematological abnormalities, and splenomegaly. METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface activation markers on T and B lymphocytes, and macrophage populations, demonstrated aberrant expression of B7 glycoproteins in all splenic cell types studied. Differences in expression levels between Mvk (+/-) and Mvk (+/+) littermate controls were observed in both the basal state (unstimulated) and after Concanavalin A (Con-A) stimulation in vitro of whole splenocyte cultures. In Mvk (+/-) CD4 and CD8 T cells, alterations in expression of CD25, CD80, CD152, and CD28 were observed. Mvk (+/-) splenic macrophages expressed altered levels of CD80, CD86, CD40, and CD11c while Mvk (+/-) B lymphocytes had differential expression of CD40, CD80, and CD86. Mvk (+/-) splenocyte subpopulations also exhibited altered proliferative capacities in response to in vitro stimulation. CONCLUSION: We postulate that imbalances in the expression of cell surface proteins necessary for activation, proliferation, and regulation of the intensity and duration of an immune response may result in defective T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions in our model and potentially in human HIDS.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"CD8\\", \\"CD11c\\", \\"CD28\\", \\"IgA\\", \\"CD25\\", \\"CD86\\", \\"CD4\\", \\"IgD\\", \\"Mvk\\", \\"CD152\\", \\"TNFu03b1\\", \\"mevalonate kinase\\", \\"CD80\\", \\"B7 glycoproteins\\", \\"CD40\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

Especially, we evaluate the effect of different shared network components and empirically verify that dependency parsing may be much more beneficial from constituent parsing structure. The proposed parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance for both parsing tasks, constituent and dependency on PTB and CTB benchmarks.IntroductionConstituent and dependency are two typical syntactic structure representation forms as shown in Figure FIGREF1, which have been well studied from both linguistic and computational perspective BIBREF0, BIBREF1. In earlier time, linguists and NLP researchers discussed how to encode lexical dependencies in phrase structures, like Tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) BIBREF2 and head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) BIBREF3.Typical dependency treebanks are usually converted from constituent treebanks, though they may be independently annotated as well for the same languages. Meanwhile, constituent parsing can be accurately converted to dependencies (SD) representation by grammatical rules or machine learning methods BIBREF4, BIBREF5. Such mutual convertibility shows a close relation between constituent and dependency representation for the same sentence. Thus, it is a natural idea to study the relationship between constituent and dependency structures, and the joint learning of constituent and dependency parsing BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14.For further exploit both strengths of the two representation forms for even better parsing, in this work, we propose a new model that is capable of synchronously parsing constituent and dependency.Multitask learning (MTL) is a natural solution in neural models for multiple inputs and multiple outputs, which is adopted in this work to decode constituent and dependency in a single model. BIBREF15 indicates that when tasks are sufficiently similar, especially with syntactic nature, MTL would be useful. In contrast to previous work on deep MTL BIBREF16, BIBREF17, our model focuses on more related tasks and benefits from the strong inherent relation. At last, our model is evaluated on two benchmark treebanks for both constituent and dependency parsing. The empirical results show that our parser reaches new state-of-the-art for all parsing tasks.Our ModelUsing an encoder-decoder backbone, our model may be regarded as an extension of the constituent parsing model of BIBREF18 as shown in Figure FIGREF4. The difference is that in our model both constituent and dependency parsing share the same token representation and shared self-attention layers and each has its own individual Self-Attention Layers and subsequent processing layers. Our model includes four modules: token representation, self-attention encoder, constituent and dependency parsing decoder.Our Model ::: Token RepresentationIn our model, token representation x_i is composed by character, word and part-of-speech (POS) embeddings. For character-level representation, we explore two types of encoders, CharCNNs BIBREF19, BIBREF20 and CharLSTM BIBREF18, as both types have been verified their effectiveness. For word-level representation, we concatenate randomly initialized and pre-trained word embeddings. We consider two ways to compose the final token representation, summing and concatenation, x_i=x_{char}+x_{word}+x_{POS}, x_i=[x_{char};x_{word};x_{POS}].Our Model ::: Self-Attention EncoderThe encoder in our model is adapted from BIBREF21 to factor explicit content and position information in the self-attention process BIBREF18. The input matrices X = [x_1, x_2, dots , x_n ] in which x_i is concatenated with position embedding are transformed by a self-attention encoder. We factor the model between content and position information both in self-attention sub-layer and feed-forward network, whose setting details follow BIBREF18. We also try different numbers of shared self-attention layers in section SECREF15.Our Model ::: Constituent Parsing DecoderThe score s(T) of the constituent parsing tree T is to sum every scores of span (i, j) with label l, s(T) = sum _{(i,j,ell )in T} s(i, j, ell ). The goal of constituent parser is to find the tree with the highest score:  hat{T} = arg max _T s(T).  We use CKY-style algorithm to obtain the tree hat{T} in O(n^3) time complexity BIBREF22, BIBREF23, BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26.This structured prediction problem is handled with satisfying the margin constraint: s(T^*) ge s(T) + Delta (T,T^*), where T^* denote correct parse tree and Delta  is the Hamming loss on labeled spans with a slight modification during the dynamic programming search. The objective function is the hinge loss,Our Model ::: Dependency Parsing DecoderSimilar to the constituent case, dependency parsing is to search over all possible trees to find the globally highest scoring tree. We follow BIBREF27 and BIBREF28 to predict a distribution over the possible head for each word and find the globally highest scoring tree conditional on the distribution of each word only during testing.We use the biaffine attention mechanism BIBREF27 between each word and the candidates of the parent node:alpha _{ij} = h_i^TWg_j + U^Th_i + V^T g_j + b,where h_i and g_i are calculated by a distinct one-layer perceptron network.Dependency parser is to minimize the negative log likelihood of the golden tree Y, which is implemented as cross-entropy loss: J_2(theta ) = - left(logP_{theta }(h_i|x_i) +logP_{theta }(l_i|x_i,h_i)right), where P_{theta }(h_i|x_i) is the probability of correct parent node h_i for x_i, and P_{theta }(l_i|x_i,h_i) is the probability of the correct dependency label l_i for the child-parent pair (x_i,h_i).During parsing, we use the first-order Eisner algorithm BIBREF29 to build projective trees.Our Model ::: Joint trainingOur joint model synchronously predicts the dependency tree and the constituent tree over the same input sentence. The output of the self-attention encoder is sent to the different decoder to generate the different parse tree. Thus, the share components for two parsers include token representation layer and self-attention encoder.We jointly train the constituent and dependency parser for minimizing the overall loss:J_{model}(theta ) = J_1(theta ) + lambda J_2(theta ),where lambda  is a hyper-parameter to control the overall loss. The best performance can be achieved when lambda  is set to 1.0, which turns out that both sides are equally important.ExperimentsWe evaluate our model on two benchmark treebanks, English Penn Treebank (PTB) and Chinese Penn Treebank (CTB5.1) following standard data splitting BIBREF30, BIBREF31. POS tags are predicted by the Stanford Tagger BIBREF32. For constituent parsing, we use the standard evalb tool to evaluate the F1 score. For dependency parsing, we apply Stanford basic dependencies (SD) representation BIBREF4 converted by the Stanford parser. Following previous work BIBREF27, BIBREF33, we report the results without punctuations for both treebanks.Experiments ::: SetupWe use the same experimental settings as BIBREF18. For dependency parsing, we employ two 1024-dimensional multilayer perceptrons for learning specific representation and a 1024-dimensional parameter matrix for biaffine attention. We use 100D GloVe BIBREF34 for English and structured-skipgram BIBREF35 embeddings for Chinese.Experiments ::: Ablation StudiesAll experiments in this subsection are running from token representation with summing setting.Token Representation Different token representation combinations are evaluated in Table TABREF13. We find that CharLSTM performs a little better than CharCNNs. Moreover, POS tags on parsing performance show that predicted POS tags decreases parsing accuracy, especially without word information. If POS tags are replaced by word embeddings, the performance increases. Finally, we apply word and CharLSTM as token representation setting for our full model.Shared Self-attention Layers As our model providing two outputs from one input, there is a bifurcation setting for how much shared part should be determined. Both constituent and dependency parsers share token representation and 8 self-attention layers at most. Assuming that either parser always takes input information flow through 8 self-attention layers as shown in Figure FIGREF4, then the number of shared self-attention layers varying from 0 to 8 may reflect the shared degree in the model. When the number is set to 0, it indicates only token representation is shared for both parsers trained for the joint loss through each own 8 self-attention layers. When the number is set to less than 8, for example, 6, then it means that both parsers first shared 6 layers from token representation then have individual 2 self-attention layers.For different numbers of shared layers, the results are in Table TABREF14. We respectively disable the constituent and the dependency parser to obtain a separate learning setting for both parsers in our model. The comparison in Table TABREF14 indicates that even though without any shared self-attention layers, joint training of our model may significantly outperform separate learning mode. At last, the best performance is still obtained from sharing full 8 self-attention layers.Besides, comparing UAS and LAS to F1 score, dependency parsing is shown more beneficial from our model which has more than 1% gain in UAS and LAS from parsing constituent together.Experiments ::: Main ResultsTables TABREF17, TABREF18 and TABREF19 compare our model to existing state-of-the-art, in which indicator Separate with our model shows the results of our model learning constituent or dependency parsing separately, (Sum) and (Concat) respectively represent the results with the indicated input token representation setting. On PTB, our model achieves 93.90 F1 score of constituent parsing and 95.91 UAS and 93.86 LAS of dependency parsing. On CTB, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art result on both constituent and dependency parsing. The comparison again suggests that learning jointly in our model is superior to learning separately. In addition, we also augment our model with ELMo BIBREF48 or a larger version of BERT BIBREF49 as the sole token representation to compare with other pre-training models. Since BERT is based on sub-word, we only take the last sub-word vector of the word in the last layer of BERT as our sole token representation x_i. Moreover, our single model of BERT achieves competitive performance with other ensemble models.ConclusionsThis paper presents a joint model with the constituent and dependency parsing which achieves new state-of-the-art results on both Chinese and English benchmark treebanks. Our ablation studies show that joint learning of both constituent and dependency is indeed superior to separate learning mode. Also, experiments show that dependency parsing is much more beneficial from knowing the constituent structure. Our parser predicts phrase structure and head-word simultaneously which can be regarded as an effective HPSG BIBREF3 parser.Figure 1: Constituent and dependency structures.Figure 2: The framework of our joint learning model.Table 1: PTB dev set performance on representations.Table 2: PTB dev set performance on joint component.Table 3: Dependency parsing on PTB and CTB.Table 4: Comparison of constituent parsing on PTB.Table 5: Comparison of constituent parsing on CTB.Question: How are different network components evaluated?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"For different numbers of shared layers, the results are in Table TABREF14.

The technique is based on deforming a prior high-quality 3D CT / CBCT image to form a new CBCT image, guided by limited-view 2D projections. The accuracy of this intensity-based technique, however, is often limited in low-contrast image regions with subtle intensity differences. The solved deformation vector fields (DVFs) can also be biomechanical ly unrealistic. To address these problems, we have developed a biomechanical modeling guided CBCT estimation technique (Bio-CBCT-est) by combining 2D - 3D deformation with finite element analysis (FEA)-based biomechanical modeling of anatomical structures. Specifically, Bio-CBCT-est first extracts the 2D - 3D deformation -generated displacement vectors at the high-contrast anatomical structure boundaries. The extracted surface deformation fields are subsequently used as the boundary conditions to drive structure -based FEA to correct and fine-tune the overall deformation fields, especially those at low-contrast regions within the structure. The resulting FEA -corrected deformation fields are then fed back into 2D - 3D deformation to form an iterative loop, combining the benefits of intensity-based deformation and biomechanical modeling for CBCT estimation. Using eleven lung cancer patient cases, the accuracy of the Bio-CBCT-est technique has been compared to that of the 2D - 3D deformation technique and the traditional CBCT reconstruction techniques. The accuracy was evaluated in the image domain, and also in the DVF domain through clinician -tracked lung landmarks.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"structure\\", \\"anatomical structure boundaries\\", \\"lung\\", \\"anatomical structures\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"lung cancer\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"intensity differences\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"cone-beam computed tomography\\", \\"technique\\", \\"CT\\", \\"CBCT\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"FEA\\", \\"Estimation Technique\\", \\"estimation\\", \\"finite element analysis\\", \\"estimation technique\\", \\"Bio-CBCT-est\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"clinician\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"Modeling\\", \\"modeling\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"displacement\\", \\"2D\\", \\"Two-dimensional\\", \\"loop\\", \\"vectors\\", \\"3D\\", \\"extracted surface\\", \\"regions\\", \\"three-dimensional\\", \\"projections\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

BACKGROUND/AIM OF STUDY Laser therapy is effective in relieving malignant dysphagia , but repeated treatments at 4 to 6 week intervals are usually required . This prospective randomised trial is designed to determine if addition of brachytherapy offers any advantages over laser therapy alone . METHODS Patients with inoperable carcinoma of the oesophagus were randomised to receive either endoscopic Nd : YAG laser therapy alone , or laser followed by brachytherapy . Patients who developed worsening dysphagia during follow-up were offered further treatment as appropriate . RESULTS Fourteen patients were randomised to receive laser only , and 12 to receive laser followed by brachytherapy . Of these 12 , one was lost to follow-up and four did not receive brachytherapy because they were unfit , had extension into the cardia or had mainly extrinsic compression . These 4 are included on an 'intention-to-treat ' basis . The mean therapeutic interval for the brachytherapy group was significantly longer , 83 days compared to 36 days for the laser group ( p = 0.026 ) . There were no differences in the degree of dysphagia relief , number of endoscopic procedures or survival times .

This heterogeneity arises in part from the ability of cancer cells to switch between phenotypic states, but the dynamics of this cellular plasticity remain poorly understood. Here we apply DNA barcodes to quantify and track phenotypic plasticity across hundreds of clones in a population of cancer cells exhibiting epithelial or mesenchymal differentiation phenotypes. We find that the epithelial -to- mesenchymal cell ratio is highly variable across the different clones in cancer cell populations, but remains stable for many generations within the progeny of any single clone -with a heritability of 0.89. To estimate the effects of combination therapies on phenotypically heterogeneous tumours, we generated quantitative simulations incorporating empirical data from our barcoding experiments. These analyses indicated that combination therapies which alternate between epithelial - and mesenchymal - specific treatments eventually select for clones with increased phenotypic plasticity. However, this selection could be minimized by increasing the frequency of alternation between treatments, identifying designs that may minimize selection for increased phenotypic plasticity. These findings establish new insights into phenotypic plasticity in cancer, and suggest design principles for optimizing the effectiveness of combination therapies for phenotypically heterogeneous tumours.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"clone\\", \\"Cancer cells\\", \\"clones\\", \\"cancer cells\\", \\"cancer cell\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"cancer\\", \\"cancers\\", \\"phenotypically heterogeneous tumours\\", \\"progression\\", \\"drug resistance\\", \\"cellular plasticity\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"Phenotypic heterogeneity\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"treatments\\", \\"specific treatments\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"population\\", \\"populations\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"barcoding experiments\\", \\"quantitative simulations\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"DNA barcodes\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2014 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  In current interframe video compression systems, the encoder performs predictive coding to exploit the similarities of successive frames. The Wyner-Ziv theorem on source coding with side information available only at the decoder suggests that an asymmetric video codec, where individual frames are encoded separately, but decoded conditionally (given temporally adjacent frames) could achieve similar efficiency. We report the first results on a Wyner-Ziv coding scheme for motion video that uses intraframe encoding, but interframe decoding. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Distributed coding is a new paradigm for video compression, based on Slepian and Wolf's and Wyner and Ziv's information-theoretic results from the 1970s. This paper reviews the recent development of practical distributed video coding schemes. Wyner-Ziv coding, i.e., lossy compression with receiver side information, enables low-complexity video encoding where the bulk of the computation is shifted to the decoder. Since the interframe dependence of the video sequence is exploited only at the decoder, an intraframe encoder can be combined with an interframe decoder. The rate-distortion performance is superior to conventional intraframe coding, but there is still a gap relative to conventional motion-compensated interframe coding. Wyner-Ziv coding is naturally robust against transmission errors and can be used for joint source-channel coding. A Wyner-Ziv MPEG encoder that protects the video waveform rather than the compressed bit stream achieves graceful degradation under deteriorating channel conditions without a layered signal representation. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  We describe PRISM, a video coding paradigm based on the principles of lossy distributed compression (also called source coding with side information or Wyner-Ziv coding) from multiuser information theory. PRISM represents a major departure from conventional video coding architectures (e.g., the MPEGx, H.26x families) that are based on motion-compensated predictive coding, with the goal of addressing some of their architectural limitations. PRISM allows for two key architectural enhancements: (1) inbuilt robustness to \\"drift\\" between encoder and decoder and (2) the feasibility of a flexible distribution of computational complexity between encoder and decoder. Specifically, PRISM enables transfer of the computationally expensive video encoder motion-search module to the video decoder. Based on this capability, we consider an instance of PRISM corresponding to a near reversal in codec complexities with respect to today's codecs (leading to a novel light encoder and heavy decoder paradigm), in this paper. We present encouraging preliminary results on real-world video sequences, particularly in the realm of transmission losses, where PRISM exhibits the characteristic of rapid recovery, in contrast to contemporary codecs. This renders PRISM as an attractive candidate for wireless video applications. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Growing percentage of the world population now uses image and video coding technologies on a regular basis. These technologies are behind the success and quick deployment of services and products such as digital pictures, digital television, DVDs, and Internet video communications. Today's digital video coding paradigm represented by the ITU-T and MPEG standards mainly relies on a hybrid of block- based transform and interframe predictive coding approaches. In this coding framework, the encoder architecture has the task to exploit both the temporal and spatial redundancies present in the video sequence, which is a rather complex exercise. As a consequence, all standard video encoders have a much higher computational complexity than the decoder (typically five to ten times more complex), mainly due to the temporal correlation exploitation tools, notably the motion estimation process. This type of architecture is well-suited for applications where the video is encoded once and decoded many times, i.e., one-to-many topologies, such as broadcasting or video-on-demand, where the cost of the decoder is more critical than the cost of the encoder.Literature Review:","answer":"The main objective of digital video coding technologies is to compress the original data into a much smaller number of bits, while preserving an acceptable video quality. These technologies are behind the success and rapid deployment of products and services such as digital cameras, digital television, and DVDs, among others. Most available video coding standards, notably the ITU-T H.26X and ISO/IEC MPEG-X families of standards, adopt the so-called predictive video coding paradigm where the temporal and spatial correlations are exploited at the encoder by using a motion compensated prediction loop and a spatial transform, respectively. As a consequence, this video coding solution typically leads to rather complex encoders and much simpler decoders, with a rigid allocation of the complexity between the transmitter and the receiver. This approach fits well some application scenarios, e.g. broadcasting, where a few (complex) encoders provide coded content for millions of (simpler) decoders. With the wide deployment of mobile and wireless networks, there is a growing number of applications where many senders deliver data to a central receiver. Typically, these emerging applications require light encoding complexity, high compression efficiency, robustness to packet losses and, often, also low latency/delay. To address some of these issues, some research groups revisited the video coding problem at the light of an Information Theory result from the 70s: the Slepian-Wolf theorem  . According to this theorem, the minimum rate needed to independently encode two statistically dependent discrete random sequences, X and Y, is the same as for joint encoding. While the Slepian-Wolf theorem deals with lossless coding, in 1976, A. Wyner and J. Ziv studied the case of lossy coding with side information (SI) at the decoder. Under some hypothesis on the joint statistics, the Wyner-Ziv theorem BIB001 states that when the side information (i.e. the correlated source Y) is made available only at the decoder there is * The work presented was developed within VISNET II, a European Network of Excellence (http://www.visnet-noe.org). no coding efficiency loss in encoding X, with respect to the case when joint encoding of X and Y is performed. The Slepian-Wolf and the Wyner-Ziv theorems suggest that it is possible to encode two statistically dependent signals independently and decoding them jointly, while approaching the coding efficiency of conventional predictive coding schemes, which rely on joint encoding and decoding instead. The new coding paradigm, known as Distributed Video Coding (DVC) avoids the computationally intensive temporal prediction loop at the encoder, by shifting the exploitation of the temporal redundancy at the decoder. This is a significant advantage in a large range of emerging application scenarios, including wireless video cameras, wireless low-power surveillance, video conferencing with mobile devices, and visual sensor networks. With the theoretical doors opened, the practical design of WynerZiv (WZ) video codecs, a particular case of DVC, started around 2002, following important developments in channel coding technology. The first practical WZ solutions have been developed at Stanford University BIB002 BIB003 and UC Berkeley  BIB004 . As of today, the most popular WZ video codec design in the literature is clearly the Stanford architecture, which works at the frame level and is characterized by a feedback channel based decoder rate control. On the other hand, the Berkeley architecture, known as PRISM (Power-efficient, Robust, hIgh compression Syndrome based Multimedia coding), works at the block level and is characterized by an encoder side rate controller based on the availability of a reference frame. Due to their popularity in the research community and the major technical evolution in recent years, Section 2 presents and compares from the functional point of view these two WZ video coding architectures. In Section 3, a brief review of some of the architectural developments which derived from the initial Stanford architecture is given. Due to space constraints, this paper will only address monoview video coding. Multiview video coding has also been addressed in the literature; for a complete review, see BIB005 ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Yet, this death process is silent, and it does not cause inflammation. The molecular mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory nature of the apoptotic process remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of apoptotic cells activated the macrophages to express anti-inflammatory genes such as Nr4a and Thbs1. A high level of AMP accumulated in the apoptotic cell supernatant in a Pannexin1-dependent manner. A nucleotidase inhibitor and A2a adenosine receptor antagonist inhibited the apoptotic supernatant-induced gene expression, suggesting AMP was metabolized to adenosine by an ecto-5’-nucleotidase expressed on macrophages, to activate the macrophage A2a adenosine receptor. Intraperitoneal injection of zymosan into Adora2a- or Panx1-deficient mice produced high, sustained levels of inflammatory mediators in the peritoneal lavage. These results indicated that AMP from apoptotic cells suppresses inflammation as a ‘calm down’ signal.Introduction:Approximately, 100, 000 cells undergo apoptosis every second in our bodies, and are engulfed by macrophages and immature dendritic cells( Fuchs and Steller, 2011). Inefficient clearance of apoptotic cells causes systemic lupus erythematosus( SLE)-type autoimmune disease in humans and mice( Botto et al., 1998; Hanayama et al., 2004; Munoz et al., 2010). Apoptotic cells characteristically expose ‘eat me’ signal( s) to macrophages( Nagata et al., 2010; Ravichandran, 2011), and one of the primary ‘eat me’ signals is phosphatidylserine( PtdSer). PtdSer is a phospholipid that localizes to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes in healthy cells; however, when cells undergo apoptosis, it is exposed on the outer cell surface in a caspase-dependent manner( Fadok et al., 2001; Leventis and Grinstein, 2010; Suzuki et al., 2013). Macrophages express membrane proteins that function as receptors for PtdSer( e. g., Tim-4, stabllin 2, and BAI1), or opsonins that bind to PtdSer( e. g. MFG-E8, Protein S, and Gas6)( Nagata et al., 2010). Masking the PtdSer on apoptotic cells prevents their engulfment by macrophages, supporting the idea that PtdSer is an important ‘eat me’ signal. Apoptotic cells also produce ‘find me’ signals to attract macrophages( Ravichandran, 2011). Lysophosphatidylcholine( LPC)( Lauber et al., 2003), ATP/UTP( Elliott et al., 2009), fractalkine( Truman et al., 2008), and sphingosine-1-phosphate( S1P)( Gude et al., 2008) are released from apoptotic cells in a caspase-dependent manner. Macrophages express specific receptors for these signals( P2Y2 for ATP and UTP, CX3CR1 for fractalkine, and S1PR1 for S1P), which may mediate migration to the dying cells( Ravichandran, 2011). The ‘find me’ signals are thought to prime macrophages for engulfment, for example by enhancing the expression of MFG-E8( Miksa et al., 2007). On the other hand, LPC, ATP/UTP, and S1P are known to cause inflammation( Trautmann, 2009; Maceyka et al., 2012; Meyer zu Heringdorf and Jakobs, 2007), which may contradict the anti-inflammatory nature of the apoptotic process. In addition, several groups showed that apoptotic cells produce growth-stimulating molecules such as Wnt3 or prostaglandin E2( Chera et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011; Mollereau et al., 2013), which is also against the silent nature of the process. Thus, how the anti-inflammatory character of the apoptosis is maintained during the process has been unclear. In this study, we found that soluble factors derived from the apoptotic cells activated macrophages to express immediate early response genes including anti-inflammatory genes such as Nuclear receptor 4A( Nr4a) and Thrombospondin( Thbs) 1. Using Thbs1 gene expression as a marker, the molecule responsible for the gene expression was identified as AMP. The overexpression of Pannexin 1 in apoptotic cells accelerated the accumulation of AMP in the culture supernatant of apoptotic cells, while a caspase-resistant form of Pannexin 1 inhibited the AMP accumulation. An inhibitor of ecto-5′-nucleotidase blocked the AMP-induced activation of the Thbs1 gene in macrophages, while macrophages from A2a adenosine receptor( Adora2a)-deficient mice did not respond to AMP. These results indicated that AMP from apoptotic cells was converted to adenosine by an ecto-5′-nucleotidase on macrophages, and that the adenosine activated a set of genes in macrophages via the A2a adenosine receptor. Mice deficient in Adora2a or Panx1 exhibited prolonged peritonitis following intraperitoneal zymosan injection, suggesting that the AMP released from apoptotic peritoneal cells exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by activating the A2a adenosine receptor.Discussion:Adenine nucleotides act not only as intracellular energy carriers but also as extracellular signaling molecules( Bours et al., 2006). For instance, extracellular ATP regulates the microglial response to brain injury via P1 or P2 purinergic receptors( Davalos et al., 2005), and adenosine modulates sleep–wake cycles via A2a adenosine receptor( Urade et al., 2003). Although the release of adenine nucleotides mainly occurs by exocytosis( Pascual et al., 2005), it is also mediated by transport via channel proteins. Connexins, which form gap junctions, can serve as hemichannels, and allow ATP to exit( Cotrina et al., 1998; Spray et al., 2006). Pannexins, which carry 4 transmembrane regions with intracellular N- and C-terminal tails, are structurally similar to connexins and also form hemichannels( Yen and Saier, 2007). Various physiological and pathological stimuli such as Ca2+-influx, shear stress, and apoptotic cell death, can cause Pannexin 1 channels to open, allowing the passage of molecules smaller than 1. 0 kDa( D’Hondt et al., 2009). Chekeni et al.( 2010) recently showed that in the early stages of apoptosis, caspases cleave Pannexin 1 resulting in the release of ATP, which can serve as a ‘find me’ signal to attract macrophages. In this study, we found that AMP was present at 30- to 100-fold higher concentrations than ATP in the culture supernatants of apoptotic thymocytes and a T cell line. The ATP concentration in healthy cells is approximately 10–50 times higher than that of AMP. However, when cells undergo apoptosis, ATP is quickly hydrolyzed to AMP, while its generating system is inactivated by caspases( Ricci et al., 2004). The caspase-cleaved Pannexin channel also contributes to the cellular loss of ATP by allowing ATP to exit cells through the plasma membrane. Thus, the AMP found in apoptotic cell supernatants could have been extracellularly converted from ATP by E-NTPDase. However, the ability of apoptotic or healthy W3 cell supernatants to hydrolyze ATP was very low, suggesting that E-NTPDase was not responsible for the accumulation of AMP in the apoptotic cell supernatants. Thus, it is possible that AMP generated intracellularly in apoptotic cells was released from through these channels. The engulfment of apoptotic cells is a silent process that does not activate inflammation( Nagata et al., 2010; Ravichandran, 2011). Since macrophages ingesting apoptotic cells produce TGFβ or IL-10 that inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines( Voll et al., 1997; Fadok et al., 1998; Lucas et al., 2006), this interaction and/or engulfment was thought to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect. Furthermore, Köröskényi et al.( 2011) recently reported that macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells released adenosine to suppress inflammation. In contrast, we show here that apoptotic cells secrete AMP, which is converted to adenosine, resulting in macrophage activation via adenosine receptors, followed by the upregulation of Thbs1 and Nr4a gene expression. When the apoptotic cells could not release AMP due to the expression of caspase-resistant form of pannexin 1, the Thbs1 gene expression was not up-regulated. Furthermore, the AMP released from the resident peritoneal macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells was significantly smaller than that released from apoptotic cells( HY, and SN, data not shown). These results suggest that the contribution of the interaction of apoptotic cells with macrophages to anti-inflammatory effect may not be great. Thbs1 is the major activator of TGFβ( Crawford et al., 1998), whereas Nr4a family members inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-8, and IL-6 in macrophages( Bonta et al., 2006), by recruiting a repressor complex to their promoter( Saijo et al., 2009). Thus, this may be one mechanism that suppresses inflammation during the apoptosis process. The conversion of AMP to adenosine is catalyzed by CD73, an ecto-5’-nucleotidase, expressed on the surface of endothelial and immune cells( Deaglio and Robson, 2011). CD73-null mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diseases such as glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis, accompanied by enhanced inflammation( Blume et al., 2012). They are also susceptible to polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture, and exhibit increased mortality and systemic inflammation( Hasko et al., 2011). Our results suggest that the substrate for CD73 in these models may be AMP released from apoptotic cells. If AMP cannot be converted to adenosine in the absence CD73, then activation of the immune system in response to the ‘danger signal( s) ’ released from apoptotic cells would not be opposed. We conclude that apoptotic cells themselves contribute to the ‘anti-inflammatory’ nature of the engulfment process by secreting AMP as an immunosuppressive ‘calm-down’ signal. Depending on the types of cells and apoptotic stimuli, intracellular ATP levels remain high( Bossy-Wetzel et al., 1998; Eguchi et al., 1997; Zamaraeva et al., 2005) or rapidly decreases( Gleiss et al., 2002; Vander Heiden et al., 1999) during apoptosis. It will be interesting to study whether this mechanism impacts various types of inflammation that are accompanied by apoptosis.","answer":"Infections , toxins , and trauma can all injure tissue and cause the cells inside the tissue to die .

Please answer the question. Do not include any text in your response other than the answer.Context: Qualitative evaluation. Fig. 4 shows the facial attribute transfer results on CelebA. We observed that our method provides a higher visual quality of translation results on test data compared to the cross-domain models. One possible reason is the regularization effect of StarGAN through a multi-task learning framework. In other words, rather than training a model to perform a fixed translation (e.g., brown-to-blond hair), which is prone to overfitting, we train our model to flexibly translate images according to the labels of the target domain. This allows our model to learn reliable features universally applicable to multiple domains of images with different facial attribute values. Quantitative evaluation protocol. For quantitative evaluations, we performed two user studies in a survey format using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess single and multiple attribute transfer tasks. Given an input image, the Turkers were instructed to choose the best generated image based on perceptual realism, quality of transfer in attribute(s), and preservation of a figure’s original identity. The options were four randomly shuffled images generated from four different methods. The generated images in one study have a single attribute transfer in either hair color (black, blond, brown), gender, or age. In another study, the generated images involve a combination of attribute transfers. Each Turker was asked 30 to 40 questions with a few simple yet logical questions for validating human effort. The number of validated Turkers in each user study is 146 and 100 in single and multiple transfer tasks, respectively. Quantitative results. Tables 1 and 2 show the results of our AMT experiment on single- and multi-attribute transfer tasks, respectively. StarGAN obtained the majority of votes for best transferring attributes in all cases.In the case of gender changes in Table 1, the voting difference between our model and other models was marginal, e.g., 39.1% for StarGAN vs. 31.4% for DIAT. However, in multi-attribute changes, e.g., the ‘G+A’ case in Table 2, the performance difference becomes significant, e.g., 49.8% for StarGAN vs. 20.3% for IcGAN), clearly showing the advantages of StarGAN in more complicated, multi-attribute transfer tasks. This is because unlike the other methods, StarGAN can handle image translation involving multiple attribute changes by randomly generating a target domain label in the training phase. Qualitative evaluation. As seen in Fig. 5, StarGAN clearly generates the most natural-looking expressions while properly maintaining the personal identity and facial features of the input. While DIAT and CycleGAN mostly preserve the identity of the input, many of their results are shown blurry and do not maintain the degree of sharpness as seen in the input. IcGAN even fails to preserve the personal identity in the image by generating male images. Quantitative evaluation. For a quantitative evaluation, we compute the classification error of a facial expression on synthesized images. We trained a facial expression classifier on the RaFD dataset (90%/10% splitting for training and test sets) using a ResNet-18 architecture [5], resulting in a near-perfect accuracy of 99.55%. We then trained each of image translation models using the same training set and performed image translation on the same, unseen test set. Finally, we classified the expression of these translated images using the above-mentioned classifier. As can be seen in Table 3, our model achieves the lowest classification error, indicating that our model produces the most realistic facial expressions among all the methods compared.Question: They perform only a qualitative analysis of the proposed model.

Using a biosensor to visualize p53 action, we find that Drosophila p53 is selectively active in gonadal stem cells after exposure to stressors that destabilize the genome. Similar p53 activity occurred in hyperplastic growths that were triggered either by the RasV12 oncoprotein or by failed differentiation programs. In a model of transient sterility, p53 was required for the recovery of fertility after stress, and entry into the cell cycle was delayed in p53- stem cells. Together, these observations establish that the stem cell compartment of the Drosophila germline is selectively licensed for stress-induced activation of the p53 regulatory network. Furthermore, the findings uncover ancestral links between p53 and aberrant proliferation that are independent of DNA breaks and predate evolution of the ARF/Mdm2 axis.Introduction:Throughout the animal kingdom, p53 occupies a central position within conserved stress response networks. The protein integrates diverse signals associated with DNA damage and uncontrolled proliferation to govern adaptive downstream responses such as increased DNA repair, arrested cell cycle, and apoptosis( Vousden and Lane, 2007). Where examined, the genes encoding p53 are not essential for viability but have been implicated as regulators of aging( Derry et al., 2007; Donehower et al., 1992; Lee et al., 2003; Sogame et al., 2003). It is now well appreciated that ancestral roles for this gene family must have predated functions in tumor suppression. In support of this, members of the p53 gene family are present in unicellular protists and short-lived multicellular organisms( Lu et al., 2009; Mendoza et al., 2003; Nordstrom and Abrams, 2000). Furthermore, cancer was probably a negligible source of selection pressure during the course of human evolution( Aranda-Anzaldo and Dent, 2007) and the combined removal of canonical p53 effectors( p21, Puma, and Noxa) does not account for tumor suppression in mice( Valente et al., 2013). These and other observations suggest that tumor suppressive roles for the p53 family were co-opted from primordial functions, some of which may have been linked to meiotic recombination( Lu et al., 2010). In recent years, considerable evidence has surfaced linking p53 action to stem cell biology. For example, in mammary stem cells p53 promotes asymmetric division and cell polarity, thereby helping to limit the population of stem cells in the mammary gland( Cicalese et al., 2009). Furthermore, reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells( iPSCs) is greatly increased in p53 deficient cells, suggesting that p53 may act as a ‘barrier for induced pluripotency’( Krizhanovsky and Lowe, 2009). Consistent with this, several labs have shown that p53 induces embryonic stem cell differentiation to maintain genomic stability after DNA damage( Lin et al., 2005; Neveu et al., 2010; Zhao and Xu, 2010). Together with recent studies in planaria, these observations indicate that an ancestral focus of p53 action could operate in stem cells( Pearson and Sanchez Alvarado, 2009). We directly tested this possibility using a p53 biosensor to visualize Drosophila germline stem cells and their progeny. When DNA breaks were exogenously imposed or intrinsically engineered, Drosophila p53( Dp53) was activated selectively in germline stem cells( GSCs) and their immediate daughters, indicating that these cells are uniquely licensed for p53 action. Furthermore, in various germline tumor models Dp53 was constitutively hyperactivated, suggesting that ancient links between p53 and inappropriate growth predate canonical effectors that connect these regulatory networks( e. g., ARF and MDM2).Discussion:We found that adult Drosophila exposed to genotoxic stress or genome destabilizers selectively activated p53 in GSCs and their immediate progeny. This striking specificity was observed despite widespread Dp53 expression( FBgn0039044 m.; Jin et al., 2000; Ollmann et al., 2000) and widespread tissue damage( Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We note that stem cell specificity was not an artifact intrinsic to the biosensors, since independent reporters behaved similarly in both the female and male germline and required the wild-type Dp53 locus in both cases. Furthermore, in certain mutant backgrounds stress-induced activity restricted to GSCs was lost and non-selective p53 activation was widespread throughout the ovary( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B′). Therefore, despite the fact that it is present and activatable throughout the gonad, functional p53 is restricted to stem cells and their immediate progeny by specific genetic determinants. Collectively, our work supports previous indications that there is an intimate and ancient link between p53 and stem cell biology( Pearson and Sanchez Alvarado, 2009). Our findings also offer rare and novel opportunities to operationally mark the stem cells in the fly germline, as visualized by p53R-GFP. This marker is distinct from conventional stem cell labels( Deng and Lin, 1997) since it is not constitutively expressed but, instead, represents a functional output that is conditional upon a perturbation. We further note that like all reporter systems, our p53 biosensors may not reflect the full scope of effector output regulated by this network, and activities visualized here could transmit only subsets of p53-mediated responses. Nevertheless, despite this possible limitation, our results are consistent with suggestions that stem cells may be acutely sensitive to sources of genomic instability with a higher propensity for engaging adaptive responses relative to other cells( Mandal et al., 2011; Sperka et al., 2012). We propose that in reproductive tissues, the p53 regulatory network is either preferentially licensed in stem cells or selectively blocked outside of this compartment. What upstream regulators might specify p53 activation in GSCs/CBs? Given that stem cells have unique properties, p53 activation in these cells might lie downstream of a novel pathway. Consistent with this idea, ATR expression, was not rate limiting for p53 activation in the germline( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A′, Figure 1—source data 1C). Furthermore, unlike meiotic induction, p53 induction in GSCs/CBs was independent of the topoisomerase, Spo11( Figure 1—source data 1A; Lu et al, 2010). Chk2 could contribute to the selective activation in stem cells seen here, but since Chk2 is also broadly expressed and functionally associated with oocyte development throughout the ovary( Abdu et al., 2002; Oishi et al., 1998) any potential role in GSCs must extend beyond a simple presence or absence of this kinase. Our findings also imply stimulus-dependent effectors of p53 in stem cells that are not yet appreciated. For example, within detection limits, we observed no obvious connection between p53 status and apoptosis, DNA double-strand break repair, or cell cycle arrest. However, irradiated p53−/− GSCs were significantly delayed in the re-entry phase for cell cycle. Future studies will explore this defect and also examine progeny derived from stressed GSCs for transgenerational phenotypes that might be adaptive. Our discovery that p53 action is coupled to hyperplasia in a non-vertebrate species was unexpected for two reasons. First, the role of this gene family as a tumor suppressor is thought to be a derived feature that evolved only in vertebrate lineages. Second, the canonical ARF/MDM2 pathway that links aberrant growth to p53 is absent outside of higher vertebrates( Lu et al., 2009). Surprisingly, our combined results suggest that ancient pathways linking p53 to aberrant stem cell proliferation may predate the divergence between vertebrates and invertebrates.","answer":"The most common genetic change seen in cancer patients produces a faulty version of the p53 protein , which normally restricts tissue growth . This change promotes cancer because cells can now divide faster and fail to die when they should . Much remains to be learned about how p53 functions to restrain growth . As p53 is found in primitive organisms , and cancer is unlikely to have significantly influenced evolution , suppressing tumor formation was almost certainly not the original function of this gene . Furthermore , p53 works in a different way compared to many other tumour suppressors . Therefore , prevention of cancer is likely to have evolved as a side effect derived from more ancient functions . Recently , a link between p53 and stem cells has been uncovered . Stem cells are special because they can develop into many different types of cells , and they are crucial for the growth and repair of tissues . To form a particular type of cell , the stem cell divides to create two daughter cells . Commonly , one daughter cell stays in the stem state , whereas the other becomes a particular type of cell , such as a nerve cell or muscle cell . Because of this special property , scientists hypothesize that stem cells have special mechanisms to protect them from DNA damage that might partially depend on p53 . This would prevent the spread of damaged genomes that would otherwise occur among daughter cells . To learn more about how p53 influences stem cells , Wylie , Lu et al . monitored its activity in the gonads of fruit flies , which are a powerful genetic model . They found that damaging DNA activates p53 in stem cells and their daughter cells , but not in other types of cells that have been damaged . In addition , p53 is activated by the uncontrolled growth and division of stem cells in the gonad , even when DNA is not damaged . This is unexpected since molecules linking inappropriate growth to p53 were thought to be present only in mammals . Therefore , it appears that the tumor-suppressing behavior of p53 in mammals was adapted from its more ancient ability to regulate stem cell growth—an ability that evolved before organisms divided into vertebrates and invertebrates ."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Antibody concentrations against tetanus, diphtheria, tickborne encephalitis and influenza were assessed by ELISA or by haemagglutination inhibition test. Disease and vaccination histories were recorded.(RESULTS) The results of the study demonstrate that protection against infectious diseases was frequently insufficient in the elderly. This was partly due to the fact that old persons were not vaccinated according to recommended strategies.

Inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene during normal retinal development initiates the formation of a retinoblastoma (RB) tumor. To identify the mutations which inactivate RB1, 21 RB tumors isolated from 19 patients were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction or an RNase protection assay or both. Mutations were identified in 13 of 21 RB tumors; in 8 tumors, the precise errors in nucleotide sequence were characterized. Each of four germ line mutations involved a small deletion or duplication, while three somatic mutations were point mutations leading to splice alterations and loss of an exon from the mature RB1 mRNA. We were unable to detect expression of the mutant allele in lymphoblasts of three bilaterally affected patients, although the mutation was present in the genomic DNA and transcripts containing the mutations were obvious in the RB tumors in the absence of a normal RB1 allele. The variations in the level of expression of mutant transcripts suggest deregulation of RB1 transcription in the absence of a functional RB1 gene product..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"tumors\\", \\"RB tumors\\", \\"retinoblastoma (RB) tumor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The use of a computer program that incorporates wound mapping from photographs onto a three-dimensional (3D) human diagram could decrease subjectivity in preparing burn diagrams and subsequent calculations of TBSA burned. Analyses were done on 19 burned patients who had an estimated TBSA burned of ≥20%. The patients were admitted to Shriners Hospitals for Children or the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, from July 2012 to September 2013 for treatment. Digital photographs were collected before the patient's first surgery. Using BurnCase 3D (RISC Software GmbH, Hagenberg, Austria), a burn mapping software, the user traced partial- and full-thickness burns from photographs. The program then superimposed tracings onto a 3D model and calculated percent burned. The results were compared with the Lund and Browder diagrams completed after the first operation. A two-tailed t-test was used to calculate statistical differences. For partial-thickness burns, burn sizes calculated using Lund and Browder diagrams were significantly larger than those calculated using BurnCase 3D (15% difference, P < .01). The opposite was found for full-thickness burns, with burn sizes being smaller when calculated using Lund and Browder diagrams (11% difference, P < .05). In conclusion, substantial differences exist in percent burn estimations derived from BurnCase 3D and paper diagram s. In our studied cohort, paper diagram s were associated with overestimation of partial-thickness burn size and underestimation of full-thickness burn size. Additional studies comparing BurnCase 3D with other commonly used methods are warranted.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"estimations\\", \\"overestimation\\", \\"underestimation\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"human\\"], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"treatment\\", \\"admitted\\", \\"operation\\", \\"surgery\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"burned\\", \\"wound\\", \\"burns\\", \\"Burn\\", \\"burn\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"methods\\", \\"computer program\\", \\"software\\", \\"Diagram\\", \\"program\\", \\"BurnCase 3D\\", \\"diagrams\\", \\"diagram\\", \\"Lund and Browder diagrams\\", \\"two-tailed t-test\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [\\"RISC Software GmbH\\", \\"Burn units\\", \\"Shriners Hospitals\\"], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"user\\", \\"studied cohort\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"studies\\", \\"Analyses\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"opposite\\", \\"size\\", \\"sizes\\", \\"3D\\", \\"Austria\\", \\"Three-Dimensional\\", \\"three-dimensional\\", \\"Galveston, Texas\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Apoptosis is a regulated form of cell death that may be triggered by natural killer (NK) or cytotoxic T cells, which effect target cell lysis by cytolytic effector and related proteins through complex intracellular signals. This study was aimed to investigate whether there is selective expression of these cytolytic markers in the putative NK-cell lymphomas and whether there is correlation with zonal tumor cell death in these tumors. Expression of the cytolytic effectors perforin, granzyme B9, and the granule membrane protein TIA1 were examined in 24 putative NK-cell lymphomas, 18 postthymic T-cell lymphomas (one case CD8+ CD56+ and three anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), three T-lymphoblastic lymphomas, and 20 B-cell lymphomas. Nineteen (79%) putative NK-cell lymphomas expressed perforin, and all 24 cases expressed granzyme B9 and TIA1. The only CD8+ CD56+ postthymic T-cell lymphoma also expressed all three cytolytic markers, two CD8- ALCL expressed TIA1; other postthymic T-cell, T-lymphoblastic, and B-cell lymphomas were consistently negative. There was strong correlation between percentage perforin-positive cells and zonal tumor cell death. Angioinvasion, in contrast, was present only in a proportion (37%) of these lymphomas despite the frequent presence of zonal tumor cell death (71%). We propose that cytolytic effector and related proteins produced by putative NK and some CD8+ CD56+ postthymic T-cell lymphomas, probably in conjunction with other mechanisms, may effect massive tumor cell apoptosis. The frequent expression of cytolytic effector markers in the CD2+ surface CD3- CD56+ putative NK-cell lymphomas lends further support to their probable NK cell origin.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"natural killer\\", \\"T-lymphoblastic lymphomas\\", \\"CD8- ALCL\\", \\"B-cell lymphomas\\", \\"postthymic T-cell\\", \\"NK-cell lymphomas\\", \\"postthymic T-cell lymphomas\\", \\"ALCL\\", \\"granule membrane\\", \\"NK cell\\", \\"lymphomas\\", \\"CD8+ CD56+ postthymic T-cell lymphoma\\", \\"tumor cell\\", \\"cell\\", \\"cytotoxic T cells\\", \\"anaplastic large cell lymphomas\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"T-lymphoblastic\\", \\"CD8+ CD56+ postthymic T-cell lymphomas\\", \\"intracellular\\", \\"CD8+ CD56+\\", \\"cells\\", \\"CD2+ surface CD3- CD56+ putative NK-cell lymphomas\\", \\"NK\\", \\"natural killer cell lymphomas\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

AIM To determine the proportion of patients achieving tacrolimus whole-blood concentrations of ≥10 ng/mL within 3 days of kidney transplantation , after randomization either to standard dosing ( control group ) or post-transplantation dosing guided by a 2-hour ( C ( 2 ) ) level following a preoperative tacrolimus dose ( T2 group ) . METHODS The first postoperative tacrolimus dose was given either according to standard care ( control group ) or 0.15 mg/kg b.d . if the pre-transplant C ( 2 ) level was ≤20 ng/mL , 0.1 mg/kg b.d . if the C ( 2 ) level was 21-59 ng/mL or 0.05 mg/kg b.d . if the C ( 2 ) level was ≥60 ng/mL ( T2 group ) . Subsequent dosing in both groups was based upon tacrolimus trough level monitoring . Participants received concomitant mycophenolate mofetil and steroids . RESULTS Ninety patients were recruited , of which 84 were included in the analysis ( control group n=43 ; T2 group n=41 ) . There was no difference in the proportion of subjects achieving tacrolimus trough levels ≥10 ng/mL ( 82.9 % Control vs 93.0 % T2 ; P=0.19 ) or between 10 and 15 ng/mL ( 41.5 % Control vs 41.9 % T2 ; P=0.97 ) at day 3 post transplant . The T2 group achieved tacrolimus trough levels of ≥10 ng/mL significantly faster than the control group ( 100 % achievement in 14 days ( Control ) versus 4 days ( T2 ) ; P=0.01 ) . CONCLUSION Performing a pre-transplant tacrolimus C ( 2 ) does not significantly increase the high proportion of subjects achieving 10 ng/mL tacrolimus concentrations by day 3 using routine protocols . However , compared with standard care , performing a pre-transplant tacrolimus C ( 2 ) does lead to patients achieving a whole-blood concentration of ≥10 ng/mL sooner .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"tacrolimus\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"tacrolimus whole-blood concentrations\\", \\"tacrolimus requirements post-transplant\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"kidney transplantation\\", \\"post-transplant\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

However, for many language pairs, it is difficult to acquire such corresponding linguistic parsers due to the lack of Tree-bank resources for training.Citation Sentence:This indicates that parse trees are usually not the optimal choice for training tree-based translation models ( Wang et al. , 2010 ) .Context after the citation:Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the tree structure that is independent from Tree-bank resources and simultaneously considers the bilingual mapping inside the bilingual sentence pairs would be a good choice for building treebased translation models. Therefore, complying with the above conditions, we propose an unsupervised tree structure for treebased translation models in this study. In the structures, tree nodes are labeled by combining the word classes of their boundary words rather than by syntactic labels, such as NP, VP. Furthermore, using these node labels, we design a generative Bayesian model to infer the final tree structure based on synchronous tree substitution grammars (STSG) 2 .","answer":"Background"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an essential role in metastasis. However, what enables TAMs to have a superior capacity to establish pre-metastatic microenvironment in distant organs is unclear. Here we have begun to uncover the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A in TAMs on lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. CYP4A(+) TAM infiltration was positively associated with metastasis, pre-metastatic niche formation and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The pharmacological inhibition of CYP4A reduced lung pre-metastatic niche formation (evidenced by a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 positive (VEGFR1(+)) myeloid cell recruitment and pro-metastatic protein expression) and metastatic burden, accompanied with TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype in spontaneous metastasis models of 4T1 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma. Co-implantation of 4T1 cells with CYP4A10(high) macrophages promoted lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Depletion of TAMs disrupted lung pre-metastatic niches and thereby prevented metastasis. Treatment with the CM from CYP4A10(high) M2 macrophages (M2) increased pre-metastatic niche formation and metastatic burden in the lungs, whereas CYP4A inhibition attenuated these effects. In vitro TAM polarization away from the M2 phenotype induced by CYP4A inhibition decreased VEGFR1(+) myeloid cell migration and fibronectin expression, accompanied with downregulation of STAT3 signaling. Conversely, overexpression of CYP4A or exogenous addition of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid promoted M2 polarization and cytokine production of macrophages and thereby enhanced migration of VEGFR1(+) myeloid cells, which were reversed by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of STAT3. Importantly, a combined blocking M2 macrophage-derived factors TGF-β, VEGF and SDF-1 abolished VEGFR1(+) myeloid cell migration and fibroblast activation induced by CYP4A. In summary, CYP4A in TAMs is crucial for lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in human cancer.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"(CYP) 4A\\", \\"VEGFR1\\", \\"STAT3\\", \\"CYP4A\\", \\"vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1\\", \\"CYP4A10\\", \\"cytochrome P450\\", \\"VEGF\\", \\"cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A\\", \\"SDF-1\\", \\"fibronectin\\", \\"TGF-u03b2\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

This has hampered and led to drastic changes in the functioning of healthcare services, forcing the professionals to adapt and work efficiently. The present study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the professional practices of audiologists and speech-language pathologists in India using a cross-sectional knowledge, attitude and practices survey. Material and methods: The study was conducted in two phases; phase one involved development and validation of the questionnaire, while phase II involved data collection. A cross-sectional self-reported internet-based study using convenience sampling was carried out. Results: Two hundred and eleven audiologists and speech-language pathologists responded to the survey. Overall, the professionals exhibited good knowledge levels regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there were differences in their attitudes towards service delivery in the midst of the pandemic. Further, poor practices towards infection control measures especially in terms of hand washing was noted. Conclusion: The findings of the present study are useful in highlighting the need to create better awareness among these professionals about appropriate and standard infection control measures.

The transcription factor NF-kappa B controls the induction of numerous cytokine promoters during the activation of T lymphocytes. Inhibition of T cell activation by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 exerts a suppressive effect on the induction of these NF-kappa B-controlled cytokine promoters. We show for human Jurkat T leukemia cells, as well as human and mouse primary T lymphocytes, that this inhibitory effect is accompanied by an impaired nuclear translocation of the Rel proteins c-Rel, RelA / p65 and NF-kappa B1 / p50, whereas the nuclear appearance of RelB remains unaffected.

Inhibitors of Apoptosis Protein (IAPs) are guardian ubiquitin ligases that keep classic proapoptotic proteins in check. Systematic identification of additional IAP substrates is challenged by the heterogeneity and sheer number of ubiquitinated proteins (> 5,000). Here we report a powerful catalytic tagging tool, the NEDDylator, which fuses a NEDD8 E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc12, to the ubiquitin ligase, XIAP or cIAP1. This permits transfer of the rare ubiquitin homolog NEDD8 to the ubiquitin E3 substrates, allowing them to be efficiently purified for LC-MS/MS identification. We have identified > 50 potential IAP substrates of both cytosolic and mitochondrial origin that bear hallmark N-terminal IAP binding motifs. These substrates include the recently discovered protein phosphatase PGAM5, which we show is proteolytically processed, accumulates in cytosol during apoptosis, and sensitizes cells to death. These studies reveal mechanisms and antagonistic partners for specific IAPs, and provide a powerful technology for labeling binding partners in transient protein-protein complexes.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

A follow-up study of 306/321 consecutive cases.Abstract 1:In a prospect i ve study of 321 consecutive cases of dislocation ankle fractures , operatively treated according to the AO ( ASIF ) principles , 306 cases ( 95 % ) were followed up two to six years after surgery . The infection rate was 1.8 % with no septic arthritis . The clinical results were \\" excellent and good \\" in 82 % , \\" acceptable \\" in 8 % , and \\" poor \\" in 10 % . Posttraumatic arthritis occurred in 14 % and was significantly more common among middle-aged women . There was a strong correlation between the degree of arthritis and the clinical result . A computer analysis ( AID ) revealed that the most decisive factors influencing the clinical result were the type of fracture , the accuracy of the reduction , and the sex of the patient . Exact reduction , rigid internal fixation  , early postoperative joint exercises  , and subsequent full weight-bearing  in a below-the-knee walking plaster are essential for a good end result of fracture-dislocations of the ankle jointTitle 2:“A to P” Screw Versus Posterolateral Plate for Posterior Malleolus Fixation in Trimalleolar Ankle FracturesAbstract 2:Objectives : To compare radiographic and clinical midterm outcomes of posterior malleolar fractures treated with posterior buttress plating versus anterior to posterior lag screw fixation . Design : Retrospective case series . Setting : Level I trauma center . Patients / Participants : Between January 2002 and December 2010 , patients with posterior malleolar fractures were identified by Current Procedural Terminology code and their charts review ed for eligibility . Intervention : Posterior malleolar fixation using either anterior to posterior ( AP ) lag screws or posterior buttress plating . Main Outcome Measurements : Demographic data , length of follow-up , range of motion , and postoperative Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment ( SMFA ) scores were the main outcome measurements . Immediate postoperative radiographs for residual gap/step-off and final follow-up radiographs for the degree of arthritis that developed were evaluated . Results : Thirty-seven patients were eligible for the study , and 27 chose to participate . Sixteen patients underwent posterior buttress plating , and 11 underwent AP screw fixation with mean follow-up times of 54.9 and 32 months , respectively . Demographic data were similar between groups . The posterolateral plating group demonstrated superior postoperative SMFA scores compared with the AP screw group with statistically significant differences in the SMFA bother index ( 26.7 vs. 9.2 , P = 0.03 ) and trends toward improvement in the mobility ( 28.3 vs. 12.9 , P = 0.08 ) and functional indices ( 20.2 vs. 9.4 , P = 0.08 ) . There were no significant differences in the range of motion or the development of ankle arthritis over time . Conclusions : Patients with trimalleolar ankle fractures in whom the posterior malleolus was treated with posterolateral buttress plating had superior clinical outcomes at follow-up compared with those treated with AP screws .

Methods A total of 102 cases of ankle joint fractures involving the posterior malleolus in five large-scale skeletal trauma centres in China , from January 2000 to July 2009 , were retrospectively analysed in terms of surgical treatment and complete follow-up . Ankle joint mobility , posterior malleolus fragment size , articular surface evenness , Ankle-Hindfoot Scale of the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ( AOFAS ) score , and imaging scale score for arthritis were recorded . The degree of fracture pain during rest , active movement , and weight-bearing walking , and satisfaction with treatment were evaluated using a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Results The average AOFAS score was 95.9 , excellence rate was 92.2 % , and average VAS scores for degree of fracture pain during rest , active movement , and weight-bearing walking were 0.15 , 0.31 , and 0.68 , respectively . Thirty-six cases showed arthritic manifestations . Ankle joint mobility along all directions on the injured side was lower than that on the unaffected side . There was no obvious difference in treatment effect between the fixed and unfixed posterior malleolus fragment groups for all and for fragment size of < 25 % ; between fixing the posterior malleolus fragment from front to back or from back to front ; or between elderly patients ( ≥60 years old ) and young patients ( < 60 years old ) . There was a distinct difference in the treatment effect between articular surface evenness and unevenness for all and for fragment size of ≥25 % . Conclusions For all 102 cases of ankle joint fracture involving the posterior malleolus , the treatment effect was satisfactory . Restoration of an even articular surface , especially when fragment size ≥25 % , should be attempted during treatmentTitle 4:Comparison of Lag Screw Versus Buttress Plate Fixation of Posterior Malleolar FracturesAbstract 4:Background : The goal of this study was to report the results of selective open reduction and internal fixation of fractures of the posterior malleolus with a posterolateral approach and to compare the results of the 2 techniques . Methods : We prospect ively evaluated 40 patients who underwent posterior malleolar fracture fixation between 2008 and 2012 . The patients were treated with a posterolateral approach . We assigned alternating patients to receive plate fixation and the next screw fixation , consecutively , based on the order in which they presented to our institution . Fixation of the posterior malleolus was made with lag screws in 20 patients and a buttress plate in 20 patients . We used American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ( AOFAS ) scores , range of motion ( ROM ) of the ankle , and radiographic evaluations as the main outcome measurements . The mean follow-up was 38.2 ( range , 24 - 51 ) months . Results : Full union without any loss of reduction was obtained in 38 of the 40 patients . We detected a union with a step-off of 3 mm in 1 patient in the screw group and a step-off of 2 mm in 1 patient in the plate group . At the final follow-up , the mean AOFAS score of the patients regardless of fixation type was 94.1 ( range , 85 - 100 ) . The statistical results showed no significant difference between the patients regardless of the fixation type of the posterior malleolus in terms of AOFAS scores and ROM of the ankle ( P > .05 ) . Conclusions : Good ( AOFAS score of 94/100 ) and equivalent ( within 3 points ) results were obtained using the 2 techniques ( screws or plate ) for fixation after open reduction of posterior malleolar fragments . Level of Evidence : Level II , prospect i ve case seriesTitle 5:Lateral Transmalleolar Approach and Miniscrews Fixation for Displaced Posterolateral Fragments of Posterior Malleolus Fractures in Adults: A Consecutive StudyAbstract 5:Objectives : To evaluate the lateral transmalleolar ( LTM ) approach for a displaced posterolateral fragments of a posterior malleolus fracture . Design : Prospect i ve , consecutive . Setting : Level 1 trauma center . Patients : Thirty-six patients . Outcome Measures : The x-rays , evaluation of arthritic changes of the ankle joint , range of motion , and Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment question naire ( SMFA ) . Intervention : The LTM approach followed by multiple interfragmentary miniscrew-only fixation . Results : No patients experienced intraoperative or postoperative complications that required a revision operation . All fractures healed . There were no infections , and no patient required implant removal . The median range of motion showed no significant difference as compared with the uninjured side . Patients achieved a mean SMFA dysfunction index of 8.2 ± 2.4 points and a mean SMFA bother index of 3.2 ± 1.2 points . All patients performed normal daily life activities at averagely 3 ( range , 2–5 ) months postoperatively . Conclusions : Direct visualization with the LTM approach followed by fixation with multiple miniscrews may be an alternative option for the treatment of ankle fractures with a posterolateral fragment associated with a posterior malleolar fracture . Level of Evidence : Therapeutic Level IV . See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence","answer":"There was no clear association between posterior fragment size and functional outcome or development of osteoarthritis .The non-anatomical reduction of the fragment was of more influence on outcome .Radiological and functional outcome was better after open reduction and internal fixation via the posterolateral approach than after percutaneous anterior-to-posterior screw fixation .Conclusion The posterior fragment size is not a clear indication for its fixation .A step-off , however , seems an important indicator for developing posttraumatic osteoarthritis and worse functional outcome .Posterior fragments involving the intra-articular surface need to be reduced and fixated to prevent postoperative persisting step-off .Furthermore , fixation of the posterior malleolus via an open posterolateral approach seems superior to percutaneous anterior-to-posterior fixation ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

A synthetic decapeptide TKKQKTDEDD was identified as the most potent lymphocyte stimulator. The activity of this peptide was sequence-specific and comparable to that of the intact molecule, suggesting that ProTalpha's immunoactive segment encompasses the nuclear localization signal sequence of the polypeptide.These data, in conjunction with reports showing that the peptide TKKQKTDEDD is generated in vivo upon caspase-cleavage of ProTalpha during apoptosis, strengthen our hypothesis that immune response stimulation by ProTalpha is in principle exerted via its bioactive C-terminal decapaptide, which can acquire a sequence-specific beta-sheet conformation and induce DC maturation.Ability to stimulate p53-dependent transcription was lost by C-terminal mutants of prothymosin alpha with impaired nuclear accumulation, but not by N-terminal deletion mutants and by the double mutant of prothymosin alpha with impaired ability to bind Keap1, suggesting that prothymosinalpha-Keap1 interaction is dispensable for p53 response.We found that zinc binding causes partial folding of the C-terminal half of ProTalpha, especially the Glu-rich regionThe immunologically active site of prothymosin alpha is located at the carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide.. ProTalpha(89-102) and proTalpha(103-109) significantly fortified healthy donor-lymphocytes' immune responses to levels comparable to those induced by intact proTalpha. These effects were more pronounced in cancer patients, where peptides proTalpha(89-102) and proTalpha(103-109) partly, however significantly, restored the depressed AMLR and cytolytic ability of PBMC, by simulating the biological activity exerted by intact proTalpha.This is the first report showing that proTalpha's immunomodulating activity can be substituted by its C-terminal peptide(s)The peptide (1-88) of calf prothymosin alpha is shown not to accumulate in the Xenopus nucleus, demonstrating that the C-terminal 21 residues, which include a KKQK sequence, are required for nuclear migration.fProt-alpha contains 28 aspartic and 25 glutamic acid residues and presents the typical basic KKQK amino acid sequence in the close carboxyl terminal regionThis is the first report showing that proTalpha's immunomodulating activity can be substituted by its C-terminal peptide(s).","answer":"Prothymosin alpha (ProTα) (encoded in human by the PTMA gene) is a ubiquitous, highly acidic nuclear polypeptide.

UTI is increasingly being used for speech therapy, making it important to develop automatic methods to assist various time-consuming manual tasks currently performed by speech therapists. A key challenge is to generalize the automatic processing of ultrasound tongue images to previously unseen speakers. In this work, we investigate the classification of phonetic segments (tongue shapes) from raw ultrasound recordings under several training scenarios: speaker-dependent, multi-speaker, speaker-independent, and speaker-adapted. We observe that models underperform when applied to data from speakers not seen at training time. However, when provided with minimal additional speaker information, such as the mean ultrasound frame, the models generalize better to unseen speakers.IntroductionUltrasound tongue imaging (UTI) uses standard medical ultrasound to visualize the tongue surface during speech production. It provides a non-invasive, clinically safe, and increasingly inexpensive method to visualize the vocal tract. Articulatory visual biofeedback of the speech production process, using UTI, can be valuable for speech therapy BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 or language learning BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . Ultrasound visual biofeedback combines auditory information with visual information of the tongue position, allowing users, for example, to correct inaccurate articulations in real-time during therapy or learning. In the context of speech therapy, automatic processing of ultrasound images was used for tongue contour extraction BIBREF5 and the animation of a tongue model BIBREF6 . More broadly, speech recognition and synthesis from articulatory signals BIBREF7 captured using UTI can be used with silent speech interfaces in order to help restore spoken communication for users with speech or motor impairments, or to allow silent spoken communication in situations where audible speech is undesirable BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . Similarly, ultrasound images of the tongue have been used for direct estimation of acoustic parameters for speech synthesis BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 .Speech and language therapists (SLTs) have found UTI to be very useful in speech therapy. In this work we explore the automatic processing of ultrasound tongue images in order to assist SLTs, who currently largely rely on manual processing when using articulatory imaging in speech therapy. One task that could assist SLTs is the automatic classification of tongue shapes from raw ultrasound. This can facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of speech sound disorders, by allowing SLTs to automatically identify incorrect articulations, or by quantifying patient progress in therapy. In addition to being directly useful for speech therapy, the classification of tongue shapes enables further understanding of phonetic variability in ultrasound tongue images. Much of the previous work in this area has focused on speaker-dependent models. In this work we investigate how automatic processing of ultrasound tongue imaging is affected by speaker variation, and how severe degradations in performance can be avoided when applying systems to data from previously unseen speakers through the use of speaker adaptation and speaker normalization approaches.Below, we present the main challenges associated with the automatic processing of ultrasound data, together with a review of speaker-independent models applied to UTI. Following this, we present the experiments that we have performed (Section SECREF2 ), and discuss the results obtained (Section SECREF3 ). Finally we propose some future work and conclude the paper (Sections SECREF4 and SECREF5 ).Ultrasound Tongue ImagingThere are several challenges associated with the automatic processing of ultrasound tongue images.Image quality and limitations. UTI output tends to be noisy, with unrelated high-contrast edges, speckle noise, or interruptions of the tongue surface BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . Additionally, the oral cavity is not entirely visible from the image, missing the lips, the palate, or the pharyngeal wall.Inter-speaker variation. Age and physiology may affect the output, with children imaging better than adults due to more moisture in the mouth and less tissue fat BIBREF16 . However, dry mouths lead to poor imaging, which might occur in speech therapy if a child is nervous during a session. Similarly, the vocal tracts of children across different ages may be more variable than those of adults.Probe placement. Articulators that are orthogonal to the ultrasound beam direction image well, while those at an angle tend to image poorly. Incorrect or variable probe placement during recordings may lead to high variability between otherwise similar tongue shapes. This may be controlled using helmets BIBREF18 , although it is unreasonable to expect the speaker to remain still throughout the recording session, especially if working with children. Therefore, probe displacement should be expected to be a factor in image quality and consistency.Limited data. Although ultrasound imaging is becoming less expensive to acquire, there is still a lack of large publicly available databases to evaluate automatic processing methods. The UltraSuite Repository BIBREF19 , which we use in this work, helps alleviate this issue, but it still does not compare to standard speech recognition or image classification databases, which contain hundreds of hours of speech or millions of images.Related WorkEarlier work concerned with speech recognition from ultrasound data has mostly been focused on speaker-dependent systems BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . An exception is the work of Xu et al. BIBREF24 , which investigates the classification of tongue gestures from ultrasound data using convolutional neural networks. Some results are presented for a speaker-independent system, although the investigation is limited to two speakers generalizing to a third. Fabre et al BIBREF5 present a method for automatic tongue contour extraction from ultrasound data. The system is evaluated in a speaker-independent way by training on data from eight speakers and evaluating on a single held out speaker. In both of these studies, a large drop in accuracy was observed when using speaker-independent systems in comparison to speaker-dependent systems. Our investigation differs from previous work in that we focus on child speech while using a larger number of speakers (58 children). Additionally, we use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of speaker-independent systems across all speakers, rather than using a small held out subset.Ultrasound DataWe use the Ultrax Typically Developing dataset (UXTD) from the publicly available UltraSuite repository BIBREF19 . This dataset contains synchronized acoustic and ultrasound data from 58 typically developing children, aged 5-12 years old (31 female, 27 male). The data was aligned at the phone-level, according to the methods described in BIBREF19 , BIBREF25 . For this work, we discarded the acoustic data and focused only on the B-Mode ultrasound images capturing a midsaggital view of the tongue. The data was recorded using an Ultrasonix SonixRP machine using Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA) software at INLINEFORM0 121fps with a 135 field of view. A single ultrasound frame consists of 412 echo returns from each of the 63 scan lines (63x412 raw frames). For this work, we only use UXTD type A (semantically unrelated words, such as pack, tap, peak, tea, oak, toe) and type B (non-words designed to elicit the articulation of target phones, such as apa, eepee, opo) utterances.Data SelectionFor this investigation, we define a simplified phonetic segment classification task. We determine four classes corresponding to distinct places of articulation. The first consists of bilabial and labiodental phones (e.g. /p, b, v, f, .../). The second class includes dental, alveolar, and postalveolar phones (e.g. /th, d, t, z, s, sh, .../). The third class consists of velar phones (e.g. /k, g, .../). Finally, the fourth class consists of alveolar approximant /r/. Figure FIGREF1 shows examples of the four classes for two speakers.For each speaker, we divide all available utterances into disjoint train, development, and test sets. Using the force-aligned phone boundaries, we extract the mid-phone frame for each example across the four classes, which leads to a data imbalance. Therefore, for all utterances in the training set, we randomly sample additional examples within a window of 5 frames around the center phone, to at least 50 training examples per class per speaker. It is not always possible to reach the target of 50 examples, however, if no more data is available to sample from. This process gives a total of INLINEFORM0 10700 training examples with roughly 2000 to 3000 examples per class, with each speaker having an average of 185 examples. Because the amount of data varies per speaker, we compute a sampling score, which denotes the proportion of sampled examples to the speaker's total training examples. We expect speakers with high sampling scores (less unique data overall) to underperform when compared with speakers with more varied training examples.Preprocessing and Model ArchitecturesFor each system, we normalize the training data to zero mean and unit variance. Due to the high dimensionality of the data (63x412 samples per frame), we have opted to investigate two preprocessing techniques: principal components analysis (PCA, often called eigentongues in this context) and a 2-dimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT). In this paper, Raw input denotes the mean-variance normalized raw ultrasound frame. PCA applies principal components analysis to the normalized training data and preserves the top 1000 components. DCT applies the 2D DCT to the normalized raw ultrasound frame and the upper left 40x40 submatrix (1600 coefficients) is flattened and used as input.The first type of classifier we evaluate in this work are feedforward neural networks (DNNs) consisting of 3 hidden layers, each with 512 rectified linear units (ReLUs) with a softmax activation function. The networks are optimized for 40 epochs with a mini-batch of 32 samples using stochastic gradient descent. Based on preliminary experiments on the validation set, hyperparameters such learning rate, decay rate, and L2 weight vary depending on the input format (Raw, PCA, or DCT). Generally, Raw inputs work better with smaller learning rates and heavier regularization to prevent overfitting to the high-dimensional data. As a second classifier to evaluate, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 2 convolutional and max pooling layers, followed by 2 fully-connected ReLU layers with 512 nodes. The convolutional layers use 16 filters, 8x8 and 4x4 kernels respectively, and rectified units. The fully-connected layers use dropout with a drop probability of 0.2. Because CNN systems take longer to converge, they are optimized over 200 epochs. For all systems, at the end of every epoch, the model is evaluated on the development set, and the best model across all epochs is kept.Future WorkThere are various possible extensions for this work. For example, using all frames assigned to a phone, rather than using only the middle frame. Recurrent architectures are natural candidates for such systems. Additionally, if using these techniques for speech therapy, the audio signal will be available. An extension of these analyses should not be limited to the ultrasound signal, but instead evaluate whether audio and ultrasound can be complementary. Further work should aim to extend the four classes to more a fine-grained place of articulation, possibly based on phonological processes. Similarly, investigating which classes lead to classification errors might help explain some of the observed results. Although we have looked at variables such as age, gender, or amount of data to explain speaker variation, there may be additional factors involved, such as the general quality of the ultrasound image. Image quality could be affected by probe placement, dry mouths, or other factors. Automatically identifying or measuring such cases could be beneficial for speech therapy, for example, by signalling the therapist that the data being collected is sub-optimal.ConclusionIn this paper, we have investigated speaker-independent models for the classification of phonetic segments from raw ultrasound data. We have shown that the performance of the models heavily degrades when evaluated on data from unseen speakers. This is a result of the variability in ultrasound images, mostly due to differences across speakers, but also due to shifts in probe placement. Using the mean of all ultrasound frames for a new speaker improves the generalization of the models to unseen data, especially when using convolutional neural networks. We have also shown that adapting a pre-trained speaker-independent system using as few as 50 ultrasound frames can outperform a corresponding speaker-dependent system.Fig. 1. Ultrasound samples for the four output classes based on place of articulation. The top row contains samples from speaker 12 (male, aged six), and the bottom row from speaker 13 (female, aged eleven). All samples show a midsaggital view of the oral cavity with the tip of the tongue facing right. Each sample is the mid-point frame of a phone uttered in an aCa context (e.g. apa, ata, ara, aka). See the UltraSuite repository2 for details on interpreting ultrasound tongue images.Fig. 2. Ultrasound mean image for speaker 12 (top row) and speaker 13 (bottom row).

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:Learning in Gaussian Process models occurs through the adaptation of hyperparameters of the mean and the covariance function.The classical approach entails maximizing the marginal likelihood yielding fixed point estimates (an approach called Type II maximum likelihood or ML-II). An alternative learning procedure is to infer the posterior over hyperparameters in a hierarchical specification of GPs we call Fully Bayesian Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). This work considers two approximations to the intractable hyperparameter posterior, 1) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) yielding a sampling based approximation and2) Variational Inference (VI) where the posterior over hyperparameters is approximated by a factorized Gaussian (mean-field) or a full rank Gaussian accounting for correlations between hyperparameters.We analyse the predictive performance for fully Bayesian GPR on a range of benchmark data sets.We demonstrate the feasibility of fully Bayesian GPR in the Gaussian likelihood setting for moderate sized high-dimensional data sets with composite kernels.We present a concise comparative analysis across different approximation schemes and find that VI schemes based on the Gaussian variational family are only marginally inferior in terms of predictive performance to the gold standard HMC.While sampling with HMC can be tuned to generate samples from multi-modal posteriors using tempered transitions (Neal, 1996) , the predictions can remain invariant to samples from different hyperparameter modes.Fully Bayesian bottom: Airline).In the CO 2 data where we undertake long-range extrapolation, the uncertainty intervals under the full Bayesian schemes capture the true observations while ML-II underestimates predictive uncertainty.For the Airline dataset, red in each twoway plot denotes ML-II, the uncertainty intervals under the full Bayesian schemes capture the upward trend better than ML-II.The latter also misses on structure that the other schemes capture.inference in GPs is highly intractable and one has to consider the trade-off between computational cost, accuracy and robustness of uncertainty intervals.Most interesting real-world applications of GPs entail hand-crafted kernels involving many hyperparameters where there risk of overfitting is not only higher but also hard to detect.A more robust solution is to integrate over the hyperparameters and compute predictive intervals that reflect these uncertainties.An interesting question is whether conducting inference over hierarchies in GPs increases expressivity and representational power by accounting for a more diverse range of models consistent with the data.More specifically, how does it compare to the expressivity of deep GPs (Damianou and Lawrence, 2013) with point estimate hyperparameters.Further, these general approximation schemes can be considered in conjunction with different incarnations of GP models where transformations are used to warp the observation space yielding warped GPs (Snelson et al., 2004) or warp the input space either using parametric transformations like neural nets yielding deep kernel learning (Wilson et al., 2016) or non-parametric ones yielding deep GPs (Damianou and Lawrence, 2013 6.Appendix","answer":"Analysis of Bayesian Hyperparameter Inference in Gaussian Process Regression"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

In this paper, we consider a subtype of humour - puns, which are a common type of wordplay-based jokes. In particular, we consider code-mixed puns which have become increasingly mainstream on social media, in informal conversations and advertisements and aim to build a system which can automatically identify the pun location and recover the target of such puns. We first study and classify code-mixed puns into two categories namely intra-sentential and intra-word, and then propose a four-step algorithm to recover the pun targets for puns belonging to the intra-sentential category. Our algorithm uses language models, and phonetic similarity-based features to get the desired results. We test our approach on a small set of code-mixed punning advertisements, and observe that our system is successfully able to recover the targets for 67% of the puns.IntroductionHumour is one of the most complex and intriguing phenomenon of the human language. It exists in various forms, across space and time, in literature and culture, and is a valued part of human interactions. Puns are one of the simplest and most common forms of humour in the English language. They are also one of the most widespread forms of spontaneous humour BIBREF0 and have found their place in casual conversations, literature, online comments, tweets and advertisements BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . Puns are a hugely versatile and commonly used literary device and it is essential to include them in any comprehensive approach to computational humour.In this paper, we consider Hindi-English code-mixed puns and aim to automatically recover their targets. The target of a pun is its phonologically similar counterpart, the relationship to which and whose resolution (recovery) in the mind of the listener/hearer induces humour. For example, in the pun “The life of a patient of hypertension is always at steak.\\" the word “steak\\" is the pun with target “stake\\".With India being a diverse linguistic region, there is an ever increasing usage of code-mixed Hindi-English language (along with various others) because bilingualism and even multilingualism are quite common. Consequently, we have also seen an increase in the usage of code-mixed language in online forums, advertisements etc. Code-mixed humour, especially puns have become increasingly popular because being able to use the same punning techniques but with two languages in play has opened up numerous avenues for new and interesting wordplays. With the increasing popularity and acceptance for the usage of code-mixed language, it has become important that computers are also able to process it and even decipher complex phenomena like humour. Traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) based methods cannot be used in target recovery of code-mixed puns, because they are no longer about multiple senses of a single word but about two words from two different languages. Code-switching comes with no markers, and the punning word may not even be a word in either of the languages being used. Sometimes words from the two languages can be combined to form a word which only a bilingual speaker would understand. Hence, this task on such data calls for a different set of strategies altogether. We approach this problem in two parts. First, we analyze the types of structures in code-mixed puns and classify them into two categories namely intra-sequential and intra-word. Second, we develop a four stage pipeline to achieve our goal - Language Identification, Pun Candidate Identification, Context Lookup and Phonetic Distance Minimization. We then test our approach on a small dataset and note that our method is successfully able to recover targets for a majority of the puns.To the best of our knowledge, this is a first attempt at dealing with code-mixed puns. The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 gives a brief description of the background and prior work on puns - both in the field of linguistics and in the field of computational humour, along with a brief introduction to the field of code-mixing. Section 3 defines our problem statement, our classification model on code-mixed puns, the dataset we use to test our approach, and our proposed model for the task of automatic target recovery of Hindi-English code-mixed puns. In Section 4, we analyse the performance of our model on a set of puns, and discuss the various error cases. Finally, we conclude in Section 5 with a review of our research contributions and an outline of our plans for future work.Code-mixingCode-mixing is the mixing of two or more languages or language varieties. Code-mixing is now recognized as a natural part of bilingual and multilingual language use. Significant linguistic efforts have been made to understand the sociological and conversational necessity behind code-switching BIBREF7 ; for example, to understand whether it is an act of identity in a social group, or a consequence of a lack of competence in either of the languages. These papers distinguish between inter-sentence, intra-sentence and intra-word code mixing.Different types of language mixing phenomena have been discussed and defined by several linguists, with some making clear distinctions between phenomena based on certain criteria, while others use \`code-mixing’ or \`code-switching’ as umbrella terms to include any type of language mixing — see, e.g., Muysken muysken1995code or Gafaranga and Torras gafaranga2002interactional. In this paper, we use both these terms ‘code-mixing’ and \`code-switching' interchangeably.Coming to the work on automatic analysis of code-mixed languages, there have been studies on detecting code mixing in spoken language as well as different types of short texts, such as information retrieval queries BIBREF8 , SMS messages BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , social media data BIBREF11 and online conversations BIBREF12 . These scholars have carried out experiments for the task of language identification using language models, dictionaries, logistic regression classification, Conditional Random Fields, SVMs, and noted that approaches using contextual knowledge were most robust. King and Abney king2013labeling used weakly semi-supervised methods to perform word-level language identification.We however, use a dictionary based approach for the language identification task. While working with puns, ambiguity in language identification can be an important marker for identifying the pun, so it is more important for us to recognize all possible ambiguities rather than picking just one depending on probabilities. This ability to recognize ambiguities, and the simplicity of a dictionary-based language identification model makes it suited for this task.ClassificationFor the purposes of this research, we only consider puns where the ambiguity or the wordplay lies in the code-switching i.e, the pun word and its target are from different languages. For example the pun \\"Rivers can't hear because woh behri hoti hai.\\" is a sentence with the pun being behri (meaning deaf) and its target being beh rahi (meaning flowing). Here, while the sentence is code-mixed, the pun word and the target both belong to the same language. We do not consider such puns for the present study.We analyze the structure of code-mixed puns with the pun word and its target belonging to different languages and propose two broad categories to classify them in - puns where the code-mixing is intra-sentential and the other where it is intra-word. Both these categories are explained below, while we evaluate only on the former category.Intra-sentential code-mixing is where code-switching occurs within a sentence. Here, the language varies at the word level. Also, each word of the sentence belongs to one or the other language. Table 1 gives examples of puns belonging to this category.In this category, code mixing is present within a word. New words are formed using Portmanteau or Blending where two or more syllables/phonemes from different languages are blended together to form a single word, resulting in a word which is phonetically similar to the target word. Table 2 illustrates examples of intra-word code-mixed puns.ModelFor preprocessing the text we give as input to our system, we first tokenize the advertisement text using NLTK's BIBREF13 tokenizer and remove all punctuations. We then give the resultant tokens as input to our model, which is a 4 step process as described below:At this step, we aim to identify the language of each of the tokens in the input text by classifying them into one of the 5 categories: English, Hindi, Named Entity (NE), Out of Vocabulary (OOV), or Ambiguous (words that could belong to both English and Hindi).We use a dictionary-based lookup method to classify a word in English or Hindi. Since the input is in Roman script, to recognize Hindi words, we use a list of 30k transliterated Hindi words in Roman to their Devanagari counterparts BIBREF14 . For the English language, we collected news data from the archives of a leading Indian Newspaper, The Hindu. Data from 2012-2018 under the tags National, International, Sports, Cinema, Television was collected, amounting to 12,600 articles with 200k sentences and around 38k unique words. We use this data to build an English dictionary. Also, we used NLTK's BIBREF13 Named Entity Recognition module on the same data to get a dictionary of Named Entities.We first try to classify all tokens as English, Hindi and NE using these dictionaries. Then, words which are found in both English and Hindi are marked as Ambiguous. The words which do not fall into any of these are classified as OOV.We now identify all possible punning locations in the text. For this, we consider words on the boundaries of language change as candidates for pun locations. Then, all NEs and OOV words are added to the list of pun candidates as well. Third, if any Ambiguous words exist in the text, we consider it once as English and once as Hindi for the next steps.In this step, we contextually lookup all the candidate locations using left context and right context to get a list of all words that may occur at that position. We use bi-gram language models we built using Knesser-Ney smoothing BIBREF15 . We used the data mentioned in the previous step to build the language model for English, and 100k sentences from Hindi monolingual data from BIBREF16 to build the language models for English and Hindi respectively. As it is highly likely that the left and the right context at a pun location belong to different languages, we look at each of those separately instead of taking an intersection of the left and the right context.Lastly, at each pun location, we calculate the similarity of the word at that location with all the words that can occur at that location depending on the context and pick the most similar words as the possible targets.To compare words belonging to two different languages on a phonetic basis, we convert both of them to WX notation BIBREF17 , which denotes a standard way to represent Indian languages in the Roman script. We transliterate our identified Hindi words from Devanagari to WX notation. To convert English words to the same notation, we use the CMU phonetic dictionary , which uses a 39 phoneme set to represent North American pronunciations of English words. We build a mapping between this phoneme set and WX notation. Whenever there was no exact parallel between CMU pronouncing dictionary's notation and WX, we used the word's Indian English pronunciation to find the closest match.Once we converted all to WX notation, we use a modified version of Levenshtein Distance BIBREF18 to find most similar words. In this normalized version of Levenshtein distance, we account for a few features like aspirations (for example, /p/,/ph/) which are non-phonemic in English, vowel elongations, rhyme, same beginning or ending sounds.In case of an OOV word, since it cannot be converted to WX notation due to non-availability of any phonetic transcription, we simply find the words with the least orthographic distance when written in Roman script, using a similar measure as used for phonetic distance with a few more normalizations (for example, considering 'w' and 'v' as similar).Results and discussionWe test the model explained in the previous section on our test dataset described in Section 3.2 and note that this method is correctly able to recover targets for 34 out of these 51 puns, or around 67% of the puns, which are very encouraging results for this complex task. Examples where the system performed successfully are given in Table 3 .We do a thorough error analysis below for the cases our method fails for.Conclusion and Future workTo conclude, in this paper, we present a first-ever work on target recovery code-mixed puns. We study various puns where the word-play is a result of code-switching, and classify them into 2 categories - puns with intra-sentential code mixing and those with intra-word code mixing. We then propose a methodology to recover the targets for puns belonging to the former category, using only monolingual language data. We test our proposed approach on a small manually annotated dataset, and we see that our system was able to successfully recover 67% of the puns from the set.In the future, we want to perform a more comprehensive evaluation of this approach on a larger, more diverse set of puns. We want to improve and extend our approach to be able to recover intra-word code-mixed puns along with the intra-sentential ones that it handles right now. After that, the system should be extended to be able to recover all kinds of puns in code-mixed language, regardless of whether the pun itself is monolingual or code-mixed.Table 2: Examples of intra-word code-mixed punsTable 1: Examples of intra-sentential code-mixed punsTable 3: Examples of puns successfully recovered by our systemTable 6: Example for error case 3, where the target does not exist in the language model.Question: What are the categories of code-mixed puns?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"intra-sequential and intra-word\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"With India being a diverse linguistic region, there is an ever increasing usage of code-mixed Hindi-English language (along with various others) because bilingualism and even multilingualism are quite common. Consequently, we have also seen an increase in the usage of code-mixed language in online forums, advertisements etc. Code-mixed humour, especially puns have become increasingly popular because being able to use the same punning techniques but with two languages in play has opened up numerous avenues for new and interesting wordplays. With the increasing popularity and acceptance for the usage of code-mixed language, it has become important that computers are also able to process it and even decipher complex phenomena like humour. Traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) based methods cannot be used in target recovery of code-mixed puns, because they are no longer about multiple senses of a single word but about two words from two different languages. Code-switching comes with no markers, and the punning word may not even be a word in either of the languages being used. Sometimes words from the two languages can be combined to form a word which only a bilingual speaker would understand. Hence, this task on such data calls for a different set of strategies altogether. We approach this problem in two parts. First, we analyze the types of structures in code-mixed puns and classify them into two categories namely intra-sequential and intra-word. Second, we develop a four stage pipeline to achieve our goal - Language Identification, Pun Candidate Identification, Context Lookup and Phonetic Distance Minimization. We then test our approach on a small dataset and note that our method is successfully able to recover targets for a majority of the puns.\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

E.; Erdogan, H. M.; Ogun, M.; Kirmizigul, A. H.; Gokce, E.; Kuru, M.; Kukurt, A. Date: 2016-11-14DOI: 10.14202/vetworld.2016.1238-1241License: cc-byAbstract: AIM: This study has been conducted for the purpose of determining serum hepcidin, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and Fe levels in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia before and after treatment and the clinical significance of hepcidin in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study material consisted of 15 calves of different ages and sexes brought to the Training, Research and Application Center at the Kafkas University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine with suspected neonatal septicemia. 8.5 mL of blood was drawn from the jugular vein of each animal into coagulant tubes before and after treatment for one-off biochemical analyses and centrifuged. After this, the serum was separated. Hepcidin, TAS, TOS, and Fe levels in the serum were measured. RESULTS: While pre-treatment hepcidin levels were 58.42±3.46 ng/mL, post-treatment levels were 46.87±2.98 ng/mL (p<0.05). Pre-treatment Fe levels were 60.13±7.27 µg/dl, while post-treatment levels were 83.1±8.09 µg/dl (p<0.05). The changes in the TAS and TOS levels were also found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In light of the fact that hepcidin plays a role function in the regulation of Fe as well as the fact that Fe is a significant nutritional source for many microorganisms, it was concluded that hepcidin may play a significant role in nutritional immunity and the pathogenesis of diseases. Text: Neonatal calf septicemia causes high morbidity and mortality and is one of the leading and most significant difficulties in raising cattle. Calf septicemia is the main cause of death in the neonatal period [1] . Its etiology involves bacteria (commonly Escherichia coli), viruses (rota and coronavirus), parasites, and other factors. As the disease progresses quickly and is lethal, diagnosis and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible [2] . Hepcidin is a low molecular weight, antimicrobial peptide hormone and was first discovered in human urine [3] . It is produced by the liver as a firstline response to inflammatory reactions and high Fe concentrations [4, 5] . Hepcidin plays a fundamental role in the regulation of Fe metabolism [6] , which is a part of foundational cellular functions and thus of vital importance. On the other hand, by participating in redox reactions leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), Fe also causes oxidative stress. Therefore, Fe has been regarded as a potentially toxic  element to cells [7] . Fe also plays an important role in pathogenesis of bacterial infections as bacteria utilize Fe for survival, growth and proliferation; therefore, it is of paramount importance to control the Fe metabolism [6] . It is well known that the abundance of Fe suppresses defense system leading host vulnerable to infections. There is a significant relationship between Hepcidin, Fe metabolism, inflammation, and the immune system. The fact that hepcidin plays an active role in the regulation of Fe release from macrophages and in the control of excessive Fe absorption from the duodenum is well documented [6] . Hepcidin is a part of the natural defense mechanism, thus it limits the amount of Fe that can be utilized by pathogens [8] . In inflammatory conditions, hypoferremia is an important first-line protective mechanism in response to infections [9] . Fe also participates in redox reactions, causing the production of ROS, and thus leading to oxidative stress [7] . Free radicals play a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases [10] . Newborns are subject to oxidative stress during birth. It is also reported that in livestock diseases, especially enteritis and pneumonia, antioxidant capacity is efficacious [11] . This study was designed to determine the clinical significance of hepcidin in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia by evaluating serum hepcidin, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and Fe levels in calves suspected of neonatal septicemia before and after treatment. This study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Mehmet Akif Ersoy University Animal Experiments Local Ethics Committee (MAKU-HADYEK-Submission: 2014/77). The study consisted of 15 calves with suspected neonatal septicemia aged between 1 and 10 days old admitted to the Teaching Hospital of Veterinary Medicine. Suspected septicemia was diagnosed based on clinical (diarrhea, weakness in or absence of sucking reflex, the calf being in a supine position on the ground or being unable to stand, severe dehydration, abnormal rectal temperature [hypo-or hyperthermia], mucosal hyperemia, and full sclera) and hematological (increase in white blood cell [WBC] count) examinations; the animals were suspected to have septicemia [12, 13] . The animals were given standard treatment (antibiotic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin C, fluid therapy, and intestinal astringent). For determination of serum hepcidin, TAS, TOS, Fe levels, and hematological parameters; blood samples were taken before and after treatment in all cases. 8.5 mL of blood was taken from the jugular vein of each animal into coagulant tubes for biochemical analysis, and 3 mL blood was taken into ETDA tubes for hematological analysis. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the serum was harvested and kept at −20°C until the analysis. Serum hepcidin (Mybiosource ® ), TAS (Rel Assay Diagnostics ® ), and TOS (Rel Assay Diagnostics ® ) were determined using commercial ELISA kits, and Fe value was measured spectrophotometrically. Hematological (WBC, lymphocyte [LYM], red blood cells [RBC], mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hematocrit [HCT]) analysis was performed on blood counter (VG-MS4e ® , Melet Schloesıng, France). The results were evaluated using the t-test in the SPSS ® (SPSS 20, USA) statistical package program to determine the differences between values before and after treatment. Calves with suspected septicemia exhibited clinical signs of loss of appetite, fatigue, indifference to surroundings, reduced/absence of sucking reflex, cool extremities, inability to stand, diarrhea, eye sinking into their sockets, and hyperemia in the conjunctiva. The average body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rates of the animals were 37.18±0.13°C, 104±4.33/min, and 28.86±0.75/min pre-treatment; and 38.54±0.1°C, 107.53±2.20/min and 26.40±0.36/min post-treatment, respectively. The changes in hepcidin, TAS, TOS and Fe levels in the calves with suspected septicemia before and after treatment are given in Table- 1. After treatment, serum hepcidin and TOS levels were significantly lower than before treatment in calves. On contrary, serum TAS and Fe levels were significantly higher than before treatment (Table-1 ). The treatment of calves resulted in significant changes in the hematological parameters that were examined except for RBC. The WBC count, LYM count, MCV and HCT significantly changed after treatment when compared to values obtained before treatment (Table-2 ). This study aimed to determine the clinical importance or use of hepcidin by comparing the values of serum hepcidin, TAS, TOS and Fe levels in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia before and after treatment. Clinicians rely on clinical and laboratory examinations of patients to form a working diagnosis, so hematological and serum biochemical parameters are usually used for this purpose [14] . The hematological parameters (WBC, HCT, LYM, and MCV) evaluated in this study were comparable with those reported by others in neonatal calves with diarrhea and suspected septicemia [15] [16] [17] . Treatment significantly corrected to normal values the hematological parameters that were examined with the exception of RBC. Pretreatment leukocyte count was high because of the inflammation that occurred in the organism, and that the HCT levels were high due to the dehydration that occurred due to diarrhea. Hepcidin is controlled by the presence of inflammation in the body, Fe storage, and erythropoietic activity in the bone marrow and plays a primary role in the homeostasis of Fe [4] . The increase in tissue and plasma Fe levels stimulates the synthesis of hepcidin and reduces Fe release and enteric Fe absorption from macrophages and hepatocytes [18] . Increased hepcidin concentrations during inflammation and infection reduce serum Fe levels by decreasing Fe release from macrophages and hepatocytes, and thus Fe required for microorganisms and tumor cells is restricted [19] . Serum hepcidin levels in calves with suspected septicemia were significantly high before treatment when compared to after treatment; also Fe levels were lower before treatment when compared to after treatment in this study. This situation could be related to the interaction between hepcidin and Fe and also gives credence to the role of hepcidin in the hemostasis of Fe during inflammation and infection. As in our study, Fe levels are well known to decrease in diarrheic calves when compared to healthy calves [20, 21] . Although no study exists reporting hepcidin concentration in diseased calves, studies in human subjects show that cord blood hepcidin levels might be an important indicator in diagnosing early-onset of neonatal sepsis. The cord blood hepcidin levels of neonatal infants with sepsis varied between 118.1 and 8400 ng/mL and were significantly higher than the healthy infants [22] . A similar result was reported that hepcidin concentrations in neonatal infants with sepsis were significantly higher than in healthy infants [23] . These findings along with our results add credence to the idea that hepcidin-Fe interaction may play a role in the pathogenesis of septicemia. The production of free oxygen species causes alterations in protein, lipid, and DNA during oxidative stress and leads to the development of lesions in the organs [24] . Free iron has toxic characteristics as it catalyses the production of ROSs [25] and thus causes oxidative stress [26] . The role of Fe in the development of oxidative stress may once more show the importance of hepcidin, as an important Fe regulator, with regard to enhancing antioxidant capacity through inhibiting utilization of Fe by the organism as well as the host cells. The antioxidant and oxidative system are in a constant state of balance in the organism. Any event breaking up this balance in favor of the oxidative stress molecules will cause cell damage [27, 28] . The host cells initiate the antioxidant system in case of exposure to oxidative stress [27] . Kabu et al. [16] reported TOS and TAS values in neonatal calves with diarrhea as 13.47±0.81 μmol H 2 O 2 /L and 0.51±0.02 mmol Trolox-equivalent/L, respectively, and treatment of these calves caused changes in these values of 11.21±0.26 μmol H 2 O 2 /L and 0.55±0.02 mmol Troloxequivalent/L, respectively. Studies also reported that parameters used for oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) were higher [29] and antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase [21] , TAS) were lower in diarrheic calves [29] . Similarly, in our study, TAS level was significantly lower and TOS level was significantly higher in diarrheic calves before treatment, and treatment caused corrections in these parameters. Decrease in TAS and increase in TOS levels demonstrated that oxidative stress was evident in the diseased calves in our study. Increased TOS and hepcidin levels before treatment are thought that associated with inflammation. After treatment increased TAS and decreased hepcidin levels support this opinion. Hepcidin may play an important part in non-specific immunity and is a key molecule that plays a role in the pathogenesis of diseases by enhancing the development of antioxidant system. However, more detailed studies are needed on the role of hepcidin in the pathogenesis of septicemia. This work was carried out in collaboration between all authors.

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:Recent powerful pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable performance on most of the popular datasets for reading comprehension.It is time to introduce more challenging datasets to push the development of this field towards more comprehensive reasoning of text.In this paper, we introduce a new Reading Comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning (ReClor) extracted from standardized graduate admission examinations.As earlier studies suggest, human-annotated datasets usually contain biases, which are often exploited by models to achieve high accuracy without truly understanding the text.In order to comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of models on ReClor, we propose to identify biased data points and separate them into EASY set while the rest as HARD set.Empirical results show that the state-of-the-art models have an outstanding ability to capture biases contained in the dataset with high accuracy on EASY set.However, they struggle on HARD set with poor performance near that of random guess, indicating more research is needed to essentially enhance the logical reasoning ability of current models.Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing, which requires models to understand a body of text and answer a particular question related to the context.With success of unsupervised representation learning in NLP, language pre-training based models such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) , BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) , XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) have achieved nearly saturated performance on most of the popular MRC datasets (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2017; Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) .It is time to challenge state-of-the-art models with more difficult reading comprehension tasks and move a step forward to more comprehensive analysis and reasoning over text (Dua et al., 2019) .In natural language understanding, logical reasoning is an important ability to examine, analyze and critically evaluate arguments as they occur in ordinary language according to the definition from Law School Admission Council (2019a).It is a significant component of human intelligence and is essential in negotiation, debate and writing etc.However, existing reading comprehension datasets have none or merely a small amount of data requiring logical reasoning, e.g., 0% in MCTest dataset (Richardson et al., 2013 ) and 1.2% in SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) according to Sugawara & Aizawa (2016) .One related task is natural language inference, which requires models to label the logical relationships of sentence pairs.However, this task only considers three types of simple logical relationships and only needs reasoning at sentence-level.To push the development of models in logical reasoning from simple logical relationship classification to multiple complicated logical reasoning and from sentence-level to passage-level, it is necessary to introduce a reading comprehension dataset targeting logical reasoning.A typical example of logical reasoning questions is shown in Table 1 .Similar to the format of multiple-choice reading comprehension datasets (Richardson et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2017) , it contains a context, a question and four options with only one right answer.To answer the question in this example, readers need to identify the logical connections between the lines to pinpoint the conflict, then understand each of the options and select an option that solves the conflict.Human minds need extensive training and practice to get used to complex reasoning, and it will take immense efforts for crowdsourcing workers to design such logical reasoning questions.Inspired by the datasets extracted from standardized examinations (Lai et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018) , we build a dataset by selecting such logical reasoning questions from standardized exams such as GMAT 1 and LSAT 2 .We finally collect 6,139 pieces of logical reasoning questions, which constitute a Reading Comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning (ReClor).Human-annotated datasets usually contain biases (Schwartz et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2017; Bugert et al., 2017; Poliak et al., 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019) , which are often exploited by neural network models as shortcut solutions to achieve high testing accuracy.For data points whose options can be selected correctly without knowing the contexts and questions, we classify them as biased ones.In order to fully assess the logical reasoning ability of the models, we propose to identify the biased data points and group them as EASY set, and put the rest into HARD set.Based on our experiments on these separate sets, we find that even the state-of-the-art models can only perform well on EASY set and struggle on HARD set as shown in Figure 1 .This phenomenon shows that current models can well capture the biases in the dataset but lack the ability to understand the text and reason based on connections between the lines.On the other hand, human beings perform similarly on both the EASY and HARD set.It is thus observed that there is still a long way to go to equip models with true logical reasoning ability.The contributions of our paper are two-fold.First, we introduce ReClor, a new reading comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning.We use option-only-input baselines trained with different random seeds to identify the data points with biases in the testing set, and group them as EASY set, with the rest as HARD set to facilitate comprehensive evaluation.Second, we evaluate several stateof-the-art models on ReClor and find these pre-trained language models can perform well on EASY set but struggle on the HARD set.This indicates although current models are good at exploiting biases in the dataset, they are far from capable of performing real logical reasoning yet.In this paper, we introduce ReClor, a reading comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning, with the aim to push research progress on logical reasoning in NLP forward from sentence-level to passage-level and from simple logical reasoning to multiple complicated one.We propose to identify biased data points and split the testing set into EASY and HARD group for biased and non-biased data separately.We further empirically study the different behaviors of state-of-the-art models on these two testing sets, and find recent powerful transformer-based pre-trained language models have an excellent ability to exploit the biases in the dataset but have difficulty in understanding and reasoning given the non-biased data with low performance close to or slightly better than random guess.These results show there is a long way to equip deep learning models with real logical reasoning abilities.We hope this work would inspire more research in future to adopt similar split technique and evaluation scheme when reporting their model performance.We also show by first fine-tuning on a large-scale dataset RACE then fine-tuning on ReClor, the models could obtain significant improvement, showing the potential of transfer learning to solve reasoning tasks.","answer":"We introduce ReClor, a reading comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning, and find that current state-of-the-art models struggle with real logical reasoning with poor performance near that of random guess."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

The thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system (TrxR/Trx1) plays a major role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Disruption of the TrxR-Trx1 system keeps Trx1 in the oxidized state leading to cell death through activation of the ASK1-Trx1 apoptotic pathway. The potential mechanism and ability of tri- and tetra-oligopeptides derived from the canonical -CxxC- motif of the Trx1-active site to mimic and enhance Trx1 cellular activity was examined. The Trx mimetics peptides (TXM) protected insulinoma INS 832/13 cells from oxidative stress induced by selectively inhibiting TrxR with auranofin (AuF). TXM reversed the AuF-effects preventing apoptosis, and increasing cell-viability. The TXM peptides were effective in inhibiting AuF-induced MAPK, JNK and p38 (MAPK) phosphorylation, in correlation with preventing caspase-3 cleavage and thereby PARP-1 dissociation. The ability to form a disulfide-bridge-like conformation was estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. The TXM peptides restored insulin secretion and displayed Trx1 denitrosylase activity. Their potency was 10-100-fold higher than redox reagents like NAC, AD4, or ascorbic acid. Unable to reverse ERK1/2 phosphorylation, TXM-CB3 (NAc-Cys-Pro-Cys amide) appeared to function in part, through inhibiting ASK1-Trx dissociation. These highly effective anti-apoptotic effects of Trx1 mimetic peptides exhibited in INS 832/13 cells could become valuable in treating adverse oxidative-stress related disorders such as diabetes.","answer":"[[\\"auranofin\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"TrxR\\"], [\\"AuF\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"TrxR\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins.Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan. A key function in this process involves the regulation of the cell cycle and stress responses including free radical scavenging.We report that the deletion of both FKH genes impedes normal lifespan and stress resistance, particularly in stationary phase cells, which are non-responsive to caloric restriction. Conversely, increased expression of the FKHs leads to extended lifespan and improved stress response.This study establishes the FKHs role as evolutionarily conserved regulators of lifespan in yeast and identifies the APC as a novel component of this mechanism under certain conditions, likely through combined regulation of stress response, genomic stability, and cell cycle regulation.The genome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe has four genes that code for proteins containing fork-head domains (FKH), two of which have been characterised. Here we describe the remaining two genes, fhl1 and fkh2, that code for proteins containing fork-head-associated domains (FHA) besides their FKHs.Here we show that the yeast forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1p and Fkh2p, associate with the coding regions of active genes and influence, in opposing ways, transcriptional elongation and termination.Our results suggest that, in addition to their documented promoter function, Fkh1p and Fkh2p coordinate early transcription elongation and pre-mRNA processing. This may reflect a general feature of gene regulation in eukaryotes.Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing.The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Forkhead Box (FOX) proteins, Fkh1 and Fkh2, regulate diverse cellular processes including transcription, long-range DNA interactions during homologous recombination, and replication origin timing and long-range origin clustering.","answer":"DNA replication"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

To test whether a reperfusion must precede the prolonged index ischemia, a series without reperfusion (intraischemic preconditioning: IIP) and a series with gradual onset of ischemia, i.e. ramp ischemia (RI), which is possibly related to the development of hibernation, was compared to conventional IP (CIP).(METHOD) Experiments were performed an 27 blood-perfused rabbit hearts (Langendorff apparatus) that were randomized into one of four series: (1) control (n = 7): 60 min normal flow - 60 min low flow (10%) ischemia - 60 min reperfusion. (2) CIP (n = 7): 4 times 5 min zero flow with 10 min reperfusion each - 60 min low flow (10%) - ischemia 60 min reperfusion. (3) IIP (n = 7): 50 min normal flow - 10 min no flow - 60min low flow (10%) ischemia -4 60min reperfusion. (4) RI (n=6): gradual reduction to 10% flow during 60min - 60min low flow (10%) ischemia - 60min reperfusion. At the end of each protocol, the infarcted area was assessed.(RESULTS) The infarct area in control hearts was 6.7+/-1.4% (means+/-SEM) of LV total area, in CIP hearts 2.6+/-0.8%, in IIP hearts 3.1+/-0.5%, and in RI hearts 3.0+/-0.3% (all p<0.05 vs. control). The differences between the three protection protocols were statistically not significant, and no protective protocol reduced post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction.Question:Does ischemic preconditioning require reperfusion before index ischemia?Answer:","answer":"NO"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In this paper, we report comprehensive genomic analyses of C. bantiana isolated from the brain abscess of an immunocompetent man, the first reported case in Malaysia and Southeast Asia. The identity of the fungus was determined using combined morphological analysis and multilocus phylogeny. The draft genome sequence of a neurotrophic fungus, C. bantiana UM 956 was generated using Illumina sequencing technology to dissect its genetic fundamental and basic biology. The assembled 37.1 Mb genome encodes 12,155 putative coding genes, of which, 1.01% are predicted transposable elements. Its genomic features support its saprophytic lifestyle, renowned for its versatility in decomposing hemicellulose and pectin components. The C. bantiana UM 956 was also found to carry some important putative genes that engaged in pathogenicity, iron uptake and homeostasis as well as adaptation to various stresses to enable the organism to survive in hostile microenvironment.

In vitro studies have shown that naproxen anion, because of its affinity for protein, may displace from their binding sites other drugs which are also albumin-bound . Theoretically, the naproxen anion itself could likewise be displaced. Short-term controlled studies failed to show that taking the drug significantly affects prothrombin times when administered to individuals on coumarin-type anticoagulants. Caution is advised nonetheless, since interactions have been seen with other nonsteroidal agents of this class. Similarly, patients receiving the drug and a hydantoin, sulfonamide or sulfonylurea should be observed for signs of toxicity to these drugs. Concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not recommended because naproxen is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels. The natriuretic effect of furosemide has been reported to be inhibited by some drugs of this class. Inhibition of renal lithium clearance leading to increases in plasma lithium concentrations has also been reported. Naproxen and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other beta-blockers. Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly. Caution should be used if naproxen is administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time. This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined. The administration of naproxen may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-dinitrobenzene used in this assay. Although 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurements (Porter-Silber test) do not appear to be artifactually altered, it is suggested that therapy with naproxen be temporarily discontinued 72 hours before adrenal function tests are performed if the Porter-Silber test is to be used. Naproxen may interfere with some urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA).","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [\\"aspirin\\"], \\"Drug\\": [\\"methotrexate\\", \\"furosemide\\", \\"naproxen\\", \\"lithium\\", \\"propranolol\\", \\"Naproxen\\", \\"Probenecid\\", \\"naproxen sodium\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"coumarin-type anticoagulants\\", \\"sulfonylurea\\", \\"sulfonamide\\", \\"ACE inhibitors\\", \\"NSAIDs\\", \\"hydantoin\\", \\"beta-blockers\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Like ibogaine (40 mg/kg), 18-MC (40 mg/kg) decreases the intravenous self-administration of morphine and cocaine and the oral self-administration of ethanol and nicotine in rats; unlike ibogaine, 18-MC does not affect responding for a nondrug reinforcer (water). Both ibogaine and 18-MC ameliorate opioid withdrawal signs. Both ibogaine and 18-MC decrease extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, but only ibogaine increases extracellular levels of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens. Both ibogaine and 18-MC block morphine-induced and nicotine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens; only ibogaine enhances cocaine-induced increases in accumbal dopamine. Both ibogaine and 18-MC enhance the locomotor and/or stereotypic effects of stimulants. Ibogaine attenuates, but 18-MC potentiates, the acute locomotor effects of morphine; both compounds attenuate morphine-induced locomotion in morphine-experienced rats. Ibogaine produces whole body tremors and, at high doses (> or = 100 mg/kg), cerebellar damage; 18-MC does not produce these effects. Ibogaine, but not 18-MC, decreases heart rate at high doses. While 18-MC and ibogaine have similar affinities for kappa opioid and possibly nicotinic receptors, 18-MC has much lower affinities than ibogaine for NMDA and sigma-2 receptors, sodium channels, and the 5-HT transporter. Both 18-MC and ibogaine are sequestered in fat and, like ibogaine, 18-MC probably has an active metabolite. The data suggest that 18-MC has a narrower spectrum of actions and will have a substantially greater therapeutic index than ibogaine.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"cocaine\\", \\"morphine\\", \\"ethanol\\", \\"nicotine\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"opioid\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": [\\"ibogaine\\", \\"18-MC\\", \\"Ibogaine\\", \\"18-Methoxycoronaridine\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

G. Reed-Berendt, L. C. Morrill, D. L. Browne, ChemSusChem2020, 13, 131.</p><p>Mechanochemistry is characterised by the input of mechanical energy into chemical bonds to initiate reactivity of those bonds.1 Chemical reactions brought about by ball‐milling constitute an area of mechanochemistry. That a reaction takes place under ball‐milling conditions does, however, not necessarily mean that the process is mechanically driven. Indeed, ball‐milling reactions also typically feature solvent‐free or solvent‐minimised, high‐concentration and occasionally high‐instantaneous/bulk‐temperature conditions. Many of these factors are inextricably linked and may never be fully delineated. Nonetheless, the fields of mechanochemistry and ball‐milling, in combination with reactive extrusion, are capable of delivering a more sustainable approach to some aspects of chemical synthesis and chemical manufacturing.2 Given the complex inter‐related nature of parameters, one approach to gain a better insight into these techniques is through attrition, that is, gaining many experimental data points and building a picture of understanding as a whole. In recent years the community in this area has been building towards this vision.3 In several instances there have emerged trends and conceptual frameworks, and in others there is simply a translation to a solvent‐minimised process. However, perhaps the most exciting aspect of this approach is the increased opportunity for serendipitous discoveries by exploring this unchartered chemical reactor environment.4 As part of this process the field has recently been moving towards assessing the possibility of running complex catalytic reactions and enantioselective processes under milling conditions.5</p><p>The area of organocatalysis is one such area where the proposed reaction pathways require several discrete steps and enantioselectivity rests on the organisation of complex transition states. Of the many areas of organocatalysis (some of which are shown in Figure 1 A), only secondary amine systems have been well studied under milling conditions, with pioneering contributions from Bolm and co‐workers.6 It has been established that several reaction manifolds accessible by secondary amine organocatalysis in solution can also operate under milling conditions.7 Given the wealth of transformations and activation modes we were intrigued by the prospect of conducting nucleophilic heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under milling conditions. NHC organocatalysis has been rapidly established as a key area for catalyst‐mediated synthesis, with many activation modes established for a wide range of substrates (Figure 1 B).8 The first established activation mode of acyl anions stemmed from the pioneering work of Breslow on thiamine‐catalysed reactions and has led to numerous examples across a range of carbonyl functional groups.9 These include benzoin, Stetter and hydroacylation reactions, with demonstration of homo‐, cross‐, inter‐ and intramolecular examples. Herein we report the first results of combining this NHC activation mode with ball‐milling (Figure 1 C).10</p><p>(a) Some areas of organocatalysis; (b) example activation modes of NHC catalysis; (c) this work: NHC acyl anion organocatalysis under ball‐milling conditions.</p><p>Our initial investigations commenced with the intermolecular homo‐benzoin reaction of 4‐chlorobenzaldehyde under planetary milling conditions. A range of ten NHC precatalysts based on thiazolium, imidazolium and triazolium heterocycles were screened, along with five bases [K3PO4, K2CO3, Cs2CO3, 1,8‐diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec‐7‐ene (DBU) and Et3N] and three grinding auxiliaries.11 Pleasingly, it was found that the pentafluorophenyl bearing triazolium tetrafluoroborate NHC precatalyst 8 was the most effective at 10 mol % loading.</p><p>Combining the 4‐chlorobenzaldehyde with the precatalyst, Cs2CO3, sand (as a grinding auxiliary) and grinding in a planetary mill at 300 rpm for 15 min furnished the homo‐benzoin product 11 in 72 % isolated yield (Scheme 1, conditions A). However, extending these conditions to a small range of substrates did not return positive outcomes in every case. The literature concerning NHC‐catalysed benzoin reactions demonstrates that several of the reaction steps can be equilibrium processes, in which the reversibility of individual steps is highly dependent on the catalyst and substrate combinations.12 We hypothesised that the presence of liquids/solvents may help to stabilise or drive reactions forward, and, in the solid state, crystal lattice enthalpies may also play a critical role in determining the position of equilibrium for reactions featuring solid products and/or starting materials (notably, 4‐chlorobenzaldehyde is a solid, and other benzaldehyde derivatives are liquids). With this in mind, we screened the addition of 100 μL of several LAG (Liquid‐Assisted Grinding) materials, including EtOAc, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), isopropanol (IPA), EtOH, dimethylformamide (DMF), MeCN, dimethylacetamide (DMA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). It was found that addition of IPA was optimal and permitted 76 % isolated yield of 14 (in the case of benzaldehyde) and 63 % yield of 12 (in the case of 4‐tolaldehyde). With these conditions in hand, a total of six aldehydes were then assessed under \\"no LAG\\" and \\"IPA LAG\\" (100 μL) conditions (Scheme 1, inter‐benzoin). It appears that milling with LAG gives the most robust conditions, that is, those that permit the greatest chances of success under this milling protocol. As common in many solvent‐based approaches, it too was found that the reaction is highly dependent on the purity of the aldehyde introduced into the reaction; trace carboxylic acid appears to have a disproportionately negative effect on the outcome of the reaction. Pleasingly, the \\"no LAG\\" conditions could also be directly applied to the intra‐cross‐benzoin reaction of tethered ketone–aldehyde substrates to yield α‐hydroxychromanone products in good yields (Scheme 1, intra‐benzoin). With confirmation in hand of carbene generation and its engagement in catalysis through acyl anion activation, our attention turned to demonstrating this reactivity also in the case of the Stetter reaction. Application of previously optimised conditions A to a model inter‐Stetter reaction featuring 4‐chlorobenzaldehyde and chalcone did not return favourable yields of the desired product. However, conditions A (5 mol % precatalyst) were applicable to a range of intramolecular Stetter reactions to furnish the corresponding chromanones and 3‐oxo‐2,3‐dihydrobenzofurans in good‐to‐excellent yields (Scheme 2, intra‐Stetter 6,6 and intra‐Stetter 6,5). Indeed, further reaction screening was required to deliver the intermolecular Stetter reaction under milling conditions. Again, screening a range of precatalysts, bases, grinding auxiliaries, LAGs and milling speeds delivered optimal results. We were pleased to find that the archetypal thiazolium catalysts were highly effective under these conditions with K3PO4 serving as base (and likely the grinding auxiliary). Thiazolium pre‐NHC 1 was optimal and afforded conditions B (Scheme 2), requiring 3 h milling at 700 rpm. With these conditions in hand, a sample of nine intermolecular Stetter reactions was explored. A combination of three aldehydes with three different chalcone derivatives afforded moderate‐to‐good yields in all nine cases. Attention was then turned to exploring if enantioselectivity could be imparted to this reaction manifold under milling conditions. Conditions A were chosen to be explored, and the pentafluorophenyl bearing triazolium pre‐NHC 8 was switched for the privileged aminoindane‐based triazolium pre‐NHC 33, reported by Kerr and Rovis.13 Three of the reaction modes were explored, including intra‐benzoin, inter‐benzoin and both the 6,6‐ and 6,5‐intra‐Stetter reactions. All experiments were run with 10 mol % catalyst loading, and preliminary results show that it is indeed possible to transmit enantioselectivity under these conditions (Scheme 3). For the intra‐benzoin reaction, it was found that addition of IPA as LAG permitted the reaction to return increased yield and slightly increased enantiomeric excess (24 % yield, 72 % ee without LAG vs. 52 % yield and 82 % ee with LAG). The 6,6‐intra‐molecular Stetter reaction returned the highest ee of 92 % (with an isolated yield of 96 %).</p><p>NHC‐catalysed benzoin reaction under milling conditions.</p><p>NHC‐catalysed Stetter reaction under milling conditions.</p><p>Overview of asymmetric NHC‐mediated acyl anion chemistry under milling conditions.</p><p>Despite these results, some of the ee values are lower than those reported under solution conditions, perhaps pointing towards poorer temperature control of the milled process.5k However, these are complex reactions, and clearly the balance of all reaction parameters requires significant fine‐tuning to deliver optimal conditions for maximum enantioselectivity, and this would have to be compared directly with a fully optimized solution protocol. Thus, the conclusion proposed here is that imparting enantioselectivity of NHC‐catalysed reactions under ball‐milling is possible and can deliver excellent results, although how these compare directly against solution‐phase conditions is not yet clear. Nonetheless, it is particularly notable that carbenes can be used catalytically in complex reaction pathways and also impart stereocontrol in the absence of solvent and under milling conditions.</p><p>In summary, ball‐milling has been used as a technique to conduct NHC catalysis for the first time. A range of catalysts, bases and grinding auxiliaries have been screened to reach general conditions for the acyl anion activation mode, which has been demonstrated in four application areas: intermolecular‐benzoin, intramolecular‐benzoin, intermolecular‐Stetter and intramolecular‐Stetter. Notably, these reactions are run without precaution to obscure air and moisture from the reaction vessel, and in general this works well, although, in some instances, increased catalyst loadings compared to solvent‐based techniques are used. Notably, among all catalysts screened, perhaps the simplest and longest‐known thiazolium pre‐NHC 1 is the most optimal catalyst for the intermolecular Stetter reaction under ball‐milling conditions. Finally, it has been demonstrated that several of the reaction modes can also be rendered asymmetric under milling conditions.</p>Experimental Section<p>Information about the data that underpins the results presented in this article, including how to access them, can be found in the Cardiff University data catalogue at https://doi.org/10.17035/d.2019.0087455694.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Abstract The parity equation residual generation method is a model-based fault detection and isolation scheme that has been applied with some success to the problem of monitoring the health of engineering systems. However, this scheme fails when applied to significantly nonlinear systems. This paper presents the application of a nonlinear parity equation residual generation scheme that uses forward and inverse dynamic models of nonlinear systems, to the problem of diagnosing sensor and actuator faults in an internal combustion engine, during execution of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Inspection and Maintenance 240 driving cycle. The Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average Model with eXogenous inputs technique is used to identify the engine models required for residual generation. The proposed diagnostic scheme is validated experimentally and is shown to be sensitive to a number of input and sensor faults while remaining robust to the unmeasured load torque disturbance. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Abstract The design of dynamic parity (consistency) relations, for the detection and isolation of faults, is described. Both additive and multiplicative (parametric) faults are considered. Various isolation schemes are discussed and decoupling from disturbances and certain model errors is included. Links to diagnostic observers and parameter estimation are pointed out. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  During the past two decades, the automotive industry has been required to develop on-board health monitoring capabilities to meet legislated diagnostic requirements for engine management systems. In this paper, real-time diagnostics are presented which monitor the performance of an electronic throttle control system to detect and identify a suite of anomalies. The ETC system shall be modeled and a parity diagnostic strategy applied to detect the presence of faults. The specific nature of the fault is isolated using a parametric estimation methodology. Representative numerical results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the operational performance of the ETC system and health monitoring algorithms. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Abstract Modern Diesel engines with direct fuel injection and turbo charging have shown a significant progress in fuel consumption, emissions and driveability. Together with exhaust gas recirculation and variable geometry turbochargers they became complicated and complex processes. Therefore, fault detection and diagnosis is not easily done and need to be improved. This contribution shows a systematic development of fault detection and diagnosis methods for two system components of Diesel engines, the intake system and the injection system together with the combustion process. By applying semiphysical dynamic process models, identification with special neural networks, signal models and parity equations residuals are generated. Detectable deflections of these residuals lead to symptoms which are the basis for the detection of several faults. Experiments with a 2.0 l Diesel engine on a dynamic test bench as well as in the vehicle have demonstrated the detection and diagnosis of several implemented faults in real time with reasonable calculation effort.Literature Review:","answer":"This method checks the consistency of the mathematical equations of the system model with the measured data. The parity relations are subjected to a linear dynamic transformation, with the transformed residuals used for detecting and isolating faults. Parity relations are rearranged forms of the input-output or state-space equations of the system. The essential characteristic of this approach is to check for consistency of the inputs and outputs. Under normal operating conditions, the magnitudes of residuals or the values of parity relations are small BIB003 . To improve residual-based fault isolation, directional, diagonal, and structured residual design schemes are proposed. In the directional residual scheme, the response to each single fault is confined to a straight line in the residual space. If the response directions are independent, directional residuals support fault isolation. In the diagonal scheme, each element of the residual vector responds to only one fault. Diagonal residuals are ideal for the isolation of multiple faults, but the method can only handle r faults, where r equals the number of outputs. Structured residuals are designed to respond to different subsets of faults, and they are insensitive to process variations that are not in these subsets. For a detailed discussion on the application of the parity relation approach to identify and diagnose the presence of faults, the reader is referred to reference BIB003 . The application of the directional residual design has been demonstrated on a linear discrete-time model of an automotive engine BIB001 . In the context of diagnosing faults in an automotive engine, Krishnaswami et al. BIB002 employed a non-linear auto-regressive moving average modelling with exogenous inputs (NARMAX) technique for system identification in order to implement a non-linear parity equation residual generation (NPERG) scheme. The non-linear parity generation method BIB004 and parameter estimation methods (based on an auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model) were used to detect and isolate process coefficient faults in electronic throttle control systems. Monte and Pisu  presented a fault-detection method for the idle speed control of an IC engine considering throttle faults and manifold pressure sensor fault, where the proposed approach is based on the residual generators using the parity equation and an active threshold calculation. It is noted that parity equations require less computational effort, but do not provide as much insight into the process as parameter estimation schemes. To summarize this section, fault detection using model-based signal analysis and residual processing is performed as follows. The residuals are generated from the comparison between the observed features of the system and the nominal behaviour of the process. Detectable deviations of the residuals result in symptoms, which are then processed in the faultdiagnosis module by means of fault-symptomcausalities BIB005 ."},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

However, our knowledge on the initial cognitive deficits in diabetic individuals and the factors that might promote such deficits is still limited. This study aimed to identify the cognitive domains initially impaired by diabetes and the factors that play a role in this first stage. Within the population-based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen, 2305 cognitively intact participants aged ≥60 y were identified. Attention / working memory, perceptual speed, category fluency, letter fluency, semantic memory, and episodic memory were assessed. Diabetes (controlled and uncontrolled) and prediabetes were ascertained by clinicians, who also collected information on vascular disorders (hypertension, heart diseases, and stroke) and vascular risk factors (VRFs, including smoking and overweight / obesity). Data were analyzed with linear regression models. Overall, 196 participants (8.5%) had diabetes, of which 144 (73.5%) had elevated glycaemia (uncontrolled diabetes); 571 (24.8%) persons had prediabetes. In addition, diabetes, mainly uncontrolled, was related to lower performance in perceptual speed (β - 1.10 [95% CI - 1.98, - 0.23]), category fluency (β - 1.27 [95% CI - 2.52, - 0.03]), and digit span forward (β - 0.35 [95% CI - 0.54, - 0.17]). Critically, these associations were present only among APOEɛ4 non-carriers. The associations of diabetes with perceptual speed and category fluency were present only among participants with VRFs or vascular disorders. Diabetes, especially uncontrolled diabetes, is associated with poorer performance in perceptual speed, category fluency, and attention / primary memory. VRFs, vascular disorders, and APOE status play a role in these associations.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"Type 2 Diabetes\\", \\"working memory\\", \\"Diabetes\\", \\"stroke\\", \\"prediabetes\\", \\"semantic memory\\", \\"diabetes\\", \\"episodic memory\\", \\"cognitive domains\\", \\"vascular disorders\\", \\"Cognitive Deficits\\", \\"obesity\\", \\"attention\\", \\"perceptual\\", \\"Attention\\", \\"type 2 diabetes\\", \\"heart diseases\\", \\"deficits\\", \\"primary memory\\", \\"hypertension\\", \\"cognitive deficits\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"glycaemia\\", \\"APOEu025b4\\", \\"APOE\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"diabetic\\", \\"overweight\\", \\"dementia risk\\", \\"speed\\", \\"vascular risk factors\\", \\"VRFs\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"knowledge\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"participants\\", \\"individuals\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"clinicians\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"analyzed\\", \\"population-based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen\\", \\"Population-Based Study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

However , the assumptions of r and om utility theory , which underpin the statistical models used to provide these estimates , have received insufficient attention . In particular , the assumptions made about the decisions between living states and the death state are not satisfied , at least for some people . Estimated values are likely to be incorrectly anchored with respect to death ( zero ) in such circumstances . Methods Data from the Investigating Choice Experiments for the preferences of older people CAPability instrument ( ICECAP ) valuation exercise were analysed . The values ( previously anchored to the worst possible state ) were rescaled using an ordinal model proposed previously to estimate QALY-like values . Bootstrapping was conducted to vary artificially the proportion of people who conformed to the conventional r and om utility model underpinning the analyses . Results Only 26 % of respondents conformed unequivocally to the assumptions of conventional r and om utility theory . At least 14 % of respondents unequivocally violated the assumptions . Varying the relative proportions of conforming respondents in sensitivity analyses led to large changes in the estimated QALY values , particularly for lower-valued states . As a result these values could be either positive ( considered to be better than death ) or negative ( considered to be worse than death ) . Conclusion Use of a statistical model such as conditional ( multinomial ) regression to anchor quality of life values from ordinal data to death is inappropriate in the presence of respondents who do not conform to the assumptions of conventional r and om utility theory . This is clearest when estimating values for that group of respondents observed in valuation sample s who refuse to consider any living state to be worse than death : in such circumstances the model can not be estimated . Only a valuation task requiring respondents to make choices in which both length and quality of life vary can produce estimates that properly reflect the preferences of all respondentsTitle 2:Old or frail: what tells us more?Abstract 2:BACKGROUND Selecting elderly persons who need geriatric interventions  and making accurate treatment decisions are recurring challenges in geriatrics . Chronological age , although often used , does not seem to be the best selection criterion . Instead , the concept of frailty , which indicates several concurrent losses in re sources , can be used . METHODS The predictive values of chronological age and frailty were investigated in a large community sample of persons aged 65 years and older , r and omly drawn from the register of six municipalities in the northern regions of the Netherl and s ( 45 % of the original addressees ) . The participants ' generative capacity to sustain well-being ( i.e. , self-management abilities ) was used as the main outcome measure . RESULTS When using chronological age instead of frailty , both too many and too few persons were selected . Furthermore , frailty related more strongly ( with beta values ranging from -.25 to -.39 ) to a decline in the participants ' self-management abilities than did chronological age ( with beta values ranging from -.06 to -.14 ) . Chronological age added very little to the explained variances of all outcomes once frailty was included . CONCLUSIONS Using frailty as the criterion to select older persons at risk for interventions may be better than selecting persons based only on their chronological ageTitle 3:Outcomes of elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures according to positive criteria for surgical treatment.Abstract 3:Proximal femoral fractures in elderly patients are a serious problem in the aging society . Recently , surgical indications have changed due to advancements in medical technology . The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcome of elderly patients with displaced proximal hip fractures according to our positive criteria for surgical treatment . Exclusion criteria included ( 1 ) terminal-stage malignancy ; ( 2 ) a combination of an inability to walk , a severe mental disorder , and caregiver refusal of surgery ; and ( 3 ) nonapproval of the anesthesiologist for surgery .  The study group comprised 666 elderly patients . They were categorized into surgically and nonsurgically treated groups , and their treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed . The majority of patients were treated surgically ( 97.0 % vs 3.0 % ) . One-year survival rate was higher among surgically treated patients ( 82.2%-91.8 % ) than non-surgically treated patients ( 55 % ) . The major cause of death in nonsurgically treated patients was deterioration of comorbidities ( 66.7 % ) , whereas this was the cause of death in 18.9 % of surgically treated patients . One-year survival rates were worse in both groups with a lower American Society of Anesthesiologists grade . The 1-year survival rate of our patients suggests that our surgical criteria offer a reasonable outcome in surgically and nonsurgically treated patients . American Society of Anesthesiologists grade and preexisting comorbidities were strongly correlated with patient outcomeTitle 4:The treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures of the hip: a prospective trial of 150 cases.Abstract 4:We report a prospect i ve clinical trial of 150 cases for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fracture of the neck of the femur . Three methods were tested in our series -- skeletal traction with a tibial pin , medial displacement osteotomy and valgus osteotomy -- with 50 patients in each group . Our results showed no significant difference between those treated with the Dimon and Hughston osteotomy and those treated by the Sarmiento osteotomy . Conservative treatment of skeletal traction for unstable fracture was found to be well tolerated by the Chinese patient . A low mortality and morbidity rate was found in this series with an overall infection rate of 4 per centTitle 5:Methodological index for non‐randomized studies (MINORS): development and validation of a new instrumentAbstract 5:Background : Because of specific method ological difficulties in conducting r and omized trials , surgical research remains dependent predominantly on observational or non‐r and omized studies . Few vali date d instruments are available to determine the method ological quality of such studies either from the reader 's perspective or for the purpose of meta‐ analysis . The aim of the present study was to develop and vali date such an instrumentTitle 6:Operative or conservative treatment for trochanteric fractures of the femur. A randomised epidemiological trial in elderly patients.Abstract 6:All elderly patients with extracapsular hip fractures seen in hospitals in Newcastle upon Tyne over a 12-month period were studied and followed up for six months . At one of the hospitals , patients were r and omised to treatment by AO dynamic hip-screw or by traction .  Complications specific to the two treatments were low , and general complications , six-month mortality and prevalence of pain , leg swelling and unhealed sores , showed no difference between the two modes of treatment . Operative treatment gave better anatomical results and a shorter hospital stay , but significantly more of the patients treated by traction showed loss of independence six months after injuryTitle 7:Mortality among third age patients with hip fracture and high cardiac risk.Abstract 7:INTRODUCTION Mortality after hip fracture remains high in spite of the progress of medicine . Due to the trend toward longer life , the problem of hip fracture is getting more significant . The aim of this study is to determine the effects of surgical treatment in patients with high risk of hip fracture on mortality reduction . METHODS In the retrospective- prospect i ve study , 66 patients aged 65 - 92 with a hip fracture and a high cardiac risk have been analyzed . The risk estimation was based on the Lee index . The patients with three or more risk factors were considered high-risk . The first group consisted of surgically treated patients with a hip fracture and at high cardiac risk , and in the second group were conservatively treated patients with a hip fracture and high cardiac risk . RESULTS In the group of conservatively treated patients , 75 % were women and in operatively treated group 67.6 % . Patient in both group are similar in relation to the participation of risk factor . A difference has been noticed in terms of renal insufficiency ( RI ) . There was 18.8 % conservatively treated patient with RI and 2.9 % in operatively treated group . CONCLUSION Patients with hip fracture and at high cardiac risk have lower mortality when treated surgicallyTitle 8:One-year outcome for elderly patients with displaced intracapsular fractures of the femoral neck managed non-operatively.Abstract 8:The outcome of patients with a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture treated non-operatively  was assessed at 1 year and compared with patients  managed operatively over the same time period . Data were collected prospect ively for 102 consecutive patients . 80 patients underwent hemiarthroplasty and 22 were managed non-operatively .  Patients were managed non-operatively if they were felt to have an unacceptably high risk of death within the perioperative period despite medical optimisation . Non-operative management entailed active early mobilisation without bed rest or traction . Patients managed non-operatively had a greater 30-day mortality compared with operatively managed patients . Deaths were due to pre-existing medical conditions or events , which had occurred at the time of hip fracture . No patient in the non-operative treatment group developed pneumonia , pressure sores or thrombo-embolic events . Patients treated non-operatively , who survived 30 days after fracture , had a mortality rate over the following year comparable with those who had undergone surgery . At 1 year , all non-operatively managed patients were able to transfer without pain and 6 of the 11 surviving patients were able to mobilise with walking aids . At 1 year , the majority of surviving non-operatively managed patients were living in their own homes . Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice for the majority of elderly patients with a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture . However , in patients with life-threatening medical co-morbidity , non-operative treatment with early mobilisation can yield acceptable results","answer":"A significantly higher 30-day and 1-year mortality was revealed in nonoperatively treated hip fracture patients .No data were found examining (HR)QOL and costs ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

line spectrum indicates that it has been excited by shocks ( cohen et al@xmath2 1985 ; snchez contreras et al@xmath2 1999 ) .the molecular envelope of oh231.8 is very cold ( t@xmath310k ) and massive ( @xmath1 1@xmath4 ) .this envelope is expanding at low velocity ( @xmath11015kms@xmath5 ) near the equator , while at higher latitudes a strong axial expansion appears .in contrast to the atomic material , the molecular gas is highly restricted to the symmetry axis of the nebula ( see alcolea et al@xmath2 in this volume ) .the pronounced axial symmetry and the large velocities reached by the gas in oh231.8 are usually attributed to the impact of a recent , highly collimated wind on the old agb envelope .a large variety of molecules has been detected in oh231.8 ( e@xmath2g@xmath2 morris et al@xmath2 1987 ) , which is classified as an o - rich source due to its h@xmath6o , oh and sio maser emission . maps of certain molecules have suggested that an active chemistry , probably induced by shocks , takes place in oh231.8 ( snchez contreras et al@xmath2 1997 ; jackson & nguyen - q - rieu 1988 ) .we have obtained high - resolution maps of the hco@xmath0(@xmath7=10 ) , so(@xmath7=2@xmath61@xmath8 ) , h@xmath9cn(@xmath7=10 ) , sio(@xmath10=1 , @xmath7=21 ) , and ns ( @xmath11 , @xmath7=5/23/2 , parity-@xmath12 ) lines in oh231.8 .observations were performed using the iram interferometer ( plateau de bure , france ) during the winters of 96 - 97 and 97 - 98 , and in february 99 .the highest spatial and spectral resolution obtained are @xmath13  and @xmath10.3kms@xmath5 , respectively . the spatial origin of our maps coincides with the position of the maser , that is located at r.a.= 07@xmath1342@xmath141693 , dec.=@xmath151442502 ( j2000 ) .in fig@xmath21 we present the interferometric maps of the hco@xmath0(10 ) line for different velocity channels .the emission is distributed in a narrow region along the symmetry axis of the nebula .such a region has a total size of about ( 1@xmath167)10@xmath17 cm , and seems to be a hollow cylinder near the equator .the present high - resolution maps show that the hco@xmath0 emission is notably clumpy .we confirm the axial velocity gradient ( fig@xmath22 , top - left box ) found in previous low - resolution observations .this gradient is almost constant along the axis and similar to that found for @xmath18co and other molecules ( see below and snchez contreras et al@xmath2 1997 ) .the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram along the nebula equator ( fig@xmath22 , top - right box ) roughly corresponds to an expanding , hollow cylinder or ring .it is remarkable that the most intense hco@xmath0 emission arises from regions moving at high velocities .in fact , there is a local minimum in the emission of the low - velocity expanding component ( between 1055kms@xmath5 ) near the center , where the rest of the observed molecules reach the maximum intensity ( see so data in fig@xmath22 and co in alcolea et al@xmath2 this volume ) .the observed spatial and spectral distributions of hco@xmath0 suggest that this molecule is efficiently formed in the accelerated gas by shock - induced reactions .      the so emission occupies a narrow region ( @xmath110@xmath17 cm ) extending @xmath13.510@xmath17 cm along the symmetry axis of the nebula .the total line width is @xmath1100kms@xmath5 , indicating that so is present in the accelerated lobes of oh231.8 . in fig@xmath22 ( bottom - left box )we can see that so follows the general velocity gradient along the symmetry axis of the nebula .we have also found so emission in an expanding disk surrounding the central star .the presence of such a disk is indicated by the inversion of the slope of the velocity gradient at the nebula center ( fig@xmath22 , bottom - left box ) .the characteristic radius and the expansion velocity of the equatorial disk are @xmath1210@xmath19 cm and @xmath17kms@xmath5 , respectively .these values lead to a kinematical age for the disk of @xmath11000yr , very similar to that found for the bipolar molecular flow .no sign of rotation has been found in the disk ( fig@xmath22 ) .differences between the so abundaces in the disk and the outflow are negligible .      in fig@xmath23we show the sio ( @xmath10=1 , @xmath7=21 ) maser spectra in six different epochs .three main spectral components can be distinguished at ( lsr ) velocities @xmath126 , @xmath133 ( the systemic velocity ) , and @xmath140kms@xmath5 .each of these features is formed of ( at least ) 3 components , indicating the complex and , probably , clumpy distribution of the gas in the vicinity of the central star .we estimate from our mapping that the size of the maser emitting region is @xmath20310@xmath21 cm .the fact that the three main spectral features are also found in the so line ( fig@xmath22 ) suggests that the maser emission arises from the innermost regions of the expanding disk seen in the so maps .our data would indicate a negligible velocity gradient between the inner and outer parts of such a disk .the relative intensity between the different spectral components as well as the total flux of the sio line is found to strongly vary with time ( fig@xmath23 ) . we have found a relative minimum of the sio flux @xmath160 days before the n - ir minimum ( kastner et al@xmath2 1992 ) .assuming that maser pumping is radiative , this phase lag would correspond to a distance of @xmath110@xmath17 cm between the maser ( very close to the star ) and the nebular dust reflecting the n - ir starlight .this value is in agreement with the measured distance from the center to the region with maximum n - ir emission .we report the first detection of nitrogen sulfide ( @xmath11 , @xmath7=5/23/2 , parity-@xmath12 ) in circumstellar envelopes . the ns emission is found in a compact central region and , tentatively , in the outflow .the total flux of the line ( integrated over all the hyperfine components ) is relatively high , @xmath1 15jykms@xmath5 .we have found the h@xmath9cn(@xmath7=10 ) emission to be distributed along the molecular outflow sharing the general velocity gradient . from the h@xmath18cn / h@xmath9cn ( @xmath7=10 ) intensity ratio ( h@xmath18cn data from snchez contreras et al@xmath2 1997 ) we deduce an isotopic @xmath18c/@xmath9c ratio of @xmath1510 .the large variety and abundance of n- and s - bearing molecules in oh231.8 is a clear sign of an active chemistry probably induced by shocks .shocks would iniciate ( endothermic ) reactions that trigger the n and s chemistry ( lada , oppenheimer & hartquist 1978 ) , and could also extract additional s from the surface of dust grains ( jackson & nguyen -

It was recognized as a global health hazard. METHODS: 234 inpatients with COVID-19 were included. Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated. RESULTS: Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P<0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19. While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.","answer":"[\\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al. at the 5 ' end of the gene.","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"BMD\\", \\"Becker muscular dystrophy\\", \\"DMD\\", \\"Duchenne muscular dystrophy\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Vannier et al., 1993), it was found that histamine as well as IL-1 are implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammatory reaction, after micorganism immune cell activation.IL-1 in combination with histamine can cause a strong increase of IL-1 levels and, consequently, a higher degree of inflammation.However, it has been reported that histamine alone has no effect on IL-1 production.Furthermore, histamine enhances IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression and protein synthesis via H2 receptors in peripheral monocytes.Therefore, since MCs are large producers of histamine in inflammatory reactions, this vasoactive amine, by increasing the production of IL-1, can amplify the inflammatory process in the lung infected with SARS-CoV-2.Here, we have proposed for the first time an emerging role for histamine released by MCs which in combination with IL-1 can cause an increase in lung inflammation induced by the viral infection SARS-CoV-2.","answer":"{\\"verdict\\": \\"SUPPORT\\", \\"evidence\\": [\\"In this pathologic environment, the activation of mast cells (MCs) causes the release of histamine, proteases, cytokines, chemokines and arachidonic acid compounds, such as prostaglandin D2 and leukotrienes, all of which are involved in the inflammatory network.\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

State-of-the-art embedding models propose different trade-offs between modeling expressiveness, and time and space complexity. We reconcile both expressiveness and complexity through the use of complex-valued embeddings and explore the link between such complex-valued embeddings and unitary diagonalization. We corroborate our approach theoretically and show that all real square matrices---thus all possible relation adjacency matrices---are the real part of some unitarily diagonalizable matrix. This results opens the door to a lot of other applications of square matrices factorization. Our approach based on complex embeddings is arguably simple, as it only involves a Hermitian dot product, the complex counterpart of the standard dot product between real vectors, whereas other methods resort to more and more complicated composition functions to increase their expressiveness. The proposed complex embeddings are scalable to large data sets as it remains linear in both space and time, while consistently outperforming alternative approaches on standard link prediction benchmarks.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: Over the last few years, RDF has been used as a knowledge representation model in a wide variety of domains. Some domains are full of uncertainty. Thus, it is desired to process and manage probabilistic RDF data. The core operation of queries on an RDF probabilistic database is computing the probability of the result to a query. In this paper, we describe a general framework for supporting SPARQL queries on probabilistic RDF databases. In particular, we consider transitive inference capability for RDF instance data. We show that the find operation for an atomic query with the transitive property can be formalized as the problem of computing path expressions on the transitive relation graph and we also propose an approximate algorithm for computing path expressions efficiently. At last, we implement and experimentally evaluate our approach.[3]: DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against datasets derived from Wikipedia and to link other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We describe the extraction of the DBpedia datasets, and how the resulting information is published on the Web for human-andmachine-consumption. We describe some emerging applications from the DBpedia community and show how website authors can facilitate DBpedia content within their sites. Finally, we present the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other open datasets on the Web and outline how DBpedia could serve as a nucleus for an emerging Web of open data.[4]: Freebase is a practical, scalable tuple database used to structure general human knowledge. The data in Freebase is collaboratively created, structured, and maintained. Freebase currently contains more than 125,000,000 tuples, more than 4000 types, and more than 7000 properties. Public read write access to Freebase is allowed through an HTTP-based graph-query API using the Metaweb Query Language (MQL) as a data query and manipulation language. MQL provides an easy-to-use object-oriented interface to the tuple data in Freebase and is designed to facilitate the creation of collaborative, Web-based data-oriented applications.[5]: An increasing amount of data is becoming available in the form of large triple stores, with the Semantic Web's linked open data cloud (LOD) as one of the most prominent examples. Data quality and completeness are key issues in many community-generated data stores, like LOD, which motivates probabilistic and statistical approaches to data representation, reasoning and querying. In this paper we address the issue from the perspective of probabilistic databases, which account for uncertainty in the data via a probability distribution over all database instances. We obtain a highly compressed representation using the recently developed RESCAL approach and demonstrate experimentally that efficient querying can be obtained by exploiting inherent features of RESCAL via sub-query approximations of deterministic views.[6]: Building computers able to answer questions on any subject is a long standing goal of artificial intelligence. Promising progress has recently been achieved by methods that learn to map questions to logical forms or database queries. Such approaches can be effective but at the cost of either large amounts of human-labeled data or by defining lexicons and grammars tailored by practitioners. In this paper, we instead take the radical approach of learning to map questions to vectorial feature representations. By mapping answers into the same space one can query any knowledge base independent of its schema, without requiring any grammar or lexicon. Our method is trained with a new optimization procedure combining stochastic gradient descent followed by a fine-tuning step using the weak supervision provided by blending automatically and collaboratively generated resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model can capture meaningful signals from its noisy supervision leading to major improvements over paralex, the only existing method able to be trained on similar weakly labeled data.[7]: Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of large-scale knowledge bases, including Wikipedia, Freebase, YAGO, Microsoft's Satori, and Google's Knowledge Graph. To increase the scale even further, we need to explore automatic methods for constructing knowledge bases. Previous approaches have primarily focused on text-based extraction, which can be very noisy. Here we introduce Knowledge Vault, a Web-scale probabilistic knowledge base that combines extractions from Web content (obtained via analysis of text, tabular data, page structure, and human annotations) with prior knowledge derived from existing knowledge repositories. We employ supervised machine learning methods for fusing these distinct information sources. The Knowledge Vault is substantially bigger than any previously published structured knowledge repository, and features a probabilistic inference system that computes calibrated probabilities of fact correctness. We report the results of multiple studies that explore the relative utility of the different information sources and extraction methods.","answer":"Many knowledge graphs have recently arisen, pushed by the W3C recommendation to use the resource description framework (RDF) [1] for data representation.

We show that this dependency is much stronger than previously assumed. In fact, we show that by completely masking the EAU text spans and only feeding information from their context, a competitive system may function even better. We argue that an argument analysis system that relies more on discourse context than the argument's content is unsafe, since it can easily be tricked. To alleviate this issue, we separate argumentative units from their context such that the system is forced to model and rely on an EAU's content. We show that the resulting classification system is more robust, and argue that such models are better suited for predicting argumentative relations across documents.ResultsOur first step towards our main experiments is to replicate the competitive argumentative relation classifier of BIBREF13 , BIBREF1 . Hence, for comparison purposes, we first formulate the task exactly as it was done in this prior work, using the model formulation in Eq. EQREF17 , which determines the type of outgoing edge from a source (i.e., tree-like view).The results in Table TABREF38 confirm the results of BIBREF13 and suggest that we successfully replicated a large proportion of their features.The results for all three prediction settings (one outgoing edge: INLINEFORM0 , support/attack: INLINEFORM1 and support/attack/neither: INLINEFORM2 ) across all type variables ( INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 and INLINEFORM5 ) are displayed in Table TABREF39 . All models significantly outperform the majority baseline with respect to macro F1. Intriguingly, the content-ignorant models ( INLINEFORM6 ) always perform significantly better than the models which only have access to the EAUs' content ( INLINEFORM7 , INLINEFORM8 ). In the most general task formulation ( INLINEFORM9 ), we observe that INLINEFORM10 even significantly outperforms the model which has maximum access (seeing both EAU spans and surrounding contexts: INLINEFORM11 ).At first glance, the results of the purely EAU focused systems ( INLINEFORM0 ) are disappointing, since they fall far behind their competitors. On the other hand, their F1 scores are not devastatingly bad. The strong most-frequent-class baseline is significantly outperformed by the content-based ( INLINEFORM1 ) system, across all three prediction settings.In summary our findings are as follows: (i) models which see the EAU span (content-based, INLINEFORM0 ) are significantly outperformed by models that have no access to the span itself (content-ignorant, INLINEFORM1 ) across all settings; (ii) in two of three prediction settings ( INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 ), the model which only has access to the context even outperforms the model that has access to all information in the input. The fact that using features derived exclusively from the EAU embedding context ( INLINEFORM4 ) can lead to better results than using a full feature-system ( INLINEFORM5 ) suggests that some information from the EAU can even be harmful. Why this is the case, we cannot answer exactly. A plausible cause might be related to the smaller dimension of the feature space, which makes the SVM less likely to overfit. Still, this finding comes as a surprise and calls for further investigation in future work.A system for argumentative relation classification can be applied in one of two settings: single-document or cross-document, as illustrated in Figure FIGREF42 :in the first case (top), a system is tasked to classify EAUs that appear linearly in one document – here contextual clues can often highlight the relationship between two units. This is the setting we have been considering up to now. However, in the second scenario (bottom), we have moved away from the closed single-document setting and ask the system to classify two EAUs extracted from different document contexts. This setting applies, for instance, when we are mining arguments from multiple sources.In both cases, however, a system that relies more on contextual clues than on the content expressed in the EAUs is problematic: in the single-document setting, such a system will rely on discourse indicators – whether or not they are justified by content – and can thus easily be fooled.In the cross-document setting, discourse-based indicators – being inherently defined with respect to their internal document context – do not have a defined rhetorical function with respect to EAUs in a separate document and thus a system that has learned to rely on such markers within a single-document setting can be seriously misled.We believe that the cross-document setting should be an important goal in argumentation analysis, since it generalizes better to many debates of interest, where EAUs can be found scattered across thousands of documents. For example, for the topic of legalizing marijuana, EAUs may be mined from millions of documents and thus their relations may naturally extend across document boundaries. If a system learns to over-proportionally attend to the EAUs' surrounding contexts it is prone to making many errors.In what follows we are simulating the effects that an overly context-sensitive classifier could have in a cross-document setting, by modifying our experimental setting, and study the effects on the different model types: In one setup – we call it randomized-context – we systematically distort the context of our testing instances by exchanging the context in a randomized manner; in the other setting – called no-context, we are deleting the context around the ADUs to be classified. Randomized-context simulates an open world debate where argumentative units may occur in different contexts, sometimes with discourse markers indicating an opposite class. In other words, in this setting we want to examine effects when porting a context-sensitive system to a multi-document setting. For example, as seen in Figure FIGREF42 , the context of an argumentative unit may change from “However” to “Moreover” – which can happen naturally in open debates.The results are displayed in Figure FIGREF43 . In the standard setting (Figure FIGREF43 ), the models that have access to the context besides the content ( INLINEFORM0 ) and the models that are only allowed to access the context ( INLINEFORM1 ), always perform better than the content-based models ( INLINEFORM2 ) (bars above zero). However, when we randomly flip contexts of the test instances (Figure FIGREF43 ), or suppress them entirely (Figure FIGREF43 ), the opposite picture emerges: the content-based models always outperform the other models. For some classes (support, INLINEFORM3 ) the difference can exceed 50 F1 percentage points. These two studies, where testing examples are varied regarding their context (randomized-context or no-context) simulates what can be expected if we apply our systems for relation class assignment to EAUs stemming from heterogeneous sources. While the performances of a purely content-based model naturally stays stable, the performance of the other systems decrease notably – they perform worse than the content-based model.We calculate the ANOVA classification F scores of the features with respect to our three task formulations INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . The F percentiles of features extracted from the EAU surrounding text ( INLINEFORM2 ) and features extracted from the EAU span ( INLINEFORM3 ), are displayed in Figure FIGREF50 .It clearly stands out that features obtained from the EAU surrounding context ( INLINEFORM0 ) are assigned much higher scores compared to features stemming from the EAU span ( INLINEFORM1 ). This holds true for all three task formulations and provides further evidence that models – when given the option – put a strong focus on contextual clues while neglecting the information provided by the EAU span itself.DiscussionWhile competitive systems for argumentative relation classification are considered to be robust, our experiments have shown that despite confidence-inspiring scores on unseen testing data, such systems can easily be fooled – they can deliver strong performance scores although the classifier does not have access to the content of the EAUs. In this respect, we have provided evidence that there is a danger in case models focus too much on rhetorical indicators, in detriment of the context. Thus, the following question arises: How can we prevent argumentation models from modeling arguments or argumentative units and their relations in overly naïve ways? A simple and intuitive way is to dissect EAUs from their surrounding document context. Models trained on data that is restricted to the EAUs' content will be forced to focus on the content of EAUs. We believe that this will enhance the robustness of such models and allows them to generalize to cross-document argument relation classification. The corpus of student essays makes such transformations straightforward: only the EAUs were annotated (e.g., “However, INLINEFORM0 A INLINEFORM1 ”). If annotations extend over the EAUs (e.g., only full sentences are annotated, “ INLINEFORM2 However, A INLINEFORM3 ”), such transformations could be performed automatically after a discourse parsing step. When inspecting the student essays corpus, we further observed that an EAU mining step should involve coreference resolution to better capture relations between EAUs that involve anaphors (e.g., “Exercising makes you feel better” and “It INLINEFORM4 increases endorphin levels”).Thus, in order to conduct real-world end-to-end argumentation relation mining for a given topic, we envision a system that addresses three steps: (i) mining of EAUs and (ii) replacement of pronouns in EAUs with referenced entities (e.g., INLINEFORM0 ). Finally (iii), given the cross product of mined EAUs we can apply a model of type INLINEFORM1 to construct a full-fledged argumentation graph, possibly spanning multiple documents. We have shown that in order to properly perform step (iii), we need stronger models that are able to better model EAU contents. Hence, we encourage the argumentation community to test their systems on a decontextualized version of the student essays, including the proposed – and possibly further extended – testing setups, to challenge the semantic representation and reasoning capacities of argument analysis models. This will lead to more realistic performance estimates and increased robustness of systems when addressing desirable multi-document tasks.ConclusionWe have shown that systems which put too much focus on discourse information may be easily fooled – an issue which has severe implications when systems are applied to cross-document argumentative relation classification tasks. The strong reliance on contextual clues is also problematic in single-document contexts, where systems can run a risk of assigning relation labels relying on contextual and rhetorical effects – instead of focusing on content. Hence, we propose that researchers test their argumentative relation classification systems on two alternative versions of the StudentEssay data that reflect different access levels. (i) EAU-span only, where systems only see the EAU spans and (ii) context-only, where systems can only see the EAU-surrounding context. These complementary settings will (i) challenge the semantic capacities of a system, and (ii) unveil the extent to which a system is focusing on the discourse context when making decisions. We will offer our testing environments to the research community through a platform that provides datasets and scripts and a table to trace the results of content-based systems.Table 1: Data set statistics.Question: How do they demonstrate the robustness of their results?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"performances of a purely content-based model naturally stays stable\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"The results are displayed in Figure FIGREF43 .

While there have been numerous studies documenting the anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of common drugs in zebrafish, many do not report or test for behavioral differences between the sexes. Previous studies have indicated that males and females differ in their baseline level of anxiety. In this study, we test for a sex interaction with fluoxetine and nicotine. We exposed fish to system water (control), 10 mg/L fluoxetine, or 1 mg/L nicotine for three minutes prior to being subjected to four minutes in an open-field drop test. Video recordings were tracked using ProAnalyst. Fish from both drug treatments reduced swimming speed, increased vertical position, and increased use of the top half of the open field when compared with the control, though fluoxetine had a larger effect on depth related behaviors while nicotine mostly affected swimming speed. A significant sex effect was observed where females swam at a slower and more constant speed than males, however neither drug produced a sex - dependent response.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"Anxiolytic effects\\", \\"anxiolytic\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"system water\\", \\"drugs\\", \\"fluoxetine\\", \\"drug\\", \\"nicotine\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"Zebrafish\\", \\"zebrafish\\", \\"Fish\\", \\"fish\\", \\"Danio rerio\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"anxiety\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"open-field drop test\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"report\\", \\"ProAnalyst\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"studies\\", \\"studying\\", \\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"vertical position\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

It is found that secretion of pancreastatin and somatostatin from QGP-1N cells is regulated through muscarinic receptor-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositide hydrolysis system. In this report, whether the cAMP pathway interacts with the phosphoinositide turnover system for the secretion of pancreastatin and somatostatin from QGP-1N cells through muscarinic receptors was studied. Stimulation of QGP-1N cells with carbachol increased intracellular cAMP levels. The carbachol-induced increase in cAMP levels was inhibited by atropine. Calcium ionophore (A23187) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased cAMP synthesis. Dibutyryl cAMP , forskolin and theophylline stimulated secretion of pancreastatin and somatostatin . When either dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin or theophylline was added in culture medium with A23187, phorbol ester or carbachol, a synergistic effect was found on pancreastatin and somatostatin secretion.

METHODS Of 102 selected patients with solitary small renal tumors who had prospect ively completed at least 2 years of follow-up since December 2004 , r and omizedly , 54 had either open ( 19 ) or laparoscopic ( 35 ) PN and 48 had laparoscopic ( 28 ) or open ( 20 ) microwave ablation .  Patient and tumor characteristics , surgical data , complications , histologic and oncologic data , and functional data of the two approaches were compared . RESULTS Patients in microwave ablation group and PN group matched for age , sex , American Society of Anesthesiologists score , body mass index , and tumor size and were respectively followed for median 32 and 36 months . Surgical and hospitalization times were comparable in both groups . Estimated blood loss , complication rates , and decline of postoperative renal function were significantly less in the microwave ablation group ( P = 0.0002 , P = 0.0187 , and P = 0.0092 , respectively ) . The decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate at the last available follow-up was similar in both groups ( P = 1.0000 ) . There were no disease-specific deaths . Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall local recurrence-free survival at 3 years were 91.3 % for microwave ablation and 96.0 % for PN ( P = 0.5414 ) ; the respective numbers for renal cell carcinomas were 90.4 and 96.6 % ( P = 0.4650 ) . CONCLUSIONS Microwave ablation can be also safely and efficiently done for patients with small renal tumors . This intermediate analysis showed that microwave ablation provides favorable results compared to PN . However , longer term data are still neededTitle 2:Reporting standards for percutaneous thermal ablation of renal cell carcinoma.Abstract 2:WITH the increasing incidence of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) in the United States and the increasing proportion of patients with tumors detected at an early stage ( 1–5 ) , nephron-sparing approaches are becoming more popular . These alternatives to radical nephrectomy include partial nephrectomy , wedge resection , and , more recently , in situ thermal ablation . Five-year survival rates after partial nephrectomy are equivalent to those after radical nephrectomy ( 6–8 ) , supporting the rationale of in situ tumor destruction to further reduce morbidity and invasiveness . In situ thermal destruction of RCC uses techniques that destroy tumor tissue through heating ( eg , radiofrequency [ RF ] ablation , microwave ablation , laser interstitial therapy , high-intensity focused ultrasound [ US ] ) or freezing ( eg , cryotherapy ) . Each of these techniques relies on controlled energy delivery to minimize collateral damage to normal renal parenchyma and other surrounding structures . In the United States , RF ablation and cryoablation are currently the most widely used techniques for in situ RCC destruction . Thermal ablation of RCC may be performed percutaneously , laparoscopically , or through open surgery . Our current underst and ing of the role of percutaneous thermal ablation in the management of primary RCC is limited by a paucity of prospect i ve studies ( 9,10 ) . Given the relative newness of this technology , most series to date report short-term or midterm outcomes , with no reports extending to 5 years of survival outcomes . No r and omized trials have been performed to date comparing thermal ablation against a gold st and ard ( ie , partial nephrectomy ) or against other thermal ablation techniques . The optimal size range of RCC amenable to thermal ablation has not been clearly defined and is closely related to anatomic factors that influence the ability to deposit sufficient thermal dose to coagulate tissue , including proximity to major vessels and the urinary collecting system , which can act as a heat sink . The kidney has approximately four times the blood flow of the liver , so convective heat loss during thermal ablation is potentially significant ( 11 ) . The role of percutaneous thermal ablation compared with laparoscopic or open thermal ablation also remains a topic of controversy . The combination of thermal ablation with other imageguided therapies ( eg , transcatheter embolization ) and adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy and antiangiogenic agents for larger RCCs in patients who are poor operative c and i date s is another potential use of this technique . Although most recent reports of percutaneous RCC ablation have involved RF ablation , other ablation technologies are now available with percutaneous applicators ( eg , cryoablation , microwave , laser interstitial therapy ) , and reporting st and ards should be uniform for all forms of energy-based ablation . This document provides recommended reporting st and ards for physicians performing percutaneous thermal ablation of primary RCC and will serve as a template in the design of clinical trials to further evaluate this technology .

This small molecule signaling process is known as quorum sensing (QS), and has attracted considerable interest from the microbiology, chemical biology, and drug discovery communities.1–5 Gram-negative bacteria use N-acylated L-homoserine lactones (AHLs, Fig. 1A) as their primary QS signals,6–8 which are produced by synthase proteins (LuxI-type proteins) and are perceived by cytoplasmic transcription factors (LuxR-type proteins).9 In general, AHLs are cell permeable and their concentration increases with increasing cell density. Once a threshold AHL concentration is achieved, productive AHL:LuxR-type receptor binding occurs. These complexes typically dimerize, associate with DNA, and initiate the transcription of the genes critical for density-dependent phenotypes. Among the diverse phenotypes regulated by this process are biofilm formation in pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa,10,11 bioluminescence in the symbiont Vibrio fischeri,12,13 and root nodulation in mutualists like the Rhizobia spp.14 Due to the impact of these QS-related phenotypes in fields from healthcare to agriculture, there is considerable interest in developing new approaches for modulating and evaluating the chemical dialogue among bacteria.15,16 Chemical approaches to intercept bacterial QS, whether by blocking AHL:LuxR-type receptor binding or sequestering/degrading AHL signals, have become prominent techniques in the field.17–21</p><p>Chemical tools for evaluating the biochemical interactions between AHLs and LuxR-type proteins, as well as for the identification of novel AHL receptors, would be useful for a broad range of experiments.16,22,23 LuxR-type proteins have proven challenging to characterize using standard biochemical and structural techniques (largely due to their instability in the absence of AHL ligands), and this has limited our understanding of how they perceive both native and nonnative AHL signals.9,24 In addition, increasing evidence suggests that AHLs from one bacterial species can induce phenotypic changes in neighboring species, including other Gram-negative bacteria25 and potentially even their eukaryotic hosts.26 This implies that bacteria may have more extensive networks of communication pathways, both at the inter-species and the inter-kingdom levels. Therefore, identifying new receptors for AHLs may lead to a deeper understanding of these phenomena.</p><p>Affinity chromatography could provide solutions for several of the challenges described above.27 In this methodology, small molecules of interest are chemically modified and covalently bound to an insoluble solid support, typically agarose or sepharose resin. These modified resins are then incubated with samples containing putative biological targets. Theoretically, small molecule moieties on the resin should only bind to their specific protein partners, permitting the latter to be retained throughout resin washing steps. Isolated proteins can then be eluted, analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), and identified using mass spectrometry (MS) or other techniques. This strategy has successfully identified several small-molecule target proteins, including histone deacetylase28 and the FK-506 binding protein (FKBP).29 Follow-up studies with these molecular targets have contributed to the overall understanding of their associated biological processes.</p><p>To date, the design of affinity matrices to assist in the identification of QS-related protein targets has been limited. Certain matrices and related chemical tools are relevant, however, and are introduced briefly here. Spring and co-workers have utilized an azithromycin-modified sepharose resin to identify its biological targets in P. aeruginosa.30 Sub-bacteriocidal doses of azithromycin have been shown to inhibit biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa, and because biofilm formation and QS are linked in this pathogen, QS pathways would appear to be a plausible target for azithromycin. Interestingly, analysis of the azithromycin–sepharose resin showed that many of the captured targets were ribosomal proteins, which suggests P. aeruginosa biofilm inhibition via azithromycin occurs through the ribosome as opposed to QS pathways. Concurrently, Spring and co-workers have developed an elegant 3D small-molecule microarray system31 that allows for the printing of AHL derivatives in a spatially addressable format.32 These arrays consist of reactive polymer gel matrices, and can be readily derivatized with AHL analogues containing nucleophilic groups at their acyl chain termini. The 3D arrays have proven useful for the screening of new AHL analogues for LuxR-type protein binding. In related work, the Meijler group has synthesized an AHL probe equipped with both a photoactive diazirine and 'click' chemistry reactive alkyne.22 In this proof-of-concept work, they demonstrated that their AHL probe binds to LasR, a prominent LuxR-type protein in P. aeruginosa, with only a slight decrease in activity relative to LasR's native AHL, N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL; Fig. 1B). The authors also demonstrated that UV exposure leads to covalent attachment of the AHL probe to LasR through the diazirine moiety. These results suggest that the alkyne moiety could be used to further react the AHL-LasR complex with an affinity resin via click chemistry, and the authors highlight this possibility as a goal for future work. Lastly, motivated by reports of the immunomodulatory effects of OdDHL in humans,33 Seabra et al. prepared two OdDHL-derivatized resins and applied them for the identification of human receptors for AHLs.34 The OdDHL ligand was appended to the matrix through either the acyl chain termini or a mid-chain branch point using a piperazine linker. Two proteins were isolated using these matrices, but neither appeared to have immunological relevance.</p><p>Inspired by these recent studies, we sought to apply the affinity chromatography technique in our own QS research with the ultimate goal of developing a new tool to aid in the discovery of novel QS targets. To the best of our knowledge, the application of AHL-derivatized affinity resins for the identification of LuxR-type receptors has not been reported to date. Herein, we describe our initial studies toward the design, synthesis, and application of an AHL-derivatized agarose matrix. Affinity pull-down assays using this new AHL-functionalized matrix confirmed the binding of QscR, an 'orphan' LuxR-type protein from P. aeruginosa,35 to the matrix. These results serve to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing AHL-derivatized affinity matrices for LuxR-type receptor isolation and characterization.</p><p>To guide our design of an appropriate ligand for matrix derivatization, we first scrutinized the AHL:receptor binding interactions in the three reported structures of AHL:LuxR-type proteins (TraR, LasR, and SdiA).36–40 Each of these structures shows a series of conserved hydrogen-bonding interactions between the AHL lactone ring and residues in the binding pocket of the receptor. To prevent disruption of these key interactions, we decided that attachment of an AHL to the resin matrix should occur through the acyl tail as opposed to the lactone head group. Such an attachment strategy was successfully utilized by Spring32 and Seabra34 (see above). For our AHL scaffold, we chose to synthesize an analogue of OdDHL (Fig. 1B). We note that this molecule is the native ligand for both LasR and QscR in P. aeruginosa. QscR is a unique QS receptor, as it appears to bind OdDHL, the native ligand for LasR, and repress the activity of LasR.35 Notably, QscR can be readily produced in full-length form (in P. aeruginosa), 41 and we have considerable experience in its manipulation. 42 We reasoned these capabilities would enable proof-of-concept resin-QscR binding studies. We selected Affigel-10 agarose resin (Bio-Rad; derivatized with N-succinimidyl (N-OSu) esters) as our matrix due to its wide and successful usage in other affinity chromatography applications.27 To facilitate coupling to the activated esters of Affigel-10, we designed an OdDHL analogue (6) with a primary amino group at the end of the acyl tail (Scheme 1).</p><p>The synthesis of AHL 6 commenced with nucleophilic substitution of NH3 onto 10-bromodecanoic acid 1 at ambient temperature, followed by N-Boc protection to generate acid 2.23 Thereafter, 2 was allowed to react with Meldrum's acid 3 under standard conditions and coupled to homoserine lactone (4) to afford N-Boc AHL 5 in 78% yield over two steps. Cleavage of the N-Boc group with TFA yielded amino-AHL 6 as the TFA salt in 56% yield after preparative HPLC purification.</p><p>Next, AHL 6 was mixed with Affigel-10 resin (N-OSu loading = 7.5 μmol/mL of slurry) and DIEA at ambient temperature for 2 h to affect coupling. Using AHL 6 as the limiting reagent (0.5 equiv relative to N-OSu available on resin) gave quantitative resin coupling (i.e., 50% coverage), as indicated by LC–MS analysis (see Supplementary data). Finally, ethanolamine was used to block all remaining activated esters on the resin (to ensure that they would not interfere with the subsequent experiments), and afforded OdDHL-derivatized resin 7. To provide a control resin for protein binding studies, we also reacted Affigel-10 with ethanolamine alone to generated a 'capped', AHL-free resin.</p><p>We next tested the ability of resin 7 to bind to QscR. QscR was produced in P. aeruginosa PAO-T7(pJLQhis), a QscR over-expression strain, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography using reported procedures.41 As this P. aeruginosa strain retains the synthase for OdDHL (LasI), QscR is likely isolated as a mixture of OdDHL-bound and OdDHL-free protein (and an equilibrium thereof). 43 We reasoned that this mixture would still be viable for binding experiments with resin 7. Samples of resin 7 and the control resin were incubated with purified QscR (3.75 μmol resin-bound AHL to 15 nmol QscR, or 250:1 AHL/protein) in buffer for 24 h at 4 °C,44 after which the resins were filtered and subjected to washing in order to remove any unbound/excess protein. These washings were collected, and the resin samples and washings were each diluted with gel loading buffer and heat-denatured before being loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel for SDS–PAGE analysis (see Supplementary data for full details).</p><p>Figure 2 shows the SDS–PAGE data for the resin 7/purified QscR binding experiment. Resin 7 was found to cleanly bind QscR (lane 3, denoted 'R'). Significant QscR was found in the collected supernatant (lane 4, denoted 'S'), with reduced quantities being observed in the washing samples (lanes 5 and 6). The large quantity of residual QscR in the supernatant could be due to a high percentage of native OdDHL-bound QscR in our protein sample (see above)43 and/or the reduced ability of QscR to bind the resin-bound OdDHL analogue. Nevertheless, resin 7 bound sufficient QscR for it to be clearly observable on the gel. Further, the control resin showed no detectable binding (lane 7, denoted 'R'), indicating that the appended OdDHL analogue is essential for binding of QscR to the resin. Collectively, these data show that resin 7 is capable of binding to a purified LuxR-type protein.</p><p>Encouraged by these results, we then evaluated the ability of resin 7 to bind and effectively remove QscR from a more complex sample, that is, cell lysates. Such a capability would be useful for the application of resin 7 to biologically relevant samples and the potential identification of new LuxR-type proteins. Co-incubation of resin 7 with crude PAO-T7(pJLQhis) lysates and analogous SDS–PAGE analysis as described above again yielded one prominent band (Fig. 3; lane 3, denoted 'R'). This band was extracted from the gel and subjected to trypsin digest followed by ESI-MS/MS analysis, which confirmed the presence of QscR (see Supplementary data). Similar to the experiment with purified QscR, no significant binding of QscR to the 'capped' control resin was observed (lane 7, denoted 'R'). We note that PAO-T7(pJLQhis) is an overexpression strain and therefore the quantity of QscR in the cell lysate is considerably higher than that in a wild-type strain.46 Even so, these initial results demonstrate the exciting potential for resin 7 to be utilized in the isolation of LuxR-type proteins from more complex biological mixtures.</p><p>In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a new AHL-modified affinity matrix, and demonstrated that this matrix can bind to the QscR protein from P. aeruginosa. This OdDHL-derivatized resin (7) was shown to bind QscR from both purified protein samples and crude cell lysates using SDS–PAGE. These proof-of-concept experiments illustrate how resin 7 could be used as a tool to isolate and potentially identify new AHL receptor proteins in bacteria. As mentioned above, a number of eukaryotes display sensitivity to AHLs.26 Therefore, resin 7 and related derivatives could also prove useful for the elucidation of such cross-kingdom sensing pathways. Our progress towards these goals, along with further optimization of resin 7, will be reported in due course.</p>","answer":"The design and synthesis of an agarose resin functionalized with a Gram-negative quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecule analogue is described.

However , in group 2 patients , a gradual increase in the pethidine requirement and a high sedation score were noteworthy in the later days of placebo medication . Observations were also analyzed for CBZ days vs. placebo days . Overall , the pain score ( 1.7 ± 0.8 ) during the CBZ period of both regimens was significantly ( p < .001 ) lower than during the placebo days ( 3.1 ± 0.9 ) . Significantly higher doses of pethidine ( 3.7 ± 0.9 mg/kg/day ) were used on the placebo days than on the CBZ days ( 1.7 ± 1.0 mg/kg/day ) . Conclusion : The pain in GBS has a dual origin , and we recommend CBZ as an adjuvant to treat pain  in GBS patients , during the recovery phase in the ICU , to reduce the narcotic requirementTitle 2:Propanolol ('Inderal') in the treatment of childhood migraine.Abstract 2:In a double-blind crossover study of 39 children with established migraine , there was no difference between treatment with propanolol and placebo as regards frequency , severity or average duration of migraine attacks .

We aim ed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of gabapentin in relieving the bimodal nature of pain in Guillain-Barré syndrome in a r and omized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , crossover study in 18 patients admitted to the intensive care unit for ventilatory support . Patients were assigned to receive either gabapentin ( 15 mg · kg−1 · d−1 in 3 divided doses ) or matching placebo as initial medication for 7 days . After a 2-day washout period , those who previously received gabapentin received placebo , and those previously receiving placebo received gabapentin as in the initial phase . Fentanyl 2 & mgr;g/kg was used as a rescue analgesic on patient dem and or when the pain score was > 5 on a numeric rating scale of 0–10 . The numeric rating score , sedation score , consumption of fentanyl , and adverse effects were noted , and these observed variables were compared . The numeric pain score decreased from 7.22 ± 0.83 to 2.33 ± 1.67 on the second day after initiation of gabapentin therapy and remained low during the period of gabapentin therapy ( 2.06 ± 0.63 ) ( P < 0.001 ) . There was a significant decrease in the need for fentanyl from Day 1 to Day 7 during the gabapentin therapy period ( 211.11 ± 21.39 to 65.53 ± 16.17 [ & mgr;g ] ) in comparison to the placebo therapy period ( 319.44 ± 25.08 to 316.67 ± 24.25 [ & mgr;g ] ) ( P < 0.001 )Title 4:Comparison of self-hypnosis and propranolol in the treatment of juvenile classic migraine.Abstract 4:In a prospect i ve study we compared propranolol , placebo , and self-hypnosis in the treatment of juvenile classic migraine . Children aged 6 to 12 years with classic migraine who had no previous specific treatment were r and omized into propranolol ( at 3 mg/kg/d ) or placebo groups for a 3-month period and then crossed over for 3 months . After this 6-month period , each child was taught self-hypnosis and used it for 3 months . Twenty-eight patients completed the entire study . The mean number of headaches per child for 3 months during the placebo period was 13.3 compared with 14.9 during the propranolol period and 5.8 during the self-hypnosis period . Statistical analysis showed a significant association between decrease in headache frequency and self-hypnosis training ( P = .045 ) .

BACKGROUND The clinical utility of a device such as the ASO can only be judged against the results of contemporaneous surgery . METHODS A multicenter , nonr and omized concurrent study was performed in 29 pediatric cardiology centers from March 1998 to March 2000 . The patients were assigned to either the device or surgical closure group according to the patients ' option . Baseline physical exams and echocardiography were performed preprocedure and at follow-up ( 6 and 12 months for device group , 12 months for surgical group ) . RESULTS A total of 442 patients were in the group undergoing device closure , whereas 154 patients were in the surgical group . The median age was 9.8 years for the device group and 4.1 years for the surgical group ( p < 0.001 ) . In the device group , 395 ( 89.4 % ) patients had a single ASD ; in the surgical group , 124 ( 80.5 % ) ( p = 0.008 ) had a single ASD . The size of the primary ASD was 13.3 + /- 5.4 mm for the device group and 14.2 + /- 6.3 mm for the surgery group ( p = 0.099 ) . The procedural attempt success rate was 95.7 % for the device group and 100 % for the surgical group ( p = 0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS The early , primary and secondary efficacy success rates were 94.8 % , 98.5 % and 91.6 % , respectively , for the device group , and 96.1 % , 100 % and 89.0 % for the surgical group ( all p > 0.05 ) . The complication rate was 7.2 % for the device group and 24.0 % for the surgical group ( p < 0.001 ) . The mean length of hospital stay was 1.0 + /- 0.3 day for the device group and 3.4 + /- 1.2 days for the surgical group ( p < 0.001 ) . Mortality was 0 % for both groups . The early , primary and secondary efficacy success rates for surgical versus . device closure of ASD were not statistically different ; however , the complication rate was lower and the length of hospital stay was shorter for device closure than for surgical repair . Appropriate patient selection is an important factor for successful device closure . Transcatheter closure of secundum ASD using the ASO is a safe and effective alternative to surgical repairTitle 6:PROPRANOLOL USED IN PROPHYLAXIS OF MIGRAINE IN CHILDRENAbstract 6:About 4 per cent of schoolchildren suffer from migraine . In some cases the attacks can be frequent and severe . Often symptomatic and prophylactic treatments are either ineffective or cause pronounced side effects . There have been reports on studies in which a prophylactic effect on migraine by propranolol has been noted . This beta‐receptor blocking agent has been tested in a double‐blind single crossover study in 32 children aged 7–16 with migraine .  Propranolol had an excellent prophylactic effect on migraine attacks . Since propranolol does not cause serious side effects provided certain patients are excluded , it seems justifiable to recommend this preparation where prophylactic therapy is indicated in cases of severe and frequent migraine .Title 7:Pizotifen (Sanomigran) in childhood migraine.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  This letter proposes a simultaneous joint sparsity model for target detection in hyperspectral imagery (HSI). The key innovative idea here is that hyperspectral pixels within a small neighborhood in the test image can be simultaneously represented by a linear combination of a few common training samples but weighted with a different set of coefficients for each pixel. The joint sparsity model automatically incorporates the interpixel correlation within the HSI by assuming that neighboring pixels usually consist of similar materials. The sparse representations of the neighboring pixels are obtained by simultaneously decomposing the pixels over a given dictionary consisting of training samples of both the target and background classes. The recovered sparse coefficient vectors are then directly used for determining the label of the test pixels. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the classical hyperspectral target detection algorithms, such as the popular spectral matched filters, matched subspace detectors, and adaptive subspace detectors, as well as binary classifiers such as support vector machines. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  In this paper, we propose a new sparsity-based algorithm for automatic target detection in hyperspectral imagery (HSI). This algorithm is based on the concept that a pixel in HSI lies in a low-dimensional subspace and thus can be represented as a sparse linear combination of the training samples. The sparse representation (a sparse vector corresponding to the linear combination of a few selected training samples) of a test sample can be recovered by solving an l0-norm minimization problem. With the recent development of the compressed sensing theory, such minimization problem can be recast as a standard linear programming problem or efficiently approximated by greedy pursuit algorithms. Once the sparse vector is obtained, the class of the test sample can be determined by the characteristics of the sparse vector on reconstruction. In addition to the constraints on sparsity and reconstruction accuracy, we also exploit the fact that in HSI the neighboring pixels have a similar spectral characteristic (smoothness). In our proposed algorithm, a smoothness constraint is also imposed by forcing the vector Laplacian at each reconstructed pixel to be minimum all the time within the minimization process. The proposed sparsity-based algorithm is applied to several hyperspectral imagery to detect targets of interest. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms the classical hyperspectral target detection algorithms, such as the popular spectral matched filters, matched subspace detectors, adaptive subspace detectors, as well as binary classifiers such as support vector machines. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Hyperspectral remote sensing imagery contains rich information on spectral and spatial distributions of distinct surface materials. Owing to its numerous and continuous spectral bands, hyperspectral data enable more accurate and reliable material classification than using panchromatic or multispectral imagery. However, high-dimensional spectral features and limited number of available training samples have caused some difficulties in the classification, such as overfitting in learning, noise sensitiveness, overloaded computation, and lack of meaningful physical interpretability. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral feature extraction and pixel classification method based on structured sparse logistic regression and 3-D discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) texture features. The 3D-DWT decomposes a hyperspectral data cube at different scales, frequencies, and orientations, during which the hyperspectral data cube is considered as a whole tensor instead of adapting the data to a vector or matrix. This allows the capture of geometrical and statistical spectral-spatial structures. After the feature extraction step, sparse representation/modeling is applied for data analysis and processing via sparse regularized optimization, which selects a small subset of the original feature variables to model the data for regression and classification purpose. A linear structured sparse logistic regression model is proposed to simultaneously select the discriminant features from the pool of 3D-DWT texture features and learn the coefficients of the linear classifier, in which the prior knowledge about feature structure can be mapped into the various sparsity-inducing norms such as lasso, group, and sparse group lasso. Furthermore, to overcome the limitation of linear models, we extended the linear sparse model to nonlinear classification by partitioning the feature space into subspaces of linearly separable samples. The advantages of our methods are validated on the real hyperspectral remote sensing data sets. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  A simple but effective method for airport detection from medium resolution Landsat-7 satellite remote sensing images based on sparse coding is presented. It consists of three phases: dictionary construction, sparse coding, and airport detection. Firstly, an over-complete dictionary is constructed using a set of airport training samples. Secondly, test images are scanned using multi-scale windows and each scanned window is sparsely coded in terms of atoms of the dictionary. Finally, sparsity concentration index of each scanned window is calculated based on the coding coefficients, which is used to decide the airport detection. Evaluations on publically available satellite images and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches have demonstrated the superiority of the presented work. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  Due to the high spectral resolution, anomaly detection from hyperspectral images provides a new way to locate potential targets in a scene, especially those targets that are spectrally different from the majority of the data set. Conventional Mahalanobis-distance-based anomaly detection methods depend on the background statistics to construct the anomaly detection metric. One of the main problems with these methods is that the Gaussian distribution assumption of the background may not be reasonable. Furthermore, these methods are also susceptible to contamination of the conventional background covariance matrix by anomaly pixels. This paper proposes a new anomaly detection method by effectively exploiting a robust anomaly degree metric for increasing the separability between anomaly pixels and other background pixels, using discriminative information. First, the manifold feature is used so as to divide the pixels into the potential anomaly part and the potential background part. This procedure is called discriminative information learning. A metric learning method is then performed to obtain the robust anomaly degree measurements. Experiments with three hyperspectral data sets reveal that the proposed method outperforms other current anomaly detection methods. The sensitivity of the method to several important parameters is also investigated. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Abstract Automatic detection of geospatial targets in cluttered scenes is a profound challenge in the field of aerial and satellite image analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel practical framework enabling efficient and simultaneous detection of multi-class geospatial targets in remote sensing images (RSI) by the integration of visual saliency modeling and the discriminative learning of sparse coding. At first, a computational saliency prediction model is built via learning a direct mapping from a variety of visual features to a ground truth set of salient objects in geospatial images manually annotated by experts. The output of this model can predict a small set of target candidate areas. Afterwards, in contrast with typical models that are trained independently for each class of targets, we train a multi-class object detector that can simultaneously localize multiple targets from multiple classes by using discriminative sparse coding. The Fisher discrimination criterion is incorporated into the learning of a dictionary, which leads to a set of discriminative sparse coding coefficients having small within-class scatter and big between-class scatter. Multi-class classification can be therefore achieved by the reconstruction error and discriminative coding coefficients. Finally, the trained multi-class object detector is applied to those target candidate areas instead of the entire image in order to classify them into various categories of target, which can significantly reduce the cost of traditional exhaustive search. Comprehensive evaluations on a satellite RSI database and comparisons with a number of state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed work. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  Abstract Airplane detection has been taking a great interest to researchers in the remote sensing filed. In this paper, we propose a new approach on feature extraction for airplane detection based on sparse coding in high resolution optical remote sensing images. However, direction of airplane in images brings difficulty on feature extraction. We focus on the airplane feature possessing rotation invariant that combined with sparse coding and radial gradient transform (RGT). Sparse coding has achieved excellent performance on classification problem through a linear combination of bases. Unlike the traditional bases learning that uses patch descriptor, this paper develops the idea by using RGT descriptors that compute the gradient histogram on annulus round the center of sample after radial gradient transform. This set of RGT descriptors on annuli is invariant to rotation. Thus the learned bases lead to the obtained sparse representation invariant to rotation. We also analyze the pooling problem within three different methods and normalization. The proposed pooling with constraint condition generates the final sparse representation which is robust to rotation and detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the better performance over other methods and provides a promising way to airplane detection. 8. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB008):  Target detection is one of the most important applications in hyperspectral remote sensing image analysis. However, the state-of-the-art machine-learning-based algorithms for hyperspectral target detection cannot perform well when the training samples, especially for the target samples, are limited in number. This is because the training data and test data are drawn from different distributions in practice and given a small-size training set in a high-dimensional space, traditional learning models without the sparse constraint face the over-fitting problem. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel feature extraction algorithm named sparse transfer manifold embedding (STME), which can effectively and efficiently encode the discriminative information from limited training data and the sample distribution information from unlimited test data to find a low-dimensional feature embedding by a sparse transformation. Technically speaking, STME is particularly designed for hyperspectral target detection by introducing sparse and transfer constraints. As a result of this, it can avoid over-fitting when only very few training samples are provided. The proposed feature extraction algorithm was applied to extensive experiments to detect targets of interest, and STME showed the outstanding detection performance on most of the hyperspectral datasets. 9. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB009):  Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is an essential preprocess step to improve the performance of subsequent applications. For HSI, there is much global and local redundancy and correlation (RAC) in spatial/spectral dimensions. In addition, denoising performance can be improved greatly if RAC is utilized efficiently in the denoising process. In this paper, an HSI denoising method is proposed by jointly utilizing the global and local RAC in spatial/spectral domains. First, sparse coding is exploited to model the global RAC in the spatial domain and local RAC in the spectral domain. Noise can be removed by sparse approximated data with learned dictionary. At this stage, only local RAC in the spectral domain is employed. It will cause spectral distortion. To compensate the shortcoming of local spectral RAC, low-rank constraint is used to deal with the global RAC in the spectral domain. Different hyperspectral data sets are used to test the performance of the proposed method. The denoising results by the proposed method are superior to results obtained by other state-of-the-art hyperspectral denoising methods. 10. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB010):  We present a novel method for detecting instances of an object class or specific object in high-spatial-resolution optical remote sensing images. The proposed method integrates sparse representations for local-feature detection into generalized-Hough-transform object detection. Object parts are detected via class-specific sparse image representations of patches using learned target and background dictionaries, and their co-occurrence is spatially integrated by Hough voting, which enables object detection. We aim to efficiently detect target objects using a small set of positive training samples by matching essential object parts with a target dictionary while the residuals are explained by a background dictionary. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for several examples including object-class detection and specific-object identification. 11. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB011):  In this paper, a new sparse representation-based binary hypothesis (SRBBH) model for hyperspectral target detection is proposed. The proposed approach relies on the binary hypothesis model of an unknown sample induced by sparse representation. The sample can be sparsely represented by the training samples from the background-only dictionary under the null hypothesis and the training samples from the target and background dictionary under the alternative hypothesis. The sparse vectors in the model can be recovered by a greedy algorithm, and the same sparsity levels are employed for both hypotheses. Thus, the recovery process leads to a competition between the background-only subspace and the target and background subspace, which are directly represented by the different hypotheses. The detection decision can be made by comparing the reconstruction residuals under the different hypotheses. Extensive experiments were carried out on hyperspectral images, which reveal that the SRBBH model shows an outstanding detection performance. 12. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB012):  The sparsity model has been employed for hyperspectral target detection and has been proved to be very effective when compared to the traditional linear mixture model. However, the state-of-art sparsity models usually represent a test sample via a sparse linear combination of both target and background training samples, which does not result in an efficient representation of a background test sample. In this paper, a sparse representation-based binary hypothesis (SRBBH) model employs more appropriate dictionaries with the binary hypothesis model to sparsely represent the test sample. Furthermore, the nonlinear issue is addressed in this paper, and a kernel method is employed to resolve the detection issue in complicated hyperspectral images. In this way, the kernel SRBBH model not only takes the nonlinear endmember mixture into consideration, but also fully exploits the sparsity model by the use of more reasonable dictionaries. The recovery process leads to a competition between the background and target subspaces, which is effective in separating the targets from the background, thereby enhancing the detection performance.Literature Review:","answer":"Lately, with the development of compressed sensing theory, SR-based features have been extensively applied to hyperspectral image denoising BIB010 , hyperspectral image classification BIB001 BIB004  , and object detection in RSIs (Chen et al., 2011b, c; BIB005 BIB006 BIB007 BIB008 BIB011 BIB009 BIB012 BIB013 .

Murine embryonic stem cells( mESC) were fused with human endothelial cells in stable, non-dividing, heterokaryons. Using RNA-seq, it is possible to discriminate between human and mouse transcripts in these chimeric heterokaryons. We observed a temporal pattern of gene expression in the ESCs of the heterokaryons that recapitulated ontogeny, with early mesodermal factors being expressed before mature endothelial genes. A set of transcriptional factors not known to be involved in endothelial development was upregulated, one of which was POU class 3 homeobox 2( Pou3f2). We confirmed its importance in differentiation to endothelial lineage via loss- and gain-of-function( LOF and GOF). Its role in vascular development was validated in zebrafish embryos using morpholino oligonucleotides. These studies provide a systematic and mechanistic approach for identifying key regulators in directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to somatic cell lineages.Introduction:Our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic processes governing endothelial development and differentiation is limited( Yan et al., 2010; De Val and Black, 2009). Accordingly, our methodologies for obtaining endothelial cells from pluripotent stem cells are empirically driven and suboptimal( Choi et al., 2009; James et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010a, 2010b; Wong et al., 2012). There is unexplained inconsistency in the yield of iPSC-ECs; in the stability of their phenotype; and in the fidelity of differentiation( in terms of replicating the epigenetic and genetic profile of a mature endothelial cell). Furthermore, our ability to efficiently generate specific endothelial subtypes( e. g. arterial, venous, lymphatic) is poor. Thus, a systematic approach is needed to more completely define the genetic and epigenetic programs required for differentiating pluripotent stem cells to the endothelial phenotype. Here, we propose an unbiased systematic approach to discover determinants of differentiation. We use interspecies heterokaryons, RNA sequencing and third-generation bioinformatics to discover novel candidate genes critical for proper endothelial differentiation and specification.Discussion:Our current understanding of the genetic and epigenetic processes governing endothelial development and differentiation is limited. We lack comprehensive knowledge regarding all endothelial lineage factors and have sparse information regarding the magnitude and temporal sequence of their expression. In this paper, we find that the bi-species heterokaryons combined with RNAseq can provide new insights into determinants of endothelial lineage. Our work suggests that transcription factors and epigenetic machinery which actively maintain endothelial phenotype can also act on the pluripotent cell nucleus to recapitulate ontogeny. This system is likely to generate useful insights to improve the yield and fidelity of reprogramming to endothelial phenotype. A tangible and immediate outcome of this line of inquiry will be a more complete knowledge of the hierarchy of genes regulating differentiation to the EC lineage. Insights into these processes will be of general interest to investigators of vascular differentiation and development and may lead to new therapeutic targets for endothelial regeneration and the treatment of vascular diseases. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this model system should be amenable to discovery of novel determinants of other cell lineages. We believe that our studies provide proof-of-concept for using bi-species heterokaryon technology as a tool to elucidate novel genes regulating differentiation to any somatic cell. Our work opens a new vista of exploration for the broader community of scientists working in tissue regeneration, development, differentiation and the therapeutic applications of these insights.","answer":"Endothelial cells form the inner surface of blood vessels , acting like a non-stick coating .

Thirty-two patients were entered into a randomized trial, and 124 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Local control with irradiation alone was achieved in 48 of 80 patients (60%) and in 60 of 76 patients (79%) treated with irradiation and actinomycin-D (p less than .05). Results were remarkably similar in the randomized and retrospective series.Title 2:A trial of human alpha interferon as an adjuvant agent in breast cancer after loco-regional recurrence.Abstract 2:Thirty-two women who had developed loco-regional recurrence of breast carcinoma were entered into a controlled trial of adjuvant alpha-interferon. All patients had histological confirmation of recurrence, local treatment with radiotherapy and negative staging investigations. They were then randomized to either observation alone, or treatment with human alpha interferon 3 x 10(6) units subcutaneously daily for 1 year. There were no differences detected in the rate of local or distant relapse. With this lack of clinically significant efficacy and a high incidence of side effects, it is concluded that alpha interferon is of doubtful value in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.Title 3:Adjuvant therapy after excision and radiation of isolated postmastectomy locoregional breast cancer recurrence: definitive results of a phase III randomized trial (SAKK 23/82) comparing tamoxifen with observation.Abstract 3:Adjuvant systemic treatment for patients with isolated locoregional recurrence (ILRR) of breast cancer is based on a single reported randomized trial. The trial, conducted by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research, compared tamoxifen (TAM) with observation after complete excision of the ILRR and proper radiotherapy. We performed a definitive analysis of treatment outcome at >11 years of follow-up, after the majority of the patients had a subsequent event of interest. Patient and methods One hundred and sixty-seven patients with 'good-risk' characteristics of disease were randomized. 'Good-risk' was defined as estrogen receptor expression in the ILRR, or having a disease-free interval of >12 months and a recurrence consisting of three or less tumor nodules, each </=3 cm in diameter. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were postmenopausal at randomization.                The median follow-up time of the surviving patients was 11.6 years. The median post ILRR disease-free survival (DFS) was 6.5 years with TAM and 2.7 years with observation (P = 0.053). The difference was mainly due to reduction of further local relapses (P = 0.011). In postmenopausal patients, TAM led to an increase of DFS from 33% to 61% (P = 0.006). In premenopausal women, 5-year DFS was 60%, independent of TAM medication. For the whole study population, the median post-recurrence overall survival (OS) was 11.2 and 11.5 years in the observation and the TAM group, respectively; premenopausal patients experienced a 5-year OS of 90% for observation compared with 67% for TAM (P = 0.175), while the respective figures for postmenopausal patients were both 75%.                These definitive results confirmed that TAM significantly improves the post-recurrence DFS of patients after local treatment for ILRR. This beneficial effect does not translate into a detectable OS advantage.Title 4:First isolated locoregional recurrence following mastectomy for breast cancer: results of a phase III multicenter study comparing systemic treatment with observation after excision and radiation. Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research.Abstract 4:We performed a randomized phase III multicenter study to compare systemic treatment versus no treatment after complete excision and radiotherapy for isolated first locoregional recurrence in patients with breast cancer.                One hundred sixty-seven good-risk patients with an estrogen receptor (ER+) positive recurrence or, in case of unknown receptor status, a disease-free interval (DFI) of greater than 12 months and < or = three recurrent tumor nodules each < or = 3 cm in diameter were entered onto the study. They were randomized to observation subsequent to local treatment or to receive tamoxifen (TAM) until disease progression. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were postmenopausal.                The median observation period for the entire study population was 6.3 years. The median disease-free survival (DFS) duration was 26 months for observation and 82 months for TAM patients (P = .007). This was mainly due to the reduction of further local recurrences, whereas the occurrence of early distant metastases was delayed. A multivariate analysis identified DFI and treatment with TAM as significant prognostic factors for DFS. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 76% and 74%, respectively (P = .77). DFI was also a prognostic factor for OS.                Systemic therapy with TAM after isolated locoregional recurrence of breast cancer significantly increased 5-year DFS rates from 36% to 59% compared with observation alone and prolonged median DFS by more than 4.5 years in patients with ER+ tumors or in the case of unknown ER status with a DFI of greater than 12 months and minimal tumor burden. Treatment with TAM currently has no significant impact on OS, but the median survival duration of the study population has not yet been reached.","answer":"This systematic review of randomised trials provides insufficient evidence to support systemic treatment in women with loco-regional recurrence of breast cancer.

Friedreich 's ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by ataxia, variously associating heart disease, diabetes mellitus and/or glucose intolerance. It results from intronic expansion of GAA triplet repeats at the FXN locus. Homozygous expansions cause silencing of the FXN gene and subsequent decreased expression of the encoded mitochondrial frataxin. Detailed analyses in fibroblasts and neuronal tissues from FRDA patients have revealed profound cytoskeleton anomalies. So far, however, the molecular mechanism underlying these cytoskeleton defects remains unknown. We show here that gene silencing spreads in cis over the PIP5K1B gene in cells from FRDA patients (circulating lymphocytes and primary fibroblasts), correlating with expanded GAA repeat size. PIP5K1B encodes phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase β type I (pip5k1β), an enzyme functionally linked to actin cytoskeleton dynamics that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [ PI (4) P ] to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [ PI (4,5) P2 ]. Accordingly, loss of pip5k1β function in FRDA cells was accompanied by decreased PI (4,5) P2 levels and was shown instrumental for destabilization of the actin network and delayed cell spreading. Knockdown of PIP5K1B in control fibroblasts using shRNA reproduced abnormal actin cytoskeleton remodeling, whereas over-expression of PIP5K1B, but not FXN, suppressed this phenotype in FRDA cells. In addition to provide new insights into the consequences of the FXN gene expansion, these findings raise the question whether PIP5K1B silencing may contribute to the variable manifestation of this complex disease.","answer":"[[\\"phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase u03b2 type I\\"], [\\"PI (4,5) P2\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase u03b2 type I\\"], [\\"phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"PIP5K1B\\"], [\\"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase u03b2 type I\\"], [\\"PI (4) P\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"pip5k1u03b2\\"], [\\"phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"pip5k1u03b2\\"], [\\"PI (4) P\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"PIP5K1B\\"], [\\"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"PIP5K1B\\"], [\\"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"pip5k1u03b2\\"], [\\"PI (4,5) P2\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"PIP5K1B\\"], [\\"PI (4) P\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase u03b2 type I\\"], [\\"PI (4,5) P2\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"pip5k1u03b2\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

For major depression diagnoses and depression symptoms, respectively, we meta-analyzed data from 65 and 95 articles and their corresponding national data sets, representing data from 1,716,195 and 1,922,064 people in over 90 different nations. Overall, odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.88, 2.03], and d = 0.27 [0.26, 0.29]. Age was the strongest predictor of effect size. The gender difference for diagnoses emerged earlier than previously thought, with OR = 2.37 at age 12. For both meta-analyses, the gender difference peaked in adolescence (OR = 3.02 for ages 13-15, and d = 0.47 for age 16) but then declined and remained stable in adulthood. Cross-national analyses indicated that larger gender differences were found in nations with greater gender equity, for major depression, but not depression symptoms. The gender difference in depression represents a health disparity, especially in adolescence, yet the magnitude of the difference indicates that depression in men should not be overlooked.

The T3SS consists of a membrane protein complex and an extracellular needle together that form a continuous channel. Regulated secretion of virulence factors requires the presence of SipD at the T3SS needle tip in S. typhimurium. Here we report three-dimensional structures of individual SipD, SipD in fusion with the needle subunit PrgI, and of SipD:PrgI in complex with the bile salt, deoxycholate. Assembly of the complex involves major conformational changes in both SipD and PrgI. This rearrangement is mediated via a π bulge in the central SipD helix and is stabilized by conserved amino acids that may allow for specificity in the assembly and composition of the tip proteins. Five copies each of the needle subunit PrgI and SipD form the T3SS needle tip complex. Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and crystal structure analysis we found that the T3SS needle tip complex binds deoxycholate with micromolar affinity via a cleft formed at the SipD:PrgI interface. In the structure-based three-dimensional model of the T3SS needle tip, the bound deoxycholate faces the host membrane. Recently, binding of SipD with bile salts present in the gut was shown to impede bacterial infection. Binding of bile salts to the SipD:PrgI interface in this particular arrangement may thus inhibit the T3SS function. The structures presented in this study provide insight into the open state of the T3SS needle tip. Our findings present the atomic details of the T3SS arrangement occurring at the pathogen-host interface.Introduction:Bacterial infections including Salmonellosis and Shigellosis affect millions of people every year. These bacteria use a T3SS to secrete virulence factors to manipulate host cells. The T3SS is a multi-component system that forms a continuous protein transport channel through the two bacterial membranes and the periplasmatic space that extends into the surrounding medium by a needle structure[1]–[3]. Spatiotemporal control of secretion is essential for effective host invasion[4]. Tip proteins, which bind to the distal end of the T3SS needle, are thought to play an important role in this process[4]–[6]. SipD from S. typhimurium, IpaD from Shigella flexneri and BipD from Burkholderia mallei are tip proteins that are thought to interact with their corresponding needle subunits PrgI, MxiH and BsaL, respectively, to make the needle tip complex[5]. Although the mechanism is unclear, tip proteins were shown to influence secretion and invasion of bacteria[7]–[9]. Sterols like cholesterol or cholic acid derivatives found in the bile are amphipathic compounds that play important roles in cellular communication and metabolic processes. Bile salts influence the T3SS of intestinal bacteria. For instance, the presence of deoxycholate either impedes( S. typhimurium) or facilitates( S. flexneri) host invasion[10]–[13]. Noteworthy, it was recently shown that SipD and IpaD bind deoxycholate and some of its derivatives[14],[15]. To understand how T3SS are regulated it is required to analyze the structure and mechanism of proteins gating the transport channel. Here, we address the questions of how the Salmonella SipD interacts with PrgI and deoxycholate and the mechanistic consequences of the assembly of the T3SS needle tip complex.Discussion:The cryo-EM map of isolated needles from S. flexneri which is similar to the map obtained from isolated S. typhimurium needle[31] together with the X-ray crystal structure of a needle protomer mutant can be used to build a composite 3-dimensional model[21]. Based on this composite model of the T3SS needle we manually superimposed the similarly structured regions of the PrgI-SipDΔD1 fusion protein with the MxiH subunits of the needle. Superposition of PrgI and MxiH( PDB code 2V6L) using the program Coot[32] was feasible without structural clashes. In total, five molecules of the PrgI-SipDΔD1 fusion protein were successfully superimposed with five MxiH subunits at the distal end of the T3SS needle( Figure 7). As described above, we found that PrgI binds to the concave side of the central coiled coil in SipD. Therefore, the PrgI-SipDΔD1 fusion protein could be mounted at the distal end of the needle without inducing structural changes. Domain1 present in SipD may face the bulk medium either in an unfold state or as a folded entity. In contrast to our model, the SipD-PrgI contact predicted by a previous work[9] would require substantial structural changes at the tip of the T3SS needle. The tip complex is the distal opening of the transport channel provided by the T3SS needle. According to the proposed model, SipD bound to PrgI localizes to the outer surface of the T3SS needle without obstructing the inner channel( Figure 7). The channel is opened in the three dimensional model of the T3SS tip complex( Figure 7A), adopting a state that permits transport or release of unfolded molecules after passage through the channel inside the needle. For this reason we assign the presented structure-based model as the “open state” of the T3SS needle tip. About 25 Å for the diameter of the T3SS channel may allow the passage of a single α-helix( or even of a helix-loop-helix motif). Deletion of the T3SS needle tip protein causes constitutive secretion of virulence factors but abolishes bacterial invasion[7]. Consequently, it was proposed that the needle tip protein blocks the secretion of virulence factors. In contrast to this hypothesis, our structure based model of the open state suggests that the T3SS tip complex is not necessarily blocking the T3SS channel. Moreover, the tip protein does not need to be released for secretion of virulence factors, as the SipD-PrgI interaction is not clogging the channel. We speculate that the presence of the tip protein enables intermittent closing of the T3SS system thus regulating the process of secretion. The three dimensional model presented here enables the following conclusions: The open state of the SipD-PrgI needle tip must be closed to block the constitutive transport of virulence factors. The closing of the T3SS needle tip can be mediated by either a conformational change of SipD or by its interaction with other effector proteins or lipids. Notably, the structure of the needle tip complex is not in conflict with possible movement of domain 2 and 3 in SipD but further work is required to explain how SipD regulates the secretion of T3SS. Moreover, binding of other effector proteins to the T3SS needle tip was proposed for the control of the needle length[1],[33] and the translocation of virulence factors across host membranes( SipB). Along these lines, we previously reported that the T3SS needle protein PrgI extends the needle from the distal end in the absence of tip proteins[18]. Moreover, addition of tip proteins prevented further growth of the T3SS needle[18]. It is plausible that addition of SipD avoid needle elongation. Bile salts, including deoxycholate, can prevent S. typhimurium invasion through binding to SipD[12],[15]. We showed here that deoxycholate binds to the cleft formed by SipD and PrgI close to the constriction of the T3SS channel( Figure 6 and Figure 7a). This interaction may prevent larger conformational changes in SipD, which block closure of the T3SS channel. Likewise bound deoxycholate may impede the binding of channel blocking proteins. Future studies are needed to understand how the T3SS is regulated using deoxycholate. The presented structural studies enable us to construct a three dimensional model of the Salmonella T3SS needle tip, which in turn suggests a secretion mechanism. In the open state of the T3SS needle tip a large cavity, maybe enclosed through contact with the host membrane, is formed. This cavity could act as a folding chamber to facilitate the folding of secreted proteins. Folding of early secreted translocator proteins at the host membrane could improve the delivery of other effector proteins into the host cytoplasm. A similar folding principle was identified in the molecular chaperones, including prefoldin which forms a cavity for the nascent protein chain at the exit channel of the ribosome[34]–[36]. Moreover, the T3SS channel could be closed by contact with host membranes. In this scenario, the host membrane could prevent waste of secreted virulence factors, which otherwise could diffuse away from the point of contact. The T3SS needle tip is crucial for bacterial invasion and searching for substances similar to deoxycholate that prevent functioning or even assembly of the complex could lead to the discovery of novel targets for the development of drugs against pathogenic enterobacteria.","answer":"Since the rise of pathogenic bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics , the need to develop potent anti-infective drugs is continually increasing .

HIV incidence was compared in six intervention communities and six pair-matched comparison communities. A random cohort of about 1000 adults aged 15-54 years from each community was surveyed at baseline and at follow-up 2 years later. Intervention consisted of establishment of an STD reference clinic, staff training, regular supply of drugs, regular supervisory visits to health facilities, and health education about STDs. 12,537 individuals were recruited. Baseline HIV prevalences were 3.8% and 4.4% in the intervention and comparison communities, respectively. At follow-up, 8845 (71%) of the cohort were seen. Of those initially seronegative, the proportions seroconverting over 2 years were 48 of 4149 (1.2%) in the intervention communities and 82 of 4400 (1.9%) in the comparison communities. HIV incidence was consistently lower in the intervention communities in all six matched pairs. Allowing for the community-randomised design and the effects of confounding factors, the estimated risk ratio was 0.58 (95% CI 0.42-0.79, p = 0.007). No change in reported sexual behaviour was observed in either group. We conclude that improved STD treatment reduced HIV incidence by about 40% in this rural population. This is the first randomised trial to demonstrate an impact of a preventive intervention on HIV incidence in a general population.Title 2:Control of sexually transmitted diseases for AIDS prevention in Uganda: a randomised community trial. Rakai Project Study Group.Abstract 2:The study tested the hypothesis that community-level control of sexually transmitted disease (STD) would result in lower incidence of HIV-1 infection in comparison with control communities.                This randomised, controlled, single-masked, community-based trial of intensive STD control, via home-based mass antibiotic treatment, took place in Rakai District, Uganda. Ten community clusters were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. All consenting residents aged 15-59 years were enrolled; visited in the home every 10 months; interviewed; asked to provide biological samples for assessment of HIV-1 infection and STDs; and were provided with mass treatment (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole in the intervention group, vitamins/anthelmintic drug in the control). Intention-to-treat analyses used multivariate, paired, cluster-adjusted rate ratios.                The baseline prevalence of HIV-1 infection was 15.9%. 6602 HIV-1-negative individuals were enrolled in the intervention group and 6124 in the control group. 75.0% of intervention-group and 72.6% of control-group participants provided at least one follow-up sample for HIV-1 testing. At enrolment, the two treatment groups were similar in STD prevalence rates. At 20-month follow-up, the prevalences of syphilis (352/6238 [5.6%]) vs 359/5284 [6.8%]; rate ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.71-0.89]) and trichomoniasis (182/1968 [9.3%] vs 261/1815 [14.4%]; rate ratio 0.59 [0.38-0.91]) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. The incidence of HIV-1 infection was 1.5 per 100 person-years in both groups (rate ratio 0.97 [0.81-1.16]). In pregnant women, the follow-up prevalences of trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia infection were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. No effect of the intervention on incidence of HIV-1 infection was observed in pregnant women or in stratified analyses.                We observed no effect of the STD intervention on the incidence of HIV-1 infection. In the Rakai population, a substantial proportion of HIV-1 acquisition appears to occur independently of treatable STD cofactors.Title 3:Impact and process evaluation of integrated community and clinic-based HIV-1 control: a cluster-randomised trial in eastern Zimbabwe.Abstract 3:HIV-1 control in sub-Saharan Africa requires cost-effective and sustainable programmes that promote behaviour change and reduce cofactor sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at the population and individual levels.                We measured the feasibility of community-based peer education, free condom distribution, income-generating projects, and clinic-based STI treatment and counselling services and evaluated their impact on the incidence of HIV-1 measured over a 3-y period in a cluster-randomised controlled trial in eastern Zimbabwe. Analysis of primary outcomes was on an intention-to-treat basis. The income-generating projects proved impossible to implement in the prevailing economic climate. Despite greater programme activity and knowledge in the intervention communities, the incidence rate ratio of HIV-1 was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.75) compared to the control communities. No evidence was found for reduced incidence of self-reported STI symptoms or high-risk sexual behaviour in the intervention communities. Males who attended programme meetings had lower HIV-1 incidence (incidence rate ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.98), and fewer men who attended programme meetings reported unprotected sex with casual partners (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.75). More male STI patients in the intervention communities reported cessation of symptoms (odds ratio 2.49, 95% CI 1.21-5.12).                Integrated peer education, condom distribution, and syndromic STI management did not reduce population-level HIV-1 incidence in a declining epidemic, despite reducing HIV-1 incidence in the immediate male target group. Our results highlight the need to assess the community-level impact of interventions that are effective amongst targeted population sub-groups.","answer":"We failed to confirm the hypothesis that STI control is an effective HIV prevention strategy.

There is no evidence for substantial benefit from a presumptive treatment intervention for all community members. There are, however, other compelling reasons why STI treatment services should be strengthened, and the available evidence suggests that when an intervention is accepted it can substantially improve quality of services provided."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

While many important functions have been attributed to adiponectin under high-fat diet conditions, little is known about its essential role under regular chow. Employing a mouse model with inducible, acute β-cell ablation, we uncovered an essential role of adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions to maintain minimal lipid homeostasis. When insulin levels are marginal, adiponectin is critical for insulin signaling, endocytosis, and lipid uptake in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. In the absence of both insulin and adiponectin, severe lipoatrophy and hyperlipidemia lead to lethality. In contrast, elevated adiponectin levels improve systemic lipid metabolism in the near absence of insulin. Moreover, adiponectin is sufficient to mitigate local lipotoxicity in pancreatic islets, and it promotes reconstitution of β-cell mass, eventually reinstating glycemic control. We uncovered an essential new role for adiponectin, with major implications for type 1 diabetes.Introduction:Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone exerting pleiotropic beneficial effects on metabolism( Ye and Scherer, 2013). Increased circulating adiponectin improves the metabolic flexibility of adipose tissue and confers systemic tolerance to obesity( Asterholm and Scherer, 2010). Under normal physiological conditions, adiponectin promotes plasma lipid clearance( Combs et al., 2004; Qiao et al., 2008). Paradoxically however, even though many important functions have been attributed to this circulating factor in mice and humans( Shetty et al., 2009; Turer and Scherer, 2012), adiponectin is not essential for life under normal physiological conditions. Genetic deletion of adiponectin in rodents leads to mild or moderate insulin resistance, which is exacerbated upon high-fat diet challenge( Kubota et al., 2002; Maeda et al., 2002). Adiponectin is required for PPARγ agonist-mediated improvements in insulin sensitivity( Nawrocki et al., 2006). Based on many published studies, adiponectin function under normal physiological function is dispensable, and it starts to play a more prominent role under hyperglycemic and, most importantly, dyslipidemic conditions. The failure of insulin-producing β-cells is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The ongoing loss of β-cells under these conditions is associated with a failure to effectively regenerate β-cell mass. This can be attributed not only to the low capacity for replication and differentiation( Bouwens and Rooman, 2005) but also the detrimental cytotoxic environment that the cells are exposed to due to the dysregulation of the balance between insulin and glucagon( Robertson, 2009; Unger and Cherrington, 2012). Insulin deficiency results in hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, both of which trigger β-cell glucotoxicity and oxidative stress( Poitout and Robertson, 2008), endoplasmic reticulum( ER) stress( Fonseca et al., 2009), and lipotoxicity( Kusminski et al., 2009). Tissue culture data suggested that adiponectin regulates β-cell viability( Brown et al., 2010; Holland et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2012). Recently, we demonstrated that adiponectin protects β-cells against lipotoxicity and apoptosis, both in cultured cells and in vivo( Holland et al., 2011). In this study, we took advantage of the PANIC-ATTAC transgenic mouse model( Wang et al., 2008). After extensive β-cell ablation, adiponectin becomes essential for survival. In the context of insulin deficiency, the lack of adiponetin aggravates the lipoatrophy and hyperlipidemia to lethal levels. The critical role of adiponectin in maintaining minimal lipid homeostasis is recapitulated in the streptozotocin-treated( STZ) mouse model. Specifically, adiponectin is required for lipid uptake into subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Under normal conditions, the action of adiponectin can be mediated through enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity and intracellular fatty acid translocation. However, under insulinopenic conditions, the primary adiponectin-mediated effect relies on enhanced insulin sensitivity and endocytic activity. While insulin deficiency and widespread loss of β-cells lead to augmented intracellular lipotoxicity, adiponectin overexpressing mice effectively overcome the resulting intracellular lipotoxicity in β-cells by ameliorating lipid metabolism and thereby paving the way for β-cell mass recovery. Our findings reveal a novel role of adiponectin as a housekeeping protein under insulinopenic conditions, and augmentation of adiponectin is sufficient to promote β-cell regeneration.Discussion:In this study, we uncover for the first time a pathological condition under which adiponectin is indispensable for survival. When insulin levels decrease by >90% after intensive β-cell loss, adiponectin ensures the minimal homeostasis for lipid metabolism. Consistent with insulin action promoting lipid storage in adipose tissue, adiponectin exerts a similar effect on lipid uptake, but does so by distinct mechanisms. First, adiponectin mediates lipid uptake specifically in subcutaneous WAT, but not in epididymal WAT. Hepatic VLDL secretion and fatty acid metabolism are unchanged. Second, adiponectin regulates neither lipoprotein lipase activity under insulinopenic conditions nor the intracellular translocation of fatty acids. Rather, caveolin-1 is reduced, thereby reducing endocytosis of lipids. This is in agreement with our previous reports on caveolin-1 knockout mice, which show significantly lower body weight and fat mass than wild-type controls under both regular chow and high-fat diet regimen( Razani et al., 2002; Wernstedt Asterholm et al., 2012). Moreover, our adiponectin knockout mice with insulin deficiency recapitulate the lipodystrophic phenotypes reported in caveolin-1 null mice, including impaired triglyceride clearance, hyper-triglyceridemia, adipocyte hypotrophy, without a change in lipoprotein lipase activity( Razani et al., 2002). Third, adiponectin potentiates insulin signaling and the suppression on lipolysis mediated by the trace levels of insulin present. It is tempting to speculate that adiponectin exerts autocrine/paracrine actions on subcutaneous adipose as a hormone, motivating future studies on signaling pathways and transcriptome/proteome analysis under insulinopenic conditions. The generation of mouse models allowing for conditional elimination of both adiponectin receptors adipoR1 and adipoR2 should be insightful. In cases where both insulin and adiponectin are depleted, fat mass becomes critically low, accompanied by exceedingly high triglycerides and ketone bodies in circulation, resulting in major mortality. Our findings also underscore adiponectin as a messenger for the crosstalk between adipose tissue and pancreatic β-cells, especially under insulinopenic conditions. Massive pancreatic β-cell failure leads to hypoinsulinemia and dyslipidemia( Dunn, 1992). The ensuing aggravated lipotoxicity further impairs β-cell function and survival( Lupi et al., 2002; Kusminski et al., 2009). Our findings demonstrate that adiponectin can disrupt this vicious cycle at multiple levels and, in so doing, promote potent regenerative effects on functional β-cell mass. Adiponectin improves lipid storage in adipose tissue and improves systemic lipid metabolism. These general improvements in dyslipidemia may contribute, at least in part, to the reduction of β-cell lipotoxicity in the adiponectin overexpressing mouse, as reflected by ceramide measurements. The reduced level of local lipotoxicity may mediate β-cell survival and proliferation. Overexpression of adiponectin is sufficient to regenerate β-cells and regain glycemic control. Taken together, our data highlight the link between lipid metabolism and β-cell maintenance and identify adiponectin as a key mediator of this process. This does not exclude a direct effect of adiponectin on β-cells, since adiponectin is avidly binding to β-cells in vivo and exerts potent cytoprotective effects on β-cells under these conditions( Holland et al., 2011). The major impediments for effective β-cell regeneration may not only relate to the inherently low proliferation rate of β-cells, but also due to the systemic highly lipotoxic environment due to severe hyperlipidemia, both in type 1 diabetes as well as late stage type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments have provided strong evidence that lipotoxicity can impair β-cell function and survival( Maedler et al., 2001; Rakatzi et al., 2004; Hoppa et al., 2009; Holland et al., 2011). Unger and colleagues demonstrated in rats that pancreatic islets transplanted into the hepatic portal area were destroyed by the local hyperlipidemic environment( Lee et al., 2007) and islets from Zucker diabetic fatty( ZDF) rats are subject to lipotoxic destruction via ceramide( Shimabukuro et al., 1998). Poitout and colleagues have established that wild-type islets similarly develop ceramide-induced impairments in islet function under hyperlipidemic/hyperglycemic conditions( Kelpe et al., 2003). In the PANIC-ATTAC model, the prolonged β-cell loss in adiponectin wild-type and adiponectin null mice is unlikely due to prolonged exposure to dimerizer, which has a half-life in mice of ∼5 hr. Rather, this is the result of glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and/or ER stress. In the PANIC-ATTAC islets, we did not detect any differences in oxidative stress and ER stress markers between adiponectin wild-type and transgenic adiponectin overexpressing mice( data not shown). However, we did see differences at the level of lipotoxic intermediates as judged by the results from the islet ceramide assays that revealed a reduction of lipotoxic ceramides as well as their precursors and derivatives. Ultimately, this improved microenvironment allows for increased recovery of islet mass.","answer":"Fat tissue is essential for health . Fat cells store energy and release it when it is needed; they also release hormones that are important for the health of our heart and for regulating our metabolism . One of these hormones , adiponectin , helps cells to remove fat molecules from the bloodstream . This allows the body to maintain appropriate cholesterol levels and prevents fatty build-ups from blocking blood vessels , which is associated with heart disease . Adiponectin also helps cells respond to insulin , a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels , and thus helps to prevent diabetes . Despite this hormone's important roles in health , mice that lack adiponectin can thrive under normal conditions . Adiponectin becomes essential , however , when blood sugar or fat levels are considerably altered . For example , when mice without adiponectin are fed a high fat-content diet , they become insulin-resistant . Moreover , certain diabetes drugs that boost insulin sensitivity only work if adiponectin is present in the body . Adiponectin helps to keep the β-cells that produce insulin alive . In patients with diabetes , β-cells slowly die , and this leads to a poor insulin response and an imbalance in the amount of fats and sugars in the cells . This is toxic to the β-cells; and as more β-cells die , less insulin is produced to control sugar levels , and the condition worsens . Adiponectin appears to protect the β-cells against this vicious cycle , but the details of how it does so are unclear . Ye et al . used a mouse model in which β-cells were destroyed to see what adiponectin does when insulin is in short supply . When insulin levels were extremely low , adiponectin was found to help one type of fat tissue absorb fat molecules from the bloodstream , which reduced blood cholesterol levels . It also protects fat cells from being destroyed when insulin levels are low . Ye et al . also found that mice that lack both insulin and adiponectin lose excessive amounts of fat tissue and develop high blood cholesterol levels , which lead to death . Increasing adiponectin levels in insulin-deficient mice , however , improves their blood cholesterol levels and protects β-cells from being destroyed . This allows the β-cells to begin regenerating . As the β-cells regenerate , the insulin-deficient mice developed better control over their blood sugar . Many people with type-1 diabetes ( which is caused by their own immune system destroying their β-cells ) currently rely on insulin injections and restricted diets to manage their condition . Ye et al . 's findings might lead to new strategies to restore β-cell production and blood sugar control; as such these findings will have important implications for the management of type-1 diabetes ."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:Deep neural networks (DNNs) typically have enough capacity to fit random data by brute force even when conventional data-dependent regularizations focusing on the geometry of the features are imposed.We find out that the reason for this is the inconsistency between the enforced geometry and the standard softmax cross entropy loss.To resolve this, we propose a new framework for data-dependent DNN regularization, the Geometrically-Regularized-Self-Validating neural Networks (GRSVNet).During training, the geometry enforced on one batch of features is simultaneously validated on a separate batch using a validation loss consistent with the geometry.We study  a particular case of GRSVNet, the Orthogonal-Low-rank Embedding (OLE)-GRSVNet, which is capable of producing highly discriminative features residing in orthogonal low-rank subspaces.Numerical experiments show that OLE-GRSVNet outperforms DNNs with conventional regularization when trained on real data.More importantly, unlike conventional DNNs, OLE-GRSVNet refuses to memorize random data or random labels, suggesting it only learns intrinsic patterns by reducing the memorizing capacity of the baseline DNN.It remains an open question why DNNs, typically with far more model parameters than training samples, can achieve such small generalization error.Previous work used various complexity measures from statistical learning theory, such as VC dimension (Vapnik, 1998) , Radamacher complexity BID1 , and uniform stability BID2 BID10 , to provide an upper bound for the generalization error, suggesting that the effective capacity of DNNs, possibly with some regularization techniques, is usually limited.However, the experiments by Zhang et al. (2017) showed that, even with data-independent regularization, DNNs can perfectly fit the training data when the true labels are replaced by random labels, or when the training data are replaced by Gaussian noise.This suggests that DNNs with data-independent regularization have enough capacity to \\"memorize\\" the training data.This poses an interesting question for network regularization design: is there a way for DNNs to refuse to (over)fit training samples with random labels, while exhibiting better generalization power than conventional DNNs when trained with true labels?Such networks are very important because they will extract only intrinsic patterns from the training data instead of memorizing miscellaneous details.One would expect that data-dependent regularizations should be a better choice for reducing the memorizing capacity of DNNs.Such regularizations are typically enforced by penalizing the standard softmax cross entropy loss with an extra geometric loss which regularizes the feature geometry BID8 Zhu et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2016) .However, regularizing DNNs with an extra geometric loss has two disadvantages: First, the output of the softmax layer, usually viewed as a probability distribution, is typically inconsistent with the feature geometry enforced by the geometric loss.Therefore, the geometric loss typically has a small weight to avoid jeopardizing the minimization of the softmax loss.Second, we find that DNNs with such regularization can still perfectly (over)fit random training samples or random labels.The reason is that the geometric loss (because of its small weight) is ignored and only the softmax loss is minimized.This suggests that simply penalizing the softmax loss with a geometric loss is not sufficient to regularize DNNs.Instead, the softmax loss should be replaced by a validation loss that is consistent with the enforced geometry.More specifically, every training batch B is split into two sub-batches, the geometry batch B g and the validation batch B v .The geometric loss l g is imposed on the features of B g for them to exhibit a desired geometric structure.A semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the proposed feature geometry is then used to generate a predicted label distribution for the validation batch, which combined with the true labels defines a validation loss on B v .The total loss on the training batch B is then defined as the weighted sum l = l g + λl v .Because the predicted label distribution on B v is based on the enforced geometry, the geometric loss l g can no longer be neglected.Therefore, l g and l v will be minimized simultaneously, i.e., the geometry is correctly enforced (small l g ) and it can be used to predict validation samples (small l v ).We call such DNNs Geometrically-Regularized-Self-Validating neural Networks (GRSVNets).See FIG0 for a visual illustration of the network architecture.GRSVNet is a general architecture because every consistent geometry/validation pair can fit into this framework as long as the loss functions are differentiable.In this paper, we focus on a particular type of GRSVNet, the Orthogonal-Low-rank-Embedding-GRSVNet (OLE-GRSVNet).More specifically, we impose the OLE loss (Qiu & Sapiro, 2015) on the geometry batch to produce features residing in orthogonal subspaces, and we use the principal angles between the validation features and those subspaces to define a predicted label distribution on the validation batch.We prove that the loss function obtains its minimum if and only if the subspaces of different classes spanned by the features in the geometry batch are orthogonal, and the features in the validation batch reside perfectly in the subspaces corresponding to their labels (see FIG0 ).We show in our experiments that OLE-GRSVNet has better generalization performance when trained on real data, but it refuses to memorize the training samples when given random training data or random labels, which suggests that OLE-GRSVNet effectively learns intrinsic patterns.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:• We proposed a general framework, GRSVNet, to effectively impose data-dependent DNN regularization.The core idea is the self-validation of the enforced geometry with a consistent validation loss on a separate batch of features.•We study a particular case of GRSVNet, OLE-GRSVNet, that can produce highly discriminative features: samples from the same class belong to a low-rank subspace, and the subspaces for different classes are orthogonal.•OLE-GRSVNet achieves better generalization performance when compared to DNNs with conventional regularizers. Andmore importantly, unlike conventional DNNs, OLEGRSVNet refuses to fit the training data (i.e., with a training error close to random guess) when the training data or the training labels are randomly generated. Thisimplies that OLE-GRSVNet never memorizes the training samples, only learns intrinsic patterns.We proposed a general framework, GRSVNet, for data-dependent DNN regularization.The core idea is the self-validation of the enforced geometry on a separate batch using a validation loss consistent with the geometric loss, so that the predicted label distribution has a meaningful geometric interpretation.In particular, we study a special case of GRSVNet, OLE-GRSVNet, which is capable of producing highly discriminative features: samples from the same class belong to a low-rank subspace, and the subspaces for different classes are orthogonal.When trained on benchmark datasets with real labels, OLE-GRSVNet achieves better test accuracy when compared to DNNs with different regularizations sharing the same baseline architecture.More importantly, unlike conventional DNNs, OLE-GRSVNet refuses to memorize and overfit the training data when trained on random labels or random data.This suggests that OLE-GRSVNet effectively reduces the memorizing capacity of DNNs, and it only extracts intrinsically learnable patterns from the data.Although we provided some intuitive explanation as to why GRSVNet generalizes well on real data and refuses overfitting random data, there are still open questions to be answered.For example, what is the minimum representational capacity of the baseline DNN (i.e., number of layers and number of units) to make even GRSVNet trainable on random data?Or is it because of the learning algorithm (SGD) that prevents GRSVNet from learning a decision boundary that is too complicated for random samples?Moreover, we still have not answered why conventional DNNs, while fully capable of memorizing random data by brute force, typically find generalizable solutions on real data.These questions will be the focus of our future work.It suffices to prove the case when K = 2, as the case for larger K can be proved by induction.In order to simplify the notation, we restate the original theorem for K = 2:Theorem.Let A ∈ R N ×m and B ∈ R N ×n be matrices of the same row dimensions, and [A, B] ∈ R N ×(m+n) be the concatenation of A and B.

This combined with the last equation in FORMULA2 implies DISPLAYFORM11 APPENDIX B PROOF OF THEOREM 2Proof.First, l is defined in equation FORMULA8 as DISPLAYFORM12 The nonnegativity of l g (Z g ) is guaranteed by Theorem1. The validation loss l v (Y v ,Ŷ v ) is also nonnegative since it is the average (over the validation batch) of the cross entropy losses: DISPLAYFORM13 Therefore l = l g + λl v is also nonnegative.Next, for a given λ > 0, l(X, Y) obtains its minimum value zero if and only if both l g (Z g ) and l v (Y v ,Ŷ v ) are zeros.•By Theorem 1, l g (Z g ) = 0 if and only if span(Z g c )⊥ span(Z g c ), ∀c = c .•According to (19), l v (Y v ,Ŷ v ) = 0 if and only ifŷ(x) = δ y , ∀x ∈ X v , i.e., for every x ∈ X v c , its feature z = Φ(x; θ) belongs to span(Z g c ).Atlast, we want to prove that if λ > 0, and X v contains at least one sample for each class, then rank(span(Z g c )) ≥ 1 for any c ∈ {1, . . . , K}. Ifnot, then there exists c ∈ {1, . . . , K} such that rank(span(Z g c )) =0. Let x ∈ X v be a validation datum belonging to class y = c. Thepredicted probability of x belonging to class c is defined in (3): DISPLAYFORM14 Thus we have DISPLAYFORM15","answer":"we propose a new framework for data-dependent DNN regularization that can prevent DNNs from overfitting random data or random labels."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate pain from within the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG). In the present study, the postsynaptic mGlu receptor mediated effects on rat PAG neurons were examined using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices. The selective group I agonist DHPG (10 μM) produced an inward current in all PAG neurons tested which was associated with a near parallel shift in the current-voltage relationship. By contrast, the group II and III mGlu receptor agonists DCG-IV (1 μM) and l-AP4 (3 μM) produced an outward current in only 10-20% of PAG neurons tested. The DHPG induced current was concentration dependent (EC(50) = 1.4 μM), was reduced by the mGlu1 antagonist CPCCOEt (100 μM), and was further reduced by CPCCOEt in combination with the mGlu5 antagonist MPEP (10 μM). The glutamate transport blocker TBOA (30 μM) also produced an inward current, however, this was largely abolished by CNQX (10 μM) plus AP5 (25 μM). Slow EPSCs were evoked following train, but not single shock stimulation, which were enhanced by TBOA (30 μM). The TBOA enhancement of slow EPSCs was abolished by MPEP plus CPCCOEt. These findings indicate that endogenously released glutamate, under conditions in which neurotransmitter spill-over is enhanced, activates group I mGlu receptors to produce excitatory currents within PAG. Thus, postsynaptic group I mGlu receptors have the potential to directly modulate the analgesic, behavioural and autonomic functions of the PAG.

During a 10-d period , seventy normal-weight ( BMI < 25 kg/m2 ) and seventy-one obese women ( BMI ≥30 kg/m2 ) were given three meals per d under ad libitum conditions . Participants were r and omly assigned to one of three experimental labelling groups in which the only difference was the label posted on lunch meal entrée : ( 1 ) low-fat label , ( 2 ) energy label ( energy content of the entrée and average daily needs ) and ( 3 ) no label ( control ) . Average energy intake was calculated by weighing all foods before v. after daily consumption . Hunger and fullness perceptions were rated on visual analogue scales immediately before and after each meal . Satiety efficiency was assessed through the calculation of the satiety quotient ( SQ ) . The appreciation and perceived healthiness of the lunch entrées were rated on eight-point Likert scales . There was no difference in energy intake , SQ and attitudes towards food between the three labelling groups . Fasting hunger perception was higher in the low-fat label group compared with the two others groups ( P=0·0037 ) . No interactions between labelling groups and BMI categories were observed . In conclusion , although labelling does not seem to influence energy intake , a low-fat label may increase women 's fasting hunger perceptions compared with an energy label or no labelTitle 2:The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trialsAbstract 2:Flaws in the design , conduct , analysis , and reporting of r and omised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated . The Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and moreTitle 3:The Smart Choices front-of-package nutrition label. Influence on perceptions and intake of cerealAbstract 3:Numerous front-of-package ( FOP ) nutrition labeling systems exist , but it is unclear if such labels influence behavior . A single- summary label called Smart Choices ( SC ) appeared briefly on products in the United States in 2009 . The current study aim ed to evaluate ( 1 ) the influence the SC symbol has on the serving and consumption of cereal ; and ( 2 ) the impact of providing calorie and serving size information on a FOP label . Two hundred and sixteen adults were r and omized to a high-sugar breakfast cereal  that had either ( 1 ) no label ; ( 2 ) the SC symbol ; or ( 3 ) a modified SC symbol with serving size information . Participants rated perceptions of healthfulness , taste , and purchase intent , estimated calories per serving and poured and ate the cereal for breakfast . Participants in the SC label conditions were better able to estimate calories per serving , but there were no differences across groups on perceptions of healthfulness , taste , purchase intent , and levels of vitamins , and sugar or amount of cereal poured or consumed . These results suggest that calories per serving information on FOP labels can increase knowledge , but the SC symbol had little impact on behavior . Studies examining FOP label influence on purchasing , consumption , and product reformulation are greatly needed to determine label utilityTitle 4:Eat fit. Get big? How fitness cues influence food consumption volumesAbstract 4:Fitness cues on food packages are a common marketing practice in the food sector . This study aims to find out whether and how fitness cues influence food consumption . The results of two field studies show that , even though eating fitness-cued food does not help consumers become more fit , the cl aims on the packaging increase both serving size and actual food consumption . This effect is mediated by serving size inferences . Also , consumers feel less guilty and perceive themselves closer to desired fitness levels after having consumed the food . The findings show that packaging cues relating to energy expenditure can increase energy intake despite the fact that consumers are not engaged in any actual physical activity while eating the foodTitle 5:Consumers' willingness to pay for nutritional claims fighting the obesity epidemic: the case of reduced-fat and low salt cheese in Spain.Abstract 5:OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate  consumers ' willingness to pay ( WTP ) for cheeses bearing reduced-fat and low salt  cl aims in Spain . STUDY DESIGN An experiment with 219 cheese consumers was conducted in the period March-May 2015 . We used different versions of cheese bearing reduced-fat and low salt cl aims . METHODS A choice experiment was used to estimate WTP for reduced-fat and /or low salt cheeses . Participants faced eight choice sets , each consisting of two packages of cheese with different combinations of two cl aims . Individuals chose one of the two packages of cheese in each choice set , or decided not to choose either . Moreover , to consider possible heterogeneity in WTP across consumers , a r and om parameters logit model ( RPL ) , a Chi-squared test , and analysis of variance tests were used . RESULTS Spanish cheese consumers were willing to pay a positive premium for  packages of cheese with reduced-fat cl aims ( € 0.538/100 g ) , and for cheese with reduced-fat and low salt cl aims ( € 1.15/100 g ) . Conversely , consumers valued low-salt content cl aims negatively . They preferred to pay € 0.38/100 g for a conventional cheese rather than one low in salt content . As there was heterogeneity in consumers ' WTP , two different consumer segments were identified . Segment 1 consisted of normal weight and younger consumers with higher incomes and levels of education , who valued low salt cheese more negatively than those individuals in Segment 2 , predominantly comprising overweight and older consumers with low income and educational level . This means that individuals in Segment 1 would pay more for conventional cheese ( € 1/100 g ) than those in Segment 2 ( € 0.50/100 g ) . However , no difference between the two segments was found in WTP for reduced-fat cheese . CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that consumers are willing to pay a price premium for a package of cheese with a reduced-fat cl aim or cheese with reduced-fat and low salt cl aims appearing together ; however , they are not willing to pay for a package of cheese with only a low salt cl aim . In comparison with overweight people , normal weight consumers would prefer to pay more for conventional cheese than low salt cheese . Finally , the results of this study contribute to insights in the promotion of healthier food choices among consumers . In this regard , outreach activities promoted by food companies could drive consumers to increase their knowledge of the benefits of eating reduced-fat and low salt food products in relation to their health status","answer":"Conclusion Health-related cl aims have a substantial effect on dietary choices .However , this finding is based on research mostly conducted in artificial setting s.

We further introduce WPSLOR, a novel WordPiece-based version, which harnesses a more compact language model. Even though word-overlap metrics like ROUGE are computed with the help of hand-written references, our referenceless methods obtain a significantly higher correlation with human fluency scores on a benchmark dataset of compressed sentences. Finally, we present ROUGE-LM, a reference-based metric which is a natural extension of WPSLOR to the case of available references. We show that ROUGE-LM yields a significantly higher correlation with human judgments than all baseline metrics, including WPSLOR on its own.On AcceptabilityAcceptability judgments, i.e., speakers' judgments of the well-formedness of sentences, have been the basis of much linguistics research BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 : a speakers intuition about a sentence is used to draw conclusions about a language's rules. Commonly, “acceptability” is used synonymously with “grammaticality”, and speakers are in practice asked for grammaticality judgments or acceptability judgments interchangeably. Strictly speaking, however, a sentence can be unacceptable, even though it is grammatical – a popular example is Chomsky's phrase “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.” BIBREF3 In turn, acceptable sentences can be ungrammatical, e.g., in an informal context or in poems BIBREF12 .Scientists—linguists, cognitive scientists, psychologists, and NLP researcher alike—disagree about how to represent human linguistic abilities. One subject of debates are acceptability judgments: while, for many, acceptability is a binary condition on membership in a set of well-formed sentences BIBREF3 , others assume that it is gradient in nature BIBREF13 , BIBREF2 . Tackling this research question, lau2017grammaticality aimed at modeling human acceptability judgments automatically, with the goal to gain insight into the nature of human perception of acceptability. In particular, they tried to answer the question: Do humans judge acceptability on a gradient scale? Their experiments showed a strong correlation between human judgments and normalized sentence log-probabilities under a variety of LMs for artificial data they had created by translating and back-translating sentences with neural models. While they tried different types of LMs, best results were obtained for neural models, namely recurrent neural networks (RNNs).In this work, we investigate if approaches which have proven successful for modeling acceptability can be applied to the NLP problem of automatic fluency evaluation.MethodIn this section, we first describe SLOR and the intuition behind this score. Then, we introduce WordPieces, before explaining how we combine the two.SLORSLOR assigns to a sentence S a score which consists of its log-probability under a given LM, normalized by unigram log-probability and length: text{SLOR}(S) = &frac{1}{|S|} (ln (p_M(S)) nonumber &- ln (p_u(S)))   (Eq. 8)  where p_M(S) is the probability assigned to the sentence under the LM. The unigram probability p_u(S) of the sentence is calculated as p_u(S) = prod _{t in S}p(t)   (Eq. 9) with p(t) being the unconditional probability of a token t , i.e., given no context.The intuition behind subtracting unigram log-probabilities is that a token which is rare on its own (in contrast to being rare at a given position in the sentence) should not bring down the sentence's rating. The normalization by sentence length is necessary in order to not prefer shorter sentences over equally fluent longer ones. Consider, for instance, the following pair of sentences: textrm {(i)} ~ ~ &textrm {He is a citizen of France.}nonumber textrm {(ii)} ~ ~ &textrm {He is a citizen of Tuvalu.}nonumber    (Eq. 11)  Given that both sentences are of equal length and assuming that France appears more often in a given LM training set than Tuvalu, the length-normalized log-probability of sentence (i) under the LM would most likely be higher than that of sentence (ii). However, since both sentences are equally fluent, we expect taking each token's unigram probability into account to lead to a more suitable score for our purposes.We calculate the probability of a sentence with a long-short term memory (LSTM, hochreiter1997long) LM, i.e., a special type of RNN LM, which has been trained on a large corpus. More details on LSTM LMs can be found, e.g., in sundermeyer2012lstm. The unigram probabilities for SLOR are estimated using the same corpus.WordPiecesSub-word units like WordPieces BIBREF9 are getting increasingly important in NLP. They constitute a compromise between characters and words: On the one hand, they yield a smaller vocabulary, which reduces model size and training time, and improve handling of rare words, since those are partitioned into more frequent segments. On the other hand, they contain more information than characters.WordPiece models are estimated using a data-driven approach which maximizes the LM likelihood of the training corpus as described in wu2016google and 6289079.DatasetWe experiment on the compression dataset by toutanova2016dataset. It contains single sentences and two-sentence paragraphs from the Open American National Corpus (OANC), which belong to 4 genres: newswire, letters, journal, and non-fiction. Gold references are manually created and the outputs of 4 compression systems (ILP (extractive), NAMAS (abstractive), SEQ2SEQ (extractive), and T3 (abstractive); cf. toutanova2016dataset for details) for the test data are provided. Each example has 3 to 5 independent human ratings for content and fluency. We are interested in the latter, which is rated on an ordinal scale from 1 (disfluent) through 3 (fluent). We experiment on the 2955 system outputs for the test split.Average fluency scores per system are shown in Table 2 . As can be seen, ILP produces the best output. In contrast, NAMAS is the worst system for fluency. In order to be able to judge the reliability of the human annotations, we follow the procedure suggested by TACL732 and used by toutanova2016dataset, and compute the quadratic weighted kappa  BIBREF14 for the human fluency scores of the system-generated compressions as 0.337 .LM Hyperparameters and TrainingWe train our LSTM LMs on the English Gigaword corpus BIBREF15 , which consists of news data.The hyperparameters of all LMs are tuned using perplexity on a held-out part of Gigaword, since we expect LM perplexity and final evaluation performance of WordSLOR and, respectively, WPSLOR to correlate. Our best networks consist of two layers with 512 hidden units each, and are trained for 2,000,000 steps with a minibatch size of 128. For optimization, we employ ADAM BIBREF16 .Baseline MetricsOur first baseline is ROUGE-L BIBREF1 , since it is the most commonly used metric for compression tasks. ROUGE-L measures the similarity of two sentences based on their longest common subsequence. Generated and reference compressions are tokenized and lowercased. For multiple references, we only make use of the one with the highest score for each example.We compare to the best n-gram-overlap metrics from toutanova2016dataset; combinations of linguistic units (bi-grams (LR2) and tri-grams (LR3)) and scoring measures (recall (R) and F-score (F)). With multiple references, we consider the union of the sets of n-grams. Again, generated and reference compressions are tokenized and lowercased.We further compare to the negative LM cross-entropy, i.e., the log-probability which is only normalized by sentence length. The score of a sentence S is calculated as text{NCE}(S) = tfrac{1}{|S|} ln (p_M(S))   (Eq. 22) with p_M(S) being the probability assigned to the sentence by a LM. We employ the same LMs as for SLOR, i.e., LMs trained on words (WordNCE) and WordPieces (WPNCE).Our next baseline is perplexity, which corresponds to the exponentiated cross-entropy: text{PPL}(S) = exp (-text{NCE}(S))   (Eq. 24) Due to its popularity, we also performed initial experiments with BLEU BIBREF17 . Its correlation with human scores was so low that we do not consider it in our final experiments.Analysis I: Fluency Evaluation per Compression SystemThe results per compression system (cf. Table 4 ) look different from the correlations in Table 3 : Pearson and MSE are both lower. This is due to the outputs of each given system being of comparable quality. Therefore, the datapoints are similar and, thus, easier to fit for the linear function used for MSE. Pearson, in contrast, is lower due to its invariance to linear transformations of both variables. Note that this effect is smallest for ILP, which has uniformly distributed targets ( text{Var}(Y) = 0.35 vs. text{Var}(Y) = 0.17 for SEQ2SEQ).Comparing the metrics, the two SLOR approaches perform best for SEQ2SEQ and T3. In particular, they outperform the best word-overlap metric baseline by 0.244 and 0.097 Pearson correlation as well as 0.012 and 0.012 MSE, respectively. Since T3 is an abstractive system, we can conclude that WordSLOR and WPSLOR are applicable even for systems that are not limited to make use of a fixed repertoire of words.For ILP and NAMAS, word-overlap metrics obtain best results. The differences in performance, however, are with a maximum difference of 0.072 for Pearson and ILP much smaller than for SEQ2SEQ. Thus, while the differences are significant, word-overlap metrics do not outperform our SLOR approaches by a wide margin. Recall, additionally, that word-overlap metrics rely on references being available, while our proposed approaches do not require this.Incorporation of Given ReferencesROUGE was shown to correlate well with ratings of a generated text's content or meaning at the sentence level BIBREF2 . We further expect content and fluency ratings to be correlated. In fact, sometimes it is difficult to distinguish which one is problematic: to illustrate this, we show some extreme examples—compressions which got the highest fluency rating and the lowest possible content rating by at least one rater, but the lowest fluency score and the highest content score by another—in Table 6 . We, thus, hypothesize that ROUGE should contain information about fluency which is complementary to SLOR, and want to make use of references for fluency evaluation, if available. In this section, we experiment with two reference-based metrics – one trainable one, and one that can be used without fluency annotations, i.e., in the same settings as pure word-overlap metrics.Experimental SetupFirst, we assume a setting in which we have the following available: (i) system outputs whose fluency is to be evaluated, (ii) reference generations for evaluating system outputs, (iii) a small set of system outputs with references, which has been annotated for fluency by human raters, and (iv) a large unlabeled corpus for training a LM. Note that available fluency annotations are often uncommon in real-world scenarios; the reason we use them is that they allow for a proof of concept. In this setting, we train scikit's BIBREF18 support vector regression model (SVR) with the default parameters on predicting fluency, given WPSLOR and ROUGE-L-mult. We use 500 of our total 2955 examples for each of training and development, and the remaining 1955 for testing.Second, we simulate a setting in which we have only access to (i) system outputs which should be evaluated on fluency, (ii) reference compressions, and (iii) large amounts of unlabeled text. In particular, we assume to not have fluency ratings for system outputs, which makes training a regression model impossible. Note that this is the standard setting in which word-overlap metrics are applied. Under these conditions, we propose to normalize both given scores by mean and variance, and to simply add them up. We call this new reference-based metric ROUGE-LM. In order to make this second experiment comparable to the SVR-based one, we use the same 1955 test examples.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Sebastian Ebert and Samuel Bowman for their detailed and helpful feedback.Table 1: Example compressions from our dataset with their fluency scores; scores in [1, 3], higher is better.Question: what language models do they use?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"LSTM LMs\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"We calculate the probability of a sentence with a long-short term memory (LSTM, hochreiter1997long) LM, i.e., a special type of RNN LM, which has been trained on a large corpus.

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:OCR is inevitably linked to NLP since its final output is in text.Advances in document intelligence are driving the need for a unified technology that integrates OCR with various NLP tasks, especially semantic parsing.Since OCR and semantic parsing have been studied as separate tasks so far, the datasets for each task on their own are rich, while those for the integrated post-OCR parsing tasks are relatively insufficient.In this study, we publish a consolidated dataset for receipt parsing as the first step towards post-OCR parsing tasks.The dataset consists of thousands of Indonesian receipts, which contains images and box/text annotations for OCR, and multi-level semantic labels for parsing.The proposed dataset can be used to address various OCR and parsing tasks.Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technique for converting images of characters into digitized texts [1, 2] .Recently, deep learning in computer vision domain has significantly improved the performances of OCR [3, 4] .Nonetheless, there is still huge room for improvement, especially concerning the tasks simultaneously linked to natural language processing (NLP) as well.In particular, post-OCR parsing is currently one of the most important, yet challenging problems in both OCR and NLP community.The goal of post-OCR parsing is to predict pre-defined semantic labels from the given OCR.Researchers from both domains have long tried to tackle the problem and collected a significant amount of data sets independently.However, since it is a specialized task, the datasets contain critical limitations to provide proper supervision.The OCR datasets typically do not have parsing class labels for the extracted texts.The parsing datasets usually contain error-free and well-ordered digitized texts in contrast to the erroneous outcomes from OCR process.We can add synthetic noise to the parsing data, but the distribution and error patterns could be different from the OCR errors, which would inevitably lead to the degradation of generalization performance.Over the past few years, a few post-OCR parsing datasets have been made public through post OCR challenges [5] .For example, ICDAR 2019 Post-OCR Challenge introduced the Scanned Receipts OCR and Information Extraction (SROIE) dataset [6] .It provides receipt images of texts and two types of annotations for OCR and parsing problem: (1) box-level text annotations for OCR, and (2) document-level parse annotations for parsing.Although the availability of both OCR and parsing information have given rise to active research within the field, it still possesses some shortcomings, e.g., limited data size and lack of box-level parsing annotations.Considering that only hundreds of samples are provided in the SROIE dataset, weak document-level annotations could not provide enough supervision for training a model with satisfactory performance.In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset called CORD, which stands for a Consolidated Receipt Dataset for post-OCR parsing.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset which includes both box-level text and parsing class annotations.The parsing class labels are provided in two-levels.The eight superclasses include store, payment, menu, subtotal, and total.The eight superclasses are subdivided into 54 subclasses e.g., store has nine subclasses including name, address, telephone, and fax.Furthermore, it also provides line annotations for the serialization task which is a newly emerging problem as a combination of the two tasks.Current semantic parsing techniques can handle only well-ordered texts.Texts obtained by OCR, however, are in two-dimensional space, thus we need an appropriate serialization technique for mapping obtained texts into one-dimensional space.In our experiments, serialization has a significant impact on parsing performance.To recapitulate briefly, the key contributions of our paper are as follows:• We introduce a novel and large-scale receipt dataset that can be used for OCR and parsing tasks, from task-specific to end-to-end.• Our dataset provides multi-level labels for weakly and strongly supervised parsing tasks.The dataset and descriptions will be available on https://github.com/clovaai/cord at the time of publication.2 Data Acquisition","answer":"We introduce a large-scale receipt dataset for post-OCR parsing tasks."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Decrease the number of input channels to 3x3 filters.Consider a convolution layer that is comprised entirely of 3x3 filters.The total quantity of parameters in this layer is (number of input channels) * (number of filters) * (3*3).So, to maintain a small total number of parameters in a CNN, it is important not only to decrease the number of 3x3 filters (see Strategy 1 above), but also to decrease the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters.We decrease the number of input channels to 3x3 filters using squeeze layers, which we describe in the next section.  We define the Fire module as follows.A Fire module is comprised of: a squeeze convolution layer (which has only 1x1 filters), feeding into an expand layer that has a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 convolution filters; we illustrate this in Figure 1.The liberal use of 1x1 filters in Fire modules is an application of Strategy 1 from Section 3.1.We expose three tunable dimensions (hyperparameters) in a Fire module: s_{1x1}, e_{1x1}, and e_{3x3}.In a Fire module, s_{1x1} is the number of filters in the squeeze layer (all 1x1), e_{1x1} is the number of 1x1 filters in the expand layer, and e_{3x3} is the number of 3x3 filters in the expand layer.When we use Fire modules we set s_{1x1} to be less than (e_{1x1} + e_{3x3}), so the squeeze layer helps to limit the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters, as per Strategy 2 from Section 3.1.Question: Why did the authors use a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 filters in the expand layer of fire module?","answer":"Authors used a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 filters in the expand layer of the fire module to reduce the number of parameters while still getting benefits from the desired properties of having reasonable scope of the input receptive field and extracting correlations and useful information by applying the 3*3 filters of the CNN. To have a small number of parameters in a CNN, we need to decrease the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters and here comes the role of 1*1 filters, while the 3x3 filters are used to capture larger spatial features (Assuming only 3*3 and 1*1 kernels). This way, the model get its wide fame of achieving a high level of accuracy with fewer parameters than other networks."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Potentiation occurs with ganglionic peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs. Medication such as digitalis may also influence serum electrolytes. Warning signs, irrespective of cause, are: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Higher dosage of oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during chlorthalidone administration. Chlorthalidone and related drugs may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. Chlorthalidone and related drugs may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"Insulin\\", \\"Chlorthalidone\\", \\"tubocurarine\\", \\"chlorthalidone\\", \\"norepinephrine\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"hypoglycemic agents\\", \\"ganglionic peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs\\", \\"digitalis\\", \\"antihypertensive drugs\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Haven and van Santen treated the case of a sodium-chloride lattice containing divalent impurities and sodium-ion vacancies. They gave complete solutions for all modes for the relaxation involving only nearest-neighbor positions, and also considered several special cases when next-nearest-neighbor positions were allowed as well. Previously, Lidiard [3] had solved, without restrictions, for the electrically active relaxation involving next-nearest-neighbor positions, but had not distinguished the two distinct modes present in his solutions. Dreyfus [4] showed that Lidiard's solution was indeed equivalent to two electrically active modes. Haven and van Satnen had also obtained two electrically active relaxation modes.</p><p>The group theory methods can in fact be very readily extended to include any number of additional sets of neighbors. The problem of the undriven relaxation can be expressed mathematically in matrix form [2]:(ddtI+C)p→=0(1)where I is the identity matrix; C is a matrix in which the element in the ith row and jth column is the negative probability per unit time of a jump from the jth into the ith site, and in which the ith diagonal element is the sum of all jump probabilities out of the ith site; and p→ is the vector whose ith component is the probability of occupation of the ith site by the point-defect. The eigenvectors of C in the space of p→ are then the relaxation modes.</p><p>Since by definition the various sets are not carried into each other by the point-group operations of the crystal, they correspond to independent, orthogonal subspaces of the vector space defined by the occupation probability of the allowed sites. Hence the relaxation modes corresponding to the various appropriate irreducible representations of the point group can be found separately for each set, and then combined in a simple fashion. The relaxation modes for the whole system, involving all allowed sites, will be just linear combinations of the modes for the several sets, combining together only modes belonging to the same irreducible representation and arising, as partners, from the same symmetry-basis functions as discussed by Bethe [5].</p><p>Use of standard matrix algebra methods [6] allows the problem to be solved. A real, orthogonal transformation matrix may be formed from the uncombined relaxation modes as columns. This matrix transforms C to reduced form, from which the eigenvalues and the coefficients in the linear combinations of uncombined relaxation modes that constitute the eigenvectors may be calculated. The eigenvalues are just the reciprocal relaxation times. One eigenvalue is always zero, corresponding to the equilibrium distribution of the defects. If the corresponding normalized eigenvector is u→1 and the other normalized eigenvectors are denoted by u→i, then the solutions to eq (1) can be writtenp→=[u→1+∑i=2Nfiu→i](∑ku1k)−1fi=fi0exp[−λit]where the fi0 are determined by the initial distribution, the u1k are the components of u→1, and the λi are the eigenvalues, and N is the total number of sites available.</p><p>Application of this technique to the problem of the motion of a sodium-ion vacancy trapped near a divalent impurity ion in the sodium-chloride lattice, and allowing jumps among nearest and next-nearest neighbors as well as interchange between the impurity ion and the vacancy on a nearest-neighbor site, results in the following (unnormalized) relaxation modes [7]:</p><p>In this table, the w's represent the jump frequencies for the unit motions, as follows: w1—between nearest-neighbor positions; w2—interchange of the impurity ion and the vacancy in a nearest-neighbor position; w3—nearest-neighbor to next-nearest-neighbor position; and w4—the reverse of w3. For any group, such as modes 7, 8, and 9, having the same relaxation frequency, any linear combination will also be a relaxation mode. In the group 3, 4, 5, and 6, there are two pairs distinguished by the cube axis along which the uniaxial compression acts. Note that relaxation along the third axis is the negative sum of those along the other two axes. In the electrically active group 13 to 18, there are three pairs, again corresponding to the three independent cube axes. The occupation ratios, a, given in the last column are defined in the sketches shown in the figure for the various modes.</p>","answer":"Group representation theory is applied to the problem of calculating the relaxation modes of a point defect trapped near an impurity atom or other defect in a crystal, where more than one set of neighboring sites is available to the point defect. For illustration, the case of a cation vacancy trapped near a divalent impurity in the sodium chloride lattice is treated, including nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor sites."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

We identify a subset of boundaries with markedly higher CpG island density compared to the rest of the genome. daSTRs specifically localize to ultra-high-density CpG island boundaries, suggesting they might be hotspots for epigenetic misregulation or topological disruption linked to STR expansion. Fragile X syndrome patients exhibit severe boundary disruption in a manner that correlates with local loss of CTCF occupancy and the degree of FMR1 silencing.

pet because glucose metabolism is increased with the accumulation of fdg in the inflammatory phagocytes and macrophages in the granulation tissue ( 5 ) .thus , tb involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes could cause false - positive nodal staging , especially in patients with evidence of previous tb . in this study, we examined the accuracy of nodal staging in lung cancer patients with radiographic sequelae of healed tb .the subjects screened for this study were patients who had undergone surgical lung resection with lymph node dissection for the treatment of primary or metastatic lung cancer between january 2004 and december 2006 at the seoul national university hospital , a university - affiliated tertiary referral hospital . among them , patients with radiographic tb sequelae ipsilateral to the resected lung were screened for the analysis . if fibrotic bands , small calcified nodules , or bronchiectasis in the upper lobes were observed on chest ct preoperatively , the patients were regarded as having healed tb ( 6 , 7 ) .patients who underwent both chest ct and fdg - pet / ct before surgical resection and who underwent at least ipsilateral 4- and 7-lymph node dissection during the operation were finally included in the study .on ct , mediastinal lymph node enlargement was defined as the presence of lymph nodes larger than 1 cm in their smallest diameter ( 7 , 8) .on fdg - pet / ct , mediastinal nodes with increased glucose uptake satisfying both qualitative ( greater than that of the surrounding tissue ) and quantitative ( a maximum standardized uptake value [ suv ] adjusted for patient body weight of  3.0 with a distinct margin ) criteria were considered positive ( 9 , 10 ) .additionally , the results of acid - fast staining or the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) for m. tuberculosis dna were also screened when available .if acid - fast bacilli were seen in the specimen or pcr for m. tuberculosis dna was positive , a definite diagnosis of tb lymphadenitis was made . if only a caseating granuloma was identified , we classified the specimen as probable tb lymphadenitis .we also classified patients who had granulomas with non - specific necrosis as suspicious cases of tb lymphadenitis . during surgical resection , encountered lymph nodes were removed from american thoracic society ( ats ) lymph - node stations 10r , 9 , 8 , 7 , 4r , 3 , and 2r in tumors of the right lung and from stations 10l , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , and 4l of the left lung ( 11 ) . when necessary , station 1 ( the highest mediastinal ) or 2l ( when tumors were located in the left lung ) nodes were also evaluated during the procedure .an experienced lung pathologist described the location and number of lymph nodes according to the surgeons ' labeling of the dissected lymph nodes .then , the pathologist evaluated the nodes for the presence or absence of tumor as numbered in the surgical field and reported the presence or absence of tumor in the nodes .the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the seoul national university hospital ( h-0710 -

003 - 221 ) .of these , 84 patients had radiographic tb sequelae ipsilateral to the resected lung . among this latter group ,the analysis included 54 patients for whom chest ct and fdg - pet / ct were available and the lymph node dissection included at least 4- and 7-lymph node sites .their median age was 66 ( range 45 - 83 ) yr . their mean body mass index was 22.1  2.7 kg / m . no patient was anti - hiv antibody seropositive .fourteen patients ( 25.9% ) had a history of pulmonary tb and 42 patients ( 77.8% ) were current or ex - smokers ( table 1 ) .the most common pathological stage of the lung cancer was ib ( 18 patients , 33.3% ) .mediastinal lymph node enlargement , larger than 1 cm in the smallest diameter on ct , was observed in 21 patients ( 32.3% ) and metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes were suggested by fdg pet / ct in 19 patients ( 29.2% ) . as seen in table 1 , calcified nodules ( 75.9% ) and fibrotic changes ( 35.2% )were the most common forms of parenchymal lesions , and bronchiectatic changes in the upper lobes were found in ten patients ( 18.5% ) . using the above - mentioned criteria , lymph node enlargement was found in 21 patients and calcified lymph nodes were seen in seven .the median number of dissected lymph nodes per patient was 32 ( range , 1 - 76 ) .of the 21 patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on ct , nine were confirmed to have mediastinal lymph node metastasis .in contrast , six of the 33 patients with negative ct findings were confirmed to have mediastinal lymph node metastasis ; one of these patients was confirmed to have tb lymphadenitis , based on the presence of acid - fast bacilli .of the 19 patients with positive mediastinal lymph nodes by fdg pet / ct , seven were confirmed to have mediastinal lymph node metastasis .eight of the 35 patients with a negative fdg - pet / ct were confirmed to have mediastinal lymph node metastasis ; one of these patients was confirmed to have tb lymphadenitis by the presence of acid - fast bacilli . on a per - person basis ,the overall sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value for mediastinal nodal metastasis were 60.0% , 69.2% , 66.7% , 42.9% , and 81.8% for ct and 46.7% , 69.2% , 63.0% , 36.8% , and 77.1% for fdg - pet /our study involving lung cancer patients with tb sequelae showed that the accuracy of mediastinal staging using ct and fdg - pet / ct was low ( 66.7% and 63.0% ) , compared with previous reports from korea ( 83.0% and 90.0% ) ( 12 ) .especially , the specificity of mediastinal nodal staging using ct and fdg - pet / ct for nodal metastasis was considerably lower in our study ( 69.2% for both tests ) , compared to 89% and 100% in a previous report for korea ( 12 ) , and 93% and 98% in a report for low tb burden country ( 13 ) .although definite tb involvement was identified only in one patient and suspicious tb in two patients , the lower specificity for nodal metastasis in our study could be explained by tb involvement . in patients with previous tb ,mediastinal lymph node enlargement might represent inflammation of previously normal nodes draining areas of active tb in the lungs to other sites .these lymph nodes were defined as inactive tb lymphadenopathy ( 7 ) . in previous reports ,live tb bacilli could not be cultivated from the majority of inactive tb lesions ( 15 ) .in fact , according to a previous report , as many as 77% of 78 lung cancer patients with calcified mediastinal lymph nodes were confirmed not to have cancer metastasis or definite tb lymphadenitis ( 14 ) .therefore , we can consider preoperative surgical staging to mediastinal lymph nodes in lung cancer patients with parenchymal tb sequelae , even though they have positive mediastinal lymph nodes in the chest ct and/or fdg - pet / ct . because only one of the 54 patients with radiographic tb sequelae was diagnosed as having definite mediastinal tb lymphadenitis , it is possible that mediastinal lymph nodes are rarely a focus of latent tb infection , contrary to the general assumption .that is , this observation indicates that mediastinal lymph nodes are not likely a focus of tb reactivation in patients with healed tb who belong to the supposed high - risk group for reactivation of tb ( 16 ) .our data differ from a report from turkey , which showed a 5.1% prevalence of mediastinal tb among lung cancer patients regardless of previous tb sequelae shown on chest radiographs ( 17 ) . although the reason for the difference between the two studies is unclear , the fact that a considerable portion of our patients ( 26% ) had been treated for pulmonary tb could result in the lower prevalence of the presence of tb bacilli in our study . to appreciate our results correctly , we should consider several limitations of the study that might have underestimated the actual prevalence of mediastinal tb .first , not all mediastinal lymph nodes were resected and reviewed because this study was performed retrospectively .additionally , acid - fast staining and pcr for m. tuberculosis dna without mycobacterial culture for the diagnosis of tb might be insufficient for detecting the presence of mediastinal tb .a well - designed prospective study is needed to determine the actual prevalence of mediastinal tb in patients with radiographic sequelae of healed tb . in conclusion , the accuracy of nodal staging using ct or fdg - pet / ct is low in lung cancer patients with parenchymal tb sequelae , because of inactive tb lymph nodes without viable tb bacilli .impact of parenchymal tuberculosis sequelae on mediastinal lymph node staging in patients with lung cancer seung heon lee , joo -

A randomized trial sufficiently large (power 80%) to detect a reduction in the incidence of umbilical artery (UA) catheter complications, including aortic thrombus formation, from 45% to 20% was conducted in 125 infants. The infants were monitored for complications possibly related to the use of a UA catheter, such as systemic hypertension and abnormalities of lower extremity perfusion. The presence of aortic thrombi was assessed by ultrasound study 3.5 +/- 1.2 (SD) days and 11.1 +/- 2.3 days after insertion of the catheter. The use of HB-PU umbilical catheters did not lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of complications and aortic thrombi compared with the use of PVC catheters. The lack of reduction may have been related to the prolonged duration of catheter use in both groups. A much larger study would have been required to detect a smaller, but perhaps clinically significant, reduction in catheter-associated complications.","answer":"There are no demonstrated clinically relevant differences in outcomes between the use of PVC catheters and other materials. Therefore, other considerations such as price and ease of availability may dictate the catheter chosen.

singh et al . 1998 ) .the network consists of three layers , i.e. ( i ) input layer , ( ii ) hidden layer and ( iii ) output layer .patterns are presented to the network for learning at the input layers which are subsequently communicated to the hidden layer .the hidden layer interconnects the input and the output layers and can have several nodes with a particular transfer function .the actual processing is done in the hidden layer via weighted connections and the outputs are rendered at the output layers ( bailer - jones , gupta & singh 2002 ) , we have used two hidden layers of 64 nodes each with a sigmoid function as the transfer function .the scheme requires a training session where the ann output and the desired output get compared after each iteration and the connection weights get updated till the desired minimum error threshold is reached . at this stage , the network training is complete and the connection weights are considered frozen . the next stage is the testing session in which the test patterns are fed to the network and output is the classification of the objects as star or galaxy .in the following , we describe the data sources for the stellar and galaxy spectra , and the generation of the train and test test sets for the network .      _( i ) the stellar data set : _ we have used the uvblue fluxes ( rodriguez - merino et al . 2005 ) for generating the training sets for stellar spectra with solar type stars with @xmath1]=@xmath2 ( http://www.bo.astro.it/@xmath3eps/uvblue/uvblue.html ) .the references ( allen ( 2000 ) , erika bohm - vitense ( 1981 ) , johnson ( 1966 ) , ridgway et al .( 1980 ) , alonso , arribas & martinez - roger ( 1999 ) and bertone et al .( 2004 ) ) provide the necessary information for matching the parameter space of uvblue to spectral - types .the uvblue library source provides the sets of theoretical fluxes ( based on kurucz model atmospheres ) in the uv region .the test spectra were taken from the iue low resolution spectra : reference atlas , normal stars , esa sp-1052 by heck et al .( 1984 ) which contains 229 low - dispersion flux calibrated spectra of o to k spectral type at a resolution of 6   obtained by the iue satellite .    _( ii ) the galaxy data set : _ for galaxy spectra we have used the uv - optical spectra of 99 nearby quiescent and active galaxies available online on http://www.stsci .edu / ftp / catalogs / nearby_gal / sed.html ( storchi - bergmann et al . ) .the spectra covers the wavelength range 1200 - 3200    with a resolution of 5 - 8  .although an extended grid of synthetic galaxy spectra are available in the wavelength range 2500 to 10500    with zero - redshift ( fioc et al .1997 ) , there is no such grid in the range of our interest ( 1200 - 3200  ) .so , we choose a subset of the galaxies from the above mentioned database as the train set , keeping the rest for the test set .the selection of the galaxy subset for the training session is based on the following general observations related to the galaxy spectra :    the spectra of galaxies of different morphological types reveal that the elliptical and the s0 galaxies essentially have no star - formation activity and the spectra of these two types look quite similar . by contrast , the sc spirals and the irr galaxies have a spectrum dominated by emission lines . on the other hand the sa and the sb galaxies form a kind of transition between these early - type galaxies and sc galaxies ( schneider 2006 ) .depending on these spectral distributions we prepare a list of 16 galaxies spanning over all the above mentioned types as the training sample .the remaining 69 galaxies are then used as the test set .all these galaxies considered in the train set and in the test are at the low red - shift regions .it is to be mentioned that the tauvex detectors being virtually noiseless and also with little or no stray light in parts of the orbit , its detection will be limited only by photon statistics ( brosch 1998 ; safonova et al .1998 ) and so the effect of noise on the data is not taken into account .          while making the train and the test sets, one has to ensure that the number of spectral fluxes at the respective wavelengths and the starting , ending wavelengths are identical .also the spectral resolution of the two sets needs to be the same .this has been achieved by first trimming the spectra in the range of 1250 - 3200   at 40 data bins and then convolving the iue star / galaxy spectra with appropriate gaussian functions to bring down their resolution to 50 .the resolution of uvblue spectral types have also been degraded to a resolution of 50   using the relevant codes provided on the uvblue library web site ( http://www.bo.astro.it/  eps / uvblue / go.html ) .the details of the procedure adopted for generating the band integrated train and test sets is described below with reference to the tauvex filter response . for the tauvex mission, the observations will be available from 1250   to 3220   spectral region using filters , namely bbf , sf1 , sf2 , sf3 and nbf3 , in five uv bands .fig.@xmath4 shows the total response of each of the tauvex filters in units of effective area @xmath5 and their approximate characteristics are summarized in table 1 ..tauvex filters specifications [ cols=\\"<,^,<,^,<,^ , < \\" , ]     [ tab1 ]this work is supported by a research grant from indian space research organization under its respond scheme .ab would like to thank prof .s. ravindranath for suggesting useful references that helps to understand the galaxy spectra .allen 2000 , astrophysical quantities , 4th edn , springer - verlag , new york alonso , a. , arribas , s. , martinez - roger , c. , 1999 , a&as , 140 , 261 .bailer - jones , c. a. l. 2002 , in automated data analysis in astronomy , ed .r. gupta , h. p. singh , & c. a. l. bailer - jones ( new delhi : narosa ) , 83 .bailer - jones , c. a. l. , gupta , r. , & singh , h .p. 2002 , in automated data analysis in astronomy , ed .r. gupta , h. p. singh , & c. a. l. bailer - jones ( new delhi : narosa ) , 51 .bertone e. , buzzoni a. , rodriguez - merino l. h. , chavez m. , 2004 , aj , 128 , 829 .bora , a. , gupta , r. , singh , h. p. , murthy , j. , mohan , r. , duorah , k. , 2008 .mnras , * 384 * , 449 .brosch , n. , 1998 .physica scripta - supplement t , * 77 * , 16 . erika bohm - vitense , 1981, 295 , 318 .fioc m. , rocca - volmerange b. , 1997 .a&a , * 326*,950 .gulati , r.k . ,gupta , r. , gothoskar , p. , khobragade , s. , 1994 .apj , * 426 * , 340 ( 1994 ) .gulati , r. k. , gupta , r. , rao , n.k .a&a , * 322 * , 933 .gulati , r.k . ,gupta , r. , singh , h.p .pasp , * 109 * , 843 .heck a. , egret d. , jaschek m. , jaschek c. , 1984 .esa sp-1052 , iue lowdispertion spectra reference atlas .normal stars , esa sp-1052 .johnson , h. l. , 1966 .astrophys . , 4 , 193 .mhnen , p. , hakala , p. , 1995 .apj * 452 * , l77 .mhnen , p. , t. frantti , 2000 .apj * 541 * , 261 .odewahn , s .c. , stockwell , r. l. pennington , r. l. , humphreys , r. , m. , zumach , w. a. , 1992 . the astronomical journal , * 103 * , 318 .philip , n. s. , wadadekar , y. , kembhavi , a. , joseph , k. b. , 2002 .a&a , * 385 * , 1119 .p. schneider , _ extragalactic astronomy and cosmology : an introduction _ , ( springer - verlag , berlin , heidelberg , 2006 ) .qin , d.m ., guo , p. , hu , z.u . , & zhao , y.h . , 2003 .. j. astron .astrophys , * 3 * , 277 .ridgway , s. t. , joyce , r. r. , white , n. m. and wing , r. f. , 1980 , apj , 235 , 126 rodriguez - merino , l. h. , chavez , m.,bertone , e. , buzzoni , a. 2005 , apj , 626 , 411 ( uvblue ) safonova , m , sivaram , c. , & murthy , j. , 2008 .astrophys space sci , * 318 * , 1 .singh , h.p ., gulati , r.k . , gupta , r. , 1998 .mnras , * 295 * , 312 .storchi - bergmann , t. , calzetti , d. , kinney , a. l. , _ a database of uv - optical spectra of nearby quiescent and active galaxies _ , ( http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/catalogs/nearby_gal/sed.html ) .","answer":"we employ an artificial neural network ( ann ) based technique to develop a pipeline for automated segregation of stars from the galaxies to be observed by tel - aviv university ultra - violet experiment ( tauvex ) .  we use synthetic spectra of stars from uvblue library and selected international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) low resolution spectra for galaxies in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region from 1250 to 3220   as the training set and iue low - resolution spectra for both the stars and the galaxies as the test set .  all the data sets have been pre - processed to get band integrated fluxes so as to mimic the observations of the tauvex uv imager .  we also perform the ann based segregation scheme using the full length spectral features ( which will also be useful for the astrosat mission ) .  our results suggest that , in the case of the non - availability of full spectral features , the limited band integrated features can be used to segregate the two classes of objects ;

(2016).In short, small models train faster due to requiring less communication.bulletLess overhead when exporting new models to clients. For autonomous driving, companies such as Tesla periodically copy new models from their servers to customers’ cars. This practice is often referred to as an over-the-air update. Consumer Reports has found that the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot semi-autonomous driving functionality has incrementally improved with recent over-the-air updates Consumer Reports (2016). However, over-the-air updates of today’s typical CNN/DNN models can require large data transfers. With AlexNet, this would require 240MB of communication from the server to the car. Smaller models require less communication, making frequent updates more feasible.bulletFeasible FPGA and embedded deployment.

For inference, a sufficiently small model could be stored directly on the FPGA instead of being bottlenecked by memory bandwidth Qiu et al.

TSG-6 cDNA was isolated by differential screening of a lambda cDNA library prepared from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-treated human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts. We show that TSG-6 mRNA was not detectable in untreated cells, but became readily induced by TNF in normal human fibroblast lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, TSG-6 mRNA was undetectable in either control or TNF-treated human vascular endothelial cells and a variety of tumor-derived or virus-transformed cell lines. The sequence of full-length TSG-6 cDNA revealed one major open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of 277 amino acids, including a typical cleavable signal peptide. The NH2-terminal half of the predicted TSG-6 protein sequence shows a significant homology with a region implicated in hyaluronate binding, present in cartilage link protein, proteoglycan core proteins, and the adhesion receptor CD44. The most extensive sequence homology exists between the predicted TSG-6 protein and CD44. Western blot analysis with an antiserum raised against a TSG-6 fusion protein detected a 39-kD glycoprotein in the supernatants of TNF-treated FS-4 cells and of cells transfected with TSG-6 cDNA. Binding of the TSG-6 protein to hyaluronate was demonstrated by coprecipitation. Our data indicate that the inflammatory cytokine (TNF or IL-1)-inducible, secretory TSG-6 protein is a novel member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, possibly involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during inflammation and tumorigenesis.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"TNF\\", \\"IL-1\\", \\"TSG-6\\", \\"secretory tumor necrosis factor-inducible protein\\", \\"adhesion receptor\\", \\"hyaluronate binding proteins\\", \\"cartilage link protein\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor\\", \\"CD44\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Here we report an unanticipated role for dMi-2 in the regulation of higher-order chromatin structure in Drosophila. Loss of dMi-2 function causes salivary gland polytene chromosomes to lose their characteristic banding pattern and appear more condensed than normal. Conversely, increased expression of dMi-2 triggers decondensation of polytene chromosomes accompanied by a significant increase in nuclear volume; this effect is relatively rapid and is dependent on the ATPase activity of dMi-2. Live analysis revealed that dMi-2 disrupts interactions between the aligned chromatids of salivary gland polytene chromosomes. dMi-2 and the cohesin complex are enriched at sites of active transcription; fluorescence-recovery after photobleaching( FRAP) assays showed that dMi-2 decreases stable association of cohesin with polytene chromosomes. These findings demonstrate that dMi-2 is an important regulator of both chromosome condensation and cohesin binding in interphase cells.Introduction:The packaging of DNA into chromatin is critical for the organization and expression of eukaryotic genes[1],[2],[3]. The basic unit of chromatin structure, the nucleosome, contains the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. The association of nucleosomes with histone H1 and other linker histones facilitates their packaging into 30 nm fibers, which in turn are packaged into increasingly compact higher-order structures. Nucleosomes and other components of chromatin can repress transcription by blocking the access of regulatory proteins and the basal transcriptional machinery to DNA. There is growing evidence that levels of chromosome organization above the level of the nucleosome – including chromosome folding, pairing and looping – also play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. For example, condensin and cohesin, which were initially identified by their roles in mitosis and meiosis, modulate transcription by promoting long-range chromosomal interactions and DNA looping in interphase cells[4]. The repressive effects of nucleosomes on transcription are modulated by two general mechanisms: the covalent modification of nucleosomal histones and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling[1],[5]. By altering the structure or positioning of nucleosomes, ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors play critical roles in transcription and other nuclear processes. Dozens of chromatin-remodeling factors, including members of the SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD and INO80 families, have been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. By contrast, relatively little is known about how higher-order chromatin structure is regulated and exploited to control gene expression and other nuclear processes. A major barrier to the identification of factors that regulate higher-order chromatin structure is the difficulty of visualizing the decondensed interphase chromosomes of diploid cells. This barrier can be overcome through the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. During Drosophila development, many tissues undergo multiple rounds of DNA replication in the absence of cytokinesis, leading to the formation of huge polytene chromosomes containing hundreds of aligned sister chromatids. These transcriptionally active chromosomes are indistinguishable from the interphase chromosomes of diploid cells in most respects. Genetic studies in Drosophila have identified numerous factors that regulate polytene chromosome structure, including ISWI, an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor. The loss of ISWI function leads to the decondensation of salivary gland polytene chromosomes, possibly due to failure to assemble chromatin containing the linker histone H1[6],[7],[8]. This striking phenotype led us to investigate the potential involvement of another ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor, Drosophila Mi-2( dMi-2), in the regulation of higher-order chromatin structure. dMi-2 functions as the ATPase subunit of multiple chromatin-remodeling complexes, including the NuRD( Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase) complex and dMec( Drosophila MEP-1 containing complex)[9]. NuRD is highly conserved in metazoans and is thought to repress transcription via its chromatin-remodeling and histone deacetylase activities[10],[11],[12]. dMec is the most abundant dMi-2 complex in Drosophila and has been implicated in SUMO-dependent transcriptional repression[13],[14]. Mi-2 plays an important role in cell fate specification in organisms ranging from nematodes to vertebrates. For example, Mi-2 helps maintain the distinction between the germline and soma during C. elegans embryogenesis[15]; regulates the terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells in mammals[16]; and participates in the transcriptional repression of HOX genes by Hunchback and Polycomb in Drosophila[17]. dMi-2 is also required for the efficient expression of heat-shock genes in Drosophila, indicating that its function is not limited to transcriptional repression[18]. Here we report an unanticipated role for Mi-2 in the regulation of higher-order chromatin structure in Drosophila. The loss of dMi-2 function causes salivary gland polytene chromosomes to lose their characteristic banding pattern and appear more condensed than normal. Conversely, the increased expression of dMi-2 in the salivary gland disrupts interactions between sister chromatids and triggers the decondensation of polytene chromosomes. Consistent with these findings, dMi-2 disrupts the association of cohesin with polytene chromosomes. Our studies reveal that dMi-2 is an important regulator of both chromosome condensation and cohesin binding in interphase cells.Discussion:Several lines of evidence suggest that the chromosome decondensation resulting from the increased expression of the dMi-2 protein reflects its normal function. The inducible transgene used in our studies rescued the recessive lethality of a dMi-2 null allele indicating that it encodes a fully functional dMi-2 protein. Even a modest( two to threefold) increase in dMi-2 levels triggered chromosome decondensation; this effect was relatively rapid and was dependent on dMi-2 ATPase activity. The expression of a dominant-negative dMi-2 protein had the opposite effect on chromosome structure; the loss of dMi-2 function made polytene chromosomes appear more condensed than normal and blurred the distinction between bands and interbands. Taken together, these observations provide strong evidence that dMi-2 promotes chromosome decondensation in vivo. HS puff formation exemplifies an unusually rapid and localized chromatin decondensation event. The precise mechanisms driving puff formation are not clear. HS gene activation is accompanied by nucleosome depletion, activation of PARP, extensive PARylation and the recruitment of topoisomerase, HSF, RNA polymerase II and several elongation factors as well as dMi-2[18],[44],[45],[46]. Expression of dominant-negative dMi-2 protein reduces the transcriptional activation of HS genes but the underlying mechanisms have not been resolved[18]. Here, we have found that expression of a dominant negative dMi-2 protein leads to the formation of HS puffs with reduced size. This suggests that dMi-2 effects on chromosome structure are not always global. Instead, our results indicate that dMi-2 can be recruited to specific chromatin regions by environmental stimuli to contribute to the rapid local decondensation of chromatin. It is conceivable that the compromised decondensation of HS loci in dMi-2 mutants is one of the reasons for the observed loss in transcriptional output[18]. To date, only one other Drosophila chromatin-remodeling factor, ISWI, has been implicated in the regulation of higher-order chromosome structure[7],[47],[48]. ISWI promotes the association of the H1 linker histone with interphase chromosomes[6],[8]. The loss of ISWI function leads to chromosome decondensation accompanied by the loss of histone H1, and the elimination of histone H1 causes chromosome defects that are remarkably similar to those resulting from dMi-2 over-expression[6],[8]. Although this similarity suggested that dMi-2 and ISWI have antagonistic effects on higher-order chromatin structure and histone H1 assembly, we failed to detect decreases in ISWI and histone H1 expression or histone H1 assembly following dMi-2 over-expression. dMi-2 and ISWI therefore appear to regulate distinct aspects of higher-order chromatin structure. Cohesin has been the topic of intensive study due to its critical role in sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis, and its roles in gene regulation and DNA repair. The complex forms a ring-like structure that encircles chromosomes beginning in telophase, and mediates sister chromatid cohesion upon DNA replication[33]. Cohesin binding is dynamic, but unusually stable compared to most DNA-binding proteins. Interphase cohesin is continuously loaded by the kollerin complex containing Nipped-B and released from chromosomes by the releasin complex containing Pds5 and Wapl[38],[43]. Our studies revealed an intriguing connection between dMi-2 and the cohesin complex, and argue that dMi-2 facilitates removal of cohesin from chromosomes during interphase. This activity is not restricted to situations in which dMi-2 is expressed at unusually high levels, since a twofold reduction in dMi-2 dosage counteracts the developmental consequences of reduced dosage of Nipped-B. Our findings add dMi-2 to the list of factors that regulate cohesin binding. Cohesin regulates transcription by multiple mechanisms, including long-range interactions between insulators, enhancers and promoters via the formation of DNA loops, repression in collaboration with Polycomb proteins, and controlling transition of paused polymerase to elongation[34],[36],[49]. The observed suppression of a dominant Nipped-B mutant phenotype by reduced dMi-2 gene dosage suggests that regulation of cohesin chromosome binding may be one mechanism by which dMi-2 controls gene expression. The live analysis of a LacO array tagged with GFP in living cells is consistent with a potential role for dMi-2 in chromosome cohesion. The array is organized in a compact disc due to cohesion between precisely aligned chromatids. The over-expression of dMi-2 caused the LacO array to disperse into hundreds of discrete foci, presumably due to the disruption of interactions between sister chromatids. The over-expression of dMi-2 also disrupted the organization of mitotic chromosomes along their longitudinal axes, possibly by interfering with chromosomal interactions in cis that contribute to the organization of chromosome shape[50],[51]. Our findings show that dMi-2 plays unanticipated roles in both the regulation of higher-order chromosome structure and cohesin dynamics. Is there a causal relationship between the two activities? The sudden removal of cohesin in late larval development by targeted proteolysis does not dramatically alter polytene structure[52] and thus cohesin may not be critical for maintenance of polytene structure once fully established. However, genetic studies of pds5 have revealed a role for both cohesin binding and sister chromatid cohesion in forming the normal structure of polytene chromosomes[53]. A pds5 null allele and an allele encoding an N-terminally truncated protein alter polytene chromosome structure in distinctive ways, but in both cases the size and normal banding pattern are disrupted[53]. Taken together, the above considerations prevent us from concluding that dMi-2 promotes chromosome decondensation by destabilizing cohesin binding. However, because dMi-2 over-expression causes a large reduction in both the amount of stable cohesin and its chromosomal residence time, we can conclude that cohesin binding has been reduced, and that it is also likely that cohesion is affected. The internal diameter of cohesin is ∼35 by 50 nm; it can therefore encircle only one 30 nm or two 10 nm chromatin fibers[54]. Interactions between cohesin complexes are thought to contribute to chromatid cohesion and presumably anchor chromatin loops to form “hubs” of high transcriptional activity[55],[56],[57]. The destabilization of cohesin binding therefore may be a secondary consequence of changes in chromatin structure catalyzed by dMi-2. Further work will be necessary to test this possibility and clarify the causal relationship, if any, between changes in chromosome structure and cohesin binding catalyzed by dMi-2. It is intriguing that dMi-2, an antagonist of cohesin binding and well-characterized transcriptional repressor, co-localizes with cohesin at sites of active transcription. Although cohesin subunits and Nipped-B were not identified as stable subunits of dMi-2 containing complexes in cultured cells[13],[58], the extensive overlap between their chromosomal distributions suggests that chromatin structure and gene activity may be dependent on a fine balance of opposing dMi-2 and cohesin activities. Cohesin selectively binds and regulates active genes that have paused RNA polymerase, and can both positively and negatively regulate these genes by multiple mechanisms, including controlling the transition of paused polymerase to elongation[49]. It is possible that dMi-2 may also influence this transition by regulating cohesin binding and the chromatin structure at the pause sites. Intriguingly, mouse Mi-2ß and the NuRD complex bind active and poised gene promoters in thymocytes, and have both negative and positive effects on expression of these genes[59]. The Mi-2/NuRD complex regulates the expression of genes involved in lymphocyte differentiation[16],[60] and is also involved in stem cell renewal and determination[61],[62]. As in Drosophila, mammalian cohesin also regulates many genes critical for growth and development[34]. Our findings raise the interesting possibility that Mi-2 may regulate cellular differentiation in vertebrates by modulating chromosome condensation and cohesin activity.","answer":"The packaging of DNA into chromatin is critical for the organization and expression of eukaryotic genes .

These findings indicate that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization.By using these model systems we demonstrated that: (i) ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; (ii) CTCF knock-down significantly inhibited differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage; (iii) differentiation of K562 into the megakaryocytic lineage was not significantly affected; and (iv) down-regulation of MYC has been identified as one of the mechanisms by which CTCF promotes erythroid differentiation.To determine how these varying effects would integrate in vivo, we engineered a variety of expression systems to study effects of CTCF on cell growth.Here we show that ectopic expression of CTCF in many cell types inhibits cell clonogenicity by causing profound growth retardation without apoptosis.While MYC is the well-characterized CTCF target, the inhibitory effects of CTCF on cell growth could not be ascribed solely to repression of MYC, suggesting that additional CTS-driven genes involved in growth-regulatory circuits, such as p19ARF, are likely to contribute to CTCF-induced growth arrest.Deletion of the CTCF-cohesin binding site caused an inhibition of cell growth and viral genome instability.By using these model systems we demonstrated that: (i) ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; (ii) CTCF knock-down significantly inhibited differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage; (iii) differentiation of K562 into the megakaryocytic lineage was not significantly affected; and (iv) down-regulation of MYC has been identified as one of the mechanisms by which CTCF promotes erythroid differentiation.","answer":"ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; Enforced ectopic expression of CTCF inhibits cell growth in culture. ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; Ectopic expression of CTCF results in severe cell growth inhibition at multiple points within the cell cycle. ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage;.
