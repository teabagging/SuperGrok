Each trick requires a unique set of magic cards, and the magician has a total of 60 magic cards in their collection. To prevent anyone from learning their secrets, the magician ensures that no two tricks share more than 2 cards in common.If each magic trick uses the same number of magic cards, how many cards does each trick use?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cards each trick uses, given the constraints.1. Define Variables:   - Let ( n ) be the number of cards each trick uses.   - There are 5 different tricks.2. Total Cards Used Across All Tricks:   - Since each trick uses ( n ) cards and there are 5 tricks, the total number of card-trick assignments is ( 5n ).   - However, we also know that the total number of unique cards in the magician's collection is 60.3. No Two Tricks Share More Than 2 Cards:   - If any two tricks can share at most 2 cards, it implies that the intersection of any pair of tricks is at most 2 cards.4. Combinatorial Consideration:   - Consider pairs of tricks. The number of ways to choose 2 tricks out of 5 is given by ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ).   - Each pair of tricks can share at most 2 cards.   - The maximum number of shared cards across all pairs of tricks is thus ( 10 times 2 = 20 ).5. Maximum Unique Cards Calculation:   - If each pair shares the maximum number of 2 cards, and there are 20 \\"shared\\" card instances, the rest are unique across the tricks.   - However, we must be careful: the 20 shared instances mean that some cards are counted more than once in the total ( 5n ) count.6. Equation Setup:   - The total number of cards used across all tricks is ( 5n ).   - The maximum overlap (20 cards) means the unique cards used is ( 5n - 20 ).   - This must equal the total number of unique cards, which is 60:      [     5n - 20 = 60     ]7. Solve the Equation:   - Rearrange the equation:     [     5n = 80     ]   - Divide both sides by 5:     [     n = 16     ]Therefore, each trick uses 16 cards.# 16"},{"question":"Frank, a retired computer programmer known for his straightforward opinions, decided to volunteer at a local elementary school to teach coding basics.

To encourage community participation, Jamie decided to distribute free podcast merchandise to attendees. They ordered 150 podcast-themed buttons and 200 stickers to give away.During the event, Jamie noticed that for every 2 buttons handed out, 3 stickers were given away. By the end of the event, all the buttons were distributed.How many stickers does Jamie have left after the event?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stickers were distributed and how many are left after all the buttons were given away.Given:- Total buttons ordered: 150- Total stickers ordered: 200- The ratio of buttons to stickers distributed is 2:3.Step-by-step Solution:1. Determine the number of stickers distributed per button:   For every 2 buttons, 3 stickers are given away. This means the number of stickers distributed per button is (frac{3}{2}).2. Calculate the total number of stickers distributed:   Since all 150 buttons were distributed, we use the ratio to find how many stickers were given out:   [   text{Number of stickers distributed} = frac{3}{2} times 150 = 3 times 75 = 225   ]3. Determine the number of stickers left:   Jamie originally had 200 stickers. If 225 stickers were distributed, we calculate how many stickers are left:   [   text{Number of stickers left} = 200 - 225 = -25   ]However, this negative result indicates an inconsistency, as the number of stickers distributed exceeds the number ordered. It's not possible to distribute more stickers than were available. Let's reassess the situation:- Since 225 stickers cannot be distributed (the starting amount was only 200), the actual number of stickers distributed must have been limited by the available stock.- Given the ratio constraint, Jamie can only distribute stickers until they run out.4. Recalculate based on sticker availability:   Since distributing all 150 buttons requires 225 stickers (which exceed the available 200), Jamie could only distribute stickers until they run out. Therefore, the number of stickers distributed is limited to 200.5. Calculate the number of buttons distributed when stickers run out:   The number of complete 2-button distributions (2 buttons and 3 stickers) is determined by the available stickers:   [   text{Maximum full sets of stickers} = leftlfloor frac{200}{3} rightrfloor = 66 text{ (full sets)}   ]6. Calculate stickers and buttons distributed in these full sets:   - Stickers distributed in full sets: (66 times 3 = 198)   - Buttons distributed in these full sets: (66 times 2 = 132)7. Calculate the remaining stickers:   Jamie distributed 198 stickers, so the remaining number of stickers is:   [   text{Number of stickers left} = 200 - 198 = 2   ]Thus, by the end of the event, Jamie has 2 stickers left.# 2"},{"question":"An event organizer is planning a series of live country music performances at different truck stops.

After preparing the infusions, she notices that she used a total of 4,500 milliliters of water. How many grams of tea leaves did Dr. Green use in total?","answer":"To solve this problem, let's break down the steps and calculations:1. Determine the Total Number of Infusions:   Dr. Green has 5 different types of tea leaves and makes 3 infusions from each type. Therefore, the total number of infusions is:   [   5 text{ types} times 3 text{ infusions per type} = 15 text{ infusions}   ]2. Calculate the Total Amount of Water Used:   We know that Dr. Green used a total of 4,500 milliliters of water for the infusions. Since 200 milliliters of water are used for each infusion, we can confirm the number of infusions by dividing the total amount of water by the amount used per infusion:   [   frac{4500 text{ milliliters}}{200 text{ milliliters per infusion}} = 22.5   ]   However, this calculation seems incorrect because it does not match the 15 infusions previously calculated. Let's reconsider our total number of infusions based on water usage:   - If each infusion uses 200 milliliters, then 4500 milliliters should make:   [   frac{4500 text{ milliliters}}{200 text{ milliliters per infusion}} = 22.5 text{ infusions}   ]   This discrepancy indicates that either Dr. Green made more infusions than initially planned, or there's an error in the problem statement. However, if we assume the information about the total water usage is correct, then she must have made 22.5 infusions, which doesn't make sense practically. Therefore, assuming there was an error in the problem setup or a misunderstanding, let's proceed with the initial calculated 15 infusions as the basis for our solution, despite the inconsistency.3. Calculate the Total Amount of Tea Leaves Used:   Since Dr. Green uses 5 grams of tea leaves per infusion, the total amount of tea leaves used for 15 infusions is:   [   15 text{ infusions} times 5 text{ grams per infusion} = 75 text{ grams}   ]4.

Calculate the initial time spent per patient without the AI tool:   - Each patient initially requires 30 minutes of the doctor's time.2. Calculate the reduction in time per patient after implementing the AI tool:   - The AI tool reduces the time each doctor spends per patient by 10 minutes.   - Therefore, the new time spent per patient is:     [     30 text{ minutes} - 10 text{ minutes} = 20 text{ minutes}     ]3. Calculate the total time available for each doctor per day:   - Each doctor works 8 hours a day. Converting this to minutes:     [     8 text{ hours} times 60 text{ minutes per hour} = 480 text{ minutes}     ]4. Calculate the number of patients each doctor can initially see in a day without the AI tool:   - Without the AI tool, each patient takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the number of patients a doctor can see is:     [     frac{480 text{ minutes}}{30 text{ minutes per patient}} = 16 text{ patients}     ]5. Calculate the number of patients each doctor can see in a day after implementing the AI tool:   - With the AI tool, each patient takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the new number of patients a doctor can see is:     [     frac{480 text{ minutes}}{20 text{ minutes per patient}} = 24 text{ patients}     ]6. Calculate the additional number of patients each doctor can see in a day:   - Subtract the initial number of patients from the new number:     [     24 text{ patients} - 16 text{ patients} = 8 text{ additional patients}     ]Therefore, after implementing the AI tool, each doctor can see 8 additional patients in a day.# 8"},{"question":"Professor Smith is preparing a presentation for a conference on international arms agreements.

You have been given a budget of 2,400 Zambian Kwacha (ZMW) for transportation. The first village is 50 kilometers away, the second village is 70 kilometers away, and the third village is 80 kilometers away. The cost of transportation is 10 ZMW per kilometer. If the distance traveled to each village is a round trip, calculate the total transportation cost for visiting all three villages. Will your budget be enough to cover the transportation costs?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total transportation cost for visiting all three villages and then compare it to the budget of 2,400 ZMW. Step-by-step Solution:1. Calculate the round-trip distance for each village:   - For the first village: The one-way distance is 50 kilometers. Therefore, the round trip distance is (50 times 2 = 100) kilometers.   - For the second village: The one-way distance is 70 kilometers. Therefore, the round trip distance is (70 times 2 = 140) kilometers.   - For the third village: The one-way distance is 80 kilometers. Therefore, the round trip distance is (80 times 2 = 160) kilometers.2. Calculate the transportation cost for each round trip:   - The cost per kilometer is 10 ZMW.   - For the first village: The cost is (100 text{ km} times 10 text{ ZMW/km} = 1,000) ZMW.   - For the second village: The cost is (140 text{ km} times 10 text{ ZMW/km} = 1,400) ZMW.   - For the third village: The cost is (160 text{ km} times 10 text{ ZMW/km} = 1,600) ZMW.3. Calculate the total transportation cost:   - Total cost = Cost for first village + Cost for second village + Cost for third village   - Total cost = (1,000 text{ ZMW} + 1,400 text{ ZMW} + 1,600 text{ ZMW} = 4,000) ZMW.4. Compare the total transportation cost with the budget:   - Budget = 2,400 ZMW.   - Total transportation cost = 4,000 ZMW.Since the total transportation cost (4,000 ZMW) exceeds the budget (2,400 ZMW), the budget is not enough to cover the transportation costs.# 4,000 ZMW (The budget is not enough)"},{"question":"Alex, a technology executive at a software company, is working on implementing a distributed computing solution.

Total pests attracted by corn = ( 40 times 5 = 200 ) pests.   - Soybeans:       Each acre of soybeans attracts 3 pests.       Number of acres planted with soybeans = 30 acres.       Total pests attracted by soybeans = ( 30 times 3 = 90 ) pests.   - Wheat:       Each acre of wheat attracts 2 pests.       Number of acres planted with wheat = 30 acres.       Total pests attracted by wheat = ( 30 times 2 = 60 ) pests.2. Calculate Total Pests Before Reduction:   Add up the pests attracted by each type of crop:   [   text{Total pests before reduction} = 200 + 90 + 60 = 350   ]3. Apply 20% Reduction:   The total number of pests is reduced by 20% due to crop diversification.

The reviewer believes that 1/4 of the books should innovate by using the interactive technique, while the rest should be evenly split between linear and non-linear techniques. How many books should employ each storytelling technique to satisfy the reviewer's criteria?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books should employ each of the three storytelling techniques: linear, non-linear, and interactive, according to the reviewer's criteria.Step 1: Calculate the number of books using the interactive technique.- The reviewer believes that 1/4 of the books should use the interactive technique.- There are 12 books in total.- Calculate 1/4 of 12: [frac{1}{4} times 12 = 3]So, 3 books should use the interactive technique.Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of books.- Since 3 books are using the interactive technique, the remaining number of books is:[12 - 3 = 9]Step 3: Split the remaining books evenly between linear and non-linear techniques.- The remaining 9 books should be evenly split between the linear and non-linear techniques.- Since they are split evenly, divide the remaining books by 2:[frac{9}{2} = 4.5]Since the number of books must be a whole number, we interpret this as needing to have 4 books using linear technique and 5 using non-linear, or vice-versa. However, the number of books cannot be non-integer, so we must adjust to ensure equal distribution.Let's re-evaluate our steps with the need for integer solutions:Step 1: After deciding 3 books are interactive, the 9 remaining books should be split into equal integer parts.- Since 9 is odd, equally splitting into integer values is not possible.- We adjust to have 4 linear and 5 non-linear (or vice-versa given no specific preference stated beyond being equal).Therefore, considering the need for integer allocation and the intention of equal distribution as closely as possible, the final step is to allocate:- 4 books for one technique,- 5 books for the other technique.Considering the need for detail and equal distribution, this solution provides a balanced allocation for linear and non-linear storytelling methods which are otherwise split into equal integer parts as closely as possible.# 4 linear, 5 non-linear, 3 interactive"},{"question":"Alex is a UI/UX designer who works closely with an architect to design a new library.

He plans to divide the players into small groups for specialized drills. He wants 4 groups to focus on offense and 3 groups to focus on defense. Each group needs the same number of players. How many players will be in each group if Coach Thompson divides them equally?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to divide 22 players into a total of 7 groups, with each group having the same number of players. The groups are divided into 4 groups for offense and 3 groups for defense, making a total of 7 groups.Let's go through the solution step-by-step:1. Total Number of Players: There are 22 players.2. Total Number of Groups: There are 4 offensive groups and 3 defensive groups, which adds up to 7 groups in total.3. Dividing Players Equally: To divide the 22 players equally among these 7 groups, we need to find how many players each group will have.

During their trip, they visit a rainforest that is home to 120 different species of medicinal plants. The traveler plans to spend 10 days in the rainforest and aims to learn about 8 different plant species each day.However, on the third day, they discover a special area with 16 additional plant species that are not found anywhere else in the rainforest. Enthusiastic about this discovery, they decide to spend an extra day in the rainforest to study these unique plants. How many total plant species will the traveler have the opportunity to learn about by the end of their trip?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's first outline the given information and what is being asked:- The rainforest initially has 120 different species of medicinal plants.- The traveler plans to stay 10 days, learning about 8 different species each day.- On the third day, they find 16 additional unique plant species and decide to stay an extra day, making it an 11-day trip.We need to determine the total number of different plant species the traveler will have the opportunity to learn about by the end of their trip.Step-by-step solution:1. Initial Calculation for the First 3 Days:   - For the first 2 days, the traveler learns about (8 text{ species/day} times 2 text{ days} = 16) species.2. Discovery on the Third Day:   - On the third day, the traveler learns about 8 species from the original 120 species.    - Additionally, they discover 16 unique species in a special area.    - Thus, on the third day, they learn about (8 + 16 = 24) species.3. Calculation for Subsequent Days:   - After the third day, the traveler will continue with their plan to learn about 8 different species each day.   - Since they planned to stay 10 days, and have already accounted for 3 days, there are (10 - 3 = 7) more days of learning 8 species each.   - Hence, they will learn about (8 text{ species/day} times 7 text{ days} = 56) species in those days.4. Including the Additional Day:   - The traveler decides to stay one extra day, making the total stay 11 days.    - On this additional day, they will learn about 8 more species.5. Total Calculation:   - Total species learned = Species from first 2 days + Species on third day + Species from subsequent 7 days + Species from additional day   - Total species learned = (16 + 24 + 56 + 8)Now, calculate the total:[16 + 24 + 56 + 8 = 104]However, we must ensure the total does not exceed the available species. Initially, there are 120 species plus 16 unique ones, totaling 136 distinct species. The traveler could theoretically learn about all 136 since they study up to 104, which is within the available species.The total number of different plant species the traveler will have the opportunity to learn about is:# 104"},{"question":"Dr. Smith is a higher education administrator who is responsible for setting admissions policies and procedures at a university.

Exports to Japan:   - Last month's exports to Japan = 1,200 gadgets.   - This month's exports to Japan increased by 10%.   - To find the increase, calculate 10% of 1,200:      [     0.10 times 1,200 = 120     ]   - Add the increase to last month's exports to find this month's exports:     [     1,200 + 120 = 1,320     ]2. Exports to South Korea:   - Last month's exports to South Korea = 950 gadgets.   - This month's exports to South Korea decreased by 5%.   - To find the decrease, calculate 5% of 950:     [     0.05 times 950 = 47.5     ]   - Subtract the decrease from last month's exports to find this month's exports:     [     950 - 47.5 = 902.5     ]   - Since the number of gadgets should be a whole number, we'll round 902.5 to 903 (assuming rounding to the nearest whole number is intended).3. Exports to Germany:   - Last month's exports to Germany = 1,350 gadgets.   - This month's exports to Germany increased by 8%.   - To find the increase, calculate 8% of 1,350:     [     0.08 times 1,350 = 108     ]   - Add the increase to last month's exports to find this month's exports:     [     1,350 + 108 = 1,458     ]4. Total Exports:   - Add the exports to Japan, South Korea, and Germany to find the total exports this month:     [     1,320 + 903 + 1,458 = 3,681     ]Thus, the total number of electronic gadgets exported by China to Japan, South Korea, and Germany this month is:# 3,681"},{"question":"Alex, a high school student who is inspired by a blogger's elegant mathematical explanations, decides to start a blog of their own to share their love for numbers.

Each literary agent they contact has a 20% chance of agreeing to represent one of their novels. If the novelist contacts 15 different literary agents, how many agents can they expect to agree to represent at least one of their novels?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of literary agents who agree to represent at least one of the novelist's novels. We can approach this by considering the probability of an agent agreeing to represent any one of the three novels. Step-by-Step Solution:1. Probability for One Novel:   - Each literary agent has a 20% chance of agreeing to represent one particular novel, i.e., ( P(text{agree for one novel}) = 0.2 ).2. Probability for At Least One Novel:   - The probability ( P(text{not agree for one novel}) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 ).   - If we assume the decision to represent each novel is independent, the probability that an agent does not agree to represent any of the three novels is:     [     P(text{not agree for any of the three novels}) = 0.8 times 0.8 times 0.8 = 0.8^3     ]   - Calculate ( 0.8^3 ):     [     0.8^3 = 0.512     ]   - Therefore, the probability that an agent agrees to represent at least one novel is:     [     P(text{agree for at least one novel}) = 1 - 0.512 = 0.488     ]3. Expected Number of Agents:   - There are 15 literary agents, and the expected number of agents who agree to represent at least one novel is:     [     text{Expected number} = 15 times 0.488     ]   - Calculate:     [     15 times 0.488 = 7.32     ]Hence, the novelist can expect about 7.32 literary agents to agree to represent at least one of their novels.

This means:  - 2nd movie: 1st movie + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9  - 3rd movie: 2nd movie + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10  - 4th movie: 7 (already rated)  - 5th movie: 4th movie + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8  - 6th movie: 5th movie + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9  - 7th movie: 9 (already rated)  - 8th movie: 7th movie + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10  - 9th movie: 8th movie + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11  - 10th movie: 9th movie + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12Step 3: Eleventh Movie- The 11th movie improves by 1 point over the 10th movie.  - 11th movie: 10th movie + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13Step 4: Calculate the Average Rating- Now, calculate the average rating for the first 11 movies:  - Ratings: 8, 9, 10, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13- Sum of the ratings = 8 + 9 + 10 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 106- Number of movies = 11- Average rating = Sum of ratings / Number of movies = 106 / 11 = 9.63636...Final Answer# 9.64"},{"question":"You are a tenant who pays 1,200 in rent each month. Recently, you lost your job and have only 3,600 in savings to cover your expenses. You are determined to find a new job within 3 months. Additionally, your monthly expenses for groceries and utilities are 400. If you use your savings to cover only rent and these basic expenses, how much of your savings will be left after 3 months?","answer":"To determine how much of your savings will be left after 3 months, we will first calculate the total expenses for rent and basic needs over this period.1. Calculate the total rent for 3 months:   - Monthly rent is 1,200.   - Rent for 3 months = 1,200/month * 3 months = 3,600.2. Calculate the total expenses for groceries and utilities for 3 months:   - Monthly expenses for groceries and utilities are 400.   - Expenses for 3 months = 400/month * 3 months = 1,200.3.

One afternoon, she decides to organize a painting session using different colors of finger paints. Emily has 5 different colors of paint bottles, and she plans to use 3 colors for each painting activity. If she wants to prepare 4 separate painting activities for Alex using different combinations of the colors each time, how many colors in total will she use across all activities?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine in how many different ways Emily can choose 3 colors out of 5 for each painting activity and ensure that she has 4 different combinations. We will then calculate how many unique colors are used across all four painting activities. Step-by-Step Solution:1. Calculate Combinations:   - Emily has 5 different colors and wants to choose 3 for each activity.   - The number of ways to choose 3 colors out of 5 is given by the combination formula ( binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} ), where ( n ) is the total number of items to choose from, and ( r ) is the number of items to choose.      [   binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3! cdot 2!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10   ]   So, there are 10 different combinations of 3 colors from a set of 5 colors.2. Choose 4 Different Combinations:   - Out of the 10 possible combinations, Emily needs to select 4 different combinations. Since any 4 combinations will involve the use of all 5 colors at least once, we can simply select any 4 combinations from the 10 available.   3. Ensure All Colors are Used:   - Since there are only 5 colors in total and each combination uses 3 colors, choosing any 4 distinct combinations from the 10 possible will cover all 5 colors at least once.4.

In the city, he decided to start a small business selling fresh produce from the local market. On his first day, John bought 30 apples and 20 oranges. He sold the apples at 2 each and the oranges at 1.50 each. However, because he is new to the market, he sold only 80% of the apples and 75% of the oranges. How much money did John make from selling the apples and oranges on his first day?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the revenue John made from selling the apples and oranges.Step-by-step Solution:1. Calculate the number of apples sold:   - John bought 30 apples.   - He sold 80% of these apples.   - Number of apples sold = 0.8 * 30 = 24 apples.2. Calculate the total revenue from apples:   - Each apple is sold for 2.   - Total revenue from apples = 24 apples * 2/apple = 48.3. Calculate the number of oranges sold:   - John bought 20 oranges.   - He sold 75% of these oranges.   - Number of oranges sold = 0.75 * 20 = 15 oranges.4. Calculate the total revenue from oranges:   - Each orange is sold for 1.50.   - Total revenue from oranges = 15 oranges * 1.50/orange = 22.50.5. Calculate the total revenue from both apples and oranges:   - Total revenue = Revenue from apples + Revenue from oranges   - Total revenue = 48 + 22.50 = 70.50.Therefore, John made a total of # 70.50 # from selling the apples and oranges on his first day."},{"question":"A venture capitalist is excited about the potential of quantum machine learning and decides to invest in three different startups working in this field.
