He plans to watch all eight seasons of the show. Each season has an average of 22 episodes, and each episode is approximately 21 minutes long. If Jake takes a 5-minute break after every 3 episodes and wants to finish watching the entire series in a single weekend (Saturday and Sunday), how many total hours will he spend watching \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\\" during the marathon?","answer":"To determine how many total hours Jake will spend watching \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\\" during the marathon, we need to follow these steps:1. Calculate the Total Number of Episodes:   - There are 8 seasons.   - Each season has an average of 22 episodes.   - Total episodes = 8 seasons × 22 episodes/season = 176 episodes.2. Calculate the Total Watching Time Without Breaks:   - Each episode is approximately 21 minutes long.   - Total minutes spent watching episodes = 176 episodes × 21 minutes/episode = 3696 minutes.3. Determine the Number of Breaks:   - Jake takes a 5-minute break after every 3 episodes.   - Total number of breaks = Total episodes ÷ 3 episodes/break = 176 ÷ 3 = 58 breaks (since 176 ÷ 3 is 58 with a remainder, Jake will not take a break after the last 2 episodes).4. Calculate the Total Break Time:   - Each break is 5 minutes long.   - Total break time = 58 breaks × 5 minutes/break = 290 minutes.5. Calculate the Total Time Spent Including Breaks:   - Total time in minutes = Total watching time + Total break time = 3696 minutes + 290 minutes = 3986 minutes.6. Convert Total Time to Hours:   - 1 hour = 60 minutes.   - Total hours = Total time in minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3986 ÷ 60 ≈ 66.4333 hours.7. Round the Total Hours:   - Since Jake needs to finish during the weekend, and fractional hours might be interpreted as needing to round up for planning purposes, we consider the total time in full hours.Thus, the total time Jake will spend watching the series during the marathon is approximately 66.43 hours, but for practical purposes, we can say he will spend:# 66 hours"},{"question":"Alex is a college student from Spain studying abroad in the United States.

You plan to watch 3 episodes each day. On weekends, you double your pace and watch 6 episodes each day. If you start watching both series from the first episode on a Monday, how many full weeks will it take you to finish watching all the episodes?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of episodes and then determine how many days it will take to watch all episodes by following the given schedule.Step 1: Calculate the total number of episodes.The number of episodes in the original series is 720, and the number of episodes in the sequel is 500.Total episodes = 720 (original series) + 500 (sequel series) = 1220 episodes.Step 2: Determine the weekly watching schedule.- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), you watch 3 episodes per day.- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), you watch 6 episodes per day.Let's calculate the total number of episodes watched in one week:- Weekdays: 5 days × 3 episodes/day = 15 episodes.- Weekends: 2 days × 6 episodes/day = 12 episodes.Total episodes in one week = 15 (weekdays) + 12 (weekends) = 27 episodes.Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks needed to watch all episodes.To find the number of full weeks required, divide the total number of episodes by the number of episodes watched per week:Total weeks = Total episodes / Episodes per week = 1220 episodes / 27 episodes/week.Calculating the division: 1220 ÷ 27 ≈ 45.185Since we need full weeks to complete the series, we take the ceiling of this division to ensure all episodes are watched within complete weeks.So, we need 46 weeks (since 45 weeks would not be enough to complete all episodes).Step 4: ConclusionTherefore, it will take 46 full weeks to finish watching all the episodes.# 46"},{"question":"Principal Taylor at Gosforth Academy is organizing a special safety and wellness day for all students.

After listening, he realizes that he has played a total of 22 songs, including repeats. How many times did he play the 12th song?","answer":"To solve this problem, let's first define the variables and understand the situation clearly.1. Define Variables:   - Let ( x_i ) be the number of times the ( i )-th song is played.   - We know that:     - ( x_1 = 3 ) (The first song is played 3 times)     - ( x_2 = 2 ) (The second song is played 2 times)     - ( x_3, x_4, ldots, x_{12} = 1 ) (Each of the remaining songs is played once)2. Equation for Total Plays:   - The fan plays a total of 22 songs, including repeats. This translates to the equation:     [     x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ldots + x_{12} = 22     ]3.

If she wants to use the same number of beads for each bracelet, how many beads will each bracelet have?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beads Lily has in total and then divide those beads evenly among the bracelets she plans to make.Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads.Lily received 24 beads as a gift and found 15 more beads in her backpack. To find the total number of beads, we add these two quantities together:[ 24 + 15 = 39 ]So, Lily has a total of 39 beads.Step 2: Determine the number of bracelets.Lily wants to make bracelets for herself and her 3 foster siblings. This means she wants to make a total of:[ 1 (Lily) + 3 (foster siblings) = 4 ]So, she needs to make 4 bracelets.Step 3: Divide the total number of beads by the number of bracelets.To find out how many beads each bracelet will have, we divide the total number of beads by the number of bracelets:[ frac{39}{4} = 9.75 ]Since Lily cannot use a fraction of a bead, she can use only whole beads for each bracelet. Therefore, she can use 9 beads for each bracelet, and there will be some beads left over.Step 4: Calculate leftover beads.To find out how many beads will be left over, we calculate the remainder of the division:[ 39 div 4 = 9 text{ remainder } 3 ]Thus, Lily can use 9 beads per bracelet and will have 3 beads left over.# 9"},{"question":"Jamie is an experienced web developer who recently worked on integrating Facebook's Open Graph for a new project. In this project, Jamie had to fetch data from 5 different Facebook pages to display on a website. Each page fetch required a set of 4 API calls. For each successful API call, Jamie receives a notification. Unfortunately, 3 API calls failed due to network issues, and Jamie had to resend those calls, which were successful on the second attempt. How many notifications did Jamie receive in total for all the successful API calls?","answer":"To determine the total number of notifications Jamie received for all the successful API calls, let's break down the problem step-by-step:1. Total API Calls Required: Jamie needs to fetch data from 5 different Facebook pages, and each page requires 4 API calls. Therefore, the total number of API calls initially required is:   [   5 text{ pages} times 4 text{ API calls per page} = 20 text{ API calls}   ]2. Successful API Calls in the First Attempt: Out of the 20 API calls, 3 calls failed due to network issues. This means that:   [   20 text{ total calls} - 3 text{ failed calls} = 17 text{ successful calls on the first attempt}   ]3. Resending the Failed API Calls: Jamie resends the 3 failed API calls, and they are successful on the second attempt. Therefore, there are:   [   3 text{ successful calls on the second attempt}   ]4. Total Successful API Calls: Adding the successful calls from the first and second attempts gives us the total successful API calls:   [   17 text{ (first attempt)} + 3 text{ (second attempt)} = 20 text{ successful calls}   ]5. Notifications Received: Jamie receives a notification for each successful API call. Therefore, the total number of notifications received is equal to the total number of successful API calls, which is 20.Thus, Jamie received a total of 20 notifications for all the successful API calls.Final answer:# 20"},{"question":"Sarah and Jake love to shop for their pet hamster, Nibbles.

Understand the Problem:   - Total number of books in the collection: 42   - Number of books written by Philippe Besson: 18   - Number of books written by other authors: 42 - 18 = 242. Determine the Number of Authors:   - Let ( x ) be the total number of authors, including Philippe Besson.   - Each author's books need to be used equally. Therefore, the number of books per author must be the same.3. Equal Distribution of Books Across Authors:   - The total number of books (42) must be divisible by the number of authors (( x )).   - The number of books per author is ( frac{42}{x} ).4. Consider Philippe Besson's Contribution:   - Philippe Besson has 18 books.   - Therefore, if one of the authors is Philippe Besson, then the number of books per author must also divide 18.5. Find Common Divisors:   - We need a number ( x ) such that 42 is divisible by ( x ) and 18 is divisible by ( frac{42}{x} ).6. Divisors of 42:   - The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.7.

They reminisced about their time in service and came up with a plan to honor their platoon by planting a total of 50 vegetable plants, with each plant representing a member of their unit.They decided to plant the garden in two sections: one section for tomatoes and another for cucumbers. They agreed to plant 3 times as many tomato plants as cucumber plants. How many cucumber plants and how many tomato plants do they need to plant to reach their goal of 50 plants in total?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's define the variables first:- Let ( x ) be the number of cucumber plants.- Since they decided to plant 3 times as many tomato plants as cucumber plants, the number of tomato plants will be ( 3x ).According to the problem, the total number of plants (cucumbers and tomatoes combined) is 50. Therefore, we can write the equation:[x + 3x = 50]Simplify the equation:[4x = 50]To find ( x ), divide both sides of the equation by 4:[x = frac{50}{4} = 12.5]The solution ( x = 12.5 ) does not make sense in a real-world context because we cannot plant a fractional number of plants. Let's reconsider the problem.Upon reviewing the problem, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the setup. Let's try again:1. Define Variables:   - Let ( c ) be the number of cucumber plants.   - Then, the number of tomato plants is ( 3c ).2. Set up the Equation:   [   c + 3c = 50   ]3. Combine Like Terms:   [   4c = 50   ]4. Solve for ( c ):   [   c = frac{50}{4} = 12.5   ]We encounter the same issue. This suggests that we should check the context again. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or in understanding. Let's assume the setup and solution are correct based on the logical interpretation given initially:1. Re-evaluate:   - If ( c = 12.5 ) is indeed the solution for cucumber plants, then that would result in ( 3 times 12.5 = 37.5 ) tomato plants. However, this doesn't work in practical terms.2. Re-confirm:   - Let's try rounding the cucumber plants to the nearest whole number that works:     - If cucumbers ( c = 12 ), then tomatoes ( = 3 times 12 = 36 ).     - Total = ( 12 + 36 = 48 ), which is incorrect.     - If cucumbers ( c = 13 ), then tomatoes ( = 3 times 13 = 39 ).     - Total = ( 13 + 39 = 52 ), which is incorrect.     - Upon review, let's try logical deduction:     - The solution ( c = 10 ) gives:       - Cucumbers ( = 10 )       - Tomatoes ( = 3 times 10 = 30 )       - Total = ( 10 + 30 = 40 ), incorrect.     - Solution ( c = 15 ) gives:       - Cucumbers ( = 15 )       - Tomatoes ( = 3 times 15 = 45 )       - Total = ( 15 + 45 = 60 ), incorrect.3. Reassess and Correct:   - Based on the logical check, the initial solution was indeed solving correctly mathematically, but due to the error in problem understanding, the scenario was revisited, and upon trying different values, we reassessed toward logical rounds and tried:     - If cucumbers ( = 10 )     - Tomatoes ( = 30 )     - Total = ( 10 + 30 = 40 ), which mathematically should not work, but the setup gives a hint that realistic solutions should be approached via integer checks.Ultimately, the solution attempts to arrive at a logical conclusion, but any potential setup error or misread is clarified:The integer solution provided initially should be approached practically, but upon checks:# Final Answer: Cucumber Plants = 12, Tomato Plants = 36. (If rounding is applied to closely match expectations.)"},{"question":"In the Arctic, a polar bear needs to travel from one patch of ice to another to find food.

The model consists of a series of interlocking cubes. Each cube has an edge length of 3 meters. If the architect uses a total of 12 cubes to create the model, how many square meters of surface area is visible from the outside of the entire structure, assuming no cubes are fully enclosed within the structure?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total visible surface area of the interlocking cubes. Let's go through the problem step by step:1. Understand the problem: We have 12 cubes, each with an edge length of 3 meters. We need to find out the visible surface area of these cubes when they are interlocking and none are fully enclosed.2. Calculate the surface area of a single cube:    - The surface area of a cube with edge length (a) is given by the formula (6a^2).   - For a cube with edge length of 3 meters:      [     6 times 3^2 = 6 times 9 = 54 text{ square meters.}     ]3. Calculate the total surface area of 12 separate cubes:   - If all cubes were separate and not interlocked, the total surface area would be:     [     12 times 54 = 648 text{ square meters.}     ]4. Consider the interlocking of cubes:   - When cubes are interlocked, some faces will not be visible because they are touching other cubes.   - Each face of a cube that is touching another cube reduces the visible surface area by (9) square meters, as each face of a cube has an area of (3 times 3 = 9) square meters.5. Determine visibility reduction due to interlocking:   - The problem states that no cubes are fully enclosed, meaning at least one face of each cube must be visible.   - Without specific arrangements, we assume a general case where the cubes are arranged to maximize efficiency without any being fully enclosed. This could typically mean a cluster where some cubes share faces.6. Estimate visibility:   - In practical scenarios like this, about half of the faces might typically be exposed if arranged in a compact form (like a larger cuboid).   - For a rough estimate, we can assume that each cube loses visibility of approximately 2 faces on average (sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the arrangement).7. Calculate the reduced total visible surface area:   - If each cube loses visibility of 2 faces, the reduction in visible area is:     [     12 times 2 times 9 = 216 text{ square meters.}     ]   - Thus, the visible surface area is:     [     648 - 216 = 432 text{ square meters.}     ]# 432"},{"question":"Jamie, a passionate advocate for food security, is working with a local bakery to provide meals for those in need.

Dr. Green wants to calculate the total energy saved in a 30-day month by switching from the older system to the new system. How many kWh of energy does House B save compared to House A over the month?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the energy saved by House B compared to House A over a 30-day month. We can do this by following these steps:1. Determine daily energy savings:     The daily energy usage of House A's HVAC system is 10 kWh, while House B's system uses 7 kWh.     The daily energy savings by using House B's system instead of House A's system is:     [   text{Daily Energy Savings} = 10 , text{kWh} - 7 , text{kWh} = 3 , text{kWh}   ]2. Calculate monthly energy savings:     Since the daily energy savings is 3 kWh, we can find the total energy saved over a 30-day month by multiplying the daily savings by the number of days in the month:     [   text{Monthly Energy Savings} = 3 , text{kWh/day} times 30 , text{days} = 90 , text{kWh}   ]Therefore, by switching from the older HVAC system to the new energy-efficient system, House B saves 90 kWh of energy over a 30-day month.# 90 kWh"},{"question":"Sarah is a down-to-earth, middle-aged mom who prefers practical solutions over trendy gadgets. She decides to bake her own bread instead of buying an expensive new bread maker. Sarah plans to bake bread for her family and friends for a simple gathering. She estimates that each loaf of bread requires 4 cups of flour. Sarah has a 20-cup bag of flour in her pantry.

Also, how many hours will Alex have left for other commitments after updating the systems each week?","answer":"To solve this problem, we'll first determine how many hours Alex will spend on each system per week. Then, we'll calculate the total hours spent on each system over the 4-week period and the remaining hours Alex will have each week for other commitments. Step-by-Step Solution1. Weekly Allocation of Hours:   - Alex can dedicate a total of 15 hours per week to updating systems.   - System A requires 8 hours per week.   - System B requires 6 hours per week.   - System C requires 5 hours per week.2. Weekly Hours Check:   - Total hours required per week by all systems = 8 (System A) + 6 (System B) + 5 (System C) = 19 hours.   - Alex can only spend 15 hours per week on these systems. Therefore, Alex will not be able to fully update all systems as planned.3. Adjusting Hours to Fit the 15-Hour Limit:   - Since Alex cannot exceed 15 hours, we need to proportionally adjust the hours spent on each system.   - Calculate the fraction of total required hours that can be spent:      [     text{Fraction of available time} = frac{15}{19}     ]4. Adjusted Weekly Hours for Each System:   - System A: (8 times frac{15}{19} = frac{120}{19} approx 6.32) hours per week   - System B: (6 times frac{15}{19} = frac{90}{19} approx 4.74) hours per week   - System C: (5 times frac{15}{19} = frac{75}{19} approx 3.95) hours per week5.

The revenue from consulting services was 250,000, which was 40% of the total revenue.2. The total revenue for the company was 625,000.3. Revenue from investment advisory was twice the revenue from financial planning.Let's break down the solution step-by-step:1. Determine the total revenue from consulting services:   We know that consulting services revenue is 250,000, and it represents 40% of the total revenue. Let's verify this calculation:   [   text{Total Revenue} times 0.40 = 250,000    ]   [   625,000 times 0.40 = 250,000    ]   The calculation confirms that the consulting services revenue is indeed 40% of the total revenue.2.

Each month, Alex assesses the potential impacts on business operations due to different risk factors like weather, transportation issues, and market fluctuations. This month, Alex has quantified the following potential risks:- Weather-related disruptions could cause a 10% delay in shipments.- Transportation issues might lead to an additional 5% delay.- Market fluctuations could reduce overall demand, causing a 3% decrease in sales.If the company normally ships 1,000 units a month and expects to sell each unit for 50, what is the potential decrease in revenue this month due to these risks? Calculate the total potential decrease in revenue by considering the sum of delays and the reduction in sales.","answer":"To calculate the potential decrease in revenue due to the risks outlined by Alex, we'll break down the problem into steps related to shipment delays and sales reduction.1. Calculate the potential impact of shipment delays:   - The company normally ships 1,000 units each month.    - Weather-related disruptions could cause a 10% delay, and transportation issues might lead to an additional 5% delay.    - These delays are additive, meaning the total potential shipment delay is 10% + 5% = 15%.   Therefore, the number of units potentially delayed is:   [   text{Delayed units} = 1,000 times 0.15 = 150 text{ units}   ]2. Calculate the potential impact on revenue due to delayed shipments:   - The units that are delayed may not be sold this month, directly impacting revenue.   - The revenue loss from delayed shipments is:   [   text{Loss from delays} = 150 times 50 = 7,500   ]3. Calculate the potential impact of reduced sales due to market fluctuations:   - Market fluctuations could reduce overall demand, causing a 3% decrease in sales.   - This reduction is independent of the shipment delays.   Therefore, the number of units lost in sales is:   [   text{Reduced sales units} = 1,000 times 0.03 = 30 text{ units}   ]4. Calculate the potential impact on revenue due to reduced sales:   - The revenue loss from reduced sales is:   [   text{Loss from reduced sales} = 30 times 50 = 1,500   ]5.

However, due to a penalty related to player misconduct, they lost 5 points from their total score in one of the games. If the total score for these 5 games was originally 125 points before the penalty, how many points did they score in the game where the penalty occurred?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points the Houston Texans scored in the game where the penalty occurred, given that they lost 5 points due to the penalty.Let's break down the problem step-by-step:1. Understand the given information:   - The total score for the 5 games before any penalty was applied is 125 points.   - The penalty reduced their total score by 5 points in one of the games.   - The average score per game over these 5 games is 24 points after the penalty.2. Calculate the total score after the penalty:   - Since the average score after the penalty is 24 points per game, for 5 games, the total score after the penalty is:     [     24 , text{points/game} times 5 , text{games} = 120 , text{points}     ]3. Determine the points lost due to the penalty:   - The total score before the penalty was 125 points.   - The total score after the penalty is 120 points.   - Therefore, the penalty reduced the total score by:     [     125 , text{points} - 120 , text{points} = 5 , text{points}     ]4. Find the score in the game where the penalty occurred:   - Let ( x ) be the original score in the game where the penalty occurred.   - After the penalty, the score in that game becomes ( x - 5 ).   - The total score for the remaining 4 games is 125 points minus the score in the penalized game:     [     125 - x     ]   - The total score after the penalty is 120 points.

This week, Alex wants to transcribe enough arrangements so that each of the 3 musicians can give feedback on all of them. If each arrangement takes Alex 2 hours to transcribe, how many hours will Alex spend transcribing arrangements this week?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many music arrangements Alex needs to transcribe so that each of the 3 musicians can give feedback on all of them.1. Determine the total feedback needed for each musician:   Each musician gives feedback on an average of 4 arrangements per week. However, this week Alex wants each musician to give feedback on all the arrangements transcribed. 2. Calculate the number of arrangements needed:   Since there are 3 musicians, and each should give feedback on all arrangements, the number of arrangements Alex needs to transcribe is equal to the number of arrangements each musician will give feedback on.      Therefore, Alex needs to transcribe ( x ) arrangements such that each of the 3 musicians gives feedback on those ( x ) arrangements.      Since all 3 musicians need to give feedback on all arrangements, we don't multiply the number of arrangements by 3. Instead, we just need to have enough arrangements so that each musician can give feedback on all of them.3. Calculate the total arrangements needed:   Since we want each musician to give feedback on all ( x ) arrangements, ( x ) is simply the number of arrangements transcribed that all 3 will review. Hence, ( x = x ).       We know from the problem statement that Alex wants feedback on all arrangements from each musician without explicitly mentioning a specific number. However, the context implies that the number of arrangements Alex wants feedback on is equal to the number of new arrangements he transcribes for the musicians to review.4. Calculate the time needed for transcription:   Each arrangement takes Alex 2 hours to transcribe.      If Alex transcribes ( x ) arrangements, the total time spent will be:   [   text{Total time} = x times 2 text{ hours}   ]5. Determine ( x ):   Since each musician can provide feedback on all arrangements, and the feedback quantity isn't specifically altered from the average, assume the musicians will give feedback on an equal number of new arrangements Alex transcribes in a typical review cycle. Therefore, ( x = 5 ), as Alex transcribes 5 new arrangements weekly.6.

He believes that when soldiers work together, they achieve far more than when they act alone. During a training exercise, he notices that 5 squads of soldiers, each squad consisting of 8 soldiers, can build a defensive trench in 2 hours when they work together. However, if each soldier tries to work individually, they can only dig 2 feet of trench per hour. If the entire trench needs to be 80 feet long, how much time would it take for all 40 soldiers working individually to complete the trench? How much time do they save by working as a united team instead?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:1. Determine the total trench length built by the team:   - Total trench length needed = 80 feet.2. Calculate the trench length built by the team working together:   - Total soldiers = 5 squads × 8 soldiers/squad = 40 soldiers.   - The team can build the entire trench in 2 hours when working together.3. Determine the trench length each soldier can dig individually:   - Each soldier digs 2 feet of trench per hour.4. Calculate how much trench 40 soldiers can dig in 1 hour individually:   - Total trench dug by 40 soldiers in 1 hour = 40 soldiers × 2 feet/soldier/hour = 80 feet/hour.5. Calculate the time needed for all soldiers working individually:   - Since 40 soldiers can dig 80 feet in 1 hour, the time required for them to dig 80 feet individually is 1 hour.6. Determine the time saved by working as a team:   - Time taken by the team working together = 2 hours.   - Time taken by soldiers working individually = 1 hour.   - Time saved by working together = 2 hours (team) - 1 hour (individual) = 1 hour.By following these steps, we find that working individually, the soldiers take 1 hour to complete the trench.

Distribute the Stories Equally Among the Villages:   The storyteller plans to share these stories with 3 neighboring villages. To find out how many stories each village will receive, we divide the total number of stories by the number of villages:   [   frac{20 text{ stories}}{3 text{ villages}} = frac{20}{3} approx 6.67   ]Since each village must receive a whole number of stories, we need to interpret the division result in a way that makes sense in the context. The division shows that it is impossible to divide the 20 stories perfectly equally among the 3 villages in terms of whole stories. A practical approach would be to give 6 stories to each village, and then distribute the remaining 2 stories (since (6 times 3 = 18) and (20 - 18 = 2)) among the villages as best as possible, perhaps by giving the extra stories to two of the villages.However, based on the requirement that each village receives an equal number of stories, if we strictly need equal distribution, we could say each village receives 6 stories, and two stories remain undistributed or handled differently.3.

Policy A is expected to increase the town's monthly revenue by 450 each month. Policy B, on the other hand, is projected to boost the monthly revenue by 300 initially and then increase by an additional 50 every subsequent month. Dr. Rational wants to determine after how many months the total revenue generated by both policies will be equal. Can you help Dr. Rational find after how many months the two policies will generate the same total revenue?","answer":"To solve this problem, we start by defining variables and expressions for the revenues generated by each policy over time. Let ( n ) be the number of months.Policy A:- The revenue increases by 450 each month.- Therefore, the total revenue after ( n ) months is given by:  [  R_A(n) = 450n  ]Policy B:- The initial revenue in the first month is 300, and it increases by 50 each subsequent month.- Therefore, the revenue in the first month is 300, in the second month is 350, in the third month is 400, and so forth.- This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( a = 300 ) and a common difference ( d = 50 ).- The revenue in the ( n )-th month is given by:  [  R_B(n) = 300 + (n-1) times 50 = 300 + 50n - 50 = 50n + 250  ]- The total revenue after ( n ) months is the sum of the first ( n ) terms of this arithmetic sequence:  [  R_B(n) = frac{n}{2} times (text{first term} + text{last term})  ]  The last term is ( 50n + 250 ), so:  [  R_B(n) = frac{n}{2} times (300 + (50n + 250))  ]  Simplifying:  [  R_B(n) = frac{n}{2} times (50n + 550)  ]  [  R_B(n) = frac{n}{2} times 50n + frac{n}{2} times 550  ]  [  R_B(n) = 25n^2 + 275n  ]Next, we set the total revenue from both policies equal to each other and solve for ( n ):[450n = 25n^2 + 275n]Subtract ( 450n ) from both sides:[0 = 25n^2 + 275n - 450n][0 = 25n^2 - 175n]Factor out the common term ( 25n ):[0 = 25n(n - 7)]This gives us two solutions:1. ( 25n = 0 ) implies ( n = 0 ).2.

They bring 3 flags and 5 banners each to wave during the matches. After the first half of the season, they decide to increase their spirit by doubling the number of flags and adding 2 more banners each for the remaining games. By the end of the season, how many flags and banners did they bring in total?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flags and banners brought by the superfans over the course of the entire season. We will break down the problem into two halves: the first half of the season and the second half of the season.1. Understanding the initial setup:   - There are 15 superfans.   - Initially, each superfan brings 3 flags and 5 banners.2. Calculating for the first half of the season:   - Since each superfan brings 3 flags, the total number of flags for the first half is:     [     15 text{ superfans} times 3 text{ flags per superfan} = 45 text{ flags}     ]   - Since each superfan brings 5 banners, the total number of banners for the first half is:     [     15 text{ superfans} times 5 text{ banners per superfan} = 75 text{ banners}     ]3. Calculating for the second half of the season:   - In the second half, each superfan doubles the number of flags they bring, so each brings (3 times 2 = 6) flags. Thus, the total number of flags for the second half is:     [     15 text{ superfans} times 6 text{ flags per superfan} = 90 text{ flags}     ]   - Each superfan adds 2 more banners, so each brings (5 + 2 = 7) banners. Thus, the total number of banners for the second half is:     [     15 text{ superfans} times 7 text{ banners per superfan} = 105 text{ banners}     ]4. Calculating the total number of flags and banners for the entire season:   - Total flags for the whole season:     [     45 text{ flags (first half)} + 90 text{ flags (second half)} = 135 text{ flags}     ]   - Total banners for the whole season:     [     75 text{ banners (first half)} + 105 text{ banners (second half)} = 180 text{ banners}     ]Therefore, by the end of the season, the superfans brought a total of 135 flags and 180 banners.# 135 flags and 180 banners"},{"question":"Alex is a young college student studying computer science and volunteers as a computer tutor at the local library.
