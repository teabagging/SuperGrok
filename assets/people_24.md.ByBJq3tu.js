He wants to enjoy nature and avoid crowded places, so he decides not to use any popular campgrounds managed by large institutions. Instead, he finds a small private campground owned by a local farmer. The campground charges 15 per night for a tent space and 3 per person per night. John, his wife, and their two kids will be going on the trip. They plan to camp for 3 nights. John is also bringing along his trusty fishing rod, and he estimates that by fishing in the nearby river, he will save 5 per meal for their family, since they won't need to buy as many groceries. They plan to have 2 meals a day using the fish he catches.Calculate the total cost for John and his family to stay at the campground for 3 nights, factoring in the savings from John's fishing.","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the camping trip and then factor in the savings from fishing. Step-by-step Solution:1. Calculate the cost of the tent space:   - The campground charges 15 per night for a tent space.   - They are staying for 3 nights.   - Total cost for the tent space = 15/night × 3 nights = 45.2. Calculate the cost per person:   - The campground charges 3 per person per night.   - There are 4 people (John, his wife, and their two kids).   - They are staying for 3 nights.   - Total cost per person for 3 nights = 3/person/night × 3 nights = 9/person.   - Total cost for all people = 9/person × 4 people = 36.3. Calculate the total campground cost:   - Total campground cost = Cost of tent space + Cost for all people   - Total campground cost = 45 + 36 = 81.4. Calculate the savings from fishing:   - John estimates saving 5 per meal for their family by fishing.   - They plan to have 2 meals a day using the fish.   - They are staying for 3 nights, which implies 3 days (assuming they have 2 meals per day).   - Total savings from fishing = 5/meal × 2 meals/day × 3 days = 30.5.

They plan to adapt a classic novel into a comic book series that will have several volumes. Each volume is intended to cover 5 chapters of the novel. The novel they have chosen has a total of 25 chapters. If Alex can illustrate 2 chapters in a week and Sam can write the script for 3 chapters in a week, how many weeks will it take for them to complete the entire adaptation, considering they work simultaneously?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for both Alex and Sam to complete their tasks so that the entire comic book series is finished.1. Determine the Number of Volumes:   - The novel has a total of 25 chapters.   - Each volume covers 5 chapters.   - Therefore, the number of volumes required is:     [     frac{25 text{ chapters}}{5 text{ chapters per volume}} = 5 text{ volumes}     ]2. Calculate the Time for Alex to Illustrate:   - Alex can illustrate 2 chapters in a week.   - There are 25 chapters to illustrate.   - Therefore, the number of weeks Alex will need to illustrate all chapters is:     [     frac{25 text{ chapters}}{2 text{ chapters per week}} = 12.5 text{ weeks}     ]   - Since Alex cannot work for a fraction of a week, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13 weeks.3. Calculate the Time for Sam to Write the Script:   - Sam can write the script for 3 chapters in a week.   - There are 25 chapters to script.   - Therefore, the number of weeks Sam will need to script all chapters is:     [     frac{25 text{ chapters}}{3 text{ chapters per week}} approx 8.33 text{ weeks}     ]   - Since Sam cannot work for a fraction of a week, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 9 weeks.4. Determine the Total Time When Working Simultaneously:   - Since Alex and Sam are working simultaneously, the total time required is determined by the task that takes the longest time.   - Alex takes 13 weeks, and Sam takes 9 weeks.   - Therefore, the total time required to complete the project is the maximum of these two times:     [     max(13 text{ weeks}, 9 text{ weeks}) = 13 text{ weeks}     ]Thus, it will take them 13 weeks to complete the entire adaptation.# 13"},{"question":"Maria owns a small coffee shop in St. Louis and strongly supports a high minimum wage for her employees.

One sunny weekend, Alex decides to ride along a 240-mile stretch of the famous highway. He starts his journey at 8:00 AM and plans to take breaks at three scenic spots along the way. At each stop, Alex takes a 20-minute break to enjoy the view and snap some pictures. He rides his motorcycle at a steady speed of 60 miles per hour. If Alex wants to complete his journey by 4:00 PM, what time should he leave the last scenic spot to ensure he finishes on time?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Alex will spend on his journey, including his riding time and breaks, and figure out what time he should leave the last scenic spot to arrive by 4:00 PM.Let's break down the problem step-by-step:1. Calculate the total riding time:     The total distance Alex needs to cover is 240 miles, and he rides at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The time ( t ) in hours that it takes to cover this distance is given by the formula:   [   t = frac{text{distance}}{text{speed}} = frac{240 text{ miles}}{60 text{ miles per hour}} = 4 text{ hours}   ]2. Calculate the total break time:     Alex takes three 20-minute breaks. The total time spent on breaks is:   [   3 times 20 text{ minutes} = 60 text{ minutes} = 1 text{ hour}   ]3. Calculate the total journey time:     The total time for the journey includes both riding and break times:   [   4 text{ hours (riding)} + 1 text{ hour (breaks)} = 5 text{ hours}   ]4. Determine the departure time from the last stop:     Alex wants to complete his journey by 4:00 PM. Thus, he should finish riding at 4:00 PM. Since the total journey time is 5 hours, we need to calculate the time when he should begin the last 60-mile segment of his ride. Subtracting the total journey time from the finish time gives the start time:   [   text{Departure time from the starting point} = 4:00 text{ PM} - 5 text{ hours} = 11:00 text{ AM}   ]   However, we need to account for the fact that he needs to continue riding after the third scenic spot. Since the break after the third scenic spot is already included in the total break time, Alex should leave the last scenic spot after taking his break at 11:00 AM.5. Calculate the time to leave the last scenic spot:     After his break at the last scenic spot, Alex resumes riding for the final hour (60 miles at 60 mph), so he should leave the last scenic spot at 3:00 PM to arrive by 4:00 PM.#3:00 PM"},{"question":"Lars is a Norwegian engineer with a large family scattered across Norway, and he loves taking road trips to see them.

If the practice session is scheduled to last exactly 2 hours, how many practice sessions does Coach Müller need to plan so that every pair gets to play against every other pair?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many unique pairs can be formed from the 12 players and how many matches are necessary for each pair to play against every other pair. Step 1: Calculate the number of unique pairsThe number of ways to choose 2 players from 12 is given by the combination formula:[binom{12}{2} = frac{12 times 11}{2 times 1} = 66]So, there are 66 unique pairs that can be formed from 12 players. Step 2: Calculate the number of matches neededFor each pair to play against every other pair exactly once, we need to use the concept of combinations again. We need to form matches between these pairs.For each match, 2 pairs are needed, and we want every pair to play against every other pair. So, we need to determine how many matches can be played with these pairs. The number of matches is the number of ways to choose 2 pairs from 66:[binom{66}{2} = frac{66 times 65}{2} = 2145]This interpretation is incorrect because it counts each match multiple times. Instead, we need to consider that each pair (from 66 pairs) needs to play against the others. Step 3: Correct approachLet's reconsider: We need to pair up all pairs, but since each pair can only play against another pair once, the number of matches necessary is the number of pairs divided by the number of pairs involved in one match. Actually, we miscalculated. Instead, we should think about matches involving pairs. Let's analyze using smaller numbers.Each unique match features two pairs. For 12 players, each player can pair with 11 others, making 66 pairs. But we need to determine how many matches.With 6 pairs (12 players), we actually need not the above method but to consider direct matching.  Step 4: Determine matches in a practical senseIf we have 12 players, we split into 6 matches (6 pairs, each pair plays once). For 12 players, each player is in exactly one pair, and each pair plays against 5 others, so half of 6*5 rounds (since it's double counting):[frac{6 times 5}{2} = 15 text{ matches needed}] Step 5: Calculate the total time required for all matchesEach match lasts for 15 minutes. Therefore, the total time required for all matches is:[15 text{ matches} times 15 text{ minutes/match} = 225 text{ minutes}] Step 6: Calculate the number of practice sessions neededEach practice session lasts 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Thus, the number of sessions needed is:[frac{225 text{ minutes}}{120 text{ minutes/session}} approx 1.875]Since Coach Müller can't have a fraction of a session, he will need to plan for 2 practice sessions to cover all the matches.The final answer is:# 2"},{"question":"Alex is a popular Instagram photographer known for their stunning compositions and editing techniques.

One day, he decides to organize his collection of books. He has 120 books about Isaac Newton, 95 books about Albert Einstein, and 85 books about Marie Curie. He wants to place these books on his shelves in such a way that each shelf has an equal number of books, and each shelf contains books about only one scientist. If he uses the maximum number of shelves possible, how many books will be on each shelf?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers of books for each scientist. The GCD will represent the maximum number of books that can be placed on each shelf while ensuring that each shelf contains books about only one scientist. Let's find the GCD of 120, 95, and 85. Step 1: Find the prime factorization of each number.1. 120   - 120 is even, so divide by 2: ( 120 div 2 = 60 )   - 60 is even, so divide by 2: ( 60 div 2 = 30 )   - 30 is even, so divide by 2: ( 30 div 2 = 15 )   - 15 is divisible by 3: ( 15 div 3 = 5 )   - 5 is a prime number.   Prime factorization of 120: ( 2^3 times 3 times 5 ).2. 95   - 95 is odd, check divisibility by 3: ( 9 + 5 = 14 ), not divisible by 3.   - 95 ends in 5, so divide by 5: ( 95 div 5 = 19 )   - 19 is a prime number.   Prime factorization of 95: ( 5 times 19 ).3. 85   - 85 ends in 5, so divide by 5: ( 85 div 5 = 17 )   - 17 is a prime number.   Prime factorization of 85: ( 5 times 17 ). Step 2: Determine the GCD.- The common prime factor among 120, 95, and 85 is 5.- Thus, the greatest common divisor of these numbers is 5. Step 3: Calculate the number of books per shelf.Since the GCD is 5, each shelf can have 5 books. Step 4: Verify the number of shelves.- For 120 books about Newton: ( 120 div 5 = 24 ) shelves.- For 95 books about Einstein: ( 95 div 5 = 19 ) shelves.- For 85 books about Curie: ( 85 div 5 = 17 ) shelves.Thus, Professor Li can use a total of ( 24 + 19 + 17 = 60 ) shelves, with each shelf containing 5 books.# 5"},{"question":"Laura is the CEO of a startup company that runs an online platform.

How much total time does Sam spend listening to and editing the song?","answer":"To solve the problem, we will break down the tasks Sam performs and calculate the time spent on each task, then sum them up:1. Dividing the song into parts:   - The song is divided into 4 equal parts.   - Total length of the song = 12 minutes.   - Length of each part = Total length ÷ Number of parts = 12 minutes ÷ 4 = 3 minutes per part.2. Time spent listening to each part:   - Sam spends 2 minutes listening to each part.   - There are 4 parts, so the total listening time is:     - Total listening time = 2 minutes/part × 4 parts = 8 minutes.3. Time spent editing each part:   - Sam spends 3 minutes editing each part.   - There are 4 parts, so the total editing time is:     - Total editing time = 3 minutes/part × 4 parts = 12 minutes.4. Total time spent:   - Total time spent listening and editing = Total listening time + Total editing time   - Total time = 8 minutes (listening) + 12 minutes (editing) = 20 minutes.Thus, Sam spends a total of 20 minutes listening to and editing the song.# 20 minutes"},{"question":"Priya is a progressive Indian woman who actively supports the Indian National Congress (INC). She decides to organize a community event to promote education and awareness about the party's initiatives. Priya plans to distribute educational booklets to children in her neighborhood. She has 300 booklets and wants to ensure that each child receives an equal number of booklets.If there are 25 children attending the event, how many booklets will each child receive? Additionally, Priya decides to keep 2 extra booklets for herself as samples. How many booklets does she have left after distributing them to the children and keeping the samples for herself?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many booklets each child will receive and how many will be left after Priya keeps 2 for herself.Step 1: Calculate the number of booklets each child will receive.1. Priya has a total of 300 booklets.2. She wants to distribute them equally among 25 children.3. To find out how many booklets each child receives, divide the total number of booklets by the number of children:   [   text{Booklets per child} = frac{300}{25} = 12   ]Each child will receive 12 booklets.Step 2: Calculate the total number of booklets distributed to the children.1. Each child receives 12 booklets.2. With 25 children, the total number of booklets distributed is:   [   25 times 12 = 300   ]Step 3: Calculate the number of booklets Priya has left after keeping 2 samples for herself.1. Priya has 300 booklets initially.2. She distributed all 300 booklets to the children.3. However, she wants to keep 2 booklets for herself. Since she distributed all 300 booklets to the children, she cannot keep any booklets for herself, unless she reduces the number distributed to the children.Step 4: Adjust for Priya keeping 2 booklets for herself.1. Priya should only distribute 298 booklets to ensure she keeps 2 for herself.2. Distributing 298 booklets among 25 children means each child will still receive 11 booklets, with some booklets left over:   [   text{Booklets distributed} = 25 times 11 = 275   ]3. Booklets left after distributing 275 and keeping 2 for herself:   [   text{Remaining booklets} = 300 - 275 - 2 = 23   ]Since distributing 12 initially doesn't allow her to keep 2, she needs to adjust the distribution as calculated above.#23"},{"question":"As a concerned Oconee County resident and a member of the parent-teacher association, you have been tasked with organizing a community fundraiser to purchase new books for the local elementary school library.

Each modern piece takes them 3 hours to practice, while each contemporary piece takes them 4 hours. If they want to practice a total of 50 hours this month, how many hours should they spend on each period to meet their goal?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours the student should spend on practicing modern pieces and contemporary pieces to meet the total practice time of 50 hours.1. Define Variables:   - Let ( x ) be the number of hours spent practicing modern pieces.   - Let ( y ) be the number of hours spent practicing contemporary pieces.2. Establish Equations:   - The student learns 5 modern pieces, each taking 3 hours to practice. Thus, the total hours spent on modern pieces is ( 5 times 3 = 15 ) hours.   - The student learns 5 contemporary pieces, each taking 4 hours to practice. Thus, the total hours spent on contemporary pieces is ( 5 times 4 = 20 ) hours.   - The total practice time they aim for is 50 hours.3. Set Up the Equation:   - We know that the total hours spent on both modern and contemporary pieces should equal 50 hours:     [     15 + 20 = 35     ]   - This means the problem is simply checking if the total of 35 hours spent meets the total practice time required:     [     15 + 20 = 35 , text{hours}     ]4. Re-evaluate the Goal:   - We need to adjust since the total hours needed (50 hours) is more than the sum of hours calculated for both periods (35 hours).5. Re-assess the Problem:   - The student needs to make sure the practice time for each type of piece meets the required total of 50 hours.   - The student can spend 15 hours on modern pieces and 20 hours on contemporary pieces as planned initially, but they need to increase hours to fully utilize the 50 hours goal.6. Meeting the Exact 50 Hours Requirement:   - Since 35 hours is less than 50, the student needs to practice more to match the total of 50 hours.   - Considering the requirement and the number of pieces, there seems to be a misunderstanding since 5 modern pieces at 3 hours each and 5 contemporary pieces at 4 hours each indeed sum up already to 35 hours.7. Solution Adjustment:   - Since 35 hours fall short of the 50 hours goal, the student could practice additional pieces or review existing ones to meet the target.   - This suggests possibly reviewing or further extending practice times to match the required 50 hours.8. Conclusion:   - If no additional pieces are to be learned, the student will need to extend practice time spent on either or both periods to meet the 50 hours.Therefore, the student should spend a total of 15 hours on modern pieces and 35 hours on contemporary pieces to meet the total of 50 hours required. The division can be adjusted based on preferences or additional practice needs.# 15 hours on modern pieces, 35 hours on contemporary pieces"},{"question":"Jamie is a salesperson who struggles with technology, and during a recent family gathering, they joked about how Jamie once tried to order 10 new tablets for work but accidentally ordered 10 sets of 5 tablets each.

Calculate the cost for designing the tattoo:   - The tattoo artist charges 50 per hour for designing.   - It takes 2 hours to design the tattoo.   - Cost for designing = 50/hour * 2 hours = 100.2. Calculate the cost for the tattooing process:   - The tattoo artist charges 75 per hour for the actual tattooing.   - It takes 3 hours to complete the tattooing.   - Cost for tattooing = 75/hour * 3 hours = 225.3. Calculate the total cost before the discount:   - Total cost = Cost for designing + Cost for tattooing = 100 + 225 = 325.4. Apply the 20% discount:   - Discount amount = 20% of total cost = 0.20 * 325 = 65.5. Calculate the final cost after applying the discount:   - Final cost = Total cost - Discount amount = 325 - 65 = 260.Therefore, after applying the discount coupon, Tori will have to pay:# 260"},{"question":"A talent scout for a major record label is at a music festival to discover new talent.

Number of books in the Children's section = half the number of books in the Fiction section = ( frac{1}{2} times 120 = 60 )Total number of books = 120 + 80 + 60 = 260Next, since we want each section to have an equal number of books, we divide the total number of books by the number of sections:[text{Equal number of books in each section} = frac{260}{3} approx 86.67]Since the number of books must be whole numbers, this suggests there is no perfect division. However, we can interpret the situation as needing a close balance, where we aim for an equal distribution as close as possible with whole numbers. The integer values closest to this are 86 or 87.Let's aim for 86 books per section:- Fiction section initially has 120 books. It needs to lose ( 120 - 86 = 34 ) books.- Non-fiction section initially has 80 books. It needs to gain ( 86 - 80 = 6 ) books.- Children's section initially has 60 books. It needs to gain ( 86 - 60 = 26 ) books.To move books, we have:1. From the Fiction section, move 34 books.2. From the Non-fiction section, move 6 books.3. These moves should transfer to the Children's section.Thus, move 34 books from the Fiction section and 6 books from the Non-fiction section to the Children's section to achieve close to equal distribution.# 34 books from Fiction and 6 books from Non-fiction to Children's section"},{"question":"A billionaire business tycoon wants to build the most luxurious mansion that money can buy.

After setting up the chairs, Alex realizes that 3 extra chairs are needed to accommodate all attendees. How many chairs are in each row initially, and how many chairs should be in each row after adding the extra chairs to accommodate everyone?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chairs were initially in each row and how many chairs should be in each row after adding the extra chairs to accommodate all 120 attendees.Step-by-step Solution:1. Initial Setup:   - There are 15 rows of seats.   - Each row has the same number of chairs.2. Equation for Initial Setup:   - Let ( x ) represent the number of chairs in each row initially.   - The total number of chairs initially is ( 15x ).3. Determining the Initial Setup:   - We know that initially, there are not enough chairs for all 120 attendees. Specifically, 3 more chairs are needed.   - This means the initial total number of chairs is 120 - 3 = 117.   - Therefore, we have the equation:     [     15x = 117     ]4. Solve for ( x ):   - Divide both sides of the equation by 15 to find ( x ):     [     x = frac{117}{15} = 7.8     ]   - Since ( x ) must be a whole number (as you can't have a fraction of a chair), the initial setup must have ( x = 7 ) chairs in each row (it's the largest whole number less than 7.8).5. Verify the Initial Setup:   - With 7 chairs per row, the total number of chairs is ( 15 times 7 = 105 ).   - If 3 more chairs are needed, then ( 105 + 3 = 108 ), which is incorrect.   - Thus, we must ensure we have 120 attendees, so we calculate for when 3 more chairs are added to 117 (initial mistake, it should have been 120).6. Corrected Initial Setup:   - We originally calculated 117, but it should have been solving for when the total is 120.   - Correcting: ( 15x = 117 ) was incorrect, needs to be ( 15x + 3 = 120 ).   - Solving gives ( 15x = 120 - 3 = 117 ).7. Correct Distribution for 120 Attendees:   - Now solve for the correct chairs per row:   - ( 15x = 120 ) (after adding 3 chairs)   - ( x = frac{120}{15} = 8 )8. Final Calculation:   - Initially, ( 15x = 117 ), so ( x = frac{117}{15} = 7.8 ), thus, ( x = 7 ) (round down for setup).   - After adding chairs, ( x = 8 ).Conclusion:Initially, there were 7 chairs in each row. After adding the extra chairs to accommodate everyone, there should be 8 chairs in each row.# 7 chairs initially, 8 chairs after adding extra chairs."},{"question":"Jamie is a struggling indie songwriter who has never had a hit song.

How much budget should each team receive?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 1,200 budget in proportion to the number of designers in each team.1. Determine the total number of designers:   - Team A has 4 designers.   - Team B has 5 designers.   - Team C has 3 designers.      Total number of designers = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 designers.2. Calculate the proportion of the budget for each team:   - The proportion of the budget for a team is determined by the number of designers in that team divided by the total number of designers.   For Team A:   [   text{Proportion for Team A} = frac{4}{12} = frac{1}{3}   ]   For Team B:   [   text{Proportion for Team B} = frac{5}{12}   ]   For Team C:   [   text{Proportion for Team C} = frac{3}{12} = frac{1}{4}   ]3. Allocate the budget based on these proportions:   - Total budget = 1,200   Budget for Team A:   [   text{Budget for Team A} = frac{1}{3} times 1200 = 400   ]   Budget for Team B:   [   text{Budget for Team B} = frac{5}{12} times 1200 = 500   ]   Budget for Team C:   [   text{Budget for Team C} = frac{1}{4} times 1200 = 300   ]4. Verify the total allocation:   - Sum of allocated budgets = 400 (Team A) + 500 (Team B) + 300 (Team C) = 1200The allocation sums up to the total budget, ensuring the calculations are correct.# 400, 500, 300"},{"question":"Agent Alex is working on a mission to analyze data patterns using AI technologies to enhance national security.

Apartment A is located 3 kilometers away from their workplace and costs 8,000 yuan per month. Apartment B is 1 kilometer away from their workplace and costs 10% more than Apartment A per month. The expat prefers a minimalist lifestyle and plans to only buy essential furniture, which costs 4,000 yuan regardless of the apartment chosen. To decide, the expat calculates the total cost of living in each apartment for a year, including rent and the one-time furniture cost. How much more expensive is Apartment B than Apartment A for the first year, including both rent and furniture?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of living in each apartment for the first year, including both rent and the one-time furniture cost, and then find the difference between the two. Step 1: Calculate the annual rent for each apartment.Apartment A:- Monthly rent = 8,000 yuan.- Annual rent = 8,000 yuan/month × 12 months = 96,000 yuan.Apartment B:- Monthly rent for Apartment B is 10% more than Apartment A.- Monthly rent for Apartment B = 8,000 yuan + (10% of 8,000 yuan).- 10% of 8,000 yuan = 0.10 × 8,000 = 800 yuan.- Monthly rent for Apartment B = 8,000 yuan + 800 yuan = 8,800 yuan.- Annual rent for Apartment B = 8,800 yuan/month × 12 months = 105,600 yuan. Step 2: Add the furniture cost to the annual rent for each apartment.Furniture Cost:- The furniture cost is fixed at 4,000 yuan for both apartments.Total Cost for Apartment A:- Total cost for Apartment A = Annual rent for Apartment A + Furniture cost.- Total cost for Apartment A = 96,000 yuan + 4,000 yuan = 100,000 yuan.Total Cost for Apartment B:- Total cost for Apartment B = Annual rent for Apartment B + Furniture cost.- Total cost for Apartment B = 105,600 yuan + 4,000 yuan = 109,600 yuan. Step 3: Calculate the difference in total cost between the two apartments.- Difference in total cost = Total cost for Apartment B - Total cost for Apartment A.- Difference in total cost = 109,600 yuan - 100,000 yuan = 9,600 yuan.Therefore, Apartment B is 9,600 yuan more expensive than Apartment A for the first year, including both rent and furniture.# 9600"},{"question":"Alex is a successful commodities trader who specializes in agricultural products.
