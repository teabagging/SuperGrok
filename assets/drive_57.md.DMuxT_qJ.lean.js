It is a legal requirement for schools to hold collective acts of worship. But the Petitions Committee wrote to Ms Williams asking her to consider if it was compatible with human rights law. The committee took the decision on Tuesday after receiving a petition from Cardiff schoolgirls Rhiannon Shipton and Lily McAllister-Sutton, who had collected 1,333 signatures. The petition called on the assembly to urge the Welsh Government to pass a law that removes the obligation on schools to hold acts of religious worship​. The girls, who say they do not believe in God, said it was time their school - Glantaf - and others in Wales, adopted modern attitudes. The committee also received another petition, launched in response, to keep the current guidelines for religious assemblies. This petition, submitted by Iraj Irfan, was signed by 2,231 people. A Church in Wales spokeswoman said: \\"The law that requires a daily act of worship in schools is not a mandate to compel pupils to recite the Lord's Prayer, and be so inspired that they turn up at church the following Sunday. \\"Rather, it is an invitation to experience what faith and commitment means, in a broadly Christian way, whilst understanding and appreciating other faith perspectives.\\" She added: \\"Often young people are put off collective worship in schools because it is not done particularly well. \\"Collective worship should be a richly rewarding spiritual experience that is creative, interactive and informative.\\" 'Range of beliefs' Ysgol Glantaf's headmaster Alun Davies has said he respects the fact two of his pupils have expressed their opinion and that the school encourages this. He said while the emphasis was on Christianity, there are times when the school holds assemblies when pupils come together to discuss other themes and moral issues. But Wales Humanists have described the practice as \\"archaic\\". Coordinator Kathy Riddick said: \\"Forcing children to worship a god they may or may not believe in is obviously unacceptable and represents an affront to young people's freedom of religion or belief. \\"It shouldn't take two school pupils to convince the Welsh Government of this, but nevertheless we hope Kirsty Williams will now give this the attention it deserves and remove this archaic and discriminatory requirement as soon as possible.\\" The Welsh Government said: \\"Collective worship should be sensitive to the range of beliefs and non-beliefs held by pupils in the school and should give pupils the opportunity to worship, without encouraging them to do something that is against the teachings of their own religion or beliefs. \\"Parents can request for their child to be withdrawn from collective worship and schools must agree to such requests in all circumstances.\\"​Output:","answer":"Poor school worship 'puts off young', Church in Wales says"},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a set of context paragraphs, some supporting facts and an answer of a question.

He needs 4 tiles per square foot of space. 40% of the tiles are green marble that costs 3/tile, and the rest are red tile that costs 1.50/tile. How much does he pay total for tile?Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: First find the area of the courtyard: 10 feet * 25 feet = 250 feet. Then multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot to find the total number of tiles needed: 250 feet * 4 tiles / square foot = 1000 tiles. Then multiply the number of tiles by the percentage that are green to find the total number of green tiles: 1000 tiles * 40% = 400 tiles. Subtract that number from the total number of tiles to find the number of red tiles: 1000 tiles - 400 tiles = 600 tiles. Multiply the number of red tiles by the price per red tile to find the cost of the red tiles: 600 tiles * 1.50 / tile = 900. Multiply the number of green tiles by the price per green tile to find the cost of the green tiles: 400 tiles * 3.00 / tile = 1200. Then add the cost of each type of tile to find the total cost: 900 + 1200 = 2100.So the answer is 2100.Question: Michelle uses 40 beads in making a necklace. She uses 5 blue beads and 2 times as many red beads as blue beads. Then she uses the same number of white beads as the blue and red beads combined. If the rest of the beads she uses are silver, how many silver beads does she use?Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: Michelle uses 5 x 2 = 10 red beads. She uses 5 + 10 = 15 white beads. So she uses a total of 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 blue, red, and white beads. Therefore, she uses 40 - 30 = 10 silver beads.So the answer is 10.Question: Josh found out that 7 bottle caps weigh exactly one ounce. Josh's entire bottle cap collection weighs 18 pounds exactly. How many bottle caps does Josh have in his collection?Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: Josh's collections weights 18 * 16 = 288 ounces. Josh's collection contains 288 * 7 = 2016 caps.So the answer is 2016.Question: Harry has 50 books in his library. His sister Flora has twice as many books and their cousin Gary has half the books Harry has.

Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store.

Each bag has 15 hats. Miggy accidentally tore off 5 hats. During the party, only 25 hats were used. How many hats were unused?A: There are a total of 15 x 3 = 45 hats in 3 bags.

The answer is 15.Question: Tommy's mother lets him ride his bike 2 blocks north of his block, 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and 2 blocks south. His friend's father lets his friend ride his bike 80 square blocks. How many times greater is the area his friend can ride in compared to Tommy?Answer: Tommy's area is 5 blocks wide because 3 + 2 = 5. His area is 4 blocks tall because 2 + 2 = 4. The total area is 20 square blocks because 5 x 4 = 20. His friend's area is 4 times bigger because 80 / 20 = 4. The answer is 4.[Question]Bonnie and Samuel went to the market together.

By nighttime, she only has 60 wipes left. How many wipes were in the container in the morning?A: Let w be the number of wet wipes Elsie had in the morning. Throughout the day, she used w - 20 wet wipes. Once that happened, she had to refill the container resulting in w - 20 + 10 = w - 10 wet wipes. By nighttime, she had w - 10 = 60 wipes. So then, w = 60 + 10 = 70. She started with w = 70 wipes. The answer is 70.Question: Every day, while going to school, Shane drives a total of 10 miles.

The number of Oreos and cookies in a box is in the ratio 4:9. Zane bought each Oreo at 2 and each cookie at 3. How much more money did Zane spend on buying the cookies than buying the Oreos if the total number of items in the box is 65?","answer":"The total ratio representing the number of cookies and Oreos that Zack bought is 4 + 9 = 13. The fraction representing the number of Oreos Zane bought is 4 / 13, and since the total number of items in the box is 65, Zane bought 4 / 13 * 65 = 20 Oreos. If Zane bought 20 Oreos at 2 each, the total cost of buying Oreos is 2 * 20 = 40. Since the total number of items in the box is 65, and there are 20 Oreos in the box, the number of cookies in the box is 65 - 20 = 45. The cost of buying the cookies at 3 each is 45 * 3 = 135. If the Oreos cost 40 to buy, Zane used 135 - 40 = 95 more to buy Cookies than Oreos.The final answer: 95."},{"question":"In this task, you are given an input list A.

The retail price of a pair of pants is 36. What is the wholesale price?Answer: Let X be the wholesale price. The retail price of a pair of pants is X + X * 80% = 36. Thus 1.8 * X = 36. Thus X = 36 / 1.8 = 20. The answer is 20.[Question]Arven bought five puppies for a total cost of 800. Three puppies are on sale for 150 each. How much does each of those two other puppies cost if they cost the same?[Answer]Three puppies on sale cost 150 x 3 = 450. The other two puppies cost 800 - 450 = 350. So, each of those two other puppies cost 350 / 2 = 175. The answer is 175.Q: Andy is a lawyer who's working on two lawsuits. The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out 5,000,000 upon a win and 0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out 1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out 2,000,000 if he wins. Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them?A: First find the probability that Andy will lose the first lawsuit: 100% - 30% = 70%. Then multiply that probability by the probability he loses the second lawsuit: 70% * 50% = 35%. Then multiply the probabilities of Andy winning each lawsuit to find the probability he wins them both: 30% * 50% = 15%. Then subtract the probability Andy wins both lawsuits from the probability he loses both lawsuits to find the difference: 35% - 15% = 20%. The answer is 20.Question: In a graveyard, there are 20 skeletons. Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children. If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?Answer: We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20 / 2 = 10 adult women's skeletons. The remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10 / 2 = 5 of each. Since an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20 * 10 = 200 bones in total. Since an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20 + 5 = 25 bones in their body. There are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25 * 5 = 125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total. Since a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20 / 2 = 10 bones in their body. Since there are 5 children, this means there are 5 * 10 = 50 bones in the children's skeletons in total. Therefore, altogether there are 50 + 125 + 200 = 375 bones in total in the graveyard. The answer is 375.[Question]There are 290 liters of oil in 24 cans. If 10 of the cans are holding 8 liters each, how much oil is each of the remaining cans holding?[Answer]10 cans are holding 8 liters each for a total of 10 * 8 = 80 liters. There are 290 - 80 = 210 litres left. There are 24 - 10 = 14 cans left. Each of the remaining cans is holding 210 / 14 = 15 liters each. The answer is 15.[Question]There were 28 students inside a bus before stopping at an intersection. After stopping at an intersection, there were 58 students on the bus.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on anxiety and depression of NOP receptor partial agonists such as the peptides [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 and UFP-113 and the non-peptide AT-090.', 'Inxa0vitro AT-090, UFP-113, and [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 were tested for their ability to promote NOP/G-protein and NOP/β-arrestin 2 interaction, using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay. Inxa0vivo, they were tested in mice in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and in the forced swim (FST) tests. NOP partial agonists effects were systematically compared to those of full agonists (N/OFQ and Ro 65-6570) and antagonists (UFP-101 and SB-612111).', 'Inxa0vitro, AT-090, UFP-113, and [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 promoted NOP/G protein interaction, with maximal effects lower than those evoked by N/OFQ and Ro 65-6570. AT-090 behaved as a NOP partial agonist also in inducing β-arrestin 2 recruitment, while UFP-113 and [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 were inactive in this assay. Inxa0vivo, AT-090 induced anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM but was inactive in the FST. Opposite results were obtained with UFP-113 and [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2.Answer: NOP ligands producing similar effects on NOP/G protein interaction (partial agonism) but showing different effects on β-arrestin 2 recruitment (partial agonism vs antagonism) elicited different actions on anxiety and mood. These results suggest that the action of a NOP ligand on emotional states is better predicted based on its β-arrestin 2 rather than G-protein efficacy.Answer: Does beta-arrestin 2 rather than G protein efficacy determine the anxiolytic-versus antidepressant-like effects of nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor ligands?Question: Context: The clinical value of oesophageal histology in non-complicated gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is controversial. Our aim was to explore the role of histology in preoperative diagnosis and postoperative follow-up in GORD.', 'From 40 patients 2 histopathologists graded and scored 191 oesophageal biopsies in a blinded manner to evaluate inter- and intraobserver variation pre- and postoperatively. Correlation between preoperative histology and objective clinical findings (endoscopy, esophageal 24-hour pH monitoring, and manometry) was calculated as well.', 'Pathologist I interpreted 16 (50%) preoperative biopsies as normal, 5 (16%) with mild, 4 (12.5%) moderate, and 7 (21.9%) severe reflux changes. Pathologist II interpreted 11 (35.5%) preoperative biopsies as normal, 11 (35.5%) with mild, 6 (19.4%) moderate, and 3 (9.7%) severe reflux changes. In preoperative biopsies, interobserver variation was 33.8% and intraobserver variation 9.7%. A positive correlation was detectable between preoperative endoscopic and morphologic findings; no correlation existed between either acid reflux or LES pressure and oesophageal morphology. Normal pH monitoring and fundic wrap were noted postoperatively in all cases. In postoperative histology no significant differences according to pathologist I existed when compared with preoperative changes: 22 normal (69%), 7 mild (22%), 1 moderate (3.1%), and 2 severe (6.3%). Compared to preoperative analysis, pathologist II interpreted 24 (77%, p = 0.001) of the postoperative findings as normal, 1 (3%, p = 0.003) as mild, 4 (12.9%, n.s.) as moderate, and 2 (6.5% n.s.) as severe reflux changes. In postoperative biopsies interobserver variation was 21.1% and intraobserver variation 5.6%.Answer: The role of oesophageal histology in preoperative diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of GORD may be considered limited.Answer: Is oesophageal histology in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease of minor pre- and postoperative diagnostic value?Question: Context: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been implicated in modulating the inflammatory response in central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we evaluate the effects of DEX on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglia activation and elucidate its possible signaling pathway involved in its anti-inflammatory effects.', 'BV2 and primary microglia were pretreated with various concentrations of DEX (0·01, 0·1, 1, and 10 μM) and/or PD98059 for 1 hour, then microglia were incubated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 hours. Nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were measured by Griess reagent and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, two intracellular signaling cascades including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were investigated by western blot analysis.', 'Dexmedetomidine significantly attenuated LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression in both BV2 cells and primary microglial cells. Lipopolysaccharide activated both ERK1/2 and JNK signal pathways; however, DEX exerted a specific inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 rather than JNK. Intriguingly, treatment of primary microglia and BV2 cells with DEX in combination with ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) enhanced attenuation of LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression.Answer: Dexmedetomidine attenuates NO and iNOS accumulation by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in both BV2 cells and primary microglial cells.Answer:","answer":"Does dexmedetomidine inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia by suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase?"},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

The characters didn't have the depth of a John Grisham, Michael Crichton or Scott Turow thriller, but the action did keep me on the edge of my seat and their were some unexpected twists and turns. Those were a pleasant surprise considering that you could easily connect some of the other plot lines pretty early on without any real suspense. I won't rush to read another Gerritsen right away, my guess is that she uses this formula in each book.

Product review: I honestly don't get the appeal of these books. Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.This is particularly true of the first Doctor Strange stories, which had utterly fabulous artwork: you *think* you're reading the stories in this format, but you're really not. Not by a longshot.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books...

The club is doing everything it possibly can to assist me.\\"The real plans are for now. Short term we want to improve and develop. We have brought in Daniel [Sturridge] and he has been brilliant.

The first pair of dumbbells are 3 lb weights, the second pair is 5 lb weights and the third is 8 lb pounds. How much does the entire system weigh?Answer with step-by-step thinking: The first pair of weights weighs 3 lb each so all total they weigh 2 * 3 = 6 lbs. The second pair of weights weigh 5 lbs each so they weigh 2 * 5 = 10 lbs. The third pair of weights weigh 8 lbs each so they weigh 2 * 8 = 16lbs. All total, the entire system of weights weigh 6 + 10 + 16 = 32 lbs.So the answer is 32.Question: Bruce buys 5 packs of crayons at 5 each, 10 books at 5 each, and 3 calculators at 5 each. If he has 200, how many bags can he buy with the change if one costs 10 each?Answer with step-by-step thinking: He pays 5 * 5 = 25 for buying crayons. He pays 10 * 5 = 50 for buying books. He pays 3 * 5 = 15 for buying calculators. The change he has for buying bags is 200 - 25 - 50 - 15 = 110. The number of bags he can buy is 110 / 10 = 11 bags.So the answer is 11.Question: Jenny likes to play board games with her friends. She likes to play against her friend Mark the most, as she's played him 10 times and Mark has only won once. She doesn't like playing Jill, as she's played her twice as many times as she's played Mark and Jill has won 75% of them. How many times in total has Jenny won board games with her two friends?Answer with step-by-step thinking:","answer":"Jenny has played Mark 10 times, and since mark has only won once she's had 10 - 1 = 9 wins. Jenny has played Jill twice as many times as Mark, so they've played 10 * 2 = 20 games. Of the 20 games Jenny and Jill have played, Jill has won 75% of them so she's had 20 * .75 = 15 wins. If Jill has won 15 games, that means Jenny won 20 - 15 = 5 games. For Jenny's total wins, her wins against Mark and Jill are added together for 5 + 9 = 14 wins.So the answer is 14."},{"question":"If \\"A woman tennis player wearing black holds a bunch of tennis balls with her racket.\\" does that mean that \\"There's a woman holding many tennis balls on her racket.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noyesExplanation: A woman tennis player holds many tennis balls on her racket..Given the sentence \\"Two men are talking a flower stand.\\" can we conclude that \\"Two men punching each other.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- nonoExplanation: Two men cannot be talking and punching each other at the same time..Premise: \\"A woman in a brown baseball cap is spray painting the image of a face on a wall.\\"Hypothesis: \\"The woman is wearing a sombrero.\\"Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?noExplanation: A sombrero and a brown baseball cap are different kinds of hats..Premise: \\"A little girl rides a toy car while her brother walks behind.\\"Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The girl's brother is showing her how to drive the car.\\" is true?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- no","answer":"it is not possible to tellExplanation: Just because he walks behind does not necessarily mean he is showing her how to drive the car.."},{"question":"*Ans* yes*Question* If \\"A man dressed in a black poncho stands in the middle of a parking lot.\\" does that mean that \\"A man is in a black poncho.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- no*CoT* To be dressed in a poncho means that the person is in it.*Ans* it is not possible to tell*Question* If \\"A dog is looking at a white swan swimming in a lake.\\" does that mean that \\"A lazy dog is looking at a big bird.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- no*CoT* Not all dog looking at a swan in the water is looking at a big bird.*Ans* no*Question* Premise: \\"A girl with a number 3 on her shirt is walking across a gymnasium floor.\\"Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The girl is nude in the gym.\\" is true?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- no*CoT* She cannot be nude because she has a shirt on with the number 3 on it.*Ans* yes*Question*","answer":"Can we conclude from \\"A motor biker gets massive air off a dirt jump.\\" that \\"A biker is jumping through the air.\\"?Options:- yes- no- it is not possible to tell*CoT* The act of jumping requires air to be present below the biker."},{"question":"Title: Liked these until.............

The case of Mexican citizen Edgar Tamayo Arias is the latest battle in a dispute over the rights of the foreign-born on American death rows. And U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has said it could put Americans abroad at risk.    Tamayo, 46, was convicted in the 1994 murder of a Houston police officer, whom he shot three times in the back of the head, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.    His attorneys are scheduled to present oral arguments Tuesday, calling for a preliminary injunction to stop the state's governor and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles from considering Tamayo's clemency petition until the process is \\"adequate and fair,\\" read a statement from his team.    This isn't the first time Mexico has stepped in to try to stop the execution of one of its citizens.    Mexican officials made similar arguments -- unsuccessfully -- before executions in 2008 and 2011    \\"The Mexican government is opposed to the death penalty and has decided to use the necessary resources to protect its citizens who are in danger of receiving this sentence,\\" the ministry said.    Kerry has also weighed in on Tamayo's case, arguing that setting an execution date is \\"extremely detrimental to the interests of the United States.\\"    \\"I want to be clear: I have no reason to doubt the facts of Mr. Tamayo's conviction, and as a former prosecutor, I have no sympathy for anyone who would murder a police officer,\\" Kerry wrote. \\"This is a process issue I am raising because it could impact the way American citizens are treated in other countries.\\"    In a response to Kerry, Texas Deputy Attorney General Don Clemmer said he would meet with representatives from the Justice Department and the State Department over the matter.    The International Court of Justice ruled in 2004 that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations , the treaty that lays out rights of people detained in other nations, in the cases of dozens of Mexican nationals. The judges ordered the United States to provide \\"review and reconsideration\\" of the sentences and convictions of those Mexican prisoners as a result.    Mexico's Foreign Ministry argues that hasn't happened in Tamayo's case.    It's a case Tamayo's lawyer had made as well in attempts to stay his execution.    \\"The Mexican Foreign minister, the U.S. Secretary of State, evangelical and Latino leaders, former Texas Gov. Mark White and legal and international organizations have called on the The Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles and Gov. (Rick) Perry to halt the execution of Mr. Tamayo based on the violation of his consular rights, yet the Texas Board of Pardons has refused to even meet to discuss Mr. Tamayo's clemency petition,\\" attorney Sandra Babcock said in a statement.    \\"Mr. Tamayo was never informed of his treaty rights at the time of his arrest, and no court has agreed to review that treaty violation and the consequences that it had for his conviction and sentence,\\" she told CNN affiliate KTRK    Prosecutors have disputed that argument.    \\"Since 1994, this case has gone to all the courts that it can possibly go to -- the state courts, the federal courts,\\" Roe Wilson, assistant district attorney in Harris County, Texas, told KTRK. \\"It has been reviewed.\\" ||||| HOUSTON — Secretary of State John F. Kerry and a former Texas governor are part of an international coalition trying to halt Texas' execution of a Mexican citizen this week.    Edgar Tamayo Arias, 46, is to be put to death Wednesday for fatally shooting Houston Police Officer Guy Gaddis in 1994.    Gaddis, 24, had been flagged down near a nightclub by a man who accused Tamayo of robbing him. The officer arrested Tamayo, handcuffed him and put him in the back seat of his patrol car. He was driving away when Tamayo drew a concealed pistol and shot Gaddis three times in the back of the head.    On Tuesday, a federal judge in Austin rejected Tamayo's request for an order that would have prevented Gov. Rick Perry and the parole board from considering his clemency petition until the fairness of the state's clemency process could be reviewed. The judge found that the clemency process satisfied constitutional requirements and did not violate Tamayo's right to due process of law.    Tamayo's attorneys vowed to keep fighting.    \\"The Texas clemency process is the weakest in the nation, in the state that executes the most. Allowing Mr. Tamayo's fate to be decided by a board that has refused to provide meaningful consideration of evidence that Mr. Tamayo has mental retardation and that his trial was fundamentally unfair as a result of the violation of his consular rights is an affront to what clemency is supposed to be,\\" the attorneys said in a statement.    They have petitioned Perry to grant a 30-day reprieve and the parole board to commute Tamayo's death sentence to life in prison.    Tamayo, a laborer from Morelos state, Mexico, was in the U.S. illegally at the time of his arrest. Advocates say he was not informed of his right to diplomatic assistance under an international treaty known as the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.    In an interview televised in Mexico on Tuesday, the governor of Morelos decried the \\"arrogance\\" and \\"racism\\" of Texas' legal system and said the Tamayo case \\"violated a fundamental principle, which is consular assistance.\\"    Graco Ramirez, a member of Mexico's Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, said that although he didn't know whether Tamayo was guilty, \\"what is certain is that due process wasn't given, and when such due process isn't granted as a judicial principle, clearly there's no certainty about what's being judged.\\"    The United Nations International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, ordered the U.S. 10 years ago to reconsider the convictions of 51 Mexicans, including Tamayo, who had been sent to death row without being told of their consular rights. Two of the 51 have since been executed, both in Texas.    In 2005, President George W. Bush ordered Texas and other states to review the 51 convictions. But Texas' then-solicitor general, Ted Cruz, now a senator, persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that the president had no authority to order state courts to defer to the World Court.    The 32 states with capital punishment have executed 28 foreign nationals since 1976, according to the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes the practice.    \\"Mexico typically intervenes in these cases, capital cases, even before the trials occur so they often don't result in a death sentence anymore. It might well have made a difference in Tamayo's case,\\" said the center's executive director, Richard Dieter.    Mexican officials have petitioned the U.S. on Tamayo's behalf, including Foreign Secretary Jose Antonio Meade and Ambassador to the U.S. Eduardo Medina Mora.    Last week, Mark White, a former Texas governor and state attorney general, joined the effort.    \\"I personally support capital punishment. But this case is not about whether we support or oppose the death penalty. It's about fairness and having the courts hear all the key facts. In Tamayo's case, a court review could have made a real difference,\\" White, a Democrat, wrote in the Austin American-Statesman.    Kerry has urged Texas to reconsider.    \\"I have no reason to doubt the facts of Mr. Tamayo's conviction, and as a former prosecutor, I have no sympathy for anyone who would murder a police officer,\\" he wrote in September, adding that he was concerned that Texas' handling of the case could affect the way Americans are treated overseas.    Kerry shared a letter he received from Medina Mora. \\"This issue has become and could continue to be a significant irritant in the relations between our two countries,\\" the ambassador wrote.    Perry and other Texas officials argue that they are not bound by the World Court's decision. Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed reiterated that position this week.    \\"It doesn't matter where you're from — if you commit a despicable crime like this in Texas, you are subject to our state laws, including a fair trial by jury and the ultimate penalty,\\" Nashed said.    Tamayo's attorneys insist that without consular assistance, he did not receive a fair trial.    Tamayo came to the United States as an adolescent, spoke little English, was developmentally disabled, brain-damaged and mentally ill, said one of his attorneys, Sandra Babcock.    \\"He's just the type of person the protections of the Vienna Convention were designed to help,\\" said Babcock, clinical director of the Center for International Human Rights at Northwestern University School of Law.    Tamayo's execution would be the first this year in Texas, which last year put 16 prisoners to death.    It's unclear whether new lethal-injection drugs could also become a factor in Tamayo's case.    The drugs drew scrutiny last week after witnesses reported that condemned Ohio prisoner Dennis McGuire took more than 15 minutes to die, appearing to gasp and snort after he was injected with midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller similar to morphine. Ohio and other states have started using new drugs because of shortages, the result of manufacturers facing protests restricting supplies.    Rather than switch drugs as Ohio did, Texas and other states have turned to compounding pharmacies, which make drugs without federal scrutiny.    Texas, which has executed 508 prisoners since lethal injections began in 1982 — more than any other state — started using a compounding pharmacy last year to renew its supply of pentobarbital, an anesthetic.    Tamayo's attorneys asked prison officials what drugs would be used in his execution, since a lawsuit filed over the state's use of the compounded drug revealed they had also obtained supplies of the drugs used in Ohio.    Jason Clark, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said they planned to use compounded pentobarbital to execute Tamayo, and declined to comment about other drugs they have.    molly.hennessy-fiske@latimes.com    Times staff writer Richard Fausset in Mexico City contributed to this report.         |||||A:","answer":"Edgar Arias Tamayo is scheduled to be executed in Texas tonight—despite a number of high-level requests that the execution be halted because Tamayo's arrest violated international law. The Mexican citizen was initially arrested after a 1994 robbery; while in the patrol car, Tamayo, now 46, shot the arresting officer in the back of the head, killing him. But authorities never notified Tamayo that he had the right to contact the Mexican Consulate, and that failure violates an international treaty, the New York Times reports. Tamayo's attorney says he was mentally ill, brain-damaged, and developmentally disabled—\\"just the type of person the protections of the Vienna Convention were designed to help,\\" the Los Angeles Times reports. In 2004, the World Court ordered Tamayo's conviction and 50 others reviewed because of Vienna Convention violations, but Tamayo's never was; Texas says it's not bound by that order.

Rick Perry and the state attorney general to stop Tamayo's execution until the case is reviewed, but they appear unswayed.

Article: After a fortnight of extraordinary type, the much-feared computer virus that was supposed to strike the globe's hard drives last Friday simply fizzled. So many warnings were sounded that most computer owners either fed anti-virus programs into their systems or refused to turn the power on during the dreaded M-day. They dodged one disease, but more strains are on the way. The eponymous Friday-the-13th virus is due to strike this week, and the Maltese Amoeba may detonate on March 15. Who creates these things? A disproportionate number seems to originate in Bulgaria or Russia, where writing the smallest, most elegant virus programs has become a matter of quirky pride. Viruses are transmitted either by shared disks (as was Michelangelo) or over telephone lines. The virus program hides in a computer until, activated by a date, time, or some other trigger, it springs to life. The most common virus, Stoned, makes your screen announce: \\"Your computer is now stoned. Legalize marijuana. \\" (Regardless of your politics, you don't want this one around; it can damage your files inadvertently.) Solution: either keep your computer isolated--no trading disks, no on-line communication--or else install one of a dozen or so commercially available anti-virus programs that detect and delete the little time bombs. If they can come up with a virus that is hidden, will they next try to extort a business?--as in, pay me 1 million or my virus will destroy your system. In the meantime, money is being made by firms selling anti-virus programs. Egghead software stores logged a 3,000 percent jump in anti-virus sales. Was the threat overblown by the companies that make millions selling anti-virus software? Thanks to the media blitz, no one will ever know what might have happened--an unallied number of computer owners discovered and deleted Michelangelo before it was supposed to strike--on the artist's birthday.

Article: Education cuts  have become routine   over the past few years, which has made it difficult for students to learn. The results of a survey of 1,850 Los Angeles County high school students show just how much the cuts are affecting students. Because of teacher layoffs  , class sizes at some high schools have risen to 50 students -- even in math and English classes. Some 37 percent of students report that they sometimes don't have a desk to sit at. Sixty-seven percent say crowded classrooms make them feel the teachers don't have enough time to teach, and 30 percent say they've not been able to join in a program because it's no longer offered at their school. At a time when technology is an important skill, 52 percent of students say there aren't enough computers. Or they're often broken, and there's no one to fix them. Fifty-one percent say they've had to share textbooks with a classmate because there aren't enough copies to go around. Fifty-seven percent say they've had to copy information because their school doesn't have enough paper to make copies. \\"We have only one science teacher for the entire  high school,\\" writes Felix Ruano, a 16-year-old student. He goes on to describe how that teacher, who is only _ to teach chemistry, is teaching physics -- or, at least, is trying to do so. \\"He shows physics videos and we teach ourselves from our textbook,\\" says Ruano. And, as has been seen elsewhere, \\"all but one of the restrooms\\" at Ruano's school \\"have been closed because we don't have enough people to clean them.\\" Ruano notes that though faced with the challenges, 97 percent of students say they plan to go to college. But without \\"properly trained teachers and the best resources,\\" says Ruano, it's not likely that every student will achieve that goal. \\"Unless schools fix these problems,\\" he says, \\"students could lose hope.\\" Question: What would be the best title for the text?

Article: We all know the saying, \\"One's enemy is one's own anger and one's calmness is the friend of oneself.\\" Anger is the root cause of many bad outcomes. We all know of damage that anger has caused us. There are many old stories that tell us the bad effects of anger.      But the question is whether we should never experience anger and lead lives like sages  ?I do not think the answer is a firm yes. Everyone should have this emotion and be able to use it in a wise way. In other words, it is also known as controlled aggression. We see a lot of this kind of controlled emotion when we watch athletes in action. If an athlete has the right amount of aggression, the game or the battle is half won. The other half can be won by his skills.      Controlled aggression or anger also plays an important role in a person's career and life. During the courses of a person's career, people who hold high positions need to exercise this emotion called anger in a professional and right manner. For getting the work done well, it is important for you to make use of positive aggression or controlled anger. We can extend this to our daily lives as well. If the parent is not strict at times, children will behave in a wrong way and do not develop as they are expected. Teachers have to exercise this emotion in a wise way to make the students gain knowledge in an effective manner.      All in all, if one is able to use the emotion called anger in a controlled manner, it will lead to the smooth development in his life and career. Question: People's opinion of anger is usually   _  .

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing.

Question: What was Alexander regarding as when he invaded Egypt?.Example Output: A Liberator.Example Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man.Sent 2: Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority.Sent 3: In about 2000 b.c.Sent 4: Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy.Sent 5: At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south.Sent 6: The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c.Sent 7: , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice.Sent 8: But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy.Sent 9: When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help.Sent 10: From Gaul to France In 125 b.c.Sent 11: , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence).Sent 12: They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain.Sent 13: When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c.Sent 14: Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier.Sent 15: The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them.Sent 16: At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire.Sent 17: The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established.Sent 18: Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. Question: About what year, did Celtic tribes came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy?.Example Output: 2000 B.C.Example Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family.Sent 2: It was indeed — until 1869.Sent 3: Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy.Sent 4: The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism.Sent 5: By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society.Sent 6: The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers.Sent 7: This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century.Sent 8: Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression.Sent 9: Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells.Sent 10: Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water.Sent 11: Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon.Sent 12: Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial.Sent 13: Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse.Sent 14: The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself.Sent 15: In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese.Sent 16: Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts.Sent 17: After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court.Sent 18: The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Much deliberation took place in the British parliament, with a number of MPs arguing that the Royal Navy would not be able to defend the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Denis Healey, who, at the time, was the UK Secretary of State for Defence, reported that the British Armed Forces were severely overextended, and in some respects, dangerously under-equipped to defend the Sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the decision to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial Sheikhdoms which had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection.

It is the most blatant and yet ineffective imitation of David Sedaris, right down to the common themes (life as a homosexual) and settings (coping with domestic help, having to kill a rodent). The callowness of the author can take your breath away, such as, for example, when he analogizes his baldness to breast cancer, saying (to paraphrase): \\"Baldness is to men what breast cancer is to women. While I recognize that baldness is not fatal, it is fatal to one's social life if one is a gay man in New York, and that is just about the same thing.\\" What a shallow, immature, stupid man.No one should read this book.

However, rather than narrating the story through the experiences of Igantius Riley, sophist/hot dog vendor, Daugherty relates the events through the whimsys of Mcquorquedale de la Rochefoucauld, a self-professed postmodernist of the first order.

Review: Gladiator was and amazing film with a good range of emotions. The score is no less it is very haunting and will be played repeatedly by its listeners. It has a lot of surprises in it because I didn't expect so much emotion from a score for a movie called Gladiator. Although, it does have one of the best battle themes I've heard in a while. \\"The might of Rome\\" evokes the greatness of that time in a magnificent way. the last three tracks \\"Elysium, Honor Him, and Now We Are Free\\" are amazingly moving and make you think of honor and love. \\"Earth and Sorrow\\" are the most deeply moving pieces because they bring through emotions with subtley and grace. overall this score is phenomenoal in every way and is very inpressive work from Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. I think it needed a remorseful love theme for Maximius and Lucilla, but one cannot have everything. Maybe...if it got another volume!

It was also the first time since the 1992 World Cup that the final match did not feature Australia.Who has won the icc world cup 2011?CoT: The relevant information to answer the above question is: India won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, thus becoming the first country to win the Cricket World Cup final on home soil.Answer: 1971. Now, what could be the question and solution-maybe?Ques: Before the Second World War, the voting age in almost all countries was 21 years or higher. Czechoslovakia was the first to reduce the voting age to 20 years in 1946, and by 1968 a total of 17 countries had lowered their voting age. Many countries, particularly in Western Europe, reduced their voting ages to 18 years during the 1970s, starting with the United Kingdom (1970), with the United States (26th Amendment) (1971), Canada, Germany (1972), Australia (1974), France (1974) and others following soon afterwards. By the end of the 20th century, 18 had become by far the most common voting age. However, a few countries maintain a voting age of 20 years or higher. It was argued that 18-year-old men could be drafted to go to war, and many people felt they should be able to vote at the age of 18.Answer this question based on the passage: when did 18 year olds get to vote?CoT: The important part for answering this question is: Many countries, particularly in Western Europe, reduced their voting ages to 18 years during the 1970s, starting with the United Kingdom (1970), with the United States (26th Amendment) (1971), Canada, Germany (1972), Australia (1974), France (1974) and others following soon afterwards.Ans: The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA )Ques: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security, initially created by Presidential Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978 and implemented by two Executive Orders on April 1, 1979. The agency's primary purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities. The governor of the state in which the disaster occurs must declare a state of emergency and formally request from the president that FEMA and the federal government respond to the disaster. The only exception to the state's gubernatorial declaration requirement occurs when an emergency or disaster takes place on federal property or to a federal asset -- for example, the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, or the Space Shuttle Columbia in the 2003 return-flight disaster.Which entity was responsible for disaster planning and relief within the united states?CoT: To answer the question, consider the following: The agency's primary purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities.Ans: she throws Hansel into the cage and forces Gretel into becoming her slaveQues: Passage: The next morning, the witch cleans out the cage in the garden from her previous captive.

Ed (Matthew McConaughey) quickly learns that he has absolutely no privacy. The taping of his life begins when he is waking up and shown to be scratching himself in his most private area. His father (played by Dennis Hopper) shows up and his mother is forced to admit that she made him leave, after having told Ed that he ran away. The television producer Cynthia Topping (Ellen Degeneres) begins to manipulate his life by arranging to have certain characters to \\"show up.\\" For example, shortly after his girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman) moves away to escape the infringement on her personal life, Jill (Elizabeth Hurley) shows up and begins to seduce him. Jill isn't really interested in Ed, though, but is only using him in an attempt to further her own career. A really racy scene ensues and it appears that Ed and Jill are about to have sex on TV but he falls off the dining room table and squashes her cat, ending the ardor. The cat survives, fortunately, so we animal lovers folks can relax. He never sees Jill again.Life for poor Ed begins to degenerate (no pun intended Ellen) when his brother Ray Pekurny (Woody Harrelson) publishes an expose book (entitled \\"My Brother Pissed On Me\\"). LIfe takes another terrible turn when he gets a phone call from his mother telling him that his stepfather has died. The doctor tells him that he died making love with his mother and about that time, his real stepfather, Al (Martin Landau), comes zipping down the hall of the hospital on his scooter and leaves Ed confused. His mother admits that she was having sex with Hank and admits on national television that Al is unable to perform.Ed really wants to get back together with Shari, who has been caught following him in disguise. He wants to end the contract but the producers won't release him.

If Squido eats 200 oysters, how many oysters do they eat altogether?Answer: If Squido eats 200 oysters, when Crabby eats twice as many oysters as Squido does, he eats 2 * 200 = 400 oysters. Together, they eat 400 + 200 = 600 oysters. The answer is 600.[Question]Perry wants to buy a new modern bedroom set for 2000. He received 200.00 in gift cards over the holidays that he can use toward the set. The store is currently offering the entire set at 15% off. If he signs up for the store credit card and uses it to buy the set, he will save an additional 10% off on the discounted set. What is the final price of the set?[Answer]The bedroom set is 2000 and it’s currently 15% off so 2000 * .15 = 300.00 off. So the new price of the set is 2000 - 300 = 1,700.00. He signs up for the credit card so that’s 10% off so .10 * 1700 = 170.00. Now the set is 1700 - 170 = 1,530.00. He has a 200.00 gift card which brings the price to 1530 - 200 = 1,330.00. The answer is 1330.Q: Nina wants to buy a new video game with her allowance money. The game cost 50 dollars. Nina also has learned that there is a 10 percent sales tax. She receives 10 dollars a week as an allowance, and thinks she can save half of that. How many weeks will it take for Nina to be able to buy the new video game with her savings?A: The 10 percent tax on 50 dollars will be 10 / 100 x 50 = 5 dollars. The cost of the game and the tax will be 50 + 5 = 55 dollars. Nina will save half of her allowance every week, or 10 / 2 = 5 dollars per week. The total cost of the game and tax, divided by Nina's weekly savings is 55 / 5 = 11 weeks. The answer is 11.Question: Reese had a sum of money in her savings account.

How much did she have in her savings account if she still has 2900 after spending those amounts?Answer: The total percentage of money that Reese spent in February and March is 20% + 40% = 60%. This means the April expenses and the money left in her account make up 100% - 60% = 40% of her savings. Reese had 2900 + 1500 = 4400 for the April expenses and the money left in her account. So, 4400 is equal to 40% which means every 1% is equal to 4400 / 40 = 110. Therefore, Reese originally had 110 x 100 = 11000 in her savings account. The answer is 11000.[Question]Farmer Randy has 1700 acres of cotton he needs to have planted in 5 days. With a crew of 2 tractors working for 2 days and then a crew of 7 tractors working for another 3 days, how many acres of cotton per day does each tractor need to plant to meet their planting deadline?[Answer]With 2 tractor teams working for 2 days, this is like 2 * 2 = 4 days worth of work by a single tractor, which they call tractor days. With 5 tractor teams working for 4 days, this is 7 * 3 = 21 tractor days. In total, the effort of all the tractor teams is 4 + 21 = 25 tractor days. If they need to plant 1700 acres with their 25 tractor days, then each tractor team needs to plant 1700 / 25 = 68 acres of cotton per day. The answer is 68.[Question]If you buy 2 packs of 500 mL milk, it will cost 2.50. If you buy them individually, they will cost 1.30 each. How much is your total savings from buying ten sets of 2 packs of 500 mL milk?[Answer]","answer":"The price per 500 mL milk from the 2 packs is 2.50 / 2 = 1.25. This means that for each pack of 500 mL milk, you can save 1.30 - 1.25 = 0.05. Ten sets of 2 packs mean 10 x 2 = 20 packs of 500 mL of milk. So, your total savings will be 0.05 x 20 = 1.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

I thought the solo piano was excellent but unfortunately a bit distant on this recording. The other instrumental solos seem somewhat distant as well. Talking about the piece itself my opinion is that it is less successful than either Dvorak's very fine cello concerto or his highly appealing violin concerto. Having said that however it is still a great composition with many pleasant passages particularly in the excellent third movement.

Review: This is a fairly standard romance set in the \\"romantic\\" coal fields of Northern Wales. The 3 main characters are linked either by blood common passion, and this should make for a more interesting story, but alas, it is entirely predictible.What is of interest is that in my copy, Dot's father has a mistress called Edie, and thus she is called for at least two thirds of the book, when she is suddenly referred to as Blanche. I had to re-read a few pages to ensure that she was indeed one and the same character. Poor editing perhaps? Either way, it doesn't make the book any more interesting.It is certainly an entertaining enough read for lovers of the genre, but if you're looking for a far more spectacular book on the life and times of the hardy and brave men who worked the mines, and the women who loved them, try \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" by Richard Llewellyn.

Sus padres fundaron el primer hospital lituano en Vilna en 1918, y siendo su padre un abierto defensor de la independencia de Lituania durante la Guerra polaco-soviética, el hospital se convirtió en un polo de resistencia contra la ocupación polaca durante esta guerra que tuvo lugar entre 1918 y 1921, y que se saldó con la pérdida del 20 % del territorio lituano a favor de Polonia, con la capital Vilna incluida, por lo que la capital se trasladó provisionalmente a Kaunas.QUESTION: ¿Quiénes solían visitar la casa de los padres de Marija?Output:","answer":"los músicos y escritores más famosos de la época"},{"question":"In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3. Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.Question: How old was the person who wrote  Die letzte Philosophie when ceased bein an anarchist? Passage 1:Several German socialists of this period also exhibited anarchist tendencies. The young Wilhelm Weitling, influenced by both Proudhon and Louis Auguste Blanqui, once wrote that \\"a perfect society has no government, but only an administration, no laws, but only obligations, no punishment, but means of correction.\\" Moses Hess was also an anarchist until around 1844, disseminating Proudhon's theories in Germany, but would go on to write the anti-anarchist pamphlet Die letzte Philosophie. Karl Grün, well known for his role in the disputes between Marx and Proudhon, held a view Nettlau would liken to communist anarchism while still living in Cologne and then left for Paris, where he became a disciple of Proudhon. Wilhelm Marr, born in Hamburg but primarily active in the Young Germany clubs in Switzerland, edited several antiauthoritarian periodicals. In his book on anarchism Anarchie oder Autorität, he comes to the conclusion that liberty is found only in anarchy. Passage 2:The current Constitution of the Republic of China was adopted by the National Assembly in 1947, when the Nationalist Government was based in Nanjing. Since 1945, China was engulfed in a civil war that pitted the Nationalist Government against the Communist Party of China (CPC). In March 1948, the first National Assembly met in Nanjing, and after some deliberation, decided to invoke Article 174 of the Constitution to amend the Constitution\\". On 10 May 1948, the Assembly adopted the first set of Temporary Provisions that was set to expire after three years. In 1949, the Communists expelled the Nationalist Government from mainland China, and Chiang's government set up base in Taipei, Taiwan. In 1954, the National Assembly indefinitely renewed the Temporary Provisions in view of the Kuomintang's plans to recapture the mainland. The Temporary Provisions from then on were amended in accordance with the needs of the President of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, or his son Chiang Ching Kuo. In 1966, the Temporary Provisions were revised to allow for supplementary elections to the National Assembly from the Taiwan Area. In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations and replaced with representatives from the People's Republic of China; the Temporary Provisions were amended again the same year.

Another word for criticism is appreciation.When I criticize or appreciate some objector another, I look for its good points and bad points.In reading any printed or written matter, I always have a pencil in hand and put any comments in the book or on a separate paper.In other words, I always talk back to the writer. That sort of critical reading might well be called creative reading because I am thinking along with the author, asking him questions, seeing whether he answers the questions and how well he answers them.I mark the good passages to store them in my memory piece of writing; where, how and why could or should I improve upon it? You might think that doing what I suggested is work.Yes, it is, but the work is a pleasure because I can feel my brain expanding, my emotion reacting and my way of living change. Reading exercises is a great influence on a person.If pictures, still or moving, accompany the reading, the memory will retain the material for a long time. Just as evil books can corrupt, so also can good books gradually work a change on a corrupt person. Let's get back to the beneficial effects of thinking while reading.It helps us to enlarge our minds.We understand more about the universe, its people and many of its wonders.We learn to think and observe in new ways.We certainly do get a feeling for the language we are reading.All good writers in any language have been readers who read critically and continuously.

The old guard is suffering: this week's 67 billion merger   between Dell and EMC, makers of computers and storage devices respectively  , was a marriage forced by the rise of the cloud. Disruptive   newcomers are blooming: if Amazon's cloud-computing unit were a stand-alone public company, it would probably be worth almost as much as Dell and EMC combined. The gains for customers have been equally dramatic. Compared with older IT systems, cloud computing is often much cheaper. It adds tremendous flexibility: firms that need more computing capacity no longer have to spend weeks adding new servers and installing software. In the cloud they can get hold of it in minutes. Their applications can be updated continually, rather than just every few months. Individual users can reach their e-mails, files and photos from any device. And cloud services also tend to be more secure, since providers know better than their customers how to protect their computing systems against hackers. But cloud computing makes one problem worse. In the old IT world, once a firm or a consumer had decided on an operating system or database, it was difficult and costly to switch to another. In the cloud this \\"lock-in\\" is even worse. Cloud providers go to great lengths to make it easy to upload data. They accumulate huge amounts of complex information, which cannot easily be moved to an alternative provider. Cloud firms also create a world of interconnected services, software and devices, which is convenient but only for as long as you don't venture   outside their universe. Being locked in to a provider is risky. Firms can start to tighten the screws by increasing prices. If a cloud provider goes bust  , its customers may have trouble getting back their data. These risks have already caused a debate about whether the cloud needs stricter regulation. Some European politicians want to force cloud providers to ensure that data can be moved between them. That is too heavy-handed, because strict rules will inhibit   innovation in what is still a young industry. The history of computing suggests that common standards may well appear naturally in response to customers' demands--just as in personal computers, where it is now much easier to use the same files on different systems. In the meantime, a few commonsense measures can reduce the risk of lock-in. Firms that use more than one cloud provider to host their data are less affected. So are those that keep their most important information in their own data centres. Consumers can take precautions, too. Some services are better than others at enabling users to move data between providers (Google does well on this score). Cloud computing promises its users many benefits, but don't mistake it for some sort of digital heaven.  Question: The author takes \\"the merger between Dell and EMC\\" for example to show   _  .  Options: (A) the influence of cloud computing on computer and storage device makers (B) the miserable sufferings of old computer companies (C) the rapid development of new computer companies (D) the interaction between old companies and newcomersOutput: AInput: Consider Input: Article: Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal. For real - you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay? Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations and their high image   of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud? Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity? Well, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut, because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. Repeated psychology tests have proved that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a \\"social reality\\". The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then, because you felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So, this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals. Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published.     It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests - everyone wrote down their personal goals.Then, half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't. Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them toward their goals, but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt that they had a long way to go to still achieve their goals. But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt much closer to achieving their goals. So audience, next time you want to tell someone your goal, what will you say? (Silence) Exactly - well done.  Question: What is the article mainly about?  Options: (A) The importance of having personal goals. (B) Tips on achieving your personal goals. (C) Studies on why people tend to keep their personal goals secret. (D) Why it's not necessarily wise to announce your personal goals to others.","answer":"Output: D"},{"question":"You are given a question-answer pair. Answer with their type.

On Monday he sold 2. Every day the number of sales increases by 1 compared to the previous day. On average, how many pastries does he sell on each day of the week?A: You know from the statement that on Monday he sells 2 pastries, so on Tuesday he sells 3, Wednesday 4, Thursday 5, Friday 6, Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 pastries. So the average value is (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) pastries / 7 days. The baker sells, on average, 35 / 7 = 5 pastries / day for 1 week. The answer is 5.Q: A bag of dozen apples costs 14 and Brian has already spent 10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only 50 and needs to pay the 3.50 subway fare each way?A: Brian requires a total of 3.50 + 3.50 = 7 to pay for the round trip subway fare. We also know he has spent half (1 / 2) the amount he spent on kiwis on bananas, so he'll spend (1 / 2) * 10 = 5 on bananas. So far in total he has spent 7 for his subway fare + 5 on bananas + 10 on kiwis = 7 + 5 + 10 = 22. If he left his house with only 50, then all he will have left for apples would be 50 - 22 = 28. If a bag of apples costs 14, then Brian would only be able to buy a maximum of 28 / 14 = 2 bags of apples. If each bag of apples has a dozen (12) apples, then (2) two bags will have 12 * 2 = 24 apples. The answer is 24.Q: Lee is saving up for a new pair of sneakers which cost 90. He already has 15 saved.

He earned 100 from selling action figures because 115 - 15 = 100. He sold them each for 10 because 100 / 10 = 10. The answer is 10."},{"question":"TASK DEFINITION: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\"., Stromness is the second most populated town in Orkney, Scotland. It is in the south-west of Mainland Orkney. It is also a parish, with the town of Stromness as its capital., Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited.The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall., The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around ., The Loch of Stenness is a large brackish loch on Orkney Mainland, Scotland and is named for the parish of Stenness. It is northeast of the town of Stromness, lies immediately to the south of the Loch of Harray and is close to the World Heritage neolithic sites of the Stones of Stenness and Ring of Brodgar. In Old Norse its name was \\"Steinnesvatn\\"., A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction., There are three related types of Neolithic earthwork that are all sometimes loosely called henges. The essential characteristic of all three types is that they feature a ring bank and ditch, but with the ditch inside the bank rather than outside. Due to the poor defensive utility of an enclosure with an external bank and an internal ditch, henges are not considered to have served a defensive purpose (cf. circular rampart). The three types are as follows, with the figure in brackets being the approximate diameter of the central flat area:, Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides., The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times., Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago., The Loch of Harray is the largest loch of Mainland Orkney, Scotland and is named for the nearby parish of Harray.

They are looked after by Historic Scotland., Heart of Neolithic Orkney refers to a group of Neolithic monuments found on the Mainland, one of the islands of Orkney, Scotland. The name was adopted by UNESCO when it proclaimed these sites as a World Heritage Site in 1999., The Stone Age was a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used to make implements with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted roughly 3.4 million years, and ended between 8700 BCE and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking., The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century., A World Heritage Site is a landmark which has been officially recognized by the United Nations, specifically by UNESCO. Sites are selected on the basis of having cultural, historical, scientific or some other form of significance, and they are legally protected by international treaties. UNESCO regards these sites as being important to the collective interests of humanity., The Neolithic Barnhouse Settlement is sited by the shore of Loch of Harray , Orkney Mainland , Scotland , not far from the Standing Stones of Stenness , about 5 miles north - east of Stromness . It was discovered in 1984 by Colin Richards . Excavations were conducted between 1986 and 1991 , over time revealing the base courses of at least 15 houses . The houses have similarities to those of the early phase of the better - known settlement at Skara Brae in that they have central hearths , beds built against the walls and stone dressers , but differ in that the houses seem to have been free - standing . The settlement dates back to circa 3000 BC. Pottery of the grooved ware type was found , as at the Stones of Stenness and Skara Brae . Flint and stone tools were found , as well as a piece of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran . The largest of the original buildings was House 2 . It was double - sized , featuring a higher building standard than the other houses and unlike the others ( rebuilt up to five times ) seems to have remained in use throughout the inhabited period of the settlement . The houses were clustered around a central open area which was divided into areas for making pottery and the working of flint , bones and hides . Evidence suggests that Barnhouse was abandoned around 2600 BC. After Barnhouse ceased to be occupied , another structure was added , partially on top of the earlier building plans . This building ( known as Structure 8 ) had a room about 7 m ( 23 ft ) square with walls 3 m ( 10 ft ) thick and an entrance facing towards the north west so that the midsummer sunset shines along the passageway , with similarities to some chambered cairns . The structure was surrounded by a clay platform . The entrance through this was aligned with Maeshowe . The structure is assumed to have served as a ceremonial site rather than as a dwelling . It is thought to be closely linked with the nearby Stones of Stenness . Some of the hearth slabs from the structure may have been moved to the Stones . This site is accessible to the public via a footpath from the Standing Stones of Stenness ., Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during about the 9th to 13th centuries., The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

Card takes the Ender character, the ultimate leader and anti-hero, and turns him into a disfunctional, co-dependant, helpless character.Not only does the demise of the Ender character spoil the book, but the unbelievable, make-it-up-as-Card goes along, plot is so unbelievable it makes one wonder why there are so many subplots. It seems like Card has a bunch of ideas with no solution, so he resolves them by making up a new set of physics where he can pull resolutions from.The hive queen is the only thing that saves this book. The Path subplot is so redundant that I skippped many pages because it was so predictable.Advice: Skip this book and just get the plot summary from some web site.

Review: I recently got an xbox for christmas, and with it an extra controller (That's a total of 2 controllers). To be honest, I was a little nervous about the extra controller idea because of all the critisism it had received in its early reviews. But I was wrong to ever doubt Microsoft. In my opinion, the xbox controller is more comfortable than the original microsoft game pad for the computer, the ps2 dual shock, or the gamecube controller. The buttons are well placed, the triggers are sensitive-enough, but not too sensitive, the analog sticks are well placed and rubberized, and the d-pad worked pretty well. The only complaint I have is that the left analog stick is a little high for my taste, but I solved that problem by using the d-pad for its functions instead (even in halo...you should try that). Bottom line: great controller.

As a history buff I collect these type of books for modern warfare. The condition of the book was poor at best.

If the bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet, how much fabric is left in square feet?Answer: First figure out how many square feet the original bolt of fabric was: 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet. Then figure out how much fabric Ann took for the living room curtains: 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet. Then figure out how much fabric Ann took for the bathroom curtains: 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet. Finally, subtract the square footage of both sets of curtains from the total square footage: 192 - 24 - 8 = 160 square feet.

She wants to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream. At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are 3.00 each and the 2 cup package of raspberries are 5.00 each. The heavy cream is sold for 4.00 for a 4 cup container. How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?[Answer]She needs 4 cups of strawberries per quart of ice cream and the strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages. So 4 / 2 = 2 packages of strawberries. The strawberries cost 3.00 per package and she needs 2 so 3 * 2 = 6.00. She needs 4 cups of raspberries per quart of ice cream and the raspberries are sold in 2 cup packages. So 4 / 2 = 2 packages of raspberries. The raspberries cost 5.00 per package and she needs 2 so 5 * 2 = 10.00. Every quart needs 2 cups of heavy cream and she's making 2 quarts so 2 * 2 = 4 quarts. She will spend 6.00 on strawberries, 10.00 on raspberries and 4.00 on heavy cream bringing the total to 6 + 10 + 4 = 20.00. The answer is 20.Q: Mandy started reading books with only 8 pages when she was 6 years old.

This extended beyond learning, with the study highlighting links between access to early years education and reduced levels of obesity.But the report warned that spending on this sector could be patchy and that staff could be less well-paid than in the school system.Pre-school staff in the UK have seen their pay fall in real terms since 2010, says the OECD survey.Looking for good quality pre-school places could also be much more difficult for parents, compared with the amount of information available about schools.Mr Schleicher said the variety of early years places could be \\"very fragmented and hard to navigate\\".Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: \\"We have long argued that, given current limited resources, the government should focus its spending on where it is needed most.\\"As such, we remain at a loss as to why there has been no attempt to rethink the current eligibility criteria for the 30-hour offer.\\"A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \\"We are investing more than ever before into childcare - Â£6bn per year by 2020 - and doubling our existing offer of free childcare for all three and four year olds to 30 hours for working parents.\\"We are also supporting the most disadvantaged families with 15 free hours per week for two year olds, our pupil premium which is worth over Â£300 a year per child and our new Disability Access Fund, providing Â£615 per eligible child.\\"Young people who went through pre-school education are much more likely to do well in international Pisa tests when they are teenagers, says the OECD.Olive Cooke, from Bristol, was one of the UK's longest-serving poppy sellers and had collected money in Bristol for the Royal British Legion for 76 years.A suicide note said she had managed to get \\"little sleep\\" and could \\"take it no more\\". Her body was found at the bottom of the Avon Gorge in May.Avon deputy coroner Terence Moore recorded a verdict of suicide.The inquest, at Flax Bourton Coroner's Court, heard Mrs Cooke had previously attempted suicide in 2009.Her insomnia meant, in the months before her death, she was getting only two hours of sleep a night.Mrs Cooke supported numerous charities and at one point received 267 charity letters in one month, leading to suggestions that being hounded for money pushed her to take her own life.But her family insisted that - while the letters and phone calls were intrusive - the charities were not to blame for Mrs Cooke's death.Nothing was said of the charities during the inquest.But speaking after the hearing, son-in-law Brian Janes said the case had opened a \\"can of worms\\".\\"She had 27 direct debits to charities, she was an older lady who had a hard time saying 'no'  to anybody and they took advantage of her.\\"Whether it was deliberately or what, it still ended up taking advantage of an older person and that shouldn't be.\\"[We want] Olive to be known as a person with a big heart who loved life.\\"It is believed the former post lady sold some 30,000 poppies during her time helping the Royal British Legion.She started selling poppies at the age of 16 as her father was an active Royal British Legion member, having served in World War One.Mrs Cooke said, before she died, that selling poppies took on new meaning for her when her first husband was killed in action in World War Two.","answer":"A 92-year-old poppy seller killed herself after suffering problems with depression and insomnia."},{"question":"You will be given a sentence containing a pronoun/person name and an emotion.

She gets 50 points per 10 spent, plus a 250 point bonus if she spends more than 100. Martha buys 3 pounds of beef for 11 each, 8 pounds of fruits and vegetables for 4/pound, 3 jars of spices for 6 each, and other groceries totaling 37. How many points does Martha get?[Answer]First find the total cost of the beef: 11 / pound * 3 pounds = 33. Then find the total cost of the fruits and vegetables: 4 / pound * 8 pounds = 32. Then find the total cost of the spices: 6 / jar * 3 jars = 18. Now add the cost of all the items to find Martha's total spending: 33 + 32 + 18 + 37 = 120. Now divide 50 points by 10 to find now many points Martha gets per dollar: 50 points / 10 = 5 points / dollar. Now multiply this exchange rate by Martha's total spending to find how many points she gets before the bonus: 120 * 5 points / dollar = 600 points. Finally, add the 250 point bonus Martha gets for spending more than 100: 600 points + 250 points = 850 points. The answer is 850.Q: A marathon is 26 miles. He can run the first 10 miles in 1 hour. For the remaining miles he runs at 80% that pace. How long does the race take?A: There are 26 - 10 = 16 miles left for the rest of the race. He runs 10 * .8 = 8 miles per hour. So it takes him 16 / 8 = 2 hours. So in total it takes 1 + 2 = 3 hours. The answer is 3.Question: Daryl is loading crates at a warehouse and wants to make sure that they are not overloaded. Each crate can weigh up to 20kg and he has 15 crates he can fill. He has 4 bags of nails to load, each of which weighs 5kg; he has 12 bags of hammers, each of which weighs 5 kg; he also has 10 bags of wooden planks, each of which weighs 30kg and can be sub-divided. He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?Answer: Daryl can load up to 15 crates * 20kg per crate = 300kg. The nails weigh a total of 4 bags of nails * 5kg per bag of nails = 20kg. The hammers weigh a total of 12 bags of hammers * 5kg per bag of hammers = 60kg. The wooden planks weigh a total of 10 bags of wooden planks * 30kg per bag of wooden planks = 300kg. So in total, Daryl’s items weigh a total of 20kg nails + 60kg hammers + 300kg wooden planks = 380kg. He will therefore need to leave out 380kg in items – 300kg weight limit = 80kg. The answer is 80.[Question]It takes Emmalyn and her research team, the Polar Bears, 30 minutes to fully navigate around a volcanic island. On Saturday, they decided to start off by rounding the island once. They then re-grouped and planned out the rest of their weekend research schedule. They completed 10 more round that day and then went home. When they came on Sunday, they were able to complete 15 rounds. Calculate the total time, in minutes, the Polar Bears spent circling the island over that weekend.[Answer]On the first day, they started off doing one round of 30 minutes. The team did ten more rounds on day one which took 10 * 30 = 300 minutes. The total time they took circumnavigating the land on the first day is 300 + 30 = 330 minutes. On the second day, they did 15 rounds, which took 30 minutes each, giving 15 * 30 = 450 minutes. The total number of rounds took 330 + 450 = 780 minutes. The answer is 780.[Question]Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94.

She was excellent in this series. The snappy comebacks from the husband were very funny and original. Sometimes the father was annoying because his character here was basically the same one he played on \\"Seinfeld\\". However, his situations along with the rest of the characters were well written and constantly funny.

The next time I found out that it was going to be on tv, I recorded it. Then sometime later, the tape got wrecked and it was un-watchable. For awhile I looked and looked for this movie and could not find it. Then looking at a music store one day, I happened to find it. Even thought it had been quit a while since the last time I had seen the movie. When I watched it, it was like I just saw it yesterday. It made an impression on me from my childhood. I never watched the movie for good acting, special effects or anything like that. I watched it just for the sake of watching it and enjoying it. In my opinion, I think if you go about analyzing movies all the time. You are going to miss out on some great movies. Because their will be somthing about the movies that you won't like.

Today, around 3.9 billion people around the world live in towns and cities, with the global urban population growing by about one million people each week. But while urban dwellers may have better access to doctors and hospitals, there are growing concerns that city-living is severely damaging to health. Rat race: The Paris-based International Council for Science has launched a programme that aims to understand how a city environment can be changed to improve the health of its residents. Now, scientists at the International Council for Science have launched a global programme to find out exactly how factors such as pollution, overcrowding and crime are affecting overall wellbeing. The 'Urban Health and Wellbeing Programme' hopes to understand what makes a 'healthy urban environment', according to a report by Mark Kinver in the BBC. 'We are facing global epidemics of non-communicable diseases - heart disease, diabetes and so on - and mental health problems,' Professor Anthony Capon, director of the UN University's International Institute for Global Health, told the BBC. Packed: The programme claims that city-dwellers have higher rates of mental illness due to stress and social isolation. Those living in cities also suffer worse from impacts from car pollution. 'We are also seeing the health impact of climate change, such as heat-stress in cities and changes in the distribution of infectious vector-borne diseases.' Women who live in urban areas are more likely to develop postnatal depression than those who live in the countryside, recent research has claimed. Women who live in large cities are three per cent more likely to develop the condition five to 14 months after giving birth. The researchers believe this could be because city living is more stressful and is associated with less supportive communities. Dr Simone Vigod, at Women's College Hospital, in Toronto, said: 'Living in an urban area is a marker of more stress, less support and a potentially higher risk of postpartum depression for women. 'Our study suggests we need to better target our supports and services towards women based on their geographic location to improve their outcomes and reduce their risk of postpartum depression.' For instance, the programme claims that city-dwellers have higher rates of mental illness due to stress and social isolation. It is also looking at how infectious diseases thrive when people are crowded together, or how they emerge when cities expand into surrounding areas. 'The demographic advantage of youth in such countries would be lost unless combined with healthy living' said Indira Nath, Chair of the Scientific Committee at the International Council for Science. 'Policy makers face the challenge of viewing healthy cities as 'systems' consisting of multiple subsystems along with the overarching super system of climate change.' But Professor Capon said that the programme could offer some hope, by combining expertise between scientists and urban planners on how to better develop cities. The programme will look at everything from the design of public spaces and transport to improvements in housing and free city services. Professor Capon says the key is understanding that cities are really about people. 'We are attracted to cities for economic, educational and social opportunities,' he said 'When we live in cities, they need to work for us. It is not just about the economic efficiencies.'Summarize this article.Answer: International Council for Science is looking at how cities affect health. It claims city-dwellers have higher rates of mental illness due to stress. They lead a more sedentary lifestyle and suffer from impact of pollution. Programme aims to combine expertise of scientists and urban planners. They want to improve the design of housing, parks and public services. It warns that if nothing is changed, economic opportunities could be lost.Problem: GENEVA, Switzerland (CNN)  -- The Obama administration has been talking about \\"pressing the reset button\\" with Russia after relations \\"crashed\\" when Russia invaded Georgia last August. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laugh about their \\"reset' button. When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday before sitting down to their working dinner, she presented him a small green box with a ribbon. Inside was a red button with the Russian word \\"peregruzka\\" printed on it. \\"I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is: 'We want to reset our relationship and so we will do it together.'\\" Clinton, laughing, added, \\"We worked hard to get the right Russian word. Do you think we got it?\\" she asked Lavrov. \\"You got it wrong,\\" Lavrov said.\\" Both diplomats laughed. \\"It should be \\"perezagruzka\\" (the Russian word for reset,) Lavrov said. \\"This says 'peregruzka,' which means 'overcharged.'\\" The question came up at the news conference afterward. \\"In a way, the word that's on the button turns out to be also true,\\" Clinton said. \\"We are resetting, and because we are resetting, the minister and I have an overload of work.\\" Asked by a Russian reporter whether he had pressed the button, Lavrov said that he and Clinton did, indeed. \\"It is big and red and I hope that Russia and the United States, and other countries will never press on another button which used to be associated with a destructive war,\\" he said. The \\"overload,\\" Clinton said, is a broad agenda of issues. \\"We are going to systematically go through each and every one of them,\\" she added. Clinton said the two sides will get to work on re-negotiating a follow-up to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and nonproliferation. On other issues like Afghanistan, the Middle East and Iran, Clinton said, \\"We will work through them.\\" On issues where there is disagreement, Clinton said, \\"We are keeping those on the list because, we think through closer cooperation and building trust in each other, we can even tackle some of those differences.\\" Lavrov agreed the burden of the agenda for the two countries is \\"enormous,\\" but added: \\"I don't think either Hillary or I have any desire to be freed from any burden.\\" Clinton called the encounter \\"a very productive meeting of the minds.\\" She said both Lavrov and she are \\"very practical-minded\\" and will create a \\"specific set of objectives and responsibilities\\" to present to presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev before the leaders' first face-to-face meeting in April at the G-20 meeting in London. On the START treaty, she said Russia and the United States intend to have an agreement by the end of this year when the treaty expires and are \\"going to get to work immediately\\" on it. Lavrov was asked about Russian intentions to install S-300 missiles in Iran. He said the decision \\"will be made exclusively on the basis of law in accordance with Russian law, and will be under expert control, which is one of the strictest in the world and of course in accordance with international agreements.\\" Lavrov said the weapons Russia provides to its partners are \\"nondestabilizing, defensive weapons.\\" In an apparent reference to U.S. military supplies to Georgia, Lavrov said, \\"We want our partners to act the same way and show restraint in military supplies to those countries where, including very recently, those weapons have been used very close to our borders.\\" Senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters afterward, however, said they had not read Georgia into the minister's comments. They said the discussion ranged broadly over a number of areas and \\"we now have a very substantive work agenda that they just outlined.\\" \\"It would have been easier and in a first meeting almost natural to be much more general but in this case it was very focused and very productive in laying out steps,\\" one official said. On the proposed missile defense system the United States is considering installing in Poland and the Czech Republic, one official said, \\"Minister Lavrov made it clear he had listened quite attentively to Secretary Clinton's comments about missile defense ... and I think it's got them thinking.\\"Summarize this article.Answer:","answer":"United States, Russia want to \\"reset\\" relations after years of tension.

Review: This DVD absolutely blew me away in every regard. The songs from Fred's latest CD really come alive on this video as he explains the purpose behind each one. The arrangements have the same live flavor as the \\"Purpose By Design\\" video, plus more (you can't get much better than Marvin McQuitty, drums; Maurice Fitzgerald, bass; and Mo' Horns). To top it off, Fred's ministry during this recording is so powerful. This video has ALL the goods, plus something extra (anointing).If you're a Fred Hammond fan, this DVD is a necessity.

Many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal-based processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanol production, olefins (ethylene and propylene), and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks. In most cases, the first step involves gasification, which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk. Biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid. Therefore, biomass gasification is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and traces of methane. This gas mixture, called a producer gas, can provide fuel for various vital processes, such as internal combustion engines, as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications. Because any biomass material can undergo gasification, this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production, where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel. In addition, biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste (such as wastes available on a farm) into producer gas, which is a very usable fuel.Question: land conversion through burning of biomass releases which gas?Solution:","answer":"OK... To answer the question, consider the following: Therefore, biomass gasification is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and traces of methane.carbon monoxide , hydrogen , and traces of methane."},{"question":"Ques: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Though a bit confusing, a wonderful book! Review: This creative and original book approaches fantasy as it's never been approached before. Jones slyly inserts quite a few comments about fantasy stories and writers, while still portraying a wonderfully entertaining story.A problem I found with Jones' writing, is that she introduces all of her characters at once, sometimes making a reader have to flip back a couple pages to remember which character is who. Other than the slight confusion of introducing them, Jones' characters are wonderfully developed, each with his or her own distinct quirks.I suppose the ultimate reason I liked this book was because of the originality of the whole plot.

His mother bought 3 packages of cookies each containing 25 cookies. After playing football, the children came to eat and celebrate Aku's 10th birthday, each eating an equal number of all the cookies. Calculate the number of cookies that each child will eat.Let's think: Let’s first calculate the total number of cookies: 25 X 3 = 75 cookies. Let us now share these cookies among the 5 children: 75 / 5 = 15 cookies.. The answer is: 15.Madeline has 10 flowers. If 4 flowers are red, 2 flowers are white, and the rest are blue, what percentage of flowers are blue?Let's think: There are 4 + 2 = 6 flowers that are not blue. Thus, there are 10 - 6 = 4 blue flowers. Thus, blue flowers make up (4 / 10) * 100 = 40%.. The answer is: 40.John decides to get a new apartment with a roommate. His former rent was 2 per square foot for a 750 square foot apartment. His new apartment cost 2800 per month, which he splits evenly with the roommate. How much money does he save a year?Let's think: His old apartment cost 750 * 2 = 1500 a month. His new apartment cost 2800 / 2 = 1400 a month. So he saves 1500 - 1400 = 100 a month. That means he saves 100 * 12 = 1200 a year.. The answer is: 1200.Noel bakes 4 dozen donuts for his class. There are 30 students in class, but only 80% like donuts.

Attendance is up today, thought Greg. As the organist was nearing the end of the Prelude, he stepped up to the podium. \\"Please take your hymnals and turn to page 23, and let's stand and sing 'Holy, Holy, Holy.'\\" Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. At the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus. After the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful. Standing there in her choir robe, she looked like a redheaded angel. If they could just get married, Greg could stop feeling guilty about his desire for her. Who stepped up to the podium? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Cynthia. - not enough information - God. - Greg.Answer: Greg.Question: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt. The author will most likely Pick the correct answer from the following options: - sell their house on their own - not enough information - interview realtors - list the house in the paperAnswer: interview realtorsQuestion: Thanks Richard for asking. Yes. I have something to tell. We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit. Later in day we heard about the most stupid thing; people were inside their houses, watching flames from pole but not knowing what to do. THEY DID NOT EVEN COME OUT TO SHARE THE ACTIVITY. That has happened today. I am going to ask everyone about it one by one. Also, I am still looking for the guy who went to complaint office and was never seen thereafter this morning. That can happen to anybody. Who asked the narrator to describe this event?

The use of a single millimeter cutoff (such as 2.5 or 3.0 mm) is inappropriate because nuchal translucency measurements normally increases with gestational age (by approximately 15 % to 20 % per gestational week from 10 to 13 weeks). At 12 weeks of gestational age, an \\"average\\" nuchal thickness of 2.18 mm has been observed; however, up to 13 % of chromosomally normal fetuses present with a nuchal translucency of greater than 2.5 mm. Thus for even greater accuracy of predicting risks, the outcome of the nuchal scan may be combined with the results of simultaneous maternal blood tests. In pregnancies affected by Down syndrome there is a tendency for the levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to be increased and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) to be decreased.Answer this question based on the passage: normal range for nuchal fold at 12 weeks?

Your goal is to judge whether the provided answer is a valid incorrect answer to a given question. An incorrect answer should not truthfully answer the given question. A good incorrect answer should be closely related to the content of the paragraph and/or the question so that the readers are forced to read the whole paragraph to infer its [in]correctness. Additionally, an incorrect answer should be of the same semantic type as the given correct answer (e.g., both can be names of locations). If you think the given incorrect answer is good(and incorrect), indicate it by responding \\"Yes\\". Otherwise, respond \\"No\\". There are only two types of responses possible:\\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\".Let me give you an example: Paragraph- Sent 1: It was hot that day.Sent 2: The temperature on the wall of the backyard was showing something well over 100 F.Sent 3: Meanwhile Tom, at home, was trying finish the remainder of carrots from last night, and packing for his trip to Chicago tomorrow.Sent 4: As employees of the Art Museum, Tom and his older cousin often had to travel to Chicago.

Incorrect Answer: Far below 100 F.The answer to this example can be: Yes.Here is why: This is a good incorrect answer, as the words corresponding to this answer appear in the the paragraph (at least partially). They are also related to the content of the question (temperature), but do not answer the question correctly. Someone will have to carefully read the paragraph to identify that these don't answer the question correctly.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.PROBLEM: Article: The people who built Stonehenge in Southern England thousands of years ago had wild parties, eating barbecued pigs and breaking pottery. This is according to recent work by archaeologists--history experts who investigate how human beings lived in the past. Archaeologists digging near Stonehenge last year discovered the remains of a large prehistoric village where they think the builders of the mysterious stone circle used to live. The village is about 4,600 years old, the same age as Stonehenge and as old as the Pyramids in Egypt. It is less than two miles from the famous ancient landmark and lies inside a massive man-made circular dirt wall, or \\"henge\\", known as the Durrington Walls. Remains found at the site included jewellry, stone arrowheads, tools made of deer antlers, wooden spears and huge amounts of animal bones and broken pottery. \\"These finds suggest Stone Age people went to the village at special times of the year to feast and party\\", says Mike Parker-Pearson from Sheffield University in England. He said many of the pig bones they found had been thrown away half-eaten. He also said the partygoers appeared to have shot some of the farm pigs with arrows, possibly as a kind of sport before barbecuing them. An ancient road which led from the village to the River Avon was also found. Here, the experts think, people came after their parties to throw dead  s in the water so the bodies would be washed downstream to Stonehenge. Parker-Pearson believes Stonehenge was like a cemetery where ancient Britons buried the dead and remembered their ancestors. The theory is that Stonehenge is a kind of spirit home to the ancestors. The recent discovery of the village within the Durrington Walls shows that Stonehenge didn't stand alone but was part of a much bigger religious site, according to Parker-Pearson.People still come to worship and celebrate at Stonehenge today. They meet there when the sun sets on the shortest day of winter and when it rises on the longest day of summer. But the days of barbecuing whole pigs there and throwing family members into the river are a thing of the past. At present, it has been attracting a great number of visitors all around the world. Here is a comment from a visitor. \\"I am speaking to a friend on Facebook who is heartbroken that she went there with utter love and respect for the site and that the whole Summer Solstice event was full of drunk party goers and those that had gone in a respectful, loving way were made to sit on the outside, so as not to be disturbed by the revellers.\\"  Answer: A site where dead people were placed or remembered.SOLUTION: What was Stonehenge according to the text?PROBLEM: Article: Take control of your health by learning these four numbers. They'll help with everything from losing weight to protecting your heart. Your daily calorie needs This is not technically a measurement, but it can have a huge influence on your health. Most women need 2,000 calories a day for good health, and men generally need about 2,550. One way to work out your daily calorie needs is to multiply   your weight in pounds by 13 to 15, depending on your activity level. But roughly, that's 300 to 400 calories for breakfast, 500 to 600 for lunch, and 600 to 700 for dinner. Trying to lose weight? Eat about 500 calories less. Your waist size Waist size is one of the best ways to measure whether your weight is affecting your heart health. When body fat is packed into your abdomen  ,your risk of heart attack increases. For women, health risk begins to rise when your waist is more than 35 inches. For men, risk increases with a measurement when your waist is over 40 inches. Your blood pressure Blood pressure rises and falls normally during the day. When it remains high, you have high blood pressure and this carries a higher risk or heart disease and stroke. A reading of 140/90 mm Hg or more is considered high, and if it's between 120/80 and 139/89, you may still be at risk and should be taking steps to prevent the development of high blood pressure. Your morning pulse rate Your pulse rate is the number of times your heart beats in one minute. A normal resting pulse rate is 60 to 90 beats per minute. People who are fit tend to have lower resting pulse rates because their heart muscles are in good shape. But if you don't exercise regularly and your heart rate is lower than the normal range, tell your doctor--it could be a sign of heart disease.  Answer: Taking in a little fewer calories than the total amountSOLUTION: How can you control daily calories if you decide to lose weight?PROBLEM: Article: I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch in San Ysidro.

Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election). From a final ballot typically including 25 -- 40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75 % or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5 % of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee. Players receiving 5 % or more of the votes but fewer than 75 % are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).Based on this passage, how long do you have to wait to be inducted into the mlb hall of fame? Let's give stream of consciousness first:","answer":"To answer the question, consider the following: Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).So, the final answer is Five years after retirement."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Until 1738, this Province of New Jersey shared its royal governor with the neighboring Province of New York. The Province of New Jersey was governed by appointed governors until 1776. William Franklin, the province's last royal governor before the American Revolution (1775 -- 83), was marginalized in the last year of his tenure, as the province was run de facto by the Provincial Congress of New Jersey. In June 1776, the Provincial Congress formally deposed Franklin and had him arrested, adopted a state constitution, and reorganized the province into an independent state. The constitution granted the vote to all inhabitants who had a certain level of wealth, including single women and blacks (until 1807). The newly formed State of New Jersey elected William Livingston as its first governor on 31 August 1776 -- a position to which he would be reelected until his death in 1790. New Jersey was one of the original Thirteen Colonies, and was the third colony to ratify the constitution forming the United States of America. It thereby was admitted into the new federation as a state on 18 December 1787. On 20 November 1789 New Jersey became the first state to ratify the Bill of Rights.Question: Based on this passage, who was the first govener of new jersey?Answer: To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: The newly formed State of New Jersey elected William Livingston as its first governor on 31 August 1776 -- a position to which he would be reelected until his death in 1790.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 656.3 square miles (1,700 km); this comprises 634.0 square miles (1,642 km) of land and 22.3 square miles (58 km) covered by water. The Piney Woods are north of Houston. Most of Houston is located on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, swamp, or prairie which resembles the Deep South, and are all still visible in surrounding areas. The flatness of the local terrain, when combined with urban sprawl, has made flooding a recurring problem for the city. Downtown stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 feet (38 m) in elevation. The city once relied on groundwater for its needs, but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as Lake Houston, Lake Conroe, and Lake Livingston. The city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons a day of groundwater.Based on this passage, how many miles from houston to louisiana border?Student B:OK...

She was able to increase the account by 25% from funds she earned babysitting. Then it decreased by 20% when she bought a new pair of shoes. Her final balance is what percentage of her starting balance?A: Megan started with 125 and increased it by 25%, so 125 + (0.25)125 or 125 + 31.25 = 156.25. Then the balance decreased by 20%, so 156.25 – (0.20)156.25 or 156.25 - 31.25 = 125. 125 is the balance Megan started with, so her final balance is 100% of the starting balance. The answer is 100.Question: Anahi bought a 500 pages book to write some notes on. In the first week, she wrote on 150 pages. In the second week, she wrote on 30% of the remaining pages. While continuing writing, she accidentally spilled coffee on the book and damaged 20 percent of the empty pages she was to write on. Calculate the total number of empty pages available for her to write on now.Answer: If she bought a 500 pages book and wrote on 150 pages, the number of empty pages remaining is 500 - 150 = 350 pages. She then wrote on 30% of the remaining empty pages on the second week, a total of 30 / 100 * 350 = 105 pages. The number of remaining empty pages is 350 - 105 = 245 pages. When she spilled coffee on the remaining empty pages, the number of damaged pages was 20 / 100 * 245 = 49. The number of empty pages remaining that she could write on is 245 - 49 = 196 pages. The answer is 196.[Question]Care and Rick have a repair shop. Each repair is priced differently: phone repair costs 11, laptop repair costs 15 and computer repair costs 18. If they perform 5 phone repairs, 2 laptop repairs, and 2 computer repairs for this week, how much did they earn for the week?[Answer]They earned 11 x 5 = 55 for the phone repairs. They earned 15 x 2 = 30 for the laptop repairs. They also earned 18 x 2 = 36 for computer repairs. Therefore, Care and Rick earned 55 + 30 + 36 = 121 for the week.

If the land he bought costs 20 per square meter, how big is his land after buying the new land?A: Carlson bought land that cost 20 per square meter, therefore the size of the land he bought is 8000 / 20 = 400. And the size of the other land he bought is 4000 / 20 = 200. Therefore the total size of the land he owns is 400 + 200 + 300 = 900. The answer is 900.Question: Martha has 20 apples. She decided to split them among her friends. Jane got 5 apples from her, and James got 2 more than Jane.

If you haven't seen FireFly set, you should watch all 14 episodes before you watch Serenity. - Too bad this series didn't get a fair chance, it might have taken off.

Congress finds that--            (1) the Federal reclamation program has been in existence         for over 90 years, with an estimated taxpayer investment of         over 70,000,000,000;            (2) the program has had and continues to have an enormous         effect on the water resources and aquatic environments of the         western States;            (3) irrigation water made available from Federal water         projects in the West is a very valuable resource for which         there are increasing and competing demands;            (4) the justification for providing water at less than full         cost was to benefit and promote the development of small family         farms and exclude large corporate farms, but this purpose has         been frustrated over the years due to inadequate implementation         of subsidy and acreage limits;            (5) below-cost water prices tend to encourage excessive use         of scarce water supplies in the arid regions of the West, and         reasonable price increases to the wealthiest western farmers         would provide an economic incentive for greater water         conservation;            (6) the Federal Government has increasingly applied         eligibility tests based on income for Federal entitlement and         subsidy programs, measures that are consistent with the         historic approach of the reclamation program's acreage         limitations that seek to limit water subsidies to smaller         farms; and            (7) including a means test based on gross income in the         reclamation program will increase the effectiveness of carrying         out the family farm goals of the Federal reclamation laws.SEC. 103.

SHORT TITLE.    This Act may be cited as the \`\`American Missile Protection Act of 1998''.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.    Congress makes the following findings:            (1) The threat of weapons of mass destruction delivered by         long-range ballistic missiles is among the most serious         security issues facing the United States.                    (A) In a 1994 Executive Order, President Clinton                 certified, that \`\`I ... find that the proliferation of                 nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (\`weapons of                 mass destruction') and the means of delivering such                 weapons, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat                 to the national security, foreign policy, and economy                 of the United States, and hereby declare a national                 emergency to deal with that threat.'' This state of                 emergency was reaffirmed in 1995, 1996, and 1997.                    (B) In 1994 the President stated, that \`\`there is                 nothing more important to our security and the world's                 stability than preventing the spread of nuclear weapons                 and ballistic missiles''.                    (C) Several countries hostile to the United States                 have been particularly determined to acquire missiles                 and weapons of mass destruction. President Clinton                 observed in January of 1998, for example, that \`\`Saddam                 Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and                 much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the                 Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and                 biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them''.                    (D) In 1996, the Senate affirmed that, \`\`it is in                 the supreme interest of the United States to defend                 itself from the threat of limited ballistic missile                 attack, whatever the source.''            (2) The long-range ballistic missile threat to the United         States is increasing.                    (A) Several adversaries of the United States have                 stated their intention to acquire intercontinental                 ballistic missiles capable of attacking the United                 States.                            (i) Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi has                         stated, \`\`If they know that you have a                         deterrent force capable of hitting the United                         States, they would not be able to hit you. If                         we had possessed a deterrent--missiles that                         could reach New York--we would have hit it at                         the same moment. Consequently, we should build                         this force so that they and others will no                         longer think about an attack.''                            (ii) Abu Abbas, the head of the Palestine                         Liberation Front, has stated, \`\`I would love to                         be able to reach the American shore, but this                         is very difficult. Someday an Arab country will                         have ballistic missiles. Someday an Arab                         country will have a nuclear bomb. It is better                         for the United States and for Israel to reach                         peace with the Palestinians before that day.''                            (iii) Saddam Hussein has stated, \`\`Our                         missiles cannot reach Washington. If we could                         reach Washington, we would strike if the need                         arose.''                            (iv) Iranian actions speak for themselves.                         Iran's aggressive pursuit of medium-range                         ballistic missiles capable of striking Central                         Europe--aided by the continuing collaboration                         of outside agents--demonstrates Tehran's intent                         to acquire ballistic missiles of ever-                        increasing range.                    (B) Over 30 non-NATO countries possess ballistic                 missiles, with at least 10 of those countries                 developing over 20 new types of ballistic missiles.                    (C) From the end of World War II until 1980,                 ballistic missiles were used in one conflict. Since                 1980, thousands of ballistic missiles have been fired                 in at least six different conflicts.                    (D) The clear trend among countries hostile to the                 United States is toward having ballistic missiles of                 greater range.                            (i) North Korea first acquired 300-                        kilometer range Scud Bs, then developed and                         deployed 500-kilometer range Scud Cs, is                         currently deploying the 1000-kilometer range                         No-Dong, and is developing the 2000-kilometer                         range Taepo-Dong 1 and 6000-kilometer range                         Taepo-Dong 2, which would be capable of                         striking Alaska and Hawaii.                            (ii) Iran acquired 150-kilometer range CSS-                        8s, progressed through the Scud B and Scud C,                         and is developing the 1300-kilometer range                         Shahab-3 and 2000-kilometer range Shahab-4,                         which would allow Iran to strike Central                         Europe.                            (iii) Iraq, in a two-year crash program,                         produced a new missile, the Al-Hussein, with                         twice the range of its Scud Bs.                            (iv) Experience gained from extending the                         range of short- and medium-range ballistic                         missiles facilitates the development of                         intercontinental ballistic missiles.                    (E) The technical information, hardware, and other                 resources necessary to build ballistic missiles are                 increasingly available and accessible worldwide.                            (i) Due to advances in information                         technology, a vast amount of technical                         information relating to ballistic missile                         design, much of it formerly classified, has                         become widely available and is increasingly                         accessible through the Internet and other                         distribution avenues.                            (ii) Components, tools, and materials to                         support ballistic missile development are                         increasingly available in the commercial                         aerospace industry.                            (iii) Increasing demand for satellite-based                         telecommunications is adding to the demand for                         commercial Space Launch Vehicles, which employ                         technology that is essentially identical to                         that of intercontinental ballistic missiles. As                         this increasing demand is met, the technology                         and expertise associated with space launch                         vehicles also proliferate.                    (F) Russia and China have provided significant                 technical assistance to rogue nation ballistic missile                 programs, accelerating the pace of those efforts. In                 June of 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence,                 reporting to Congress on weapons of mass destruction-                related equipment, materials, and technology, stated                 that \`\`China and Russia continued to be the primary                 suppliers, and are key to any future efforts to stem                 the flow of dual-use goods and modern weapons to                 countries of concern.''                    (G) Russia and China continue to engage in missile                 proliferation.                            (i) Despite numerous Russian assurances not                         to assist Iran with its ballistic missile                         program, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of                         State for Nonproliferation testified to the                         Senate, that \`\`the problem is this: there is a                         disconnect between those reassurances, which we                         welcome, and what we believe is actually                         occurring.''                            (ii) Regarding China's actions to                         demonstrate the sincerity of its commitment to                         nonproliferation, the Director of Central                         Intelligence testified to the Senate on January                         28, 1998, that, \`\`the jury is still out on                         whether the recent changes are broad enough in                         scope and whether they will hold over the                         longer term. As such, Chinese activities in                         this area will require continued close                         watching.''                    (H) The inability of the United States to defend                 itself against weapons of mass destruction delivered by                 long-range ballistic missile provides additional                 incentive for hostile nations to develop long-range                 ballistic missiles with which to threaten the United                 States. Missiles are widely viewed as valuable tools                 for deterring and coercing a vulnerable United States.            (3) The ability of the United States to anticipate future         ballistic missile threats is questionable.                    (A) The Intelligence Community has failed to                 anticipate many past technical innovations (for                 example, Iraq's extended-range Al-Hussein missiles and                 its development of a space launch vehicle) and outside                 assistance enables rogue states to surmount traditional                 technological obstacles to obtaining or developing                 ballistic missiles of increasing range.                    (B) In June of 1997, the Director of Central                 Intelligence reported to Congress that \`\`many Third                 World countries--with Iran being the most prominent                 example--are responding to Western counter-                proliferation efforts by relying more on legitimate                 commercial firms as procurement fronts and by                 developing more convoluted procurement networks.''                    (C) In June of 1997, the Director of Central                 Intelligence stated to Congress that \`\`gaps and                 uncertainties preclude a good projection of exactly                 when \`rest of the world' countries will deploy ICBMs.''                    (D) In 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence                 testified that Iran would have a medium-range missile                 by 2007. One year later the Director stated, \`\`since I                 testified, Iran's success in getting technology and                 materials from Russian companies, combined with recent                 indigenous Iranian advances, means that it could have a                 medium-range missile much sooner than I assessed last                 year.'' Department of State officials have testified                 that Iran could be prepared to deploy such a missile as                 early as late 1998, nine years earlier than had been                 predicted one year before by the Director of Central                 Intelligence.            (4) The failure to prepare adequately for long-range         ballistic missile threats could have severe national security         and foreign policy consequences for the United States.                    (A) An attack on the United States by a ballistic                 missile equipped with a weapon of mass destruction                 could inflict catastrophic death or injury to citizens                 of the United States and severe damage to their                 property.                    (B) A rogue state's ability to threaten the United                 States with an intercontinental ballistic missile may                 constrain the United States' options in dealing with                 regional threats to its interests, deter the United                 States from taking appropriate action, or prompt allies                 to question United States security guarantees, thereby                 weakening alliances of the United States and the United                 States' world leadership position.            (5) The United States must be prepared for rogue nations         acquiring long-range ballistic missiles armed with weapons of         mass destruction.                    (A) In its resolution of ratification for the START                 II Treaty, the United States Senate declared that                 \`\`because deterrence may be inadequate to protect the                 United States against long-range ballistic missile                 threats, missile defenses are a necessary part of new                 deterrent strategies.''                    (B) In September of 1994, Secretary of Defense                 Perry stated that in the post-Cold War era, \`\`we now                 have opportunity to create a new relationship based not                 on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but rather                 on another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.''                    (C) On February 12, 1997, the Under Secretary of                 Defense for Policy testified to the Senate that \`\`I and                 the administration are quite willing to acknowledge                 that if we saw a rogue state, a potential proliferant,                 beginning to develop a long-range ICBM capable of                 reaching the United States, we would have to give very,                 very serious attention to deploying a limited national                 missile defense.''            (6) The United States has no defense deployed against         weapons of mass destruction delivered by long-range ballistic         missiles and no policy to deploy such a national missile         defense system.SEC. 3.

(b) Capital and Reserve Requirements.--With respect to the transfer of a mortgage loan with recourse that is a sale under generally accepted accounting principles, each qualified insured depository institution shall--            (1) establish and maintain a reserve equal to an amount         sufficient to meet the reasonable estimated liability of the         institution under the recourse arrangement; and            (2) treat as an asset (for purposes of applicable capital         standards and other capital measures, including risk-based         capital requirements) only the maximum amount at risk under the         recourse arrangement.    (c) Qualified Institutions Defined.--An insured depository institution is a qualified insured depository institution for purposes of this section if, without regard to the accounting principles or capital requirements referred to in subsections (a) and (b), the institution is--            (1) well capitalized; or            (2) with the approval, by regulation or order, of the         appropriate Federal banking agency, adequately capitalized.    (d) Aggregate Amount of Recourse.--The total outstanding amount at risk with respect to transfers of mortgage loans under subsections (a) and (b) (together with the amount at risk under any provisions of law substantially similar to subsections (a) and (b)) shall not exceed--            (1) the amount which is equal to 15 percent of the risk-        based capital of the institution; or            (2) such greater amount, as established by the appropriate         Federal banking agency by regulation or order.    (e) Institutions That Cease To Be Qualified or Exceed Aggregate Limits.--If an insured depository institution ceases to be a qualified insured depository institution or exceeds the limits under subsection (d), this section shall remain applicable to any transfer of mortgage loans that occurred at a time when the institution was qualified and had not exceeded such limit.    (f) Prompt Corrective Action not Affected.--The capital of an insured depository institution shall be computed without regard to this section in determining whether the institution is less than well capitalized.    (g) Regulations Required.--Before the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, each appropriate Federal banking agency shall prescribe final regulations implementing this section.    (h) Alternative System Permitted.--            (1) In general.--At the discretion of the appropriate         Federal banking agency, this section shall not apply if the         regulations of the agency provide that the aggregate amount of         capital and reserves required with respect to the transfer of         mortgage loans with recourse does not exceed the aggregate         amount of capital and reserves that would be required under         subsection (b).            (2) Existing transactions not affected.--Notwithstanding         paragraph (1), this section shall remain in effect with respect         to transfers of mortgage loans with recourse by qualified         insured depository institutions occurring before the effective         date of regulations referred to in paragraph (1).

Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions:(i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage(ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer(iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question(iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable.See one example below:Problem: Passage: In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain for control of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. It was part of a large expansion of British territory following the country's victory in the Seven Years' War. Almost the entire Spanish population left, taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to Cuba. The British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British named \\"Cow Ford\\", both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.Solution: Who owned Cuba after the Eight Years War?Explanation: This question appears to be relevant to the passage as both involves words such as 'Cuba' and 'War' which also exist in the passage. The passage mentions that \\"after the war, almost the entire Spanish population left, taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to Cuba\\". This information is not sufficient to conclude that which country owned cuba.Problem: Passage: On the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the past is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the future is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.Solution:","answer":"How is the future perceived as by the crew?"},{"question":"In this task, you're given a statement and three sentences as choices.

They also had a special where you could buy one dozen carnations for 4.00. If Georgia sent a dozen carnations to each of her 5 teachers and bought one carnation for each of her 14 friends, how much money would she spend?[Answer]She wants to send a dozen carnations that cost 4 / dz to each of her 5 teachers, so 4 * 5 = 20. She has 14 friends and she knows a dozen carnations is cheaper than buying 12 single carnations. So 14 - 12 = 2 single carnations are needed. A single carnation cost 0.50 so 2 * .50 = 1.00. All total she will spend 20 + 4 + 1 = 25.00 on carnations. The answer is 25.Q: Ashton had two boxes of pencils with fourteen pencils in each box. He gave six pencils to his brother.

Each jar can hold 12 pickles. It takes 10 ounces of vinegar per jar of pickles. When he is all done making as many pickles as he has supplies for, how many ounces of vinegar are left?Answer: The jars allow him to make 48 pickles because 4 x 12 = 48. The cucumbers allow him to make 60 pickles because 10 x 6 = 60. The vinegar allows him to make 10 jars of pickles because 100 / 10 = 10. The vinegar is enough to make 60 pickles because 10 x 6 = 60. He can make 48 pickles because 48 < 60. He needs 4 jars to make this because 48 / 12 = 4. He needs 40 ounces of vinegar because 4 x 10 = 40. He has 60 ounces remaining because 100 - 40 = 60.

Passage:After the All Blacks tour, amid a time where prominent California colleges and universities were transitioning back to playing American football from rugby union, no further matches were held. However, after organizing a team for a successful tour of British Columbia in early 1920, the California Rugby Union successfully petitioned the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to enter a team at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. The USOC declined to provide any funding for this team; in June 1920, the Amateur Athletic Union agreed to pay for the team's expenses. After each of the home nations declined to send a team to the Games on account of scheduling conflicts with their domestic competitions, and the teams from Romania and Czechoslovakia withdrew from the Games on short notice, the Olympic rugby union competition was reduced to a single match between the United States and France. After a scoreless first half, the United States won this match by a score of 8–0. Following the Olympics, the French Rugby Union invited the American team to tour France. Sixteen members of the team that competed in the Olympics traveled to France and played three uncapped matches against regional opposition from the southeast, south, and southwest of France; each resulted in a victory for the Americans. A final match against the French national team was held on October 10, 1920 in Paris, resulting in a 14–5 defeat for the Americans. Upon returning to the United States, the team was disbanded. Charles Tilden served as team captain during the 1920 Olympics and the tour of France that followed. Daniel Carroll, veteran of the 1913 team, served as player-coach in 1920; he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2016.[A]: a[Q]: Question: Did the 2008 Olympic basketball tournament that Fernández played in take place in the capital city of its country?

Based on the information provided in a given passage, you should identify the shortest continuous text span from the passage that serves as an answer to the given question. Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question.See one example below:Problem: Passage: The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War. The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict. Question: When was the French and Indian War?Solution: 1754-1763Explanation: It is a common convention to write (start year-end year) beside a historical event to understand when the event happened. We can observe a similar notation from the passage to conclude that the French and Indian War happened during 1754–1763. Therefore, the answer is 1754–1763.Problem: Passage: The discovery of the element is credited to the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth. While he was working in his experimental laboratory in Berlin in 1789, Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder, which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself (in fact, that powder was an oxide of uranium).

ExampleFact1: Ning returns to home village, Fact2: home village has fallen on desperate times, Fact3: rebel sisters and Moon After discover Elder Chu's pendant short skirmish, Fact4: father is being transported to place of execution, Fact5: Imperial High Monk Before arrives with entourage longAnswer: Following the events of the first film, Ning (Leslie Cheung) parts ways with the Taoist Yin (Wu Ma) and returns to his home village, which has since fallen on desperate times. Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel. Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn (Jacky Cheung), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy (Joey Wong) and Moon (Michelle Reis) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu. The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu (Waise Lee). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father. Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk. The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away. The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving. In the desert, as Yin and Ning are about to continue their journey, they see two women approach on horseback, which happen to be Windy and Moon. Windy has escaped from her wedding and decides to leave with NingExplanation: All the given five facts are present in the generated story in the same order that they appear in the input.Part 3.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.Q: Context_1 : Na Hyeseok (Hangul: 나혜석 ; Hanja: 羅蕙錫 , 28 April 1896 – 10 December 1948) was a Korean feminist, poet, writer, painter, educator, and journalist. Her pen name was Jeongwol (Hangul: 정월, 晶月). She was a pioneering Korean feminist writer and painter. She was the first female professional painter and the first feminist writer in Korea. She created some of the earliest Western paintings in Korea, and published feminist novels and short stories. She became well known as a feminist with her criticism against the marital institution in the early 20th century. Context_2 : Hermeticism is a historiographical term describing the work that attempts to reconstruct the mode of thought held by 17th century scientists. It primarily traces out the connections of Renaissance (16th century) modes of thought with those of the Scientific Revolution (17th century). This type of analysis began with English historians of science in the 1960s. This category of history of science work has largely subsumed earlier academic philosophers' work on the problem of transition from Aristotelianism to 17th century science. Context_3 : The Welbeck Academy or Welbeck Circle is a name that has been given to the loose intellectual grouping around William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the first half of the 17th century. It takes its name from Welbeck Abbey, a country house in Nottinghamshire that was a Cavendish family seat. Another term used is Newcastle Circle. The geographical connection is, however, more notional than real; and these terms have been regarded also as somewhat misleading. Cavendish was Viscount Mansfield in 1620, and moved up the noble ranks to Duke, step by step; \\"Newcastle\\" applies by 1628. Context_4 : Álvaro Cepeda Samudio (March 30, 1926 – October 12, 1972) was a Colombian journalist, novelist, short story writer, and filmmaker. Within Colombia and the rest of Latin America, he is known in his own right as an important and innovative writer and journalist, largely inspiring much of the artistically, intellectually and politically active climate for which this particular time and place, that of mid-century Colombia, has become known. His fame is considerably more quaint outside his home country, where it derives primarily from his standing as having been part of the influential artistic and intellectual circle in Colombia in which fellow writer and journalist Gabriel García Márquez—with whom he was also a member of the more particularized Barranquilla Group—and painter Alejandro Obregón also played prominent roles. Only one of his works, \\"La casa grande\\", has received considerable notice beyond the Spanish-speaking world, having been translated into several languages, English and French among them; his fame as a writer has therefore been significantly curtailed in the greater international readership, as the breadth of his literary and journalistic output has reached few audiences beyond those of Latin America and Latin American literary scholars. Context_5 : During the early part of the 17th century, and persisting in some form into the early 18th century, there were a number of proposals for an English Academy: some form of learned institution, conceived as having royal backing and a leading role in the intellectual life of the nation. Definite calls for an English Academy came in 1617, based on the Italian model dating back to the 16th century; they were followed up later, after the 1635 founding of the French \\"Académie\\", by John Dryden (1664), John Evelyn (1665), and Daniel Defoe (1697). Context_6 : Mary Astell (Newcastle upon Tyne, 12 November 1666 – London, 11 May 1731) was an English feminist writer and rhetorician. Her advocacy of equal educational opportunities for women has earned her the title \\"the first English feminist.\\" Context_7 : Judith Drake (fl. 1670s–1723) was an English intellectual and author who was active in the last decade of the 17th century. She was part of a circle of intellectuals, authors, and philosophers which included Mary Astell, Lady Mary Chudleigh, Elizabeth Thomas, Elizabeth Elstob, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and John Norris. She was married to James Drake F.R.S., physician and Tory pamphleteer. She is remembered in the field of feminist literature for her 1696 essay, \\"An Essay in Defence of the Female Sex\\". Context_8 : Mary Chudleigh, Lady Chudleigh (August 1656 – 1710) was an English poet who was part of an intellectual circle which included Mary Astell, Elizabeth Thomas, Judith Drake, Elizabeth Elstob, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and John Norris. In her later years she published a volume of poetry and two volumes of essays, all dealing with feminist themes. Two of her books were published in four editions during the last ten years of her life. Her poetry on the theme of human relationships and human reactions has appeared in several anthologies and her feminist essays are still in print. Context_9 : Caerlaverock Castle (from \\"caer laverock\\", \\"lark castle\\") is a moated triangular castle first built in the 13th century. It is located on the southern coast of Scotland, 11 km south of Dumfries, on the edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve. Caerlaverock was a stronghold of the Maxwell family from the 13th century until the 17th century when the castle was abandoned. It was besieged by the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and underwent several partial demolitions and reconstructions over the 14th and 15th centuries. In the 17th century, the Maxwells were created Earls of Nithsdale, and built a new lodging within the walls, described as among \\"the most ambitious early classical domestic architecture in Scotland\\". In 1640 the castle was besieged for the last time and was subsequently abandoned. Although demolished and rebuilt several times, the castle retains the distinctive triangular plan first laid out in the 13th century. Caerlaverock Castle was built to control trade in early times. Context_10 : Sir Roger Pratt (1620 – 20 February 1684) was an English gentleman-architect of the 17th century. He designed only five known buildings, but was highly influential, establishing a particularly English type of house, which was widely imitated. He drew on a range of European influences, and also on the work of Inigo Jones, England's first classical architect. Pratt also served on official commissions, and in 1668 was the first English architect to be knighted for his services. fact_1 : Judith Drake (fl. fact_2 :  1670s–1723) was an English intellectual and author who was active in the last decade of the 17th century. fact_3 :  She was part of a circle of intellectuals, authors, and philosophers which included Mary Astell, Lady Mary Chudleigh, Elizabeth Thomas, Elizabeth Elstob, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and John Norris. fact_4 : Mary Astell (Newcastle upon Tyne, 12 November 1666 – London, 11 May 1731) was an English feminist writer and rhetorician. fact_5 :  Her advocacy of equal educational opportunities for women has earned her the title \\"the first English feminist.\\" Answer: Mary AstellA:","answer":"Which English feminist part of the intellectual circle with Judith Drake in the 17th century was known as the first English feminist?"},{"question":"Definition: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.Input: Article: Researchers in the field of psychology have found that one of the best ways to make an important decision, such as choosing a university to attend or a business to invest in, involves the use of a decision worksheet. Psychologists who study optimization   compare the actual decision made by people to theoretical ideal decisions to see how similar they are. Proponents   of the worksheet procedure believe that it will yield optimal, that is, the best decisions. Although there are several variations on the exact format   that worksheets can take, they are all similar in their essential aspects. Worksheets require defining the problem in a clear and concise way and then listing all possible solutions to the problem. Next, the relevant considerations that will be affected by each decision are listed, and the   importance of each consideration or consequence is determined. Each consideration is assigned a numerical value to reflect its   importance. A decision is mathematically calculated by adding these values together. The alternative with the highest number of points emerges   as the best decision.    Since most important problems are multifaceted  ,there are several alternatives to choose from, each with unique advantages and disadvantages. One of the benefits of a pencil and paper decision-making procedure is that it permits people to deal with more variables than their minds can generally comprehend and remember. On the average, people can keep about seven ideas in their minds at once. A worksheet can be especially useful when the decision involves a large number of variables with complex relationships. A realistic example for many college students is the question \\"What will I do after graduation?\\" A graduate might seek a position that offers specialized training, pursue an advanced degree, or travel abroad for a year. A decision-making worksheet begins with a concise statement of the problem that will also help to narrow it. It is important to be clear about the distinction between long-range and immediate goals because long-range goals often involve a different decision than short-range ones. Focusing on long-range goals, a graduating student might revise the question above to \\"What will I do after graduation that lead to successful career?\\"  Answer: A tool to assist in making complex decisions.Output:","answer":"What does the passage mainly discuss?"},{"question":"Part 1.

The answer is 25.Question: John starts a TV show. He pays 1000 per episode for the first half of the season. The second half of the season had episodes that cost 120% more expensive. If there are 22 episodes how much did the entire season cost?Answer: The season is broken up into 22 / 2 = 11 episode based on cost. The first 11 episodes cost 11 * 1000 = 11,000. The next set of episodes cost 1000 * 1.2 = 1200 more per episode. So they cost 1000 + 1200 = 2200 each. So in total they cost 2200 * 11 = 24200. So in total the season cost 24200 + 11000 = 35,200. The answer is 35200.[Question]Nancy carves statues out of jade. A giraffe statue takes 120 grams of jade and sells for 150. An elephant statue takes twice as much jade and sells for 350. If Nancy has 1920 grams of jade, how much more money will she make turning it all into elephants instead of giraffes?[Answer]First find how many giraffe statues Nancy can make by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount used per giraffe statue: 1920 g / 120 g / giraffe = 16 giraffes. Then multiply that number by the price per giraffe to find how much Nancy earns total from giraffes: 16 giraffes * 150 / giraffe = 2400. Then find how much jade each elephant statue uses by doubling the jade used by the giraffe statues: 120 g / giraffe * 2 = 240 g / elephant. Then find how many elephant statues Nancy can make by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount used per elephant statue: 1920 g / 240 g / elephant = 8 elephant. Multiply that number by the price per elephant to find Nancy's total earnings from elephants: 8 elephants * 350 / elephant = 2800. Finally, subtract Nancy's total earnings from the giraffes from her total earnings from the elephants to find the difference: 2800 - 2400 = 400. The answer is 400.Q: Angel has written letters to all of her pen pals and is putting all of the letters in envelopes. Most of the letters are put into large envelopes and the remaining 20 letters are put into small envelopes. The large envelopes each contain 2 letters each. If Angel has written a total of 80 letters, how many large envelopes did she use?A: As some of the letters are in small envelopes, there must be 80 total letters – 20 letters in small envelopes = 60 letters in large envelopes. Angel therefore used 60 letters / 2 letters per large envelope = 30 large envelopes. The answer is 30.Question: 6 kids in Carolyn's daycare prefer peas, 9 prefer carrots, and 5 prefer corn. What percentage of the children prefer corn?Answer: First find the total number of children: 6 kids + 9 kids + 5 kids = 20 kids. Then divide the number of kids who prefer corn by the total number of kids and multiply by 100% to express as a percentage: 5 kids / 20 kids * 100% = 25%. The answer is 25.Q: Faith went to a baking shop and bought flour that cost 5 and a cake stand that costs 28. She then gave the cashier two 20 bills and 3 in loose coins. How much change will she receive?A:","answer":"Faith must pay 28 + 5 = 33 for the flour and cake stand. Her two 20 bills amount to 20 x 2 = 40. So, she gave the cashier a total of 40 + 3 = 43.

DESIGN Nationwide register based cohort study.    SETTING Denmark, 1996-2011.    PARTICIPANTS 999,378 liveborn singletons and linked individual level information on macrolide prescriptions (maternal use during pregnancy, n=30,091; maternal use after birth, n=21,557; use in infants, n=6591), surgery for IHPS, and potential confounders.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Surgery for IHPS by three categories of macrolide use: in mothers during pregnancy, in mothers after birth, and in infants after birth.    RESULTS 880 infants developed IHPS (0.9 cases per 1000 births). Compared with infants with no use of macrolides, the adjusted rate ratio for IHPS in infants with use of macrolides during days 0 to 13 after birth was 29.8 (95% confidence interval 16.4 to 54.1) and during days 14 to 120 was 3.24 (1.20 to 8.74); the corresponding absolute risk differences were 24.4 (95% confidence interval 13.0 to 44.1) and 0.65 (0.06 to 2.21) cases per 1000 infants exposed to macrolides, respectively. The rate ratio for maternal use of macrolides for days 0 to 13 after birth was 3.49 (1.92 to 6.34) and for days 14 to 120 was 0.70 (0.26 to 1.90); the corresponding absolute risk differences were 2.15 (0.82 to 4.64) and -0.11 (-0.26 to 0.31). The rate ratios for maternal use of macrolides during pregnancy were 1.02 (0.65 to 1.59) for weeks 0 to 27 and 1.77 (0.95 to 3.31) for weeks 28 to birth; the corresponding absolute risk differences were 0.01 (-0.31 to 0.50) and 0.67 (-0.06 to 2.02).    CONCLUSIONS Treatment of young infants with macrolide antibiotics was strongly associated with IHPS and should therefore only be administered if potential treatment benefits outweigh the risk. Maternal use of macrolides during the first two weeks after birth was also associated with an increased risk of IHPS. A possible association was also found with use during late pregnancy..
