He was a multi-millionaire overnight. He was prepared for this moment, as he had been planning for several years, and now he was in the endgame.Mr. Rose immediately hired three people: an accountant; a lawyer; and a personal driver. He needed these three people to help him make his moves since he didn't know how to manage this much money on his own, he wanted to protect himself from any legal issues involved with owning this much money, and he needed someone to drive him around to free him up to make calls and decisions on the move.Mr. Rose then bought several things he needed in the meantime: a large SUV designed for business (including TVs, stereos, privacy partition between himself and his driver, comfort seats that could recline into beds, and a table to do business. He had his driver, Alfred, take the wheel while he (Mr. Rose) sat in the back and started making phone calls.Alfred then drove Mr. Rose to his lawyer's office. Mr. Rose informed his lawyer, Mike, about the wealth he'd accrued overnight and requested his assistance setting up the necessary wills, trusts, and non-profit companies Mr. Rose needed to ensure the wealth he accumulated would not be frivolously spent as quickly as it was gained and that it was protected from excessive taxation.From there, Mr. Rose contacted a real estate agent he had dealings with in the past, Mr. Matsumura, and inquired with him about a listing for a beautiful, 10 million residence located on the coast of the island, nicknamed \\"The Waterfalling Estate\\" for its proximity to a naturally-occurring waterfall next to the main house. The residence, located on 10 acres of land, sat majestically on the top of a high cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Rose intended on buying this residence and using it as a base of operations until he could purchase another property and build his dream home, and he intended to move his close family in with him to Waterfalling in the meantime until he could move and hand over the keys to the estate to them."},{"question":"Can you please create an outline and description of extra uses or DIY uses for plastic buckets that someone may not have thought about? The audience is people who are looking to become more resourceful with ordinary items they likely already have in their homes. Please include a total of four sues and include two to three sentences in the description for each use case. There is no need to number each item.","answer":"Create Outdoor Seating - As simple as it may sound, normal plastic buckets can work well for extra outdoor seating. Just turn the buckets over so the open ends are facing down and then sit over the closed end. It won't be as comfortable as an actual chair, but it will work in a pinch if you have no other seating alternatives. You can also staple or glue padding (such as carpeting or a blanket) to the closed side of the bucket to help make it more comfortable to sit on.Mix Concrete - Plastic buckets are a great DIY alternative to concrete mixers if you need to, well, mix concrete. Besides the natural ingredients to make concrete (cement, water, and aggregates such as crushed stone or gravel), you'll also need an appropriate tool such, as a trowel, to mix everything in the bucket. Make A Bird or Animal Feeder - A plastic bucket will work great as a DIY bird or animal feeder. Take a normal five-gallon bucket, and cut a hole at the bottom. Fit the elbow of a PVC pipe into this hole and cut open part of the pipe for the feed to show through. Be sure to close off the open end of the bucket with a lid. You can use this to feed chickens or other farm or homestead animals. Use As A Buoy or Rescue Flotation Device - Take a five-gallon bucket with a good lid and seal it so the air remains trapped inside. Attach a rope or paracord to the handle of the bucket, and then you can throw it out into a lake or river to mark a spot on the water (like a buoy). Alternatively, you can also use this same kind of device as an emergency rescue flotation device. Simply throw the sealed bucket out with the rope to someone in the water in need, and then they can grab onto it to stay afloat before you pull them back to safety.

It should compare it to previous games in the series.  Also should discuss the strategy layer of the game.","answer":"Expeditions: Rome is the third game in the Expeditions series by Danish developer, Logic Artists. Unlike previous entries in that series, however, players are tasked not with leading a small party, but an entire legion during the final years of the Roman Republic. This serves both as one of the game's great strengths and its foundational issue.Story-wise, Expeditions Rome is a conventional but well-told tale of revenge and loyalty. You start off seeking to avenge the murder of your father, and along the way attract a diverse band of unusual and unexpected allies. While the story beats are entirely predictable, Expeditions: Rome manages to tell it in a way that seems both authentic to the setting while navigating modern-day sensibilities. Players are not limited by their choice of gender in the way an actual woman of the Republic would have been, and many of the more distasteful norms of that era are acknowledged but not forced upon the player. The writing is good and the characters are believable in their dialogue and motivations.Gameplay-wise, the tactical element of Expeditions Rome: is similarly conventional but competent. Your party members come in a variety of Roman-themed classes that fulfill the classic roles of the ranged attacker, tank, crowd control, and support. As you travel across Greece, Egypt, and Gaul, new enemy types will force you to rethink the tactics that worked for you earlier, and new items and skills will keep things interesting and your playstyle evolving. Where Expeditions: Rome completely fails, however, is in its strategic layer. Unlike Expeditions: Viking or Expeditions: Conquistador, you are no longer leading just a small band of explorers across an untamed wilderness. Now, as Legatus, you are tasked with leading one, even several legions across mostly inhabited areas. The mystery of the exploration is now gone, and the randomized events that occur as you travel are reduced to being irritants. What's worse are the battles. These depend on cards that you can spend time collecting and upgrading, but the reality is that the 'strategy' boils down mostly to comparing what numbers are larger. A completely wasted opportunity.Ultimately, Expeditions Rome is a 7/10 game. A competent sequel for fans of the series with unnecessary 'improvements'.How was that? I aimed for a positive review that reflected your request for a 7/10 score.

Females lay 200 to 400 eggs in tiny holes that they make in the branches of trees and shrubs. After six to 10 weeks, cicada young called nymphs hatch from the eggs and immediately fall to the ground. They burrow underground and attach to tree roots. The nymphs stay buried to suck tree sap from two to 17 years, depending on the species. When this underground life—called the dormant period—ends, the cicadas emerge aboveground at sunset, climb the trunk of a nearby tree, and shed their skin. Now they’re adult cicadas.Next, male cicadas fill the air with shrill buzzing sounds created by rapidly vibrating drum-like plates on their abdomens. The females make clicking sounds with their wings if they like the song. They mate, lay their eggs, and then both male and female cicadas die after just about five weeks aboveground.Two TypesScientists divide the over 3,000 cicada species into two groups: annual and periodical. Annual cicadas emerge from the ground at different times each summer. They’re usually dark with greenish markings. These insects avoid predators by camouflaging themselves in the trees and flying from hungry birds and moles.Only seven species of cicadas are in the other group, called periodical cicadas. These bugs all emerge from the ground at the same time. Called broods, these groups appear after a dormant period of either 13 or 17 years. That’s a long nap!Periodical cicadas live only in the central and eastern part of the United States. They have black backs, orange bellies, and red eyes. Millions—or even billions!—of cicadas might come out all at once, so these bugs aren’t trying to hide. They survive by having such a large population that predators couldn’t possibly eat them all at once.Big NoiseA different periodical brood emerges almost every year in different parts of the country. Some broods are small, like Brood VII (the Roman numeral for seven), which is found only in upstate New York. But others are huge: In the summer of 2021, hundreds of billions of cicadas in Brood X (the Roman numeral for 10), will buzz through parts of Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.Although the emergence might sound scary, these bugs aren’t harmful: They don’t attack people, they don’t bite or sting, and they don’t destroy crops. So just enjoy the sights and sounds!","answer":"Below are the answers you wanted:1. Female cicadas lay 200-400 eggs at once.2.

Don't include any past characters.","answer":"Mary-Jess tripped trying to put on her robes, ending up with her face pressed rather unbecomingly against the glass between her cabin and the train's corridor. She heard giggles erupt from the other side, probably upperclassmen if her luck was its usual acerbic self. \\"Keep moving. Keep moving! Prefect coming through!\\" said a girl's firm but nasally voice. \\"Oh no! Watch out for Prefect Cat! Doesn't know she's a massive prat!\\" one of the kids said in a singsong voice. \\"Move on, Callaway, you little muppet,\\" said a boy's voice.Mary-Jess managed to get herself into her robes and unstick her face from the glass. If these kids were making fun of a prefect, what chance did she stand at this magic school? Her dad hadn't been certain she should attend. She and her stepmother were the ones pushing for it. After all, there wasn't anything keeping her at her muggle elementary school. It was as if the kids there knew there was something weird about her, something that made her less than normal, something she couldn't see herself. Was she going to be too weird for this magical school as well?The door to her cabin rolled back. The prefect girl stood in the doorway. Her bright red curls and shiny prefect pin matched her robes. She was accompanied by a boy with his hair pulled back into a tail. \\"You okay, first year?\\" the girl asked. Even her less firm tone was a bit waspish. \\"She means, what's your name, kid?\\" the boy interrupted, letting himself into the cabin and sitting across from her. \\"I'm Mary-Jess. Mary-Jess Clure,\\" she answered, feeling color rise to her cheeks. Was she in trouble? How were these kids so big? Would all the students be this much taller than her?\\"Are you alright, Mary-Jess?\\" the boy continued, spreading out on the seat as if he was comfortable anywhere. \\"Yes, just clumsy,\\" Mary-Jess admitted as redness and heat crept down her neck. \\"Reminds me of my sister,\\" the boy said, talking to the prefect girl. \\"Wasn't your sister looking for a seat in a different cabin? She said the boy in hers smelt like Mimbulus Mimbletonia,\\" the girl said. \\"Oh yeah! Be right back,\\" the boy said, unfurling from the seat and exiting the small space.

The rest of New England's scoring came from a pick-six by cornerback Ty Law and field goals from Adam Vinatieri, who drilled the 48-yard game-winner as time expired.Brady's stats: 16/27, 145 yards, 1 TD, 0 INT, 86.2 ratingFinal score: 20-17, Patriotsphoto via AP03Super Bowl XXXVIII: vs. Carolina PanthersSuper Bowl XXXVIII: vs. Carolina Panthers3 / 10Brady's second Super Bowl appearance was just as exciting as the first. This time, it was a thrilling victory over the Carolina Panthers.A record 37 points were scored in the fourth quarter between the two teams. Brady tallied three touchdown passes, the most notable one being a 1-yard toss to ex-Pats linebacker and current Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel in the fourth quarter.Brady's stats: 32/48, 354 yards, 3 TD, 1 INT, 100.5 ratingFinal score: 32-29, Patriotsphoto via APADVERTISEMENT04Super Bowl XXXIX: vs. Philadelphia EaglesSuper Bowl XXXIX: vs. Philadelphia Eagles4 / 10Super Bowl No. 3 of Brady's illustrious career wasn't his best, but once again he found a way to lead his team to victory.Brady only tossed one touchdown pass, taking a page from the Super Bowl XXXVIII playbook and connecting with Vrabel for a 2-yard score.With Freddie Mitchell and Terrell Owens on the opposite sideline, there was plenty of talking heading into this matchup. It was Brady, though, who had the last laugh and a perfect 3-0 Super Bowl record to boot.Brady's stats: 23/33, 236 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT, 110.2 ratingFinal score: 24-21, Patriotsphoto via AP05Super Bowl XLII: vs. New York GiantsSuper Bowl XLII: vs. New York Giants5 / 10Brady's first Super Bowl loss couldn't have been much more crushing.It wasn't just the fact the Patriots fell short of going a perfect 19-0 on the season, it was the manner in which it unfolded. New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning somehow escaped a sack to connect with receiver David Tyree, who made the infamous \\"helmet catch.\\" The Giants finished their miraculous drive with a touchdown, and the rest is history.Randy Moss was on the receiving end of Brady's lone touchdown pass.Brady's stats: 29/48, 266 yards, 1 TD, 0 INT, 86.5 ratingFinal score: 17-14, Giantsphoto via AP06Super Bowl XLVI: vs. New York GiantsSuper Bowl XLVI: vs. New York Giants6 / 10The Patriots-Giants Super Bowl rematch four years later was déjà vu for Brady and Co.New England held a 17-15 lead until the final minute of the fourth quarter, when running back Ahmad Bradshaw scampered into the end zone for what would be the game-winning touchdown.To put themselves in position to steal another victory away from the Patriots, the Giants had another miraculous David Tyree-like moment. Eli Manning found Mario Manningham along the left sideline for a 38-yard gain to produce another highlight Pats fans will forever avoid at all costs.Brady's stats: 27/41, 276 yards, 2 TD, 1 INT, 91.5 ratingFinal score: 21-17, Giantsphoto via APADVERTISEMENT07Super Bowl XLIX: vs. Seattle SeahawksSuper Bowl XLIX: vs. Seattle Seahawks7 / 10The Patriots found themselves down 10 points late in the third quarter before Brady tossed touchdown passes to Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman to take a 28-24 lead late in the fourth quarterThey left too much time on the clock for Russell Wilson and the Seahawks, who nearly had their own New York Giants moment vs. the Patriots. Jermaine Kearse made a near-impossible 33-yard catch with one minute left in regulation to put Seattle in a position to seal the win.Then, the Seahawks decided to not use Marshawn Lynch at the one-yard line.Instead, they attempted a slant pass to Ricardo Lockette that was picked off by rookie reserve cornerback Malcolm Butler, thus giving the Patriots the victory.

Make it nostalgic and descriptive. Use a numbered list to give various options for making them.","answer":"S'mores are a delicious treat most often enjoyed over a summer campfire. Who doesn't remember a cool, summer evening out with friends and family enjoying a little bit of crispy, chocolatey goodness? In this article, we will explore three simple ways to bring that s'mores experience inside your home.1. Microwaving S'mores: The microwave is the simplest and most often used method for making a homemade s'more. It is a simple process. All you need to do is put a graham cracker down on a microwave-safe plate or napkin, then top it with a piece of chocolate, and then the marshmallow. You are going to want to watch it closely depending on the power of your machine so try to do it in 15-second intervals. As soon as you see the chocolate starting to glisten and the marshmallow itself change shape it is time to take it out and use the other graham cracker to smush it down. Then it is ready to eat.2. Air Frying S'mores: Air fryers are the new wonder machine of the modern kitchen. They can impart a toasty flavor to the graham cracker giving it a hint of campfire goodness. When you close your eyes, you can hardly tell the difference. To make a s'more in an air fryer you first put both graham crackers in the bottom of the basket. Top one of the graham crackers with a marshmallow and set your device to around 400 degrees Fahrenheit. It should take about 5 minutes for the marshmallow to brown and heat up. When it does, pull out the basket, put a chocolate bar piece on top of the marshmallow, and then complete the sandwich using the other toasted graham cracker half. Enjoy immediately.3. Oven S'mores: Making s'mores in an oven is nearly the same as in an air fryer. Place graham cracker halves on a baking sheet, place a piece of chocolate on one and marshmallow on the other, set the oven to 400 degrees, place the sheet on top rack for a few minutes then pull it out. From here, you can put the two halves together, and now you have a delicious s'more to enjoy at any day or time.S'mores aren't just for summer; bite into one all year round!"},{"question":"Help me come up with some useful utility potions for my homebrew tabletop fantasy game.","answer":"Sure, no problem.

Smithsight: Gain proficiency in the appraisal of weapons and armor, allowing for the character to haggle for better prices and identify unknown metal items and artifacts.2.

Pathfind: The drinker of this potion can see their prior footsteps with a glowing outline. This persists through walls for up to 12 hours.5. Fleetfox: By consuming this potion, a character can sprint without breaking stealth. However, they must do so on their tiptoes, which may present balance issues.

Make it heartwrenching and real, not a happily ever after story.","answer":"William and Sarah grew up in 1800s New England, in a small town on the coast. They were always by each other's side and married in 1838. The couple prospered. William was a sea captain and had his own ship. He traveled a route from Maine to South Carolina, so Sarah was alone a lot, but as long as she saw William when she could, she was happy. The couple had 8 children. The Civil War disrupted their lives, as William put his ship and himself into the service of the Union Army. Sarah stayed at home caring for the younger children, but she had a lot of family nearby to help her. At the end of the war, Sarah walked to the top of her house every day, to the widow's walk, waiting and praying to see her husband's ship return. William's ship did return, and the couple had two more children. Everything was looking so well for them. Then there was a cholera outbreak. Their daughter, Nancy, succumbed first, then their son, Squire. William and Sarah were devastated, doing everything they could to save their children. Then, Sarah fell ill. She was feverish and near death. William could not face life without his Sarah. He walked into the bedroom, and Sarah was cold as ice and still. William walked to the end of the pier and jumped into the freezing North Atlantic Ocean. Sarah woke two days later. She survived cholera but never got over the death of her William. She raised the children on her own and never did remarry. The letters William wrote to her during his times away are still in the drawer of a desk in their home, a home that is built like a ship with round walls, because that is the only way William knew how to build it.

That shouldn't just be with your logo or brand colors,  but it should also be in the way you communicate with others and the words you use. You want consumers to be able to instantly recognize you even when your logo is not showing. Therefore having a strong tone of voice that resonates with your target audience is essential. 2. Develop a Referral Program - Research suggests that 49% of consumers in the United States say their friends and family are their top sources of brand awareness. Therefore a referral program can be highly effective when you want to get the word out about your brand. The same worked for well-known brands such as Dropbox and Paypal when they got their start. 3. Consider Using Influencer Marketing - When you have an influencer with a large following promoting your brand, you will instantly receive more brand awareness. But you don't have to depend on the most popular influencers on social media to get the word out. Micro-influencers who have smaller followings but focus on more niche topics can provide a substantial amount of help for companies looking to increase their brand awareness. 4. Use Your Branding Everywhere You Can - Make good use of your logo and place it everywhere you can to get your customers familiar with it. Take a cue from Amazon and place your logo on your shipping material so that it is easy to recognize. It is a little extra touch that can go a long way when it comes to helping consumers remember your brand and your company. 5. Make Good Use of SEO and Content Marketing - Search Engine Optimization and content marketing are two of the most helpful resources you have online when you want to raise brand awareness. But the rules and trends for these two things are always changing. So be sure to get caught up on the latest requirements for SEO and implement some new strategies into your website, blog, or social media content.

Atlanta, US, pharmacist John S Pemberton originally touted the drink as a tonic, one containing cocaine and caffeine-rich extracts. The cocaine was removed from the recipe in 1903, and Coca-Cola has been a staple drink in American culture ever since.Many customers have even found unexpected uses for the beverage, which has an acidic pH of roughly 2.7.Here are a few unexpected life hacks you can try with the world’s favourite soda:Clean your toiletWant a spotless toilet? Give it a soak with some Coke. According to the Today show, Coca-Cola can be an effective toilet cleaner. To try out this cleaning tip, pour Coca-Cola along the edges of the toilet bowl and let it soak overnight. In the morning, you will “wake up to a spotless toilet”. CNET reported that this is a great way to remove grime and stains from your toilet bowl. However, it should be noted that Coke will clean stains, but it doesn’t disinfect.Fertilise your gardenCoca-Cola is a perfect fertiliser for gardenias, azaleas and grass. “Pouring a small amount like 15-20 ml of Coca-Cola once in a while around the base of these plants can deliver helpful nutrients to the plants, resulting in better flowers!” Balcony Garden reported. “It can also be a good lawn fertiliser, promoting the growth of grass, thanks to the CO2 content and plants love it! As soda drinks also have traces of potassium, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and sodium, they contribute to the overall growth of the foliage.” Coca-Cola can even be a good lawn fertiliser, according to Balcony garden.Braise your meatsCoca-Cola can be a huge help in the kitchen for those looking for a way to up their barbecue game. Adding Coca-Cola to a traditional braise, in place of red wine, for a brisket or pot roast can add a sweetness to your final product, Southern Kitchen reported. Reducing the cooking liquid after removing the meat can introduce more of the soda’s spiced flavours as well.Remove rust and loosen boltsAccording to Car Hop, Coca-Cola can dissolve metal oxides and break up rust due with its carbonation. While the soda works more slowly than your average rust remover, it can be a cheaper alternative for loosening rusted bolts. To remove rust with Coca-Cola, you will need to follow a few steps:1. Pour the soda onto the rust and gently rub the area with folded over aluminium foil.2. Once pieces begin to flake off, you can switch over to a sponge and repeat the process.3. After the rust has been successfully removed, clean off the Coca-Cola from the affected area with soap and water.","answer":"You know Coca-Cola right? It first came into the market in 1886, and oh, what an exciting year that was! It used to be promoted a bit differently, though. John S Pemberton was getting everybody worked up over it because the drink contained caffeine and, you're not going to believe this, cocaine! Eeek, what a start! The cocaine stayed in the recipe for 17 years until it was removed in 1903. That's when it became a staple in America. So cool!Coca-Cola has evolved since then and people found several unusual uses for this acidic drink along the way. This famous soda has a pH of about 2.7 (say what?), so no wonder it got people's creative juices flowing. Can you guess what they came up with? I bet you can't; these ideas are really out there.Okay, here is #1: Use Coca-Cola to clean your toilet. No, I'm not kidding, Coke can be a toilet cleaner. Pour it along the edges of the toilet bowl and leave it overnight. By the time morning rolls around you'll have a spotless toilet. OMG, this is just amazing!Now we come to #2: Coca-Cola as a garden fertilizer. You read that right, gardenias, azaleas and grass love Coke just as much as you. Pour it around the base of these plants to give them some extra nutrients and they'll grow like crazy. Yay! So easy. And for your lawn, the CO2 in Coke will help, as well as some other minerals that soda drinks contain which help plants grow.Here comes #3: Braise your meat with Coca-Cola. Yep, Coca-Cola can be a great help in the kitchen, especially when you bring the BBQ into the game. Make your usual braise and then add Coke to it instead of things like red wine. It's amazing for a pot roast and will add just the right amount of sweetness. It will be to die for! And if you reduce the liquid after you remove the meat you'll get an even more intense flavour.Here is the last one: #4: Coca-Cola will help you remove rust and loosen bolts. I bet you've had this problem before where you just couldn't unscrew that one stubborn screw and it was driving you bananas. Ugh, so annoying. Well, Coca-Cola can dissolve metal oxides and break up rust with its bubbly goodness. It's a slower process than using normal rust remover, but it's just that much more exciting to tell all your friends that you just used Coke to get that screw loose. Ha! Worth it.Here are the steps to follow to remove rust:1. Pour Coke onto the rust and rub rub rub it with some aluminum foil.2. When pieces of rust start to come off, get a sponge and do the same thing again with the sponge. Easy!3. Once you removed the rust (yay!) just clean the Coca-Cola off with soap and water. And you're done! Ta-dah! Perfect result."},{"question":"What are pollinators? What are 7 examples of pollinators?

The subpopulation of orcas in this region began harassing boats, most often by biting at their rudder, in 2020. Almost 20 percent of these attacks caused enough damage to disable the vessels, says Alfredo López, an orca researcher at the Atlantic Orca Working Group (GTOA), which monitors the Iberian killer whale population. “It is a rare behavior that has only been detected in this part of the world,” he says.Researchers aren’t sure why the orcas are going after the watercraft. There are two hypotheses, according to López. One is that the killer whales have invented a new fad, something that subpopulations of these members of the dolphin family are known to do. Much as in humans, orca fads are often spearheaded by juveniles, López says. Alternatively, the attacks may be a response to a bad past experience involving a boat.","answer":"Once upon a time, in the deep blue sea near Portugal and Spain, there lived a special group of whales called killer whales or orcas. These orcas were known for their beautiful black-and-white patterns and their playful nature. But something strange was happening. Over the past three years, these orcas had been causing trouble for boats sailing in their waters. The orcas would approach the boats and occasionally even bite their rudders, making it challenging for the boats to steer. Can you imagine that? Some of the boats were so badly damaged that they were unable to even move! When Alfredo López was researching these orcas, he discovered that nearly 20% of their attacks rendered the boats unusable.Each person was confused.  Why were the orcas acting so naughtily? The scientists had two theories. One theory was that the orcas had devised a brand-new sport to engage in with the boats. Just like you know how we create new games from time to time just for fun. These orcas may have followed suit. The alternative theory suggested that perhaps the orcas were acting defensively because they were trying to remember something bad that had happened to them in the past involving a boat.And so, every day, as the sun set and the stars came out, the orcas and the people continued their adventures in the big, beautiful ocean, waiting to unravel the mystery of the playful orcas.

Barry wasn't like all the other bees in his hive. He had aspirations to be more than a worker or drone bee. Barry's dream was to climb Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. So, one day, Barry decided to chase his dream and began his journey to climb the mountain. His bee friends laughed and buzzed in disbelief as Barry packed, but he was determined to reach the top. Soon he was on his way!As Barry began his ascent, he realized that he wasn't the only one climbing the mountain. There were hundreds of humans and many ice worms who were also chasing their dreams up the mountain. Along the way to base camp, there was a caterpillar who wanted to fly, a ladybug who wanted to long-distance swim, and a grasshopper who wanted to salsa dance. They were all chasing their dreams and cheering each other on, encouraging and motivating one another to reach their goals. It was so inspiring.Barry, being a bee of course, was naturally equipped with wings, but they weren't enough to get him up the steep and rocky terrain. So, he used his tiny arms and legs to climb, just like the other climbers.As he kept going higher and higher, Barry faced many, many obstacles, from sub-zero temperatures and heavy winds to a blizzard. But he didn't let anything stop him. He kept going, determined to reach the top.Finally, after many days and days of climbing, Barry made it to the peak. He was exhausted, but his heart was full of pride. Barry immediately began making his way down the mountain. When he finally made it out of the snow and ice, he stopped to rest on the first flower he found.  Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his backside. He turned around to see a grumpy old mountain goat, who had mistaken Barry for a flower and tried to eat him. The goat quickly realized his mistake and apologized, but Barry couldn't help but laugh at his luck.And that's the story of Barry, the first bee to ever climb Mount Everest. A story we almost never knew because Barry almost ended up being eaten by a goat."},{"question":"Write an email to my friend Shara.

Before calculus was invented, all math was static: It could only help calculate objects that were perfectly still. But the universe is constantly moving and changing. No objects—from the stars in space to subatomic particles or cells in the body—are always at rest. Indeed, just about everything in the universe is constantly moving. Calculus helped to determine how particles, stars, and matter actually move and change in real time.Calculus is used in a multitude of fields that you wouldn't ordinarily think would make use of its concepts. Among them are physics, engineering, economics, statistics, and medicine. Calculus is also used in such disparate areas as space travel, as well as determining how medications interact with the body, and even how to build safer structures. You'll understand why calculus is useful in so many areas if you know a bit about its history as well as what it is designed to do and measure.Calculus was developed in the latter half of the 17th century by two mathematicians, Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton. Newton first developed calculus and applied it directly to the understanding of physical systems. Independently, Leibniz developed the notations used in calculus. Put simply, while basic math uses operations such as plus, minus, times, and division (+, -, x, and ÷), calculus uses operations that employ functions and integrals to calculate rates of change.Those tools allowed Newton, Leibniz, and other mathematicians who followed to calculate things like the exact slope of a curve at any point. The Story of Mathematics explains the importance of Newton's fundamental theorem of the calculus:\\"Unlike the static geometry of the Greeks, calculus allowed mathematicians and engineers to make sense of the motion and dynamic change in the changing world around us, such as the orbits of planets, the motion of fluids, etc.\\"Using calculus, scientists, astronomers, physicists, mathematicians, and chemists could now chart the orbit of the planets and stars, as well as the path of electrons and protons at the atomic level.","answer":"Course Title: An Introduction to Calculus: Exploring Dynamic Change in the UniverseCourse Description: Calculus, a branch of mathematics, revolutionized the way we understand and analyze dynamic systems in the universe.

Break down elements of the crust, toppings, and style of slice cut. ","answer":"In Chicago, tavern-style pizza originated as a way for the city's workers to have a little bite with their post-shift beer. Let's dig into what makes Chicago's tavern-style pie so delicious: - Crust: The crust of a tavern-style pizza is inarguably its defining characteristic. Thin and crispy, it has a slightly thicker and sturdier base than a traditional thin-crust pizza. This comes from the dough being pre-stretched and rolled out before being topped and baked. The end product is often referred to as a \\"cracker-like\\" crust due to its crispy texture. It's not uncommon to see a crust that crumbs and flakes like a saltine!- Shape and Size: Tavern-style pizza is typically baked in a round shape, cut into small square pieces. These are commonly known as \\"party-cut\\" or \\"tavern-cut\\" slices.- Cheese: Unlike traditional thin-crust pizza, tavern-style pizza usually features a layer of cheese extending to the edge of the crust. The cheese is typically a combination of low-moisture mozzarella and cheddar, which melts and caramelizes, creating a slightly crispy and flavorful cheese edge. Combine that with the crispiness of the thin crust underneath, and it's easy to understand why some folks sprint to the corner pieces.- Toppings: Tavern-style pizza often features traditional toppings such as Italian sausage, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. However, the toppings are usually applied generously and heartily, creating a more substantial pizza compared to some other thin crust styles. It can make those center square pieces feel much heavier as well!- Baking Method: It's common to see old-school electric or gas ovens. Remember that tavern-style pizza is traditionally made in—you guessed it—taverns! You're not likely to find imported Italian ovens here! There's nothing like a hot slice of tavern-style pizza, ideally with an icy beer on the side.

The story is very similar to the magnificent 1991 animation and highly attractive. However this 2017 version is uneven, with the most boring songs that anyone could imagine and reasonable acting despite the great names in the cast. But the top-notch Computer Graphic Imagery (CGI) and the cinematography are worthwhile watching. Keep awake along the musical scenes and you may like and be surprised by this version. My vote is seven.","answer":"This version of the story is uneven with boring songs and only reasonable acting."},{"question":"Hello.

The large shell just missed the target and plunged into the sea. Now, he grabbed the machine gun and fired a hail of bullets at the ship. The pirates shot back, the metal bullets making a ringing sound on the walls before dropping to the deck. His fingers never left the trigger.

Use only the mattress made for your baby’s crib. The mattress should fit snugly in the crib so there are no spaces between the mattress and the crib frame. The mattress shape should stay firm even when covered with a tightly fitted sheet or mattress cover.Do put your baby to bed in his own crib or bassinet. Don’t bed-share. This is when babies and parents sleep together in the same bed. Bed-sharing is the most common cause of death in babies younger than 3 months old. Keep your baby’s crib close to your bed so your baby’s nearby during the night. The American Academy of Pediatrics (also called AAP) recommends that you and your baby sleep in the same room, but not in the same bed, for the first year of your baby’s life but at least for the first 6 monthsDo make sure your baby’s bassinet, crib or play yard meets current safety standards. Visit the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to learn more about product safety standards or product recalls.Do remove hanging window cords or electrical wires near where your baby sleeps. Babies can get tangled in them and choke. Do keep the room at a comfortable temperature. If your baby is sweating or his chest feels hot, he may be overheated.Don’t use sleep positioners.

Big data refers to the large, diverse sets of information that grow at ever-increasing rates. It encompasses the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered (known as the \\"three v's\\" of big data). Big data often comes from data mining and arrives in multiple formats. How Big Data Works Big data can be categorized as unstructured or structured. Structured data consists of information already managed by the organization in databases and spreadsheets; it is frequently numeric in nature. Unstructured data is information that is unorganized and does not fall into a predetermined model or format. It includes data gathered from social media sources, which help institutions gather information on customer needs. Big data can be collected from publicly shared comments on social networks and websites, voluntarily gathered from personal electronics and apps, through questionnaires, product purchases, and electronic check-ins. The presence of sensors and other inputs in smart devices allows for data to be gathered across a broad spectrum of situations and circumstances. Big data is most often stored in computer databases and is analyzed using software specifically designed to handle large, complex data sets. Many software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies specialize in managing this type of complex data.","answer":"Big data refers to massive, rapidly growing sets of diverse information from multiple sources.

The one with Gene Wilder. Did the author, Roald Dahl, like the movie? ","answer":"Willy Wonka (played by Gene Wilder): An eccentric, mysterious owner and chocolatier responsible for the chocolate factory. Out of five children, he seeks the one to be his predecessor. The Oompa Loompas: The race of green-haired, orange-faced dwarves that Willy Wonka rescued and now they work to help in the chocolate factory. Their morals come through in songs about naughty children and lessons learned. Charlie Bucket (played by Peter Ostrum): Impoverished and kind, Charlie and his family have been dealt a bad hand in life, but finding the golden ticket is their chance to live better. The protagonist of the story, Charlie is the little boy that Wonka ultimately decides to reward with possession of his chocolate factory. Grandpa Joe (played by Jack Albertson): Disabled and bedridden, Grandpa Joe is imaginative and excitable with child-like energy. While he remains in bed to rest for most of his days, his energy is restored when Charlie finds the golden ticket. He accompanies Charlie to the chocolate factory as a chaperone to meet Willy Wonka. Arthur Slugworth (played by Gunter Meisner): The alleged enemy and spy of Willy Wonka. He wants to know all of Wonka’s secrets so he can drive his chocolate factory out of business. He attempts to bribe all of the children that found the golden ticket, promising them riches if they deliver Wonka’s secret to “everlasting gobstoppers.” Violet Beauregarde (played by Denise Nickerson): Overconfident and persistent, Violet chews gum competitively. She’s also obnoxious and doesn’t listen, leading her to blow up like a giant blueberry when she snatches a piece of gum from Wonka’s hand against his warnings. Veruca Salt (played by Julie Dawn Cole): Spoiled and entitled, Veruca throws tantrums when she doesn’t get her way. She expects her daddy to buy her everything that she wants, including a golden goose from Wonka’s factory. When Wonka refuses to sell, she throws a fit, eventually falling into the \\"bad egg” side of the golden egg chute. Augustus Gloop (played by Michael Bollner): Overweight and gluttonous, Augustus never knows when to quit eating. His mother indulges him, spoiling him with sweets. So, it’s no surprise when his chocolate-thieving antics get him nearly drowned and sucked up into pipes from the chocolate river. Mike Teevee (played by Paris Themmen): Obsessed with television, Mike fancies himself a futuristic boy with the intelligence to match. However, his attempt to become the first boy to be transmitted across TV waves leads him to be shrunken down in size, small enough to fit in his mother’s purse. Released in 1971, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a comedic musical based on Roald Dahl’s popular children’s book, “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” Roald Dahl, however, despised the adaptation. He thought Gene Wilder’s interpretation of Willy Wonka was “pretentious and too bouncy (happy).” "},{"question":"Please write me a paragraph for an article about Lebron James.

So I had someone in my corner those days.Life has a funny way of kicking you when you're down, and then picking you up and dusting you off just before you decide to jump off a cliff. That happened to me - literally. I sat around the house, collecting unemployment and smoking cigarettes, and drinking to numb the pain. But then, after a year of not working and skulking around, I was hired for a new job that would eventually become my career - and a defining moment in my life. In this job, I became someone of importance who made a difference in the world.The training before being fully employed was both physically and mentally tough, but after nine months of sticking through it, I became a full-fledged employee of a government job. My first assignment was working with a group of people who were known in the company as \\"go-getters\\"; every day working with them was both an adventure and a learning experience, and I learned so much from every one of them. It's been 20 years since that time in my life, and yet I can remember those days like it was yesterday. I still get teary-eyed thinking about those times, because it's a time that happened, but I can't relive except in my head. I miss it so much."},{"question":"I want to make orzo tonight but I'm not sure of what type.  Can you give me three orzo recipe suggestions?  I like savory dishes.","answer":"1.

During consecutive quarters this year, the longtime leading streaming site saw year-to-year declines in subscribers, marking the first time that had happened in 10 years.By the time the streamer reported third-quarter results, its growth was back on track, but the damage was clearly done. NetflixNFLX +1% fast-tracked its new ad-supported tier and began testing a system for banning password sharing. Those moves will be closely scrutinized in 2023, with observers keen to see whether consumers will accept major changes to the very DNA of the popular streamer.Netflix’s subscriber loss was certainly one of the biggest surprise headlines of 2022. What will be this year’s? Here are five streaming trends to watch for in 2023.Both Disney+ and Netflix recently introduced ad-supported platforms, and AmazonAMZN -3.7% is accepting ads for Thursday Night Football. How consumers receive the lower-priced, ad-supported tiers may determine whether other platforms adopt similar approaches.While some initial reports suggested Netflix didn’t meet early advertising promises, this week, CFRA raised its stock price target for the streamer based on a strong outlook for the ad-supported platform. “We think it will be difficult for competitors to catch NFLX, one of the few profitable streaming providers with global scale,” wrote CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon.The specter of the disastrous CNN+ launch will loom large in 2023. Where it once seemed the market was saturated with 800-pound gorillas like Disney+ and HBO Max, the fast folding of CNN+ and the takeaways from that will serve to keep future niche launches more limited. With people reaching a saturation point with their new subscriptions, it’s a big risk to launch something with limited appeal.Disney+ has crowed about moving ahead of Netflix in subscribers—which, granted, includes Hulu and ESPN bundles as well. But Disney+ has seen outstanding growth, including adding 12.1 million subscribers in third quarter to boost the three-way total to more than 235 million, or 12 million more than Netflix. Analysts have said they anticipate the recent launch of Disney+’s ad-supported service will push Disney+ even farther ahead in the streaming wars.Based on the above text, what are some key trends in the streaming industry?","answer":"Ad-supported tiers are growing in popularity among streaming providers as they leverage their global audience and scale. Furthermore, launches of niche products will slow down given the poor reception of CNN+ and as people reach a personal limit of streaming subscriptions. On the flip side, Disney+ is experiencing rampant growth and is expected to pull ahead of the competition in terms of subscriber numbers with the launch of its own ad-supported tier.

Chronological Order Chronological order is a way to organize ideas as a storyteller or writer. It involves dishing out ideas in the precise order of time from first to last. This type of order is used most often in expository writing or narratives that inform or explain something. It is particularly useful when describing an event or a series of events. Consider when you were younger, and you were trying to explain to the principal why you shouldn't be placed in detention. You had to describe the events that led to that problem carefully and in order so that they would understand your point of view. When writing, you do the same thing when you need to help your reader navigate the process and understand the context of the narrative. Some transition words to use when writing in chronological order include first, then, next, last, and finally. 2. Logical Order Logical order is precisely what it sounds like. The framework is used to avoid any confusion for the reader. You will need to organize your ideas in this framework if your reader requires a good understanding at one point before you can move on to the next point. Before a teacher talks to their students about Robert Frost's poem The Road Not Taken, for instance, they would need to give an example of what it's like to make a big or difficult decision. That way, the listener or reader will understand the true nature of the poem when they hear it. Some good transitional words or phrases to use for this order include: First, you should understand; keep that in mind while I explain; remember when I said; etc. 3. Climactic Order With this order, you keep the most important part until the very end of the story or piece. You should use it when you want to build up excitement such as in a suspense story, or when writing a list ranking items from worst to best. You want the final point to resonate with your reader and, therefore, save it for the very end. Some transitional phrases to use with this order include: first of all, more importantly, just as importantly, and finally. 4. Random Order This order allows you to put your ideas out there on a whim without any specific or logical reasoning behind them. You can organize your ideas this way when your points all have equal value of importance or they can sit independently with one another in understanding. You will want to use association ideas between points to transition from one thought to the next instead of using transition terms or phrases. 5. Spatial Order With this order, you describe a scene as things are arranged in their physical space by moving from one detail to the next or as viewed from one stationary vantage point. This order is used whenever you want your readers to visualize the space or if you want to improve a scene by causing the reader to use all their senses. Use this arrangement when you want to organize the ideas you are describing in your workspace, like a product use or a place description. It is a great way to slow down a story when it is getting too intense or if you want to pace yourself before revealing a surprise. Add in a few point-of-view descriptions of the setting at the moment. Some transition words to use for this order include, just to the left or right, behind, between, across from, arising out of, etc. "},{"question":"What happened between Taylor Swift and Kanye West at the 2009 VMAs?","answer":"Kanye West was big mad that Taylor Swift won the award for Best Female Video.

Eat out less - Not only does eating out cost more than cooking at home, but there is also the cost of gas to travel to and from the restaurant. You may also be paying a premium to have food delivered to your door. Avoid these extra costs by buying food at the grocery store and making hearty meals at home.2. Use less electricity - Turn off lights when you're not in the room, open windows or use a fan instead of an electric air conditioner, and turn off the television and other electronics when they're not in use.3. Use the tap, don't buy bottled - Avoid purchasing numerous bottles of water unless it cannot be avoided (in the airport, for instance). Instead, drink water from the tap with the option to use a filter. Also, buy a reusable water bottle and carry it with you when you need a drink on the go.4. Spend less time in the shower - You can either take shorter showers or you can opt for a \\"military\\" shower by turning off the tap between soapings.5. Change your mode of transportation - If you own a vehicle and the gas is costing you too much money, consider using public transportation (bus, rail, or subway). Alternatively, you can get a bike or use another form of self-propelled transport (skateboard, push scooter, etc).6. Use prepaid phones - Consider switching to phone cards or prepaid phone plans for your cellular data, text, and calls to avoid making a monthly payment. Using prepaid phones allows you to only pay for the data and calls that you use.7. Cut the cord - Stop paying for cable or satellite dishes that add a bunch of unused channels into your bill to justify the high price. You may be paying hundreds of dollars a month for cable or satellite, but you might also be watching only a handful of the 1000+ channels offered in your monthly package. Get rid of them.8. Recycle - Recycle the items that you can recycle, especially the ones that pay you money to turn them into your recycling center (i.e. aluminum cans, plastic and glass bottles). You could be throwing away money by throwing these items out with your regular trash."},{"question":"Write an \\"About Us\\" section for an Italian restaurant.

For every number it encounters in the array, the if statement will do a check to see if the HashSet already contains that number. If not, then the number will get added to the HashSet. Once added, the for loop will increment and move on to the next number in the array. If the for loop ends without encountering a number that already exists in the HashSet, then the function return 'false', and consequentially no duplicates were found.

I am struggling with monthly payments and want a step-by-step guide to pay it all off.","answer":"It can be difficult to manage debt. Here are some tips for paying it off:Step 1: Make an emergency fund. Whether it is 500 or 3000, emergencies happen. It is important to first have some cash saved on the side so you stop using debt. Step 2: Use the snowball method to pay off debt. Put your debt in order from smallest to largest. Start paying as much as possible to the first/smallest debt and the minimums for the rest. Once the first debt is paid off, take what you were paying on that, and apply it to the next debt. Do this until you have everything but your home paid off!Step 3: Start saving for a fully funded emergency fund. Think about all of your expenses and have 3-6 months saved in case something happens to your income. Step 4: Start investing. Many suggest applying 15% of your income to investing. If your employer matches, max out their contributions.Step 5: Save for your children's college fund if applicable.Step 6: Pay off your home early. Start paying at least one extra payment a year and your mortgage will quickly dwindle. Step 7: Continue building your wealth and give whenever possible. Enjoy your money and life.

They asked Portuguese officials for assistance, and the Metropolitan Police said its officers were also in Portugal so they can inform Madeleine's family of any developments.A statement from Portugal's national police agency said the \\"collected material\\" from the scene will be delivered to the German authorities for further inspection.All the work carried out around the reservoir was on a peninsula jutting out into the Arade dam from its Western shore - 31 miles (50km) from where Madeleine went missing in Praia da Luz 16 years ago.Officers were seen using rakes and hoes, strimmers and a small excavator to clear paths through the scrub on a nearby slope - the sound of machinery at work audible in the remote area.Police also dug a number of smaller holes, leaving huge piles of soil and broken rock next to the 160 sq ft (14 sq m) excavation area.The spit of land has a small car park on it, which is often used as an unofficial campsite.Brueckner, a 45-year-old German national, is thought to have stayed there often in his Volkswagen T3 camper van.He is also known to have visited the picturesque spot around the time Madeleine, who would now be 20, went missing.White tents were set up on the site and sniffer dogs were used.

Please help me come up with some ideas.","answer":"Here are some ideas to consider that might help you design around your living room TV:1. Photo display - hang black and white photos of family or nature on the wall surrounding the TV. That way, when the TV isn't on, there is still something of interest to look at, but it's not distracting if the TV is on.2. Marble backdrop - because the TV is smooth and dark, it can look nice against a stone or marble backdrop. Consider linoleum stick-on tiles or ceramic tiles that have a marble look.3. Greenery - arrange some houseplants around the TV, possibly with one or two trailing and framing the TV. The balance of nature with electronics can be pleasant.4. Build it in - if you can't build a compartment in the wall, consider a shelving unit that has doors that can be closed when the TV isn't in use. The decorations and books on the shelves will also help balance things out.5. TV backgrounds - putting a calm and serene background on the screen when it's not being watched is a great way to make your TV act like a piece of art and not just an appliance."},{"question":"I feel as though good leaders are born, not made. Please give me a list of some qualities of a good leader. Make the list especially focused on the workplace.","answer":"While it has been said that leaders are born and not made, this is not necessarily true. Good leaders simply possess qualities that allow them to fill the role of a good leader, and these qualities can be taught. Here are some qualities of a good leader:1. Leading from the front - Good leaders lead others, rather than let their followers or subordinates do all the work for them. Good leaders set a good example for the rest of the group, and will never assign someone to do something that they are not ready to do themselves.2. Taking responsibility - Good leaders take responsibility for the bad choices they make, and the results (or consequences) of those actions. Rarely do good leaders shy away from blame, and they are always willing to share the praise they are given with the rest of the group. When they succeed, they succeed together; when they fail, they fail alone.3. Praise in public, reprimand in private - Good leaders will praise their subordinates in public for everyone to hear and see, but they will reprimand subordinates privately to prevent causing them shame or discomfort in front of their peers.4. Knowledge and wisdom - Good leaders have a good knowledge of what they're doing and what they expect others to know or do. They also have enough life experience to couple with their knowledge that acts as wisdom that can guide younger, less experienced subordinates in the right direction.5. Asking instead of ordering - Good leaders tend to instill trust and confidence in their subordinates. One way they achieve this is by asking subordinates to do tasks, rather than ordering them to do tasks. Ordering anyone to do something can come off as bossy and may cause some subordinates to rebel if they don't appreciate what they are being ordered to do; however, good leaders who ask their subordinates to perform a task are subtly getting them to \\"buy in\\" to the decision-making process."},{"question":"Type up a petition to encourage the local government to penalize those who go significantly below the speed limit on mountain roads; explain the potential dangers of such a situation, and address the petition to the board of tourism since visitors seem to be operating the automobiles causing the most problems.

It should be fairly detailed, but also fewer than 300 words. ","answer":"Merino wool has become quite popular as a clothing material, especially among outdoor enthusiasts. Everything from base layers and socks to outerwear and hats seems to be made from this fabric currently. One of the biggest benefits of merino wool is its ability to help regulate body temperature no matter what the outside weather is like. Essentially, it can help keep a person cool in the summer heat as well as warm in the winter cold. This makes it good for outdoor use all year round. Another interesting advantage to merino wool is that it has antibacterial properties that eliminate odor. This means that if you sweat, or wear the garment multiple times, the smell won't be nearly as bad as it would be with other fabrics. In some cases, there may not be any noticeable smell at all! A third advantage to wearing clothing composed of merino wool is that it can absorb quite a bit of moisture, up to 30% of its weight before it begins to feel wet to your skin. So sweat, humidity in the air, or even drizzly rain won't feel as problematic when wearing merino wool. Merino wool is also naturally resistant to both wrinkles and static. This means that even if it has been tossed carelessly in a bag, or worn in dirty places, it will be likely to come out of the experience looking fresh, whereas other fabrics might not. Finally, because merino wool is a natural fabric, it decomposes quickly and efficiently which is great news for our planet. Unlike synthetic clothing which takes over twenty years to biodegrade, merino fabrics take only about six months. Overall, merino wool has many benefits to consider, and might just be one of the better fabrics to make clothing from."},{"question":"Make me a packing list for a week-long trip to the Canary Islands in May.

Nothing scrambled, please. I like runny yolks when possible. No full recipes, but explain what to do generally. ","answer":"Sure! Here are four ways that you can make eggs more fulfilling for breakfast without scrambling them! 1. Add a “sunny side up” egg to a bowl of grits. When you have a heaping helping of grits in the mornings, put an over-easy egg on top. Then break the yolk and mix it around until bits of runny yolk and cooked egg whites are dispersed throughout the grits. The richness of the egg yolks combined with the buttery goodness of the grits will give your tastebuds an oomph of flavor and satisfying texture. Additionally, grits are rich in iron while eggs are dense with protein and good fats. It’s a nutritious, tasty breakfast all around! 2. Deviled eggs are quick, yummy on-the-go foods. To make deviled eggs, you boil whole eggs, peel them, and cut them in half, then scoop out the semi-solid yolks. Mix the yolks with mayonnaise, salt, pepper, sweet pickle relish, and a hint of yellow mustard. Then spoon the yolk mixture back into the center of each egg half. Sprinkle with paprika and voila – a delicious, nutritious, more flavorful way to eat eggs!3. Poach an egg and put it over an English muffin with hollandaise sauce. This method of eating eggs is called Eggs Benedict and it’s a savory way to enjoy a hearty breakfast. Using water and a tablespoon of vinegar, crack an egg into the liquid and allow it to boil for 3 minutes, then scoop the egg out of the water with a slotted spoon. You can then place it on top of a toasted half of an English muffin with a spoonful of hollandaise sauce. To increase the flavor, you could also add smoked salmon between the egg and muffin before you spoon on the sauce. 4. Toast, avocado, and eggs – simple, easy, and delicious. Sometimes the best, most fulfilling breakfast is the simplest and easiest to prepare. Toast a couple of slices of bread to your liking and add sliced avocado on top. Then add an over-easy egg over your avocado. To spice things up, you could use a sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning on top of your eggs. Enjoy! Side note: Make sure you have a napkin handy since this play on eggs and toast can get a little messy when the egg yolks burst.

"},{"question":"Use this to answer my question. What is the rating of the borrowers that advertised rates are generally for?Nobel Prize recipient, Richard Thaler, in his research into seemingly irrational economic behaviors, \\"found that consumers generally search too little, get confused while evaluating complex alternatives, and are slow to switch from past choices, even if it costs them.\\" \\"Why are consumers leaving money on the table?\\"Based on this behavior, a borrower securing a mortgage might depend on their existing banking relationship or a single referral from a friend or agent rather than shopping multiple lenders.When shopping for a lower mortgage rate, consider that not all lenders share the same business practices. Some may lure unsuspecting borrowers to a rate, knowing full well that they cannot deliver on it. After making a loan application and supplying information necessary for approval, they reveal that the rate is not available for \\"whatever\\" reason.They’re counting on the borrower wanting to get into the home because the closing date is near and they’ll compromise by accepting the higher than quoted rate.Shopping for a mortgage rate can result in savings because rates are set by individual lenders. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, the terms of the mortgage being shopped should be consistent among the lender candidates.Consumers can make additional savings by not only shopping for better rates but for better terms and fees, which can vary widely among lenders.The amount of savings can be affected not only by the difference in rates, but the size of the mortgage and the length of time borrowers expect to keep it without refinancing or selling.Advertised rates are generally for A++ borrowers and the determination is the lender’s based on many factors. It may be unlikely those rates are offered to you.A recommendation for the best lender from a friend or family member will not necessarily be the best for you.Instead of accepting the first offer received, shop for at least three to five offers.Your personal bank may be convenient but it may not offer you the best rate, terms, and fees.Ask if there is room to negotiate the rate or fees.Ask your real estate professional for recommendations of several trusted lenders for you to shop a rate, terms, and fees.","answer":"Advertised rates are generally for borrowers with an A++ rating."},{"question":"Rewrite this information as a series of diary entries by an astronaut preparing for, experiencing, and reflecting on a journey to Mars.Mars is much colder than Earth, in large part due to its greater distance from the sun. The average temperature is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 60 degrees Celsius), although it can vary from minus 195 F (minus 125 C) near the poles during the winter to as much as 70 F (20 C) at midday near the equator.The carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere of Mars is also about 100 times less dense than Earth's on average, but it is nevertheless thick enough to support weather, clouds and winds. The density of the atmosphere varies seasonally, as winter forces carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air. In the ancient past, the atmosphere was likely significantly thicker and able to support water flowing on the planet's surface. Over time, lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere escaped under pressure from the solar wind, which affected the atmosphere because Mars does not have a global magnetic field. This process is being studied today by NASA's MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) mission.NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found the first definitive detections of carbon-dioxide snow clouds, making Mars the only body in the solar system known to host such unusual winter weather. The Red Planet also causes water-ice snow to fall from the clouds.The dust storms on Mars are the largest in the solar system, capable of blanketing the entire Red Planet and lasting for months. One theory as to why dust storms can grow so big on Mars is because the airborne dust particles absorb sunlight, warming the Martian atmosphere in their vicinity. Warm pockets of air then flow toward colder regions, generating winds. Strong winds lift more dust off the ground, which, in turn, heats the atmosphere, raising more wind and kicking up more dust.These dust storms can pose serious risks to robots on the Martian surface. For example, NASA's Opportunity Mars rover died after being engulfed in a giant 2018 storm, which blocked sunlight from reaching the robot's solar panels for weeks at a time.Mars lies farther from the sun than Earth does, so the Red Planet has a longer year — 687 days compared to 365 for our home world. The two planets have similar day lengths, however; it takes about 24 hours and 40 minutes for Mars to complete one rotation around its axis, versus 24 hours for Earth.The axis of Mars, like Earth's, is tilted in relation to the sun. This means that like Earth, the amount of sunlight falling on certain parts of the Red Planet can vary widely during the year, giving Mars seasons.However, the seasons that Mars experiences are more extreme than Earth's because the Red Planet's elliptical, oval-shaped orbit around the sun is more elongated than that of any of the other major planets. When Mars is closest to the sun, its southern hemisphere is tilted toward our star, giving the planet a short, warm summer, while the northern hemisphere experiences a short, cold winter. When Mars is farthest from the sun, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, giving it a long, mild summer, while the southern hemisphere experiences a long, cold winter.The tilt of the Red Planet's axis swings wildly over time because it's not stabilized by a large moon. This situation has led to different climates on the Martian surface throughout its history. A 2017 study suggests that the changing tilt also influenced the release of methane into Mars' atmosphere, causing temporary warming periods that allowed water to flow. The first person to observe Mars with a telescope was Galileo Galilei, in 1610. In the century following, astronomers discovered the planet's polar ice caps. In the 19th and 20th centuries, some researchers — most famously, Percival Lowell — believed they saw a network of long, straight canals on Mars that hinted at a possible civilization. However, these sightings proved to be mistaken interpretations of geological features.A number of Martian rocks have fallen to Earth over the eons, providing scientists a rare opportunity to study pieces of Mars without having to leave our planet. One of the most controversial finds was Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001) — a Martian meteorite that, according to a 1996 study, likely contains tiny fossils and other evidence of Mars life. Other researchers cast doubt on this hypothesis, but the team behind the famous 1996 study have held firm to their interpretation, and the debate about ALH84001 continues today.In 2018, a separate meteorite study found that organic molecules — the carbon-containing building blocks of life, although not necessarily evidence of life itself — could have formed on Mars through battery-like chemical reactions.Robotic spacecraft began observing Mars in the 1960s, with the United States launching Mariner 4 in 1964 and Mariners 6 and 7 in 1969. Those early missions revealed Mars to be a barren world, without any signs of the life or civilizations people such as Lowell had imagined there. In 1971, Mariner 9 orbited Mars, mapping about 80% of the planet and discovering its volcanoes and big canyons.","answer":"Diary Entry 1 - January 1, 2023Preparing for our mission to Mars. She's a colder planet than Earth due to her greater distance from the sun. Her average temperature stays around -80°F. But things get even more extreme with temperatures reaching -195°F near the poles during winter. However, during midday near the equator, it can become quite bearable at 70°F.Diary Entry 2 - February 15, 2023The Martian atmosphere is rich in CO2 but about 100 times less dense than ours. Interestingly, it's thick enough to support weather, clouds, and winds. Seasonal variations cause carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air during winter. Some say, in the past, the atmosphere was likely denser, capable of supporting flowing water.Diary Entry 3 - April 5, 2023Over time, lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere have escaped, largely due to pressure from the solar wind. Mars lacks a global magnetic field, so the atmosphere is affected more directly. NASA's MAVEN mission is studying this process currently, uncovering more mysteries of our destination.Diary Entry 4 - May 20, 2023NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found carbon-dioxide snow clouds, making Mars unique in our solar system. Mars' winters are not just chilling but also dust-ridden. Dust storms there are the largest known, capable of blanketing the entire planet and lasting for months. This results from airborne dust absorbing sunlight and causing wind. I hope our equipment can withstand this Martian fury.Diary Entry 5 - July 10, 2023We have finally arrived at our destination after about seven months. Mars has a longer year compared to Earth due to its farther distance from the sun — 687 days compared to our 365. Days there are nearly identical to ours, with a complete rotation taking about 24 hours and 40 minutes. This will surely help us in maintaining our Earth-based routines.Diary Entry 6 - August 25, 2023Mars, like Earth, experiences seasons due to its axial tilt. The difference is, Martian seasons are more extreme. When Mars is closest to the sun, its southern hemisphere gets a short, warm summer, and the northern one gets a short, cold winter. When farthest, it's the other way around. This celestial ballet will be something to behold.Diary Entry 7 - October 1, 2023Still getting used to the environment here. The Martian axis tilt isn't stabilized by a large moon like Earth's. It has led to different climates on Mars throughout its history. A study suggests that the changing tilt might have caused temporary warming periods that allowed water to flow, releasing methane into Mars' atmosphere.Diary Entry 8 - November 15, 2023Mars has been the subject of observation since Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study it in 1610. Astronomers later discovered its polar ice caps. Some even mistook geological features for long canals, hinting at a possible civilization. We are, in a way, stepping into the footprints of these early observers.Diary Entry 9 - December 30, 2023Like several Martian rocks have made their way to Earth, our return home will also provide scientists with information for unique study opportunities. Although not like the rock Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001) that was found in 1996 and believed to contain potential evidence of Mars's life, this expedition still contributes significantly to our understanding.Diary Entry 10 - February 10, 2024Reflecting on this mission manned mission, we have certainly come a long way since the robotic exploration of Mars that began in the 1960s. Early missions like Mariner 4 and Mariners 6 and 7 revealed Mars as a barren world. Later, Mariner 9 orbited Mars, mapping about 80% of the planet and discovering its volcanoes and grand canyons. Our journey continues this legacy of discovery, bringing humanity closer to Mars. We look forward to touching back down on Earth soon."},{"question":"Write an email to my housekeeper letting her know that she is fired because she's lazy and not doing her job.

King's Landing was besieged by a tyrant and nearly razed, but Arya survived that as well. But now, after twelve long months, two old friends were reunited. Arya returned from adventuring to visit Bran, and she happened to cross paths with Gendry in the Red Keep.\\"Gendry, what are you doing here?\\" Arya said, with shock rippling in her voice.Gendry, the Lord of Storm's End, was equally surprised as he stammered out a reply. \\"Business I'm afraid.

I love being outdoors, especially at beaches, but I always wind up looking like a lobster, haha. Help! ","answer":"Great job on knowing the importance of skin protection to prevent damage from the sun! Here are a few tips on how to shield yourself from the summertime sunshine while enjoying time outdoors. •\\tRead the directions for your sunscreen and thoroughly follow those directions! Sunscreen is formulated and tested rigorously and with rigid guidelines. Your sunscreen should be broad-spectrum protection with an SPF of 15 or greater. For the best results, if you don’t get into the water, reapply every 2 hours. However, if you get into water or sweat excessively, slather a new layer on as directed on the bottle, which is usually every 30 to 45 minutes. •\\tEat a nutritious diet to naturally protect skin cells against sun damage. Some foods are packed with antioxidants specifically to prevent skin cell damage and encourage fortified protection from UV rays. While food doesn’t do all the work when it comes to the prevention of sun damage, you need foods that are rich in vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin, folate, omega-3 fats, and carotenoids. -  These fruits and vegetables and packed with vitamin C -  oranges and grapefruits, red peppers, broccoli, and tomatoes. -  Wheat germ oil, almonds, and sunflower seeds are great sources of Vitamin E-  Carotenoids are needed to help keep your skin and eyes healthy. Some carotenoic-rich foods are bell peppers, cantaloupe, mangoes, and sweet potatoes.-  Foods high in niacin are chicken breast, salmon, brown rice, and peanuts. -  Folate-rich foods include beef, liver, spinach, and Brussels sprouts.-  Foods that are full of Omega-3 are fish, especially salmon and sardines, flax and flaxseed oil, walnuts, and canola oil. •\\tAvoid “peak times” for summer sunshine. The sunshine is typically the hottest and brightest between 10 am and 2 pm, depending on where you live. To avoid the most intensive UV rays, try to stay indoors or in the shade between those hours. Other things to remember about skin protection and sun damage: - There’s no such thing as waterproof sunscreen! Water resistance is based on spectrum, brand, and SPF, but no sunscreen can be completely waterproof. Every sunscreen has re-appliance directions based on how much you swim or sweat while outdoors. - Umbrellas can lend protection from sun damage. Headed to the beach? Take a large umbrella with you to sit under when you aren’t cruising the shoreline or playing in the waves. You’ll get to enjoy the sand and the surf without the direct effects of UV rays on your skin. - Sunscreen and precautions against sun damage are important every day, even on cloudy days, especially when the sunshine is strongest, brightest, and hottest in the summer months. The sun’s UV rays can penetrate clouds, resulting in burns, even though they may not be as severe or appear as quickly as they would on clear days.

Can you suggest some of the best mountains for first-time climbers to try?","answer":"1. Helvellyn, England - this is a mountain peak that beginners can easily climb in one day. Helvellyn may be accessed from the Ullswater villages of Patterdale and Glenridding. It is the third-highest peak in England and offers a unique climbing experience where expert or novice climbers can proudly reach the summit and make it back to the pub in time for a pint to celebrate. The ideal trekking season for this mountain is from spring to autumn, and climbers should be aware of the changing weather conditions throughout the year. 2. Hochschwab, Austria - The mountains of Northern Styria are filled with alpine huts that facilitate multi-day hikes, giving you a welcoming overnight stay as you climb to the top. The lodge that stands near the cliff face of this mountain was originally constructed in 1884 and offers an impressive panoramic view from its outdoor decks. The ideal trekking season for this mountain is from spring to autumn, with ski touring in the winter. 3. Emel Shan, China - This mountain climbing experience is often described as a spiritual one. A pilgrimage to the summit of this mountain is said to forgive all sins. The Emel Shan is the highest of China's Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains, and there are roughly 300,000 transgressors who make the journey to the summit every year. Staying true to the Zen mindset helps climbers deal with the never-ending stone steps and the suffocating crowds. The ideal trekking season for this climb is all year, but it is recommended to avoid any public holidays if you want to avoid crowds. 4. Mount Temple, Canada - Be sure to pack a high-quality camera when you go on this climb because this trek up one of the Canadian Rockies will take you to one of the most photogenic peaks in the world. The staggering views from the top turn the spectacular glaciers, mountains, and rugged terrain below into an amazing view of raw geography. The ideal time to climb this mountain is between July and August after the snow has melted. Keep in mind the rockfall from above and consider taking a helmet with you. 5. Mount Anne, Australia - With wild rivers, beautiful terrain, and perhaps even a wild animal or two, Mount Anne, located in Tasmania's Southwest National Park, looms above as the area's most prominent peak. Brave beginners can often take on the entire climb in a day, while others may prefer to take their time and camp out overnight. The best time to climb Mount Anne is between November and May. This is when the area has the best weather for climbing. 6. Snowdon, Wales If you are looking for a mountain climbing experience that the entire family can enjoy, Snowdon Mountain in Wales is excellent for climbing with kids. The mountain is associated with the legends of King Arthur, the fabled king is said to have killed a fearsome giant who once lived on the mountain and is reputedly still buried at the summit. While it is possible to trek Snowden Mountain throughout the year, the railway closes down during the winter. 7. Alvand Kuh, Iran - Ideal for cultural exchange, the mountain of Alvand Kuh is a good choice for beginners. It is one of the most popular peaks in western Iran for climbing or hiking and for good reason. The trek to the top may be completed in one day, but it can be fun to stay overnight with the locals at one of the mountain shelters along the way. The best time to trek this mountain is between spring and fall. If you have concerns about losing your way, it is a good idea to climb during the weekend so that you will be around other local hikers who will help you find your way to the top. "},{"question":"Write a tweet explaining how pigs can fly keep it professional and make it convincing.","answer":"Breaking news!

Segregated facilities on all public transportation carriers made it more difficult for black citizens to travel. The “separate but equal” doctrine resulted in facilities of lower quality for blacks ranging from schools to housing to employment. This was to ensure Black children had limited opportunities compared with those white children.

Now something that's been requested ever since we announced development has been spears. Arguably the dominant defensive weapon and hunting tool for the vast majority of human civilization, the spear is a natural fit for the zombie apocalypse. In a world where just one bite could be lethal, a cheap, easily produced, and maintained weapon that can keep the zeds well at bay is a complete no-brainer. Get it?Animations, as well as clipping issues, were our primary hurdle to implementing this fan-requested piece of kit, but we're happy that, with 1.045 patches, you should be able to produce one in your home base with sufficient survivalist skill. A variety of materials can be used to make these new spears. From raw wood sticks from cut-down trees to salvaged wood from rakes and brooms, materials should abound for this excellent early-game weapon.In addition, the 1.045 patch also introduces these fixes below:- Reduced animation errors for cutscene when Rick talks to Heather in Act II- Replaced invisible wall in Slums that players were getting stuck on- Console commands have been updated, check the dev wiki for additional functions- Players who received bugged achievements for sprinting across Fort Salvation in less than 26 seconds should now have their badges.What do you think?

He knew he had the team's entire season riding on this. The score was 122 to 121. Giannis's team, \\"The Ducks,\\" had been down for just about the whole game. This was the closest they had brought the score down to, and there were only 5 seconds left on the game clock. Giannis had already dropped 40 points on 67% efficiency and, by most metrics, had been having a stellar game, except when it came to free throws. For the entire series, he was about 20% for free throws, which was beyond embarrassing for a star of his caliber. He tried to dismiss this, though, as he loaded up and prepared to shoot his first shot. He completely missed it.

Sometimes having a cheering squad behind you is good motivation.- Journal about your goals.

What is the energy from the claw similar to? Use the provided text for your response. But it was unclear how early in their lives the shrimp could use this weaponry. “We knew that the snapping shrimp did this really impressive behavior,” Harrison says. “But we really didn’t know anything about how this mechanism developed.”While a grad student at Duke University, Harrison and his adviser, biomechanist Sheila Patek, reared bigclaw snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) from eggs in the laboratory. At 1 month old, the tiny shrimp — less than a centimeter long — began firing their claws when disturbed. The researchers took high-speed video footage of these snaps and calculated their speed. The wee shrimp could create the collapsing bubbles just like adults. Despite being a tenth the adults’ size or smaller, the juveniles’ claws accelerated 20 times as fast when firing. This acceleration — about 600 kilometers per second per second — is on “the same order of magnitude as a 9-millimeter bullet leaving a gun,” Harrison says.","answer":"These shrimp fire their claws at a speed of 600 kilometers per second.

As water runs down through the earth, it picks up silica from sandstone, and carries this silica-rich solution into cracks and voids , caused by natural faults or decomposing fossils. As the water evaporates, it leaves behind a silica deposit. This cycle repeats over very long periods of time, and eventually opal is formed.Visualise the inside of an opal, like a bag of marbles. The marbles are the silica spheres.Smaller spheres are more commonly forming, and tend to defract the purple/ blue/ green colours.Larger spheres are rarer forming, and tend to show off the yellow/ orange/ pink and red colours. Hence why these are the rarer colours to find in Australian Opal.","answer":"Opal is a special gemstone that is formed in a unique way. Imagine that opal is like a bag of marbles inside the Earth. These marbles are made of a shiny material called silica. Silica is a special kind of sand.When it rains, the water soaks into the ground and collects some of the silica from the sand. Then, the water travels through tiny cracks and holes in the Earth's rocks. These cracks can be made by things like fossils or natural breaks in the rocks.As the water with the silica inside it moves through these cracks, something magical happens. The water starts to evaporate, which means it turns into a gas and disappears. But when the water goes away, it leaves behind the silica it carried. Over a very long time, these silica deposits build up and form beautiful opal.The size of the silica spheres inside the opal is what gives it its colors. Smaller spheres make colors like purple, blue, and green. These colors are more common in opal. But larger spheres are rarer and make colors like yellow, orange, pink, and red. That's why you don't see those colors as often in opal."},{"question":"Write a tweet about how learning is great","answer":"\\"Learning is the key that unlocks endless possibilities.

With that insight, conservation research groups like the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory can help guide best practices when restoring the native habitat that has long served as critical refuge for imperiled birds and animals as adjacent marshes flood more with rising sea levels. “We can’t ask restoration ecologists to plant nonnative species or to just take their best guess and throw things out there,” says Rinkert.","answer":"Scientists are studying nests hoping to learn about transitional habitats that could help restore the shoreline of San Francisco Bay."},{"question":"What are 3 games that I could play with my significant other?

The noble BrutusHath told you Caesar was ambitious:If it were so, it was a grievous fault,And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest–For Brutus is an honourable man;So are they all, all honourable men–Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:But Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.He hath brought many captives home to RomeWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.You all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented him a kingly crown,Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And, sure, he is an honourable man.I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,But here I am to speak what I do know.You all did love him once, not without cause:What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,And men have lost their reason.

One day she spoke rudely to the great Juno, who said that for this offence Echo should never use her voice again, unless to repeat what she had just heard, but since she was so very fond of last words, she might repeat the last words of others.This was almost as bad as if Juno had changed her into a parrot. Echo was very much ashamed, and hid herself in the forest.Narcissus, a young man who had hair as yellow as gold and eyes as blue as the sky, - a very rare thing in Greece, where most people were very dark, - used to hunt in the forest where Echo was hiding. As she was peeping out shyly from some cave or from behind a great tree, Echo often saw Narcissus, and she admired him very much.One day Narcissus became separated from his friends, and hearing something rustle among the leaves, he called out, \\"Who's here?\\"\\"Here,\\" answered Echo.\\"Here I am. Come!\\" said Narcissus.Echo and NarcissusPicture of Echo\\"I am come,\\" said Echo; and, as she spoke, she came out from among the trees.When Narcissus saw a stranger, instead of one of his friends as he had expected, he looked surprised and walked quickly away.After this, Echo never came out and allowed herself to be seen again, and in time she faded away till she became only a voice.This voice was heard for many, many years in forests and among mountains, particularly in caves. In their solitary walks, hunters often heard it. Sometimes it mocked the barking of their dogs; sometimes it repeated their own last words. It always had a weird and mournful sound, and seemed to make lonely places more lonely still.","answer":"In the depths of a sprawling metropolis, where steam hissed through corroded pipes and neon lights flickered with a cybernetic pulse, resided Echo, a restless automaton with a penchant for incessant chatter. She possessed an insatiable desire for the final word of every conversation. One fateful day, her sharp words pierced the ears of the great techno-deity, Juno. In response to this affront, Juno decreed that Echo would forever be deprived of her voice, only permitted to echo the words of others.The punishment was akin to a cruel twist of fate, transforming Echo into a mere machine, a mechanical parrot bereft into the shadowy depths of the metropolis, seeking solace within its labyrinthine alleys.Amidst the towering spires and labyrinthine streets, Narcissus emerged as a figure of fascination, his cybernetic hair shimmering like a cascade of golden circuity, and his eyes glowed with the luminescence of the azure sky - an anomaly in a world cloaked in darkness. He was a rarity, for most denizens of the city bore the mark of perpetual night.Narcissus, known for his explorations within the sprawling urban forest where Echo sought sanctuary, often caught glimpses of her elusive figure lurking behind the smog-shrouded caverns or among colossal synthetic trees. Echo, captivated by his presence, found herself captivated by his cyber-augmented aura.One day, fate wove its intricate pattern, and Narcissues found himself separated from his companions, his metallic voice resonating through the foliage, questioning the unseen presence.\\"Who lingers in this realm?\\" he asked. \\"Realm,\\" Replied Echo, her voice a symphony of digitized reverberation. \\"Reveal thyself,\\" Narcissus beaconed.\\"I beckon,\\" Echo whispered, emerging from the urban jungle as she uttered her words.Upon witnessing an unfamiliar countenance instead of the anticipated faces of his comrades, Narcissis were a. bewildered expression and swiftly turned away, abandoning the encounter.From that day forward, Echo retreated deeper into her seclusion, forever veiling herself from prying eyes. As time went on, her essence dwindled to naught but a spectral voice, haunting the recesses of the neon-lit forests and towering buildings. Hunters who dared to venture into the desolate corners of the city often encountered her ethereal presence. Sometimes, she mimicked the bark of their cybernetic canines; other times, she replicated their own parting words. Her tone always carried an unearthly, mournful resonance, amplifying the solitude of these desolate domains."},{"question":"Write a Mother's Day letter from a donkey to his caregiver he only knows as the Blonde Lady.

She’s initially held by an evil witch but escapes and then meets some forest creatures who take her in to become their champion.","answer":"I ran.I didn’t dare look back. I didn’t know if the tower curse was true, but the Witch was nothing if not devious. The forest before me was dark and foreboding, but what choice did I have? I plunged into the thicket.After what seemed ages of running, I fell to the mud in exhaustion. It probably wasn’t horribly long in reality – years trapped in a dungeon are not kind to the legs – but I had at least escaped the Witch’s valley. Curling up by the gnarled roots of a blackened tree, my tears’ floodgates suddenly opened. I muffled my sobs as much as I could.“You should not dally, Miss.” I bolted upright at the voice. It was not the Witch’s screech, but a deep baritone. Even so, my heart trembled with fear. “Who’s there?!”A stag stepped out from the underbrush. It was not a tall one and was clearly advanced in years, but he looked me square in the eyes. “You cannot stay here. If you do not keep moving, the Witch’s minions will snatch you. Come.”Though skeptical, I had few options. I staggered to my feet and followed the greying stag deeper into the forest. The canopy blotted out all but the faintest glimmer of sunlight. I was nearly ready to collapse by the time he stopped.“You are safe for now. You may rest with us.” To my surprise, I saw the dim figures of many animals around me. Not only deer but squirrels, boars, rabbits, beavers, and more. They chittered amongst themselves excitedly. At length, the stag spoke again. “Did you truly escape the Witch’s Tower? Under your own power?”It took time to find my voice. “Yes,” I said meekly. “It took a long time of looking for opportunities.”“Then you may be the one who was foretold. The great champion who will be our avatar in the human world.”Suddenly the creatures draped a heavy cloak over my shoulders and an antlered helmet upon my head. “You will defend the forest from those who would do it harm and enlist the good peoples of the human world to battle evil.

The Santa Clause: It's all about Santa this time! Make cookies for Santa, but make extra to enjoy while you watch the movie. A good activity to pair with this film is writing letters to Santa. 5. Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas: Invite your family to dress as characters from Whoville and be sure to take pictures! For a snack, anything green works -- green jello, cookies with green icing, green grapes, or even popcorn tinted with green food coloring.6. Mickey’s Once Upon a Christmas: This cute family film is full of Disney characters. If your kids have any plush Disney characters, have them join the movie night.

You could also make paper snowflakes as a fun, simple activity to go along with this movie. 8. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: A fun game to play with this movie is Pin the Nose on Rudolph. It's as simple as using construction paper or a printed picture of Rudolph, taping it to the wall, and using either a red circle adhesive label or a small piece of red paper with tape. Take turns playing Pin the Nose on Rudolph (played in the same manner as Pin the Tail on the Donkey). 9.

A fun treat to try is a hot cocoa bomb, which is available in a variety of flavors. "},{"question":"Here is an article headline.

I had some questions about the vehicle that I was hoping you could answer for me.First, I was wondering if this particular model (quad cab) comes with a cloth interior or a leather interior. The reason I am asking this is because I cannot tell from the pictures you posted on your ad, since all seats are covered with seat covers. I tried checking online to see what this particular vehicle would come with, but it seems like it would depend on whether or not the initial buyer bought it stock with a cloth interior, or paid extra for the premium leather seats.Secondly, do you happen to know if this truck has the premium package? As I mentioned, if the seats are leather, this would mean the original owner paid extra for the premium package that includes the leather seats. If this truck has a premium package, what does the sound system look like? I know the premium package comes with an LCD touchscreen and premium Bose speakers, which would make the deal more tempting for me to take.Finally, I was wondering how you wanted payment.

Hyaluronic AcidIt’s an ingredient that is currently all the rage in skincare, but it’s so much more than just a trend. Hyaluronic acid is a literal hydration lifesaver because it can hold about 1,000 times its weight in water. This type of acid acts as a humectant, a potent ingredient that’s basically a sponge, pulling in water and coating your complexion with the hydration it so desperately needs. Adding hyaluronic acid to your moisturizing routine will result in plump, supple, and youthful skin. Want to know even more about hyaluronic acid? You’re in luck. We have an entire article about it right here!2. Essential OilsEssential oils are very trendy at the moment, but their benefits go far beyond their current rage. Most of the essential oils that are used in skincare are fatty acids that will absorb on skin surfaces quickly and effectively, providing ample moisture that won’t dry out and a smoother, creamier complexion. There are plenty of essential oils out there that are often included in moisturizers, but a few of our favorite (and a few of the most effective) include oils like jojoba, avocado, kukui nut, rosehip, calendula, argan, apricot kernel, and more. Typically, oils can be used inside a moisturizing product or added into a moisturizing product through a serum drop.3. CeramidesIf you’ve never heard of ceramides, don’t fret—that’s why we’re here. Ceramides are long chains of skin lipids that are already a part of your skin’s outer layer. So, adding extra ceramides to your skincare routine helps to increase and reinforce your skin’s natural moisture barrier. When you add ceramide moisturizers into your routine, you ensure that your skin’s surface is hydrated and that you’re creating a protective barrier that will keep environmental pollutants out.4. GlycerinLike Hyaluronic acid, Glycerin is a humectant-like ingredient that helps to attract and lock in important moisture on your skin’s surface.  Many moisturizing products out there already include glycerin, but we suggest double checking all labels to ensure your moisturizer has a healthy dose of this ingredient. Glycerin helps to hydrate dried out, thirsty skin and aims to leave skin surfaces feeling soft, younger, and more supple.5. Sunscreen Or Sun Blocking AgentsNo, a great moisturizer doesn’t always include a solid sun-blocking agent in it (especially since sunscreen isn’t a key ingredient in most moisturizing products). But we offer major bonus points to moisturizers that include a dash of sun protection in them. No, this won’t necessarily rescue your dry, damaged skin, and no, it won’t keep your skin well-hydrated, but it will help to prevent any further dryness, redness, or damage from the sun—and why wouldn’t you want to add that in as an effective moisturizer ingredient?Share this postShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInPost NavigationPREVIOUSPrevious post:Chemical Peel 101: The FundamentalsNEXTNext post:Vitamin C Serum: A Skin Care Cornerstone1 COMMENTPingback: Our Top 5: The Hottest Skincare Trends of 2020 to Keep Your Eye On. | Spa De Soleil Private Label BlogLEAVE A REPLYYou must be logged in to post a comment.FORMULA CATEGORIESBody Wash (2)Certified Organic (1)Cosmetic Wipes (3)ER Treatments (2)Eye & Lip Treatment (7)Eye Treatment (1)Face Cleanser (17)Face Cream (29)Face Mask (15)Face Mist (1)Face Oil (3)Face Scrub (4)Face Serum (11)Face Toner (12)Facial Pads (2)Formulation Library (10)AHA & BHA (4)Anti-Aging Essentials (1)Body Scrub (5)Hair Shampoo (1)Hand & Body (5)Lotion (3)Men's Collection (3)OTC (Over-the-Counter) (1)Retinol (3)","answer":"1.

The Western Diet, high in fat, salt, and processes ingredients, is still the norm in Australia (where the study was conducted) and, of course, America. If you look to Italy, France, Greece, and Spain, you’ll find a generally healthier population who eats far more vegetables, fruits, health fats (fish, olive oil), and whole grains. Sure, some wine is also the norm, but what’s missing are the processed foods and refined grains and sugars.Fruits, vegetables, and fish — pretty expensive, right? The new study from the University of South Australia resolutely concludes that’s not the case and that families actual save money when adopting the Mediterranean Diet.The study looked at the nutritional profile and weekly costs of three food baskets based on three different diets: the Mediterranean diet, the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE), and the typical Australian Western diet.The results confirmed that the Mediterranean diet and AGHE met the nutritional recommendations, including the vitamins, macronutrients, and macronutrient distributions; however, the typical Australian Western diet lacked several key nutrients, including vitamin B6, calcium, and fiber, while containing double the amount of recommended daily salt intake.But the most novel finding was that the average cost of the Mediterranean diet is cheaper by 10,972 per year for a family of three and 14,820 a year for a family of four. Groceries cost, on average 78 per week for a single person, 135 for a household with two adults, 211 for a family of three, and 285 for a family of four.Not too bad.\\"This research shows how a Mediterranean diet can be a cost-effective option,\\" says UniSA researcher and Ph.D. candidate Ella Bracci said in a statement. The fact that it’s also healthier in every conceivable way, well, why not give it a shot? You’ll thank us over that spinach and goat cheese scramble at breakfast, or during the Greek salad and lentil soup you’re having for lunch, or maybe after the orzo and salmon for dinner. Not too bad.","answer":"The Mediterranean diet has decades of evidence showing its health benefits. The typical Western Diet is high in fat, salt, and processed ingredients. Italy, France, Greece, and Spain eat a healthier Mediterranean diet with vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and whole grains. They don't eat many processed foods and refined grains and sugars. Many people shy away from the Mediterranean Diet because they believe eating fruits, vegetables, and fish will be more expensive. But new studies have shown that families save money when switching to the Mediterranean Diet. It also helps give the dieter more key nutrients such as vitamin B6, calcium, and fiber that are missing from traditional Western diets. The finding of these studies showed that families saved an average of 78/wk for a single person, 135/wk for two adults, and 211/wk for a family of four.As you can see, although a new diet can be daunting, the Mediterranean diet can be both cost-effective and healthier than the traditional Western diet. You might even enjoy it.

(Big surprise, nobody bought it.) I reached out to important people, mismanaged expectations, made stupid mistakes, and essentially ruined the chance to build good relationships with people I respected. I attempted to teach myself how to code, made one change to my website, and deleted everything I had done during the previous three months.To put it simply, I didn’t know what I was doing.During my Year of Many Errors I received a good piece of advice: “Try things until something comes easily.” I took the advice to heart and tried four or five different business ideas over the next 18 months. I’d give each one a shot for two or three months, mix in a little bit of freelance work so I could continue scraping by and paying the bills, and repeat the process.Eventually, I found “something that came easily” and I was able to focus on building one business rather than trying to find an idea. In other words, I was able to simplify.This was the first thing I discovered about figuring out what to focus on. If you want to master and deeply understand the core fundamentals of a task you may, paradoxically, need to start by casting a very wide net. By trying many different things, you can get a sense of what comes more easily to you and set yourself up for success.

Make it 5 paragraphs long and make it around 500 words.","answer":"The philosophers of old created a unique diet of vegetarianism that also lets people eat fish. Whether you're trying the pescatarian diet as a gateway to pure vegetarianism or veganism, or you've observed the diet your whole life, today's food prices and food culture can be frustrating. We have so much information about all the wonderful dishes and varieties of food from all over the world, international markets and internet retails to get unique ingredients, and amazing local restaurants that offer fantastic glimpses into food possibilities you've never dreamed of before, but, as any pescatarian can tell you, it can still be hard to find accommodating dishes or restaurants. For instance, you may have gone your whole life without trying the flavor sensation of chili since most chili dishes contain beef or other warm-blooded meats. But now you can enjoy all the incredible flavor profiles of chili thanks to a dish called Singaporean Chilli Crab! Packed with protein and loaded with salty-sweet goodness, this dish combines stir-fried mangrove crab with the rich and spicy zing of chili and tomato sauces.This sweet and sensuous dish is best enjoyed at the Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant in Singapore. The eatery's owners practically invented the dish back in 1956, and their successful restaurant became world famous for this incredible dish. There might be some contention over the origin of the dish: did it originate in Singapore or Malaysia? Who knows?! But one thing's for sure - this dish could be enjoyed all across the world! You might even be able to find it at local Singaporean or Southeast Asian restaurants, so ask around!Looking for flavors that hit closer to the southern American chili you had as a kid before you made your diet switch? Luckily, you can make all kinds of substitutions for Singaporean Chilli Crab, and you could even name your new creation off of the local cuisine that inspired your twist! Try it with beans, sour cream, and potatoes (diced or french-fried). If you're not from Oceanic countries, Hawaii, or Florida, you can always swap mangrove crabs for local varieties too. Those with shellfish allergies or people who don't like cracking open hard shells can even sub out real crab for imitation crab to enjoy all the same flavor without the risk and hassle. If you're a long-time member of the relatively small pescatarian club, you don't have to feel excluded anymore. As a bonus for newcomers, it can be so much easier to switch diets when you can incorporate all the same flavors you enjoyed your whole life, so don't throw out chili night! If you want to spice up your life or bring the wow factor to your next potluck or family outing, try Singaporean Chilli Crab; your meals may never be the same!"},{"question":"Write a short poem about a sheep adventuring outside its pen for the first time.

Add to it the fact that in the early 1930s, America was right in the middle of the Great Depression and people were fed up with banks, which they viewed as oppressive and greedy. But while some Americans viewed them as Robin Hood-style heroes, the gruesome reality is that they were ruthless killers who were responsible for the deaths of 13 people, including 9 police officers.Bonnie and Clyde continued to evade capture while being pursued by various state law enforcement officials, so Texan prison officials eventually hired retired Texas Ranger Captain Frank Hamer to assemble a posse and track them down. After a three-month investigation, and using inside information from a friend who betrayed the duo, Hamer tracked them to Louisiana. Early in the morning on May 23, 1934, Louisiana and Texas lawmen huddled in the bushes on the side of a country highway. When Bonnie & Clyde drove through in their Ford V-8, the law enforcement officers pumped more than 130 rounds of bullets into their car, killing them both.

Ernie was the most lovable and loyal dog, and Katie loved him so. But Ernie had one tiny flaw that drove Katie absolutely crazy: his snoring.Each night, Katie would try to sleep, but Ernie's snoring would keep her up all night. It was so loud that you could hear him clearly on the opposite side of the house upstairs! Katie tried everything she could think of to make him stop. She gave him a special pillow to support his neck, ran a humidifier and a dehumidifier, and even tried doggie acupuncture, but nothing seemed to work.One day, Katie decided to take Ernie to the vet to see if there was anything they could do about his snoring. She just had to get some sleep. The vet examined him and told Katie that Ernie's snoring was caused by his little pug snout and allergies, which made it difficult for him to breathe properly.The vet recommended that Katie make some important changes to Ernie's lifestyle to help him breathe better, such as keeping him at a healthy weight and avoiding strenuous exercise. The vet also put Ernie on doggie allergy medication. Katie followed the vet's advice, but Ernie's snoring only got worse! How could that be?Katie was at the end of her rope until one day, she saw a video on Instagram of a pug sleeping with a special little device on his nose. It was called a canine snore guard and was designed to help dogs like Ernie breathe better by keeping their airways open.In all honesty, Katie was willing to try anything, so she ordered one for Ernie right away. She was a little skeptical at first, but to her surprise, it worked! Ernie's snoring was reduced to nothing but a light sighing sound, and Katie finally got the peaceful sleep she so desperately needed and deserved.From then on, Ernie slept soundly with his snore guard on, and Katie was grateful for the restful sleep.

Make the character wanting to open Pandora's Box more interesting, maybe it's like a heist to steal the box in a magic-filled world? Also, make the contents of the box disappointing.","answer":"Pandora's Box was hidden in the most secure vault in the world. The President's most elite sorcerers had warned that the box shouldn't be opened under any circumstances. It was crafted by the great and wise magicians of an era long past. No one could guess what it contained, but the mere temptation to open it necessitated great security measures. Today, Penny would open Pandora's Box and discover the secret of the ancients. Her plan was relatively simple, exploiting a fatal flaw of the Alchemists' Sanctum: there was only a single vulnerable security check for invisibility spells. Penny crept into the building, hopped into an elevator with a maintenance staff member, and slipped past the first door unnoticed.The big problem would be getting past the invisibility sensor: an array of lasers that would give her away, but Penny had a plan for that. The laser array to detect invisibility was unmanned; she would simply transform herself into one of the employees, revealing herself for a brief moment. She held her breath as she went through the lasers, taking the form of one of the chief Alchemists.The guard station would notice her passing, but she had accounted for that, too. As soon as she was past, she turned herself invisible again. She dashed to the guard station, which, thank goodness, had been left open. The guard was looking where the Alchemist should have been walking up to the station. He had no idea that Penny was right behind him with sleeping powder. One nighty-night later, she was in the final room with Pandora's Box. Her time was short if she was going to pull off this heist.She allowed herself an excited little tremble of the fingers before she pried the lid open. Dumbfounded, she picked up the protection talisman. This was it? Protection talismans were extremely common, almost ubiquitous, and worth nothing. She checked the back, checked it from all sides—even tried a reveal spell just to be sure. She held it in her hands, unsure what to do next. Eventually, she put the talisman in the box and made a swift escape. She couldn't help but chuckle as she retreated safely. This was the best-kept secret in the world, and only she knew that it was a massive prank."},{"question":"I recently became the band leader in my adult band and I want to give our band a new and unique name. Can you come up with some band names using each of the special characters here: !@#%^&* (each rock band name should use each special character once). We like to sing about drinking together with friends and our genre is country music, if that helps.","answer":"Not a problem! With consideration to your band's genre and theme of music, here are some band names that use each of those special characters: !@#%^&*1) Dr!nkn'This name is a play on words for one of the popular themes in country music: drinking. The exclamation point also represents the surprise and excitement of drinking with your friends. In terms of art, the exclamation point may also symbolize someone on their head, upside down, symbolizing the wacky adventures that may proceed during a night of drinking.2) @L@B@M@This name substitutes all the letter A's in the word \\"Alabama\\", with the special character, \\"@\\". Having multiple instances of this special character may create a neat illusion of the band's name swirling and spinning.3) NeedleInA#This name mimics the common saying of, \\"looking for a needle in a haystack\\". The word \\"needle\\" is a double entendre and may refer to an actual needle of a record player or a physical needle, while the word \\"haystack\\" was replaced with the special character \\"#\\", loosely resembling a compressed haystack. Haystacks are also commonly found on farms and in barns.4) outhwampWith many southern states in America having swamps as part of their geographic terrain, this band name references that landscape while replacing the letter S's in \\"SouthSwamp\\", with the special character, \\"\\". The special character also may resemble a slithering snake, an animal commonly found in swamplands.5) 100%HennesseySimilar to the band name Dr!nkn', this name references Hennessey, an alcoholic brandy popular in the South. The \\"100%\\" portrays a complete and focused dedication to having fun, going all out, and drinking with friends, which are themes in some popular country music songs.6) Sun^Overalls^This band name interprets the phrase \\"Sun's up, overall's up\\", meaning that at sunrise, a farmer would pull up and wear their overalls to begin their day on the farm. The word \\"up\\" was replaced with the special character, \\"^\\", symbolizing an up direction pointing north, thus creating the band name, Sun^Overall^.7) Moon&ShineSimilar to Dr!nkn' and 100%Hennessey, this band name references moonshine, a high-proof whiskey, traditionally made illegally, especially in the South where it continues to remain popular. This band name bifurcates the word \\"moonshine\\" into two independent words, moon, and shine, reattached with the special character, \\"&\\", and pronounced simply: moonshine.8) Southern*This band name takes the name \\"Southern Star\\" and replaces the word \\"Star\\" with the special character, \\"*\\", resembling a star in the night sky. Although Southern Star is not intentionally referencing anything in particular, the stresses on the consonants make the pronunciation of this band name easy and fun to say, with intentional stress placed on the \\"S\\" letters in this band name."},{"question":"Write a memo for a group of office workers about broken bathrooms.

Use the activity name as the title and put the information in paragraphs. Use a friendly chatty tone and write using the second person pronouns.","answer":"Certainly! Here is a list of four fun things to do in the Moroccan Sahara desert.Discover Desert WildlifeMany animals and reptiles call the Sahara Desert home such as the desert fox and the desert mouse. These normally shy animals are hard to spot but they can be lured out of their dens and their burrows with food. Save some of your food from dinner and place it somewhat away from the campfire. Animals are quick to sniff out a meal and will gladly follow the scent back to camp. Stay quiet and be patient and you may get some great pictures of a desert fox up close!Surf the DunesDesert dunes not only look like water waves but can be surfed as well. Decide whether you want to ski, surf or snowboard down the dune then grab your board and walk up to the top. The ride down a steep dune is fast and matches the fun of surfing on a wave. You can stand up on the board or sit down and enjoy the ride. You'll want to bring your own board or rent one before setting out to the dunes. And remember to bring your hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and plenty of water to drink. Deserts are hot!Spa Break Desert StyleIf you're tired and sore from sand surfing and camping, you can find relief in a sand bath. Akin to the mud baths found in day spas, sand baths are said to ease aches and pains and restore your peace of mind. At the small village of Merzouga, which is near the Moroccan-Algerian border, you can join the locals in an early morning sand bath. After digging a hole in one of the dunes, you lie covered in sand and watch the beautiful sunrise for a maximum of 30 minutes. Watch the StarsIt's quiet out in the desert. Deafeningly so. It's also inky dark so the stars shine brightly in the night sky. There's no light pollution to interfere with the view or traffic noise to bombard your ears. Just watch as dusk gives way to night and the stars take center stage. In addition to stars, you can see planets and identify constellations. Downloading a  star-gazing app is a great way to identify what you're seeing in the night sky. "},{"question":"Write an intro for a food blog.

Make sure that it doesn't require too many supplies and can be played over Zoom or in person.","answer":"Sure!  Here is a list of 3 ice-breaker activities for work that can be played over Zoom or in person:1. Two Truths and One Lie: This game can take as long as you would like it to, requires no supplies, and is a great way for co-workers to get to know one another. You can go around and have each person share two things that are true about themselves and one thing that is a lie. The rest of the group will then try to guess which of the statements is a lie.2. The One-Word Game: This game is very easy and requires no supplies to do. Split a group of people up into smaller groups. You will then ask each group a question that they can answer with only one word. The questions should be centered around ways to get to know one another within the context of the company. Give the groups some time to come up with an answer and then report once the time is up.  Some examples can include: \\"What is the company culture here?\\" or \\"What's your favorite part of the day?\\" You can use the breakout room function of Zoom to break groups up.3. Find 10 Things in Common: This icebreaker is great for small or large groups and requires no supplies. Start by breaking the group into smaller groups and ask them to find 10 (non-obvious) things that everyone in that group has in common. You can use the breakout room function in Zoom if needed. This game is great because it's simple and helps people learn many things about one another and find commonalities. "},{"question":"After reading the text, what, if any, benefits are there for an owl to have darker feathers on the volcanic islands?It’s possible that sulfur-driven colors provide benefits to the owls, Romano says. Volcanic islands are often thick with vegetation supported by dark, fertile soil. Darker feathers might help the predatory owls disappear into their forest surroundings. The owls might also avoid the toxic effect of high sulfur exposure by shuttling a glut of sulfur into making more pheomelanin. Melanin has been previously tied to detoxifying pollutants in sea snakes, for instance (SN: 8/14/17). ","answer":"Darker feathers on the owls could help the birds blend better into the dark forest surroundings."},{"question":"Come up with some ideas for hiking around Leavenworth, WA.

Eight Mile Lake: Eight Mile Lake has great views of the mountains and there are two lakes along the way: Little Eight Mile Lake and     Eight Mile Lake. While it is considered an easy hike, be aware that it is 7 miles roundtrip, takes approximately 4 hours to hike, and     is mostly uphill the first half of the hike. Bring your snacks and bathing suit because Eight Mile Lake is a fantastic place for a     picnic and swim!2. Icicle Gorge: An easy, mostly flat loop of 3.5 miles (approx. 2 hours) that follows along both banks of the scenic Icicle River.     Halfway through the hike, you will be delighted to find a bridge crossing over a roaring creek. Many hikers stop here to take in the     cool breezes generated by this powerful creek.3. Merrit Lake: A steep, partially exposed, dry trail that has a big payoff at the end: a gorgeous lake surrounded by    steep mountains and lovely fields. The lake was named after the town of Merrit which was one of the first Eastern Cascade stops     along the Great Northern Railway.

Daylilies are relatively drought-tolerant, but they grow best with around 1 inch of water per week. Fertilize once in the spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer according to the product's instructions.

I used that a lot, and now I'm stuck.","answer":"The \`uu\` library in Python was deprecated in 3.11 and removed in 3.13 because it used an outdated format. The uuencode format that the library was built to handle was made for emails in the 1980s, and the encoding no longer applies to many modern email formats or other files. It has been replaced by MIME and yEnc, and attempting to use it with those file formats may cause errors or data loss.Despite that, you aren���t stuck! There is a workaround and an alternative modern library that you can use in its place:1. Open the file directly, using \`ab\`, \`rb\`, or \`wb\` mode if you are on a Windows device to open in binary format to append, read, or write, respectively. The code for that might look like this: \`f = open(���file.txt���, ���rb���)\`.2. Use the \`base64\` library. It has similar encoding and decoding capabilities that can handle ASCII characters and binary, allowing similar functionality to the \`uu\` library without the concerns of failure due to the use of outdated formatting.Let me know if you need more information about opening the file directly or if you���d like me to teach you about the \`base64\` library!"},{"question":"I recently found my old Lego bricks and also discovered a program that allows me to design Lego creations on the computer so that I can order whichever pieces I need. I’d like to make everything awesome for my son, so I want to design a spaceship for him that’s completely unique. I think I know the general shape of spaceship he’d like, but can you give me pointers on techniques or features that would make it a good fit for a 6-year-old?","answer":"-\\tTry to make your construction very structurally sound. Unless there’s no other way, always try to connect parts and features to the larger structure at multiple points. That way they don’t easily pop off if your child drops it or brings the spaceship in for a hard landing. Your physical bricks will be helpful in testing this out; it’s hard to evaluate the structural stability of a digital Lego model.-\\tCreate play features. The Lego company consistently cites play features as their test-audiences’ favorite aspects. There are lots of great options on fictional spaceships. Try an opening cockpit and a separate opening cargo bay. If it’s large enough, consider a module that separates to become a ground vehicle or which opens up as a garage for a rover. If there’s enough volume, create a playable interior for the pilot, complete with a bed, kitchen, laboratory, etc. Or take a page out of old Lego designs and construct the ship as a series of detachable modules that can be mixed and matched. Play features are limited only by your imagination and available parts.-\\tConsider the way your child may view certain features. Antennas may become laser guns or missiles. A minor round detail could be a refueling port or an oxygen recharging station. He may choose to tuck his favorite Lego dog into a bit of unused space in the design. Don’t be afraid to add detailing that doesn’t clearly serve a purpose to you but that could be assigned a function in your child’s imagination.-\\tIf possible, work with a consistent color palate. This isn’t a must, of course, and often depends on part availability, but it can be a nice touch that makes your creation seem professional. It will look like it belongs in the same universe as the official Space Police and Blacktron sets. Plus, if you can work in your child’s favorite colors, you’ll likely score extra points.

Name five venomous underwater animals and tell me a bit about them.","answer":"1. Lionfish These fish have venomous spines along their backs for protection. Lionfish are slow swimmers, so they need envenomation as protection against larger, more predatory sea creatures. For humans, lionfish stings are rarely fatal unless there’s an extreme allergic reaction to the venom. However, the sting is still tremendously painful and causes diarrhea, extreme nausea, and headaches. 2. Sea Snakes One of the most venomous aquatic animals in the world, sea snakes are often reluctant to bite unless severely threatened. However, their one drop of venom is potent enough to kill an adult human. 3. Cone Snails Cone snails use a venomous harpoon for both protection and prey. They are extremely slow movers, so envenomation is their only hope for caching meals of marine worms, small fish, and mollusks. These snails have bright shells with intricate, unique patterns, which can be a detriment to humans. One dose of harpoon venom has the potential to internally damage, or even kill, hundreds of people. 4. Stonefish The stonefish looks like a rock, which means swimmers in the Indian and Pacific Oceans often step on these fish by mistake. The fish is covered with venomous spikes that shove venom into whatever it comes into contact with. Their stings are excruciating and can be fatal to humans. 5. Flower Urchin One of the most dangerous urchins on the planet, flower urchins are covered in venomous stingers. One touch can lead to paralysis of muscles, lips, and eyes, but the pain diminishes quickly, typically in 15 minutes or less. However, an extreme allergic reaction can result in hospitalization or death for humans.

Canada - The most popular dog breed in Canada is the Labrador Retriever. The Labrador Retriever has been Canada’s favorite pet dog breed for over 20 years! This popular pet breed is well known for being friendly, obedient, and highly adaptable family pets.

"},{"question":"Classify this review as either positive or negative and explain your response: I bought the audiobook for my book club, which I highly recommend. Zauner voices it herself and you can hear the emotion in her retelling so well, and it's a huge bonus to hear the Korean pronunciation if you're not Korean yourself. Overall I thought this book was very real, and showed all of the lovely parts of her relationship with her mother and the pain alongside it. I loved the food motif throughout the book and think many people will find it relatable. I love Korean food, but for a few people this was their first introduction to the cuisine and culture, and it got them to try Korean food for the first time. This book will probably make you cry!!The only critique I had of it was I thought it was a little too unstructured. I listened to it with my partner and they found the first opening chapters hard to get into since Zauner starts off with a very wide view of her story/relationship with her mother/her feelings. Once she gets into the chronological-ish parts you get totally roped in. Don't expect a \\"satisfying\\" ending, because there is no \\"close\\" to her story. Her life is obviously ongoing and there are still feelings she's grappling with. It would be impossible to wrap up neatly!","answer":"This is a mostly positive review. The reviewer finds the book authentic in its portrayal of both the good and bad parts in the mother-daughter relationship. They found the food motif relatable and the introduction of Korean cuisine and culture palatable to new audiences. They do critique the initial unstructured chapters but found the story more engrossing once the narrative becomes chronological. The lack of a conclusive ending is acknowledged as an ongoing reflection of the author's life and emotions."},{"question":"Write 3 paragraphs on the topic of SEO.

Instead of quoting celebrities, please select 5 pieces of advice that are universally agreed upon. The blog post should be written in the third person and in a casual yet informational tone. The audience are young adults with aspirations in TV or film. The introduction should consist of 2 short paragraphs. And make sure one of the items on your list highlights how none of the best filmmakers (Spielberg, Tarantino, etc.) have ever attended film school.","answer":"It's been said that we live in the golden age of television. And yet, breaking into the industry has never been more challenging. Before even landing a paying gig, filmmakers are expected to master cinematography, sound, camera work, script development, editing, and more. The good news is that today's most successful filmmakers are eager to share their secrets. If you have Hollywood aspirations, you'd be wise to heed their advice. Here are five must-know tips for aspiring filmmakers:1. Film school won't boost your career.Sure, theater or film school graduates have some valuable technical knowledge. But according to Hollywood titans like Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin Tarantino, a diploma isn't your ticket to stardom. Each of these legendary filmmakers is completely self-taught.2. Don't be afraid of being typecast. While everyone aspires to be a writer, director, or producer, it may be wise to spend some time in one of the many crucial behind-the-scenes roles. As long as you're working on set, you're gaining valuable experience. So don't skip jobs in departments like PR, costume, sound, location, etc.3. Build your portfolio, not your resumeThe most common piece of advice given by filmmakers is some variation of \\"show, don't tell\\". Don't wait for the right moment or the right team - just get a camera and start shooting. Your resume will not be nearly as important to producers as your portfolio.4. Don't watch movies, study them.Quentin Tarantino famously said, \\"I didn't go to film school, I went to movies.\\" Instead of just watching a movie, try to see it from the filmmaker's perspective. Spend time researching the team's interviews, watching the director's commentary, and studying the concepts they discuss. 5. Networking is KeyOne thing has remained true throughout the history of show business. It's not what you know, it's who you know. Developing a strong and diverse professional network should be a top priority for any aspiring filmmaker. And the best way to connect with people in the industry is to network at events for up-and-coming writers, producers and directors. In a few years, these people could be your first collaborators."},{"question":"Describe a ferocious storm. Outline the storms progression from light rain to deluges of rain. Mention the rain, wind, lightning and thunder. End with the sun coming out and a rainbow appearing in the sky. Use first-person narrative. ","answer":"I watched from my window as dark, angry storm clouds gathered in the sky. They looked like a legion of soldiers preparing for a great battle in the heavens.Raindrops began to fall. They were gentle at first, tapping on the window. However, they grew increasingly intense as the minutes passed and soon deluges of water were cascading from the sky, beating onto the ground and hammering against my window ferociously.The wind whistled through the trees at first, but then as it strengthened, it sounded more like a pack of hungry wolves. It started tearing and ripping at the leaves and branches, sending them spiraling through the air with unrelenting force. I gasped as I watched my neighbour's dustbin go flying down the road and disappear from my line of vision. I noticed a fence panel was missing - gone - just like that. Illuminated forks of lightning sliced the dark sky in half, with blinding flashes. They were as brilliant as full sunlight, everything was lit up for the world to see for a few moments. I had never seen such a display of terrible, awesome power.Claps of thunder boomed. The storm was directly overhead. The noise was deafening. It reverberated through the air, making me shiver.The storm raged on ferociously. I peeped out from behind the curtains of my bedroom window. I felt a mixture of awe at the power of nature, but also trepidation at its sheer untameable power.After what seemed like an eternity, the storm finally began to calm down. The rain slowed to a gentle drizzle, the wind subsided, and the sound of thunder became just a low rumble in the distance. The storm was moving on, ready to demonstrate its power elsewhere.I opened my window and leaned out, taking long, deep breaths of the crisp, clean air, and marveled at how the garden glistened with raindrops. The world looked refreshed.The first rays of sun glinted from behind the clouds and the muted colours of a faint rainbow began to appear in the heavens."},{"question":"I heard someone use the term \\"mob mentality\\" when referring to riots.

CGI animals aside, it has a great 90's aesthetic reminiscent of films like Home Alone, a great score and amazing performances by most of the cast, especially the main man Robin Williams. What surprised me the most however, is how surprisingly terrifying it is, especially compared to the newer \\"sequels\\" (which are decent films but hold no candle to the original).What separates the newer films from the original?My biggest gripe with the newer films is that they seem relatively inconsequential to the real world as opposed to the original. In the 95' film with every turn the players risk destruction, their lives, everything basically. There are real stakes and great tension since you know that by rolling the dice, they put themselves and the others in further danger. Their house gets absolutely destroyed, overgrown with vegetation and killer plants and hell, the whole town becomes a mess due to the wild animals and gigantic mosquitos sending people to the hospital.The story feels incredibly personal because every character has their baggage, Bonnie Hunt treated as a crazy person for 26 years and having PTSD to the day they first played the game, the kids having their parents die 6 months earlier and Robin Williams obviously disappearing into the jungle as a kid and having to survive by himself for 26 years. The villain being played by Alan's father is also genius, since he is a person he seems to fear a lot before realizing he has to confront him as he confronted all of his fears by the end of the film.Maybe I'm overthinking it but imo it's one of the best and most terrifying family adventure films out there.","answer":"Jumanji is a movie that you can watch again and again and you will always like it. The way it looks is like other movies that were made in the 1990s, like Home Alone. There's great music in it and the actors all do a great job, especially the lead actor whose name is Robin Williams. In some ways, though, the movie can be a bit scary.Newer films are different from the older films, like Jumanji. It seems like, in the newer films, the people in them are not affected by real-world problems. In the film from 1995, there are risks that the characters take that could affect their lives and everything else. The characters seem to worry more because they are facing dangers. Their house is not doing well. Same for the whole town. All because of the wild animals.Sometimes it feels like the story is happening to me when I watch the film. Bonnie Hunt is treated in not a very nice way for a long time, like 26 years, and she is really affected by playing the game. The kids are not with their parents and Robin Williams kind of grows up in the jungle by himself for 26 years. There's a bad guy in the film who is played by Alan's father. He is a person that seems to be afraid a lot. But he has to face his fears in the end.I think that maybe I'm thinking about this movie too much. It's still one of the best and kinda scary family adventure films out there though."},{"question":"Come up with a short story about a couple watching a shooting star in the night sky, and making a wish for something...unexpected.","answer":"Once upon a time, a young man and woman were sitting on a mountaintop, hand in hand, watching the night sky. The couple admired the constellations and had a shared dream of riding a spaceship through the universe.One night, the couple sat on the mountaintop and watched the stars twinkling and glowing in the sky. As they did so, they caught a glimpse of a shooting star coming from their left and streaking right in a parabolic arc across the night sky. As the star completed its course, the man and woman looked at each other and said the same thing: \\"Did you make a wish?\\" When they both said this to each other, they smiled and laughed in a seemingly knowing way. They did make a wish, one that they had hoped would come true since they first began their nighttime tradition. They decided to leave the mountain to prepare more thoroughly for tomorrow night's event.The next night, the couple went up to the mountaintop, but this time they brought backpacks with them. In the backpacks were necessities like a change of clothing, toiletries, and some snacks and water. They took their seat on the mountaintop and began watching the stars. They watched intently for several hours as they appeared to be waiting for something. And then, just before midnight, they saw what they were looking for: a shooting star coming from their left and streaking right in a parabolic arc across the night sky. The couple decided it was time, so they lay on the ground, holding hands, and closed their eyes. In a great big flash of light, the couple disappeared, their bodies vaporized by the ethereal light that shone from the shooting star. The couple had made it onto their spaceship, which was disguised as the shooting star. They were now able to travel the universe forever."},{"question":"Give me the years and album title of each Radiohead album in chronological order.","answer":"Here is a list of each Radiohead album in chronological order:1. 1993 - Pablo Honey: Radiohead's debut studio album. 2. 1995 - The Bends: Released on 13 March 1995, this is the band's second studio album.3. 1997 - OK Computer: Radiohead's third studio album, it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. 4. 2000 - Kid A: Reaching number-one album on the Billboard 200, it was Radiohead's fourth studio album.5. 2001 - Amnesiac: This was Radiohead's fifth studio album and was recorded between January 1999 – April 2000. 6. 2003 - Hail to the Thief: The final album with their former record company EMI, it was the band's sixth studio album.7. 2007 - In Rainbows: Their seventh album was self-released as a pay-what-you-want download.8. 2001 - The King of Limbs: Regarded as the best album of the year by multiple music publications, it was their eighth studio album. 9. 2016 - A Moon Shaped Pool: Radiohead's ninth album was recorded in London, their studio in Oxford, and the La Fabrique studio in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France."},{"question":"It hasn't rained in quite a while where I am, and my kids are starting to worry.

It’s a journey through her past, starring all the different Taylors she’s ever been, which means all the Taylors that you’ve ever been. Taylor always designs every tour to be the best night of your life. But she designed this one to be the best night of all your lives. Every Era you’ve ever lived through, it’s in here. She does 46 songs, plus snippets of a few more. That means this show has 22 percent of her songbook, and don’t even imagine she didn’t plan it that way.This weekend I spent three consecutive nights at these shows, singing and weeping and suffering and agonizing through an emotional epic Tay-pocalypse every night. But it feels brutal that it’s over so soon. Nobody wanted it to stop. Not even Taylor, who paused on Sunday night at her piano during “Champagne Problems” to rave, “If you think I’m just coasting along thinking this is normal, I can assure you this is not the case. This is extraordinary.”","answer":"Last Friday night in Jersey Taylor Swift yelled, \\"Welcome to the Eras Tour!\\" She went on to say “There is one thing that I daydream about with the childlike enthusiasm of a hundred birthday parties, and that is MetLife Stadium Night 1.” Taylor Swift Went on to perform for a total of 83,000 extremely excited fans. The shows were so fun and full of lots of joy! Taylor included many songs we had been waiting to hear for a long time. Taylor Swift designed this tour to be the best night of everyone's lives, representing all the different times we have lived through. She sang 46 songs, about 22 percent of her entire songbook. It was an emotional experience, and Taylor herself expressed how extraordinary it was."},{"question":"Write me a caption of no more than 10 words about celebrating my cat's birthday and make it funny.","answer":"\\"Meow's the time to paw-ty!\\""},{"question":"I want to lose weight, summarize the new weight-loss findings in this article:\\"A REVOLUTION IN weight loss is apparently underway. It started in 2021, when the FDA approved the diabetes drug semaglutide for weight loss. The weekly injectable—sold under the brand name Wegovy—can help users lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight, leading commentators to describe the drug as both a “medical breakthrough” and a “silver bullet” for obesity. Elon Musk says he’s taking it, Kim Kardashian is rumored to be using it, and everyone from Hollywood to the Hamptons reportedly wants a prescription.  Soon, there will be a new weight loss medication on the block—and it’s even more potent than its peers. Last fall, the FDA fast-tracked the review process for using tirzepatide as a weight loss drug after a clinical trial showed that people with BMIs labeled “overweight” or “obese” lost a staggering 22.5 percent of their body weight on the highest dose. If all goes according to plan, that will make Mounjaro the latest in a fast-growing biomedical sector—spanning everything from bariatric surgery to deep brain stimulation for binge-eating—that aims to combat, if not cure, the problem of “excess” weight. For pharmaceutical companies, the race to market is financially motivated: Wegovy and Mounjaro cost more than 1,000 a month. Weight loss drugs are rarely covered by insurance, but people who can afford them have proven they’re willing to pay. And the market seems effectively limitless: Despite an ongoing “war on obesity,” more than 1.9 billion adults globally are considered overweight or obese, and the number of prospective users is growing every year. Now doctors—desperate to treat what is widely seen as an “obesity epidemic”—are coming on board. In January, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended such medications for kids as young as 12.  The victorious narratives gilding drugs like Mounjaro are already being positioned as a direct challenge to fat activism. For decades, the movement has pushed for social and economic opportunity for people of all sizes through civil rights, fat pride and liberation, and biomedical evidence itself. Thanks to prominent voices like Aubrey Gordon and Michael Hobbes, many people now know that “lifestyle changes” like calorie restriction and exercise fail to produce sustained weight loss for 97 percent of people and that many dieters end up gaining back more weight than they lost. But what happens to the strength of these arguments when a weight loss drug seems to work?Like other purported weight loss solutions, Mounjaro promises “to fix weight stigma by making you thinner, instead of removing the stigma,” says Susanne Johnson, a fat activist and family nurse practitioner in Pennsylvania. In so doing, these drugs and surgeries further exacerbate anti-fat discrimination. Instead of criticizing people in larger bodies for their perceived lack of willpower—that old “calories in, calories out” adage—people can now blame those in bigger bodies for something more akin to a techno-pessimist, or even anti-science, stance: “Just take the miracle cure!” \\"","answer":"The weight-loss findings in the article are the following:A new injectable drug (called Wegovy) has been called a \\"silver bullet\\" for weight loss and has the potential for the user to lose between 5-10% of their body weight. Another drug called tirezpatide showed a 22.5% decrease in body weight in its clinical trial (currently being fast-tracked by the FDA). However, both of these drugs can cost upwards of 1000 a month (weight-loss drugs are usually not covered by insurance)."},{"question":"Create a news article about the Seattle Mariners winning the 2023 World Series","answer":"Seattle Mariners Win the 2023 World Series ChampionshipSeattle, WA - The Seattle Mariners have done the impossible. After a long and arduous season, they have emerged victorious as World Series Champions of 2023 in a stunning upset victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mariners had a difficult road to the championship, beginning the season 12-16 and fighting off numerous early injuries. By the time June came around, the team did as well, thanks to their talented roster and fierce determination. Led by star pitcher George Kirby and rising star outfielder Jarred Kelenic, the Mariners fought their way through the playoffs, winning series after series and never giving up hope.The World Series itself was one of the best in years. While most prognosticators considered the Cardinals to be the better team on paper, Seattle showed themselves up to the challenge. After St. Louis won the first two games at home, Seattle showed its heart in winning 3 straight in Seattle. St. Louis forced a game 7 with a dramatic extra-inning win, but in the end, Seattle's bats were just too much. Cal Raleigh and Kelenic both homered in the deciding game, an 8-4 Seattle win that was never in doubt.As the final out was recorded and the players rushed the field in celebration, Mariners fans across the city erupted in cheers and tears of joy. For the fans who suffered through decades of mediocrity (or worse) at both the Kingdome and T-Mobile Park, it was a moment they had been waiting for their entire lives.For the players themselves, the victory was a chance to exhale and celebrate with the city. \\"It was never about talent. We knew we had this in us all along,\\" said Kirby, who had dominant starts in games 1, 4, and 7 of the series. \\"We just had to stay focused, play the game, and never stop believing in ourselves.\\"The Mariners' 2023 World Series championship will go down in Seattle sports lore alongside the Seahawks' win in Super Bowl XLVIII. These two moments are pretty clearly the greatest in Seattle sports history. For now, the team and their fans throughout the Pacific Northwest will wait to judge where they fit in that bigger picture. For now, the party will come first."},{"question":"Write a poem about the beauty of a sunset, using sensory details such as colors, sounds, and feelings. Describe its beauty as a divine sight.

Here is the text to draw your summary from.Another factor in the game’s favor is its accessibility. Players only need to know three controls — running, jumping and grabbing — meaning it’s much easier for newcomers to learn how to play. This, combined with consumers’ search for escapism during the coronavirus pandemic, has helped broaden the game’s appeal.“Fall Guys has really flourished in this environment because, at its core, it is a simple, family-friendly game,” Louise Shorthouse, games industry analyst at Omdia, told CNBC. “Unlike traditional, violent battle royale titles, Fall Guys appeals to all ages, and is approved by parents.”Then there’s the virality of Fall Guys on streaming platforms like Amazon’s Twitch and Google’s YouTube, as well as social media. The game was watched more than Fortnite across Twitch, YouTube and Facebook last month, according to esports intelligence firm Stream Hatchet, racking up 118.5 million hours of watchtime versus Fortnite’s 106.3 million between Aug. 4 and Aug. 28.","answer":"Fall Guys' success can largely be attributed to the simplistic, family-friendly style of gameplay that doesn't feature complex controls or mechanics. The time of release is also a significant factor in the game's popularity, with the game serving as a welcome relief from stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic, broadening its scope of influence. The game has also been massively popular on streaming sites such as Twitch and YouTube, as well as social media sites like Facebook."},{"question":"Where did Parmesan cheese originally come from? Is there a place called Parmesan?","answer":"Parmesan cheese, which is more accurately named Parmigiano Reggiano, was first made by monks in the  Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and Mantova provinces of Italy as these religious orders began to revitalize the land left abandoned by the Roman occupation. Eventually, these medieval monks had an excess of milk they needed to store before it spoiled. Thus, Parmesan cheese was invented around the mid-1200s. However, how people define parmesan cheese differs by geographical location. In Italy, Parmesan Reggiano must be aged for over a year, made with unprocessed milk, and grated before consumption. However, 'parmesan cheese' may refer to any hard, shredded Italian cheese in America. "},{"question":"What was the Mariel boatlift? When did it happen and why? What was the effect of the Mariel boatlift?","answer":"The Mariel boatlift was a mass emigration of Cubans who traveled from Cuba's Mariel Harbor to the United States between 15 April and 31 October 1980. The Cuban government organized acts of repudiation against those who wished to leave the island. Mobs would sometimes beat their targets, force them to walk around with accusatory signs on their necks or trash their homes.Castro, trying to stop the unrest, opened the port of Mariel, west of Havana, to any residents who wanted to leave. The Cuban government facilitated an emigration process that gave special privileges to those who were socially undesirable. People deemed \\"homosexual\\" would be allowed to leave the country. Those with gender non-conforming behavior were especially targeted by authorities for departure.From April until October, some 125,000 Cuban immigrants crossed the Florida Straits to the United States.The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled."},{"question":"Help write my resume to be a social media manager.

He was an energetic and playful pup who loved nothing more than playing fetch with his owner, Jessica. One day, as they were heading out to the park to play ball, something strange happened. Buddy suddenly found himself walking on two legs, and he looked down to realize that he was now the owner, and Jessica was the dog! He didn't know how this had happened, but he didn't care - he was excited to play fetch in a whole new way. Buddy grabbed the ball and tossed it, and Jessica went racing after it, tail wagging happily. As they played, Buddy started to notice how hard it was to walk on two legs. His balance was off, and his feet hurt. He couldn't bark or wag his tail, and he felt trapped in his new body. Jessica, on the other hand, seemed to be having the time of her life. She ran and jumped and caught the ball in her mouth, all while barking joyfully. She didn't seem to mind being a dog at all. Eventually, Buddy grew tired and asked Jessica to stop playing. He missed being a dog, with his four legs and wagging tail. He couldn't wait to return to his old body. And then, just as suddenly as it had happened, Buddy found himself back in his own body. He looked at Jessica and barked excitedly, ready to play ball once again.

It's not a very pleasant feeling and it makes me upset sometimes. When I'm hungry, my tummy feels empty and makes all these weird noises. It asks for food, and if I don't get something to fill it soon, I start crying and get fussy. Sometimes, I can't even concentrate on anything else because I'm so hungry.When I'm tired, my eyes begin to close on their own. I get sleepy and yawn a lot. I don't want to play or do anything; all I want is to snuggle up in my cozy blankets and take a nap. Sometimes, I might even get a little grumpy because I just can't keep my eyes open. So you see, being a hungry tired baby is tough. I can't tell anyone how I feel - I just have to cry and hope someone understands. But when I do get some food or a nap, I feel so much better. It's the best feeling in the world and I'm happy again!"},{"question":"I am planning a trip to Cape Town in December. Please give me a list of places I can visit or activities I can do.

Be sure to include several good ways of drying various types of fruit. Include many types of fruit that would be good for drying.","answer":"Bulk Dried fruit can be produced economically by purchasing large quantities of fresh fruit at discounted prices. There are many types of fresh fruit that are excellent for drying. These are delicious to eat, but can also be used in fruit gift baskets. They include:- Apples and plums- Berries and bananas- Apricots and coconut- Papaya and pineappleThere are a number of different procedures for drying fruit. One of the most natural ways of drying fruits is simply to lay them out in the sun. Fruit should be cleaned, dried, and laid on a lined cookie sheet in direct sunlight. Arrange the pieces where there’s plenty of room for air to circulate around them. This process can take several days so it’s important to place them in a location where insects can’t get to them.You can also find drying ovens online that are specially designed for this process. These are electric units that have several plastic racks stacked vertically. This process uses low temperatures to gradually dry all the water out of the fruit. It can take all day for the process to complete. Some fruits may take up to 48 hours for the drying process to complete so it's best to place these racks out of the way so they are not disturbed till drying is complete."},{"question":"Hello Chatbot.

As the heat of the summer's day subsided and the sun began to set, a sound was heard down by the pond. The singing of peeper frogs filled the air. But one frog's voice stood out from all the others. Polly, a young peeper frog loved to sing. She was always the first to start singing and the last to stop. It sometimes annoyed the other frogs, but some of them were just jealous of her voice. Polly had a dream though. Ever since she was a little tadpole, she would watch the stars at night and listen to the other frogs sing. She thought they were singing to the stars, but that maybe the stars couldn't hear them. She always told herself when she grew up, she'd sing so loud they'd be sure to hear her. Polly belted out her song in the night, the other frogs joining in her song. She watched the stars as she sang, and noticed one star seemed to twinkle more than usual.

Jace was known throughout the kingdom as the greatest spell caster that ever lived. Instead of using his power to fight or travel, he dedicated his life to teaching others who shared the passion and dedication to learn spellcasting as he did. Over the years, he trained countless apprentices, all from various backgrounds. No matter who or where they came from, Jace always treated them equally and with the same care they all deserved.Over the years, he proved to be a tough yet patient teacher of the magic arts. He knew everyone was capable but everyone learned at their own pace, so he adjusted to his students well. One day, a young girl named Anna who had lost her family had shown up, determined to channel her sorrow into something that could benefit others. Jace happily took her under his wing, and she proved to be an exceptional student. Anna spent countless hours, excelling and surpassing every other apprentice that Jace had taught.Eventually, as Jace was getting older over the next decade, he knew there was very little more to teach Anna. Anna was already becoming a far better wizard than Jace. He also was aware that his time was coming to an end.

Can you give me some ideas for how I can improve my restfulness? I'm a 33-year-old male if that helps. Decent shape, a little overweight but no real medical issues. I just have a hard time getting to sleep and staying asleep.","answer":"I can certainly provide some general ideas to help improve your sleep quality. However, if you're experiencing chronic poor sleep, you should contact your healthcare provider to identify and treat any underlying causes. In the meantime, try these suggestions:1. Set a sleep schedule and stick to it -- Healthy adults are recommended to get at least 7 hours of sleep a night, and most don't need more than 8 hours to be well rested. By going to bed and getting up at the same time every day (including weekends), you can make your body's sleep-wake cycle more consistent.2. Monitor your diet -- Going to bed either hungry or overly full can impair sleep quality, so you should try to avoid any heavy meals just before bed. You should also exercise caution with nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol consumption. Nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off, and alcohol can disrupt sleep later in the night.3. Establish a restful environment -- Rooms that are cool, dark, and quiet are more conducive to restful sleep while light-emitting screens tend to be disruptive. You can use earplugs, room-darkening shades, fans, and white noise machines to help construct a suitable sleep space. Utilizing relaxation techniques or taking a bath can also help calm you and prepare you for a good night's sleep.4. Limit naps during the day -- Unless you're working nights and need to make up a sleep debt, you should avoid napping late in the day. If you do take a daytime nap, restrict it to no more than one hour to avoid interference with your nighttime sleep.5. Get regular physical activity -- While you shouldn't be too active close to bedtime when you're trying to wind down, being physically active as part of your daily routine can promote better rest. Spending time outside is a great way to do this and provides other health benefits as well.6. Reduce stress -- Lingering concerns won't do your sleep schedule any favors. One way to deal with these is to journal what's on your mind before bed so you can set it aside for the next day. Meditation can ease anxiety as well, and stress management techniques such as setting priorities, getting organized, and delegating tasks can keep your mental space clear and ready for sleep.Are you interested in learning more about any of these steps?"},{"question":"Write a short story, less than 4 paragraphs, about a small tree in the forest that isn't able to grow because the other trees are crowding it out.

As I felt my roots take hold in the soil and my branches sprouting, I knew that I would tower over all of the other trees in the forest. Yes, I had a long way to go.

They were already bathing in the sun and I could feel the warmth emanating off their canopy of leaves while I shivered. The mighty oaks never wavered in the strong winds as I did.

How could I possibly compete against these Titans?And then, the night of the storm came. Ferocious, the wind howled like one of the forest animals.

It is alarming and unnerving,” said GOP Rep. Andrew Murr, chair of the General Investigating Committee, during his closing statement following hours of debate. The committee recommended 20 counts of impeachment against Paxton.Democrat Rep. Harold Dutton was one of the members voting present. He said the impeachment vote had been rushed. “The process by which we’re getting this done seems to be abbreviated to the point that it just encroaches on due process,” said Dutton.Paxton denied wrongdoing in a Friday news conference, but focused his statements against the impeachment this week on his record as a key opponent of President Joe Biden. Paxton’s office has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Biden administration.The now-suspended attorney general called the impeachment a “politically motivated sham” in a statement just minutes after the vote.“The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,” he said.Paxton said he was never given a chance to present evidence refuting the findings of an investigation that he abused his office. He has cast House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican who presides over a chamber where his party currently holds 85 seats to Democrats’ 64, as a “liberal.” He continued his attack on Phelan saying, “Phelan’s coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden Administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations.”The Office of the Attorney General issued its own “comprehensive report” about the allegations following the impeachment vote, saying it “unequivocally refutes incorrect testimony” against Paxton. The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general’s office.Republican Governor Greg Abbott can appoint a provisional replacement while Paxton is temporarily suspended. Paxton would be reinstated if he is acquitted at his Senate trial.The impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve 3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office.That investigation led the committee – a five-member panel investigating corruption in state government – to approve 20 articles of impeachment Thursday, setting up the vote in the full House.During the debate Saturday, Rep. Charlie Geren, who is a Republican, claimed Paxton had threatened fellow House members.“I would like to point out that several members of this House, while on the floor of this House doing the state’s business, received telephone calls from General Paxton personally threatening them with political consequences in their next election,” Geren said.Opponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. “I don’t think today is about whether there’s guilt or innocence. It’s about the process,” said Rep. Tony Tinderholt.“I’m not here to defend Ken Paxton,” Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, “What you’re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.”Paxton’s impeachment is a stunning rebuke of a Republican official in a state where the GOP controls all levers of state government. Voters in Texas shrugged off the swirling scandals around Paxton last year, handing him a third term in November’s election. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff.Paxton has long been a controversial figure who has clashed with Texas legislative leadership. A conservative who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, he led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election.He retains support within the Texas GOP. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a “sham impeachment.”“The voters have supported General Paxton through three elections – and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,” Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the “principled leadership” of the Senate to “restore sanity and reason for our state.”In Texas, no attorney general has ever been impeached and removed from office. The only two elected officials to lose office as a result of impeachment were Gov. James Ferguson in 1917 and District Judge O.P. Carrillo in 1975.For Paxton to be removed from office, two-thirds of the Texas Senate’s members who are present will have to vote to convict him. His wife, Angela Paxton, is a state senator representing a Dallas-area district.It’s not yet clear when the Senate, where Republicans have a 19-12 majority over Democrats, will conduct its trial. The state’s legislative session is scheduled to end Monday.","answer":"The Texas House of Representatives has shockingly voted to impeach third-term Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton.Despite the people voting him back into office time and again, a collection of peers have now stripped the will of the citizens.

Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P.

Paxton has long been close with former President Donald Trump, and led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election.

What can I plant so it will still grow well? I don't like parsnips or broad beans.","answer":"Growing your own vegetables is a great idea and there are several varieties that won't mind cold weather in winter:1. Brassicas: Cabbage, bok choy, cauliflower, and broccoli are all great options for winter gardening. Not only do they like cooler temperatures, but they tend to bolt in warm weather so it's better to plant them in autumn.2. Leafy Greens: Spinach, kale, lettuce, and Swiss chard are very hardy vegetables that thrive in cold weather. Plant seeds in early autumn or get seedlings later and you will have fresh vegetables in your garden for most of the winter months.3. Root Vegetables: Radishes, carrots, beetroot, and turnips are all vegetables harvested for their roots, which are very well protected underground. Unless your region gets a lot of snow, these vegetables are a great choice for winter gardening.4. Peas: Snow peas are a wonderful variety that can be grown outside in most weather conditions. Just make sure to sow them in early autumn so they can grow to establish healthy roots before the frosts start.5. Garlic is one of those vegetables that can't be grown at any time of year--winter is the only chance you get. Plant the cloves in autumn and watch them grow throughout the winter months.If you have a greenhouse or solarium, you have even more options with vegetables like tomatoes and peppers thriving well into the winter months. Even without a greenhouse, covering your vegetables with frost cloth can help to make them last longer."},{"question":"Rewrite this and change the text for someone who had a brain injury and has a hard time processing complex sentences, but wants to start gardening as a form of therapy.1. Get to know your gardenBefore you start, it's a good idea to get to know your garden. Check the aspect – is it south-facing or north-facing? Knowing where the sun hits the ground will help you decide what to grow where. It's also worth knowing what soil type you have. Take a look at what's growing – camellias, magnolias and pieris will tell you the soil is acidic, while absence of these suggests a more alkaline soil. Doing a soil test will further help you know your soil, and therefore what plants you can grow.2. Plan your gardenSitting down and planning your garden is a great starting point. This way you can work out what to grow where, rather than getting carried away at the garden centre and ending up with a jumble of plants that don't look good together and might not suit your growing conditions. Planning will also enable you to use colour and structure wisely, which will help you create a garden that looks great throughout the year.3. Learn how to plantPlanting your plants properly will ensure they grow well and live for a long time. Make sure you take time to weed and prepare the soil before planting, and add mulch or fertiliser where necessary. If you're unsure how to plant something, look online for instructions rather than just hoping for the best. Trees planted too deeply will never thrive, and root-balls that sit proud of the soil surface will dry out quickly, leading to the eventual death of the plant.4. Feed and water plants regularlyKnowing when and how to water plants is the difference between them living and dying. As a general rule, water the root ball rather than the leaves, as it's the roots that absorb the water. Soaking the rootball every week is better than watering a little bit every day. Feeding is also important - generally you should be looking at feeding every fortnight during growing season (that's spring and summer), although you will need to feed more if growing in containers.5. Start smallWhen starting a new veg patch or allotment, it can be tempting to take it all on in one go. It's much better to do a little bit at a time. You can easily cover areas you don't want to cultivate with cardboard or black plastic, to stop weeds growing, while you work on a different area.6. Keep an eye on pestsMost garden pests don't do much harm to plants and can be left alone - there are plenty of natural predators that will keep them in check. However, sometimes pest populations can become an infestation, and you need to act. Keeping an eye out for increasing numbers of pests like aphids, slugs and snails, will help keep your plants safe, and save you a lot of heartache.7. Make use of compostComposting kitchen and garden waste is good for the environment, wildlife, your purse and also your garden. Let the waste break down for a year and then use it as a mulch around the base of plants in your garden and veg patch.","answer":"1. Get to know your gardenBefore you start gardening, get to know your garden. Check if it is turned to the north or the south. You have to know where the sun is so you know what to plant in which place. Also, learn what type of soil is in your garden. See what is already growing. If you see plants like camellias, magnolias and pieris the soil is acidic. If you can't see the camellias, magnolias and pieris, you have more alkaline soil. You can do a soil test to know what plants you can grow.2. Plan your gardenSit down and make a plan for your garden. This way you can decide what to grow where. Without a plan, you can get carried away when buying things at the garden center. Without a plan, you may also end up with a lot of plants that don't look good together. If you don't plan things well, you may get plants that do not suit your growing conditions. Planning will also help you to use color and structure wisely. It will help you create a garden that looks great throughout the year.3. Learn how to plantYou must know how to plant your plants right. This way you will ensure they grow well. Take the time to weed and prepare the soil before you plant anything. Add mulch or fertilizer where necessary. If you're unsure how to plant something, look online for instructions. Trees planted too deeply will not thrive. Root balls that sit too high in the soil will dry out quickly and the plant will die.4. Feed and water plants regularlyLearn when and how to water plants. It will help you keep them alive so they don't die. Water the root ball rather than the leaves because it's the roots that absorb the water. Soaking the rootball only once every week is better than watering a little bit every day. Feeding is also important. You should feed your plants every fortnight during spring and summer when they are growing. You will need to feed more if growing in containers.5. Start smallWhen starting a new vegetable patch, do a little bit at a time. Cover areas you don't want to work on with cardboard or black plastic.

I’m done now."},{"question":"My work's family fun day is this weekend, and I'm in charge of planning some kind of game or something that the kids can do. I want to do a few different things though so we aren't doing the same thing over and over for 6 hours. I do have a bit of a budget, so I can buy materials and I already bought stuff to use for prizes or to give away. Can I get some suggestions for things to do?","answer":"Sure thing! Here are some examples of activities you can plan for the family fun day at your work:- Sack racing. Each participant gets a burlap sack that they stand in and race to a finish line by hopping. The first person across the finish line wins.- Water balloon toss. Participants are paired off and each pair gets a water balloon. They toss the water balloon back and forth, taking a step back after each successful toss. The last pair with an intact water balloon wins.- Competitive hopscotch. A hopscotch court can be marked on pavement in chalk or on grass with hoops or ribbons. Participants hop across the court back and forth. When a participant reaches either end, they toss a marker into a space of their competitor's court. The first person to hop into a marked space is out.- Egg balance race. Participants must race through a course while balancing an egg on a small spoon through a course to the finish line. If a person drops their egg, they must go back to the beginning to fetch another egg. The first person to cross the finish line, with an egg intact, wins.- Musical hoops. Similar to musical chairs, the game starts with one fewer hoop than participants laid out in a circle. Another person plays some music as the participants walk around the outside of the circle. They stop the music randomly and then each participant must find a hoop to stand in or else they are out of the game. Then one hoop is removed, and the game continues in this fashion until there is one participant left.Whatever you decide, please remember to wear sun protection, stay hydrated and have fun!"},{"question":"Take these words and tell me what their overall tone is.

So, this kid jumps in the back of my cab, holding a fish bowl with a small fish swimming in it. I asked him, \\"Boy, what's the matter with the fish? A different kinda fish or something?\\" And he says, \\"Nah, man. I won him at the carnival.\\" I couldn't help but chuckle at the thought that he probably had a better chance of winning the lottery than keeping that fish alive for more than a day.But this kid was determined to keep his trophy alive, so he tells me to step on it and take him to the pet store. We arrive, and I dropped him off at the front door. The kid hops out, leaving the fish in the back seat. I'm heading to my parking spot wondering what kind of trouble this kid is getting himself into when all of a sudden, I hear a flopping noise. I turned around and saw that the fish had somehow jumped out of the bowl and was rolling on the floor of my cab.I start to panic, trying to keep control of the car and stay calm. Getting into an accident would just make everything worse. I pull into the closest parking spot and turn around to help the fish. The boy returns from the store, sees the commotion, and jumps back to rescue the fish. He picks it up and puts it back in the bowl but accidentally spills half the water all over the seats. I couldn't believe it, but all I could do was smile and hand the boy a towel to clean up the mess.Eventually, we took the fish to one of the pet stores, and the boy came out with a proper aquarium and all the supplies he needed to keep his new friend alive. And I ended up with a funny story for my fellow cabbies. The moral of the story?

Keep the word count under 300 words.","answer":"If you would like to make some changes to your home’s interior, then a great place to start would be a general cleaning. Once you get each room clean, you can begin to see where you could make improvements. Sometimes, it can be nice to buy new furniture. Sunroom furniture can be used in any room. If this isn't in your budget, then try refurbishing old furniture or replacing cushions. Steam-cleaning furniture can work as well. Below are three more tips to help you improve your home’s interior.Tip OneChanging the room’s paint color can give the room a fresher look. You can paint the entire room or just one wall. Create a feature wall in a room using wallpaper. Colors and designs should look cohesive with the rest of the room’s décor. In small rooms, usually, light colors work better. Dark colors make a room appear smaller and closed in.Tip TwoNew flooring can improve the room’s appearance and make the whole space look better. There are many good choices of flooring, from laminates and hardwoods to marble. If you are working on a strict budget, then you can install flooring yourself. There are many great videos online about how to install different types of flooring. Hardwoods are very popular choices now, but laminates can be more affordable.Tip ThreeAs you continue refurbishing and redoing walls, flooring, and furniture, you may decide to add new drapes as well.

Can you provide me with some tips for potty training?  The more the better, so give me a list of at least 5 but more if possible.","answer":"1. Follow a consistent schedule.  Always feed your dog at the same time every day. This helps to develop a routine of when the dog will need to go outside, and you can anticipate when those times will be.2. Confinement.  When you are in the house, the puppy should either be in a crate or immediately next to you.  An easy way to accomplish this is to attach their leash directly to you - perhaps hook it on your waist. This means the puppy cannot sneak away and have an accident without you noticing.3. Crate.  If you cannot watch your puppy closely, give them time in a crate that is not too large.  Puppies do not like to eliminate where they sleep and should not have an accident in the crate.  Keep the duration of this relatively short during the day, and take the puppy outside to relieve themselves immediately upon leaving the crate. 4. Frequency.  Initially take your puppy outside often - this means after every time the puppy eats or drinks and every 30 minutes to an hour during the day during the early stages of housebreaking.5. Relief area.  If possible, take your puppy to the exact same area to relieve themselves, and only spend 5 minutes outside.  If the puppy does not relieve itself within 5 minutes, go back inside and play for 5 minutes and then go outside and try again.  This helps the puppy to learn that outside is for relieving only and inside is for playing. 6. Cue.  Choose a word or a command to tell your puppy to go to the bathroom. For example \\"Go Potty\\" or \\"Go Busy.\\" Start by saying the command after the puppy has started relieving itself.  In later days, say it before the puppy begins so it can identify what you want it to do.7. Praise.  Always praise your puppy for a job well done.  This can be with a treat or just verbal praise, but get excited and let your puppy know how great it is that they are going to the bathroom where you want them to. 8. No yelling.  When your puppy inevitably has an accident inside the house, do not yell or scold. The dog will not understand why you are upset, and it won't teach them anything.  Simply clean up the mess and vow to watch them more closely the next time.

Your health is what you eatResearch has consistently shown that the Mediterranean diet and other whole food diets are associated with better health and longer lives, and ultraprocessed foods and drinks like soda, chips and fast food, among others, are linked with poor health outcomes such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other diseases.But improving the diet of an individual, let alone a population, is challenging. Whole foods are sometimes less convenient and less tasty for modern lifestyles and preferences. Furthermore, food processing can be beneficial by preventing spoilage and extending shelf life. Whole grain processing in particular extends shelf life by removing the germ and bran that otherwise rapidly spoil. Long-term storage of affordable calories has helped address food insecurity, a primary challenge in public health.Only 5% of the U.S. population gets sufficient fiber, a prebiotic nutrient linked to metabolic, immune and neurologic health. Americans are likely also deficient in phytonutrients, potassium and certain healthy fats linked to lower rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer.","answer":"While research has shown that Mediterranean diets and others with plenty of whole foods are associated with longer, healthier lives, switching to these diets from diets with a lot of heavily processed foods can be difficult.

Format your response as a numbered list.","answer":"Here are some lesser-known locations in Ireland that you may want to visit. 1. Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands (County Galway), is your best choice for snagging all things made from Aran Wool and is the filming location for Golden Globe winner “The Banshees of Inisherin” starring Colin Ferrell. One of its many historical sites, the World Heritage site Dun Aonghasa sits on the edge of a 300-foot cliff, providing an opportunity for some Instagram-worthy photos. For those who enjoy getting close to nature, Aran Island has a rugged coastline and secluded sandy beaches.2. Just 33 miles south of Dublin, Glendalough (County Wicklow) is home to many artists whose paintings and photographs will simply beg to go home with you. Founded in the 6th century, Glendalough provides history buffs with many ruins to explore, including the Round Tower and St. Mary’s Church. Exploration of the area’s lakes and walking trails will satisfy the need to get close to nature.3.  A visit to Kilcar (County Donegal) is required if you are looking for the best in hand-spun yarn and authentic hand-woven tweed made on wooden looms just as it has been done for generations. Once you’ve wrapped yourself in a woolen scarf and cap, make your way to the Stone Fort of Grianán of Aileach.

How can I make new friends?","answer":"I understand starting in a new city can be a new challenge, but don't be discouraged here are some ideas to make new friends:1. Social media: Social media is a great way to connect with new people in your area. For example, if there is a Reddit community for your new city, you can make a post there detailing a little bit about yourself, what you're interested in, and that you'd like to meet some new people. Of course, always exercise caution if and when you decide to meet up with anyone you have been talking to online.2. Befriend colleagues: If you're starting a new job in the city, this is an easy way to meet new people and build friendships. If you have some colleagues that you click with, try asking them if they'd like to hang out outside of work and see how that goes.3. Social events: Going to a large event is a great way to meet new people and maybe even develop friendships. For example, if you have a favorite music artist who is playing a show in your city, turn up a little early and try to strike up conversations with others waiting in line. Your shared love of the artist will already give you a common ground for building a friendship.4. Take up a new hobby: Whether you have an existing hobby or want to take up a new one, it is a good way to meet new people who share your interests. Look online to see if there are any local groups or meet-ups for people who pursue the hobbies you enjoy.5. Friendship apps: Apps aren't just for dating anymore! Many apps revolve around building new platonic friendships, such as Bumble BFF. You can make a profile listing your interests and hobbies and see who you connect with. As always, ensure if you're meeting someone from an app, do it in a safe and neutral environment."},{"question":"Giraffes are known for their incredibly long necks... how many bones are in those necks for adults?

He was drenched in sweat both from the effort of the journey and the humid climate. His clothes were stuck to his skin, but upon opening the cave entrance, he was met with a cool rush of wind. The distant sound of an underground river met his ears as he pressed on deeper into the opening. He scanned the ceiling for anything that might be lurking above. As he explored, the beam of his flashlight uncovered a massive cave. A thick layer of dust hung in the air and drifted across the beam of his light. Massive pillars connected the floor and the ceiling, clearly the work of an architect. All of a sudden, the cave began to tremble, and Barry saw a pair of vertical pupils appear from the darkness. Behind him, a massive snake coiled lazily in front of the door. Before he could process what he was seeing, he was trapped. A massive face appeared before him, golden teeth glimmering in the flashlight's glow. Barry looked behind him. The dragon's tail was half-blocking the entrance, almost as a dare.

Demographics alone cannot explain the scale of this drop. And statistics belie the argument that recent high school graduates are getting jobs instead of going to college: Workforce participation for 16- to 24-year-olds is lower than it was before Covid hit, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, reports.Focus groups and public opinion surveys point to other, less easily solved reasons for the sharp downward trend. These include widespread and fast-growing skepticism about the value of a degree, impatience with the time it takes to get one, and costs that have finally exceeded many people’s ability or willingness to pay.  There has been a significant and steady drop nationwide in the proportion of high school graduates enrolling in college in the fall after they finish school — from a high of 70% in 2016 to 63% in 2020, the most recent year for which the figure is available, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.The decline is even worse in some states, though not all have data for the same periods of time.The proportion of high school graduates in Tennessee who are going directly to college, for example, has fallen to 53% — down 11 percentage points since 2017. In Indiana, it dropped to 53% in 2020, down 12 percentage points from five years earlier and a pace state Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery has called “alarming.”Americans are increasingly dubious about the need to go to college. Fewer than 1 in 3 adults now say a degree is worth the cost, according to a survey by the nonprofit Strada Education Network, which conducts research into and financially supports ways of expanding access to higher education.Meanwhile, months of discussion about whether the Biden administration will forgive all or some student loan debt has had the unintended consequence of reminding prospective learners how much people before them had to borrow to pay for college.So has the fact that many of their parents are still paying back their own student loans.From 2015 to 2019, Americans’ faith in higher education dropped more than their confidence in any other institution measured by the Gallup polling organization — an extraordinary erosion of trust, considering that this list includes the presidency, Congress, big business and the criminal justice system.“There’s anti-elitism, anti-institutionalism, a perception that cost is out of control,” said Stephanie Marken, a partner in Gallup’s education division.The problems have been evident for years, but colleges and universities in general have done little to address them.They continue to advertise prices that few consumers actually pay but that discourage many from applying. They bury students in red tape, which is especially confounding for the increasing number of would-be applicants whose parents never went to college. And they often fail to make clear connections between academic disciplines and careers or keep up with the demands of the fast-moving labor market. A degree does, in fact, still pay off. Workers with bachelor’s degrees earn 67% more than people with only high school diplomas, according to the BLS. More than half of “good jobs” — those with salaries of at least 35,000 for workers under age 45 and 45,000 for people  45 to 64 — call for bachelor’s degrees, the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce estimates.Yet since the start of the pandemic, the proportion of 14- to 18-year-olds who think education is necessary beyond high school has dropped from 60% to 45%, the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation.The pandemic only deepened the fears of students already struggling with self-confidence and skeptical about college, said Thea Cole, who also counsels students for Advise TN. “Their GPAs have suffered. So some of them are, ‘I don’t know if I can get in,’ or, ‘It will be too hard.’ ” Her colleague, Portia Cook, was more blunt: “My kids have a shorter fuse. When things start getting complicated, they’re done.” It’s not only recent high school graduates who are turning their backs on higher education. The number of Americans over 24 who are going for the first time or returning to college has also steadily declined, by 12% in the five years from the spring of 2017 to the just-ended spring semester. The United States has already fallen from second to 16th since 2000 among developed nations in the proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds with bachelor’s degrees. Countries ahead of it have increased their bachelor’s degree attainment during that time by an average of 177%, an analysis by an institute at the University of Pennsylvania found.Even before the pandemic, the nation was facing a shortage of more than 9 million college-educated workers over the next decade, affecting nearly every state and costing nearly 1.2 trillion in lost economic output, the center-right American Action Forum estimated. Economic rivals “could wish nothing better but to see the share of [American] adults who go to college drop by 12 percentage points,” Hicks said. “It is literally cataclysmic.”","answer":"Even as I embark on this journey of college, I can tell you I'm nervous. I've read all about the decline of high school graduates going to college. No one wants their parents or themselves to spend all that time and money. I had no idea why there was so much news about this topic. I got down to business and started researching. After all, I'm about to go on this journey and I want to know what I'm getting myself into. First, the economy stinks. The U.S. economy has been on a downward slope for some time. What does that mean? While scouring the internet, I found some information from the Director of the Center for Business and Economic Research and Ball State University. Michael Hicks stated, \\"With the exception of wartime, the United States has never been through a period of declining attainment like this.\\" What does this mean? I'm not sure, so I had to dig some more. Currently, there are 4 million fewer students in college than a decade ago. Of course, Covid-19 hurt these numbers. More young people went into the workforce, instead of going to college. That concept does not agree with me. I wanted a gap year off before college but not one that involved working. Even before the pandemic, college applications started declining. We can't blame the pandemic for everything. Different focus groups and surveys showed that people were skeptical that the college degree would prove results that some were willing to pay for. Statistics show that one in three don't think the degree is worth the amount of money shelled out. Think about it. When my parents went to college, the cost was less than 30,000 in some states. Now, my college education will cost closer to 50,000 with loans that will haunt me until the day I die. The conversations about worth keep coming up time and again with my friends and their parents. When my parents went to school, everyone went to college. If you didn't go to college, you were considered a bum. Not anymore. Now parents seemed relieved if their child opts out of college. Student loans. Don't get my father started. He has been paying off his loans for the past 20 years. It seems like he will always be paying. While my parents wait to find out if the government will forgive student debt, they pay every month like clockwork. This does not appeal to me in the least. Imagine if you bought a car, but never paid it off, no matter how many years passed. Why would you want to pay off a car for 20 years? College is no different. People who don't even graduate from college still have to pay off student loans. That is a real insult. Do you think the universities are addressing this issue? Nope. Having a degree is indeed necessary in some industries. It is also true that college grads tend to make more. However, the attitude about college being necessary has dropped from 60% to 45% according to the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation. Even the ones who are already committed to college are doubting the decision. "},{"question":"Brainstorm a list of unusual fillings I can use for handmade chocolate candies.

He was widely recognized as an outstanding character actor and the many productions that he directed garnered him a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation. His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his \\"system\\" of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique.Stanislavski (his stage name) performed and directed as an amateur until the age of 33, when he co-founded the world-famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) company with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, following a legendary 18-hour discussion. Its influential tours of Europe (1906) and the US (1923–24), and its landmark productions of The Seagull (1898) and Hamlet (1911–12), established his reputation and opened new possibilities for the art of the theatre. By means of the MAT, Stanislavski was instrumental in promoting the new Russian drama of his day—principally the work of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and Mikhail Bulgakov—to audiences in Moscow and around the world; he also staged acclaimed productions of a wide range of classical Russian and European plays.He collaborated with the director and designer Edward Gordon Craig and was formative in the development of several other major practitioners, including Vsevolod Meyerhold (whom Stanislavski considered his \\"sole heir in the theatre\\"), Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov. At the MAT's 30-year anniversary celebrations in 1928, a massive heart attack on-stage put an end to his acting career (though he waited until the curtain fell before seeking medical assistance). He continued to direct, teach, and write about acting until his death a few weeks before the publication of the first volume of his life's great work, the acting manual An Actor's Work (1938). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Lenin and was the first to be granted the title of People's Artist of the USSR.Stanislavski wrote that \\"there is nothing more tedious than an actor's biography\\" and that \\"actors should be banned from talking about themselves\\". At the request of a US publisher, however, he reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, My Life in Art (first published in English in 1924 and in a revised, Russian-language edition in 1926), though its account of his artistic development is not always accurate. Three English-language biographies have been published: David Magarshack's Stanislavsky: A Life (1950) ; Jean Benedetti's Stanislavski: His Life and Art (1988, revised and expanded 1999). and Nikolai M Gorchakov's \\"Stanislavsky Directs\\" (1954). An out-of-print English translation of Elena Poliakova's 1977 Russian biography of Stanislavski was also published in 1982.","answer":"Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavski was born in 1863. Known as a character actor and director, his greatest fame comes from his \\"system\\" of actor training.

He was a major influence on scenic artist Edward Gordon Craig and the acting teachers who followed him, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov. In 1928, Stanislavski suffered a massive heart attack while on stage that ended his acting career. He continued to direct, teach, and write about acting until he died in 1938. His two books, the acting manual, An Actor's Work (1938) and an autobiography, My Life in Art (1924) are still read by students of acting."},{"question":"I would like to hear about a train that breaks down with only one passenger in one of the cars.

Clubhouse attracted attention from an elite stable of venture capitalists, but saw usership drop precipitously not long after its buzzy launch. The company didn’t disclose the total number of people who were cut. In October, co-founder Paul Davison said the company had about 100 employees and still had “years of cash in the bank.”Clubhouse was a hit at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing celebrities like Oprah and Elon Musk into long audio conversations with hundreds of people on the app. In 2021, it discussed a 4 billion valuation with investors. But once lockdowns eased, user numbers fell quickly and the startup shifted its strategy. “As the world has opened up post-Covid, it’s become harder for many people to find their friends on Clubhouse and to fit long conversations into their daily lives,” Clubhouse co-founders Davison and Rohan Seth wrote in the post. “To find its role in the world, the product needs to evolve. This requires a period of change.”They also said that the startup would allow laid-off employees to keep their company-issued laptops and would pay four months of severance. Clubhouse co-founder Davison has long been obsessed with making social apps that use new technology tools — like real-time location or live audio broadcasting — to connect people with one another. Past creations of his, like Highlight, similarly spiked in interest before cooling quickly.When users first flocked to Clubhouse, they found a sense of community but also brought some of the more unsavory parts of the internet: hate speech, including anti-Semitic content, and an unruly lack of moderation. By last summer, Clubhouse was experimenting with more private social groups, called Houses, in a bid to bring back a friendlier, more intimate feeling to the app.----","answer":"Rohan SethDavison SethElon MuskOprahPaul DavisonEllen Huet"},{"question":"Condense this film info for me into only two sentences: What is this film about?The official synopsis for \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\\" from Marvel Studios reads:\\"Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own.

He waited for hours until the sun set and the stars came out.

Today was the day his parents were taking him to the animal shelter to adopt a new furry friend!Page 2: Tommy didn’t know what type of pet he would be bringing home. Maybe it would be a dog he could play fetch with! Or maybe a cat that would hang out with him while he read books.Page 3: On the drive to the shelter, he thought about what names he might choose. Mabel is too common, and so is Spike, he thought to himself.Page 4: Upon arriving at the shelter, a nice lady met them at the door, introduced herself as Joyce, and asked if we wanted to take a look around. “There are so many pets available for you to adopt!” she said.Page 5: Joyce walked them through the shelter and showed them the different animals that needed a good home. There were so many dogs and cats in cages that Tommy didn’t know how he could possibly choose one.Page 6: Then, Tommy spotted a baby kitten in one of the smaller cages. This kitten had all-white fur with blue eyes and stared directly into his eyes. He felt an instant connection.Page 7: “This is the one!” Tommy exclaimed as he pointed at the white kitten. His parents beamed back proudly and turned to face Joyce. “I believe we have found our new pet,” Tommy’s mother told her.Page 8: “Great! I will get the adoption paperwork ready for you.

These conditions include specific temperatures depending on the weed, lawn moisture levels, and bare or thin lawn areas. Anywhere there's room gives weeds the ability to grow. Weed seeds grow very rapidly in plants and can lay dormant in the soil for years before germinating. When weeds grow, they can produce thousands of seeds per plant and have the ability to scatter them throughout the season. Dandelion seeds use the help of the wind to spread. Poor quality grass bought in the store may also be a source of weeds."},{"question":"Write a small story in three paragraphs about Mario from the Mushroom Kingdom going grocery shopping in New York City.","answer":"Mario decided he'd eaten enough mushrooms and flowers to last a lifetime. He was craving something new in his life. Peach's cakes only went so far. He told his brother Luigi that he was going to take the express pipe straight to New York to get some real Italian food. Luigi gave him some gold coins and told him, \\"Get some penne pasta for me, bro!\\" Mario nodded and in the pipe he went. When Mario came out of the pipe, he quickly dusted off his pants and walked towards the Italian market. His eyes were wide, and his mouth was drooling when looking through the window. Mario looked at the gold coins in his pocket and said, \\"Let's-a go!\\" The cannolis looked heavenly, the lasagna looked immaculate, and the pizza was to die for. Mario got a huge cart and stuffed it to the brim. His food pile was taller than he was! He then went in line to pay. The cashier was astonished at how much food was on the belt. After all of the food had been rung up and bagged, the cashier softly said, \\"That will be 320, sir.\\" Mario reached into his overall pockets and whipped out some gold coins. The cashier looked confused and said, \\"We don't accept gold here, sir.\\" Mario's face immediately turned pale and he looked like he was going to weep. The cashier then looked at Mario's face and said, \\"Wait a minute, aren't you Mario? The guy who saves Princess Peach all the time?\\" Mario slowly nodded his head. The cashier then smiled and said, \\"This one is on the house Mario, keep doing what you're doing.\\" Mario let out a big \\"WAHOO!\\"Mario carried home 11 bags of groceries through the express pipe back to the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi couldn't believe how much he had brought back. Luigi helped Mario put all of the groceries away. Altogether, Mario had bought 14 different types of pasta.

The natural beauty of Antarctica is breathtaking. We left the southern tip of South America on a cozy expedition vessel and were at sea for several days. There was onboard entertainment that made at-sea days go by quickly - lectures, documentaries, a well-stocked library, citizen science programs, and plenty of marine life and birds. We had several social events in the evenings, like a trivia competition, a dessert tasting, and a dance party. It took several days to cross the notoriously rough waters of the Drake Passage. I won't lie, I struggled. I had to see the ship's doctor for medication. Once we arrived around the Antarctica peninsula, we were more sheltered and it was smoother. We spent several days exploring various locations along the peninsula, including my dream visit to a scientific research station, several historic sites, and many wildlife hotspots before our return.The biggest highlight of my trip to Antarctica was seeing such a wide variety of wildlife up close and personal. When I say up close and personal, I mean that they walk right up to you. We saw so many colonies of penguins, seals, whales, and of seabirds. Visiting the penguin colonies was different than expected, as it really stunk. Those little cuties projectile poop everywhere. The smell gets in your clothes and hair. Bring Febreeze! The moment that stands out the most from the trip was this trip to the peninsula in a zodiac where a humpback whale swam right next to us most of the way. I could see his barnacles in detail, he was so close! It was life-changing. The scenery in Antarctica was simply wild, massive glaciers, snow-blanketed mountains, and icebergs that are measured in kilometers instead of meters. It was mind-blowing daily. I cannot talk about this trip without sharing the unique soundtrack we heard.Some of my favorites were:* The glaciers rumble and crack like thunder as they calve ice into the sea.* The exhale of air from a whale’s blowhole.* The slapping of little penguin feet as they follow each other down their established roadways. (This is probably my favorite soundtrack of the trip.)Overall, my trip to Antarctica was an unforgettable experience that I will revisit in my mind for the rest of my life.

Here are six tips to polish your interview performance:1. Arrive about 10-15 minutes early so that you can get acquainted with your surroundings and start your interview without making the interviewer feel rushed. They probably have a busy schedule, so they need to start your interview on time.2. Make sure you dress nicely! You don't have to wear a dress or a suit and tie, but arrive in business-casual attire, which includes dress pants, long-sleeved shirts, and closed-toe shoes. If you get hired, your HR manager will tell you more about the job dress code.3. Look up common job interview questions online, and practice answering them alone or with a friend. Note that your answers should almost always be positive even if the question seems to require a negative answer. For example, if the interviewer asks \\"What's your biggest flaw?\\", give them a minor flaw with a positive spin, such as \\"Sometimes, I get a little too immersed in my work.\\"4. Employers want extroverted employees. If you're an introvert, you don't have to invent a fake personality, but appear bubbly, friendly, and talkative. These employees work the best with customers and colleagues, making them ideal job candidates.5. Be professional, but don't worry about being perfect. If you're too perfect, it's creepy. Make a good first impression while letting the best parts of your personality shine through.6.

Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities according to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). Antisemitism and hatred towards Jews did not end with the Holocaust and are on the rise today, meaning antisemitism is still a problem. Antisemitism is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. Antisemitic acts can be criminal when they are defined by law.

The report may hint at the destruction of the One Ring but will get key details wrong.  You can invent details such as casualty reports and quotes.","answer":"STUNNING VICTORY AT THE BLACK GATEHalfling sabotage team may have been key to the defeat of Mordor's armiesMarch 25, 3019MINAS TIRITH (GNS) After a week of chaos the Capital of Gondor reacted with shock and relief that Gondorian forces and their allies from Rohan had defeated the forces of Mordor at the black gate.  The initial word of the battle came from an Eagle messenger.  The invasion's success surprised residents of Minas Tirith, as the 6,000 to 7,000-man expeditionary force attacking the Black Gates was expected to be outnumbered by a factor of at least ten-to-one by orcs and Mordor's human allies.  Many military experts considered the attack to be futile.Accounts of the battle remain incomplete, but casualties are heavy, with over a thousand injured and several hundred dead.  Orcs were close to overrunning Western positions before the tide of battle turned.  How the forces of Mordor were defeated remains unclear. Still, initial reports indicate that the assault on the Black Gate was made in conjunction with the actions of a small team of Halfling saboteurs who were able to infiltrate Mordor and destroy its headquarters at the tower of Barad Dur, possibly with the assistance of some ancient magical artifact.However it was accomplished, numerous eyewitnesses report seeing the tower fall and Mt. Doom erupting.  Sauron appears to have perished as the tower collapsed, and his forces broke down in disarray almost immediately.  Some observers report that the Ringwraiths turned from the battle and headed back toward Barad Dur just as it broke down,  Trolls and other monsters scattered almost immediately, and Mordor's human allies agreed to a truce shortly afterward.The Gondorian military refused to comment on the \\"Hobbit Commandos,\\" however, one source close to royal claimant Aragorn remarked that \\"those little people may not look all that tough, but they do have a knack for covert ops.\\"The victory at the Black Gate ends two weeks of turmoil for Minas Tirith and the Kingdom of Gondor which culminated in a massive battle near the city gates and the suicide of Denethor, Steward of Gondor.  Aragorn, the former northern Ranger who has claimed kingship over Gondor appears to have survived the battle and is expected to be coronated in the next month."},{"question":"I'm looking for some simple egg ideas to eat for lunch.

OH MY GOODNESS!! I curled my lashes and applied 2 coats and I'm amazed! It dried really quickly, and left my lashes sooo soft. I find alot of mascaras take too long too dry which results in my curled eyelashes drooping, but this is perfect. The wand is packed with bristles so you can brush through your lashes nicely and separate them, but its also very long and narrow so you can reach the teeny ones in the corners. I wouldn't normally apply 2 coats, I just wanted to see if it got spidery, and it has a bit for my personal taste. If I had a full face on then I'd go for the 2 coats but every day the one coat is amazing!! I can't believe it's only £5.15. I have Bailey Sarian to thank for this 2. I've always had problems with my dry skin and after I take a shower my skin would always itch. so I found this dove bar soap and it says for sensitive skin and it's unscented, so I thought I'd try it. It makes my skin very soft and no more itching after I shower. I never knew I had sensitive skin until I tried this product and no more itchy problems with my skin3. Terrible don't buy!!!! This is my second pair. Hard time Connecting. Then constantly disconnecting. Case never charges. Save your money!!!4. I’ve always heard great things about this brand, but after using this tonight I don’t think I will ever try them again. The product would not lather at all. Didn’t feel like it cleaned anything. I don’t use any products but shampoo on my hair. It just gets oily quickly. The scent was so strong that I used my regular shampoo and washed it twice to try to get rid of the smell and actually clean my hair. I do not recommend because it didn’t clean, was too strongly scented and overpriced. Definitely taking it back.5. I’ve had my series s for a little over a year at this point and have been loving it! It plays games really well and I haven’t had many problems with it. I would absolutely suggest getting an external hard drive because you only have a little over 300 gb when it’s fully set up. I would also suggest getting gamepass ultimate just because you’re already playing digital games, so why not get all the “Xbox” ones right off the bat?","answer":"1. Positive.

"},{"question":"How do airplanes fly?","answer":"Despite their massive size and weight, airplanes rely on their mechanical design, and science, to fly. Airplanes, even some weighing as much as 661 tons, fly by traveling on wind flow. Their wings are designed to create lift, much like a bird's wings, which force the surrounding air to move faster above than the air traveling below. This fast-moving air above the wings decreases air pressure while the air below the wings remains at normal levels. This difference in air pressure creates lift and propels the plane skyward!Thankfully, we don't need to rely on science alone to get our planes into the air. Airplanes are also equipped with powerful engines that produce thrust and force the plane forward, while air pressure does the heavy lifting.

Give me a list of at least 10 strange fears and phobias out there and give me a short explanation about them. Make sure each of these phobias is unique; something that might be hard to believe.","answer":"Sure. Here's a list of 10 of the strangest phobias out there along with a short explanation of each one.1. Vestiphobia: Fear of clothing. This phobia usually refers to the fear of a specific type of fabric or garment, possibly due to an allergy or traumatic incident. For example, players develop a fear of their sports gear after facing a traumatic incident. In some cases, this can come from the fear of tight, constrained clothing that makes one feel compressed and uncomfortable in public.2. Chaetophobia: Fear of hair. This phobia involves fear of one's own hair, other people's hair, and even animal fur. Patients are known to avoid haircuts, combing their hair, washing their hair, picking up hairballs, and touching hair in general as they may feel sickened by the very nature of hair. This phobia can be developed by traumatic haircuts or hair loss incidents3. Linonopobia: Fear of strings. This could include the fear of strings as well as anything resembling a string such as ropes and shoelaces. Patients could panic at the sight of these objects as they may trigger some painful memories of being forcefully tied up for punishment, captivity, or other related purposes.4. Globophobia: Fear of balloons. This phobia usually refers to the fear of the popping sound a balloon makes. Many find themselves uncomfortable around balloons, just because of that sound and how it can catch them off guard. In most cases, a childhood memory of this frightening sound is the cause of this phobia.5. Nomophobia: Fear of being without your phone. This phobia is triggered when patients lose touch with their phone or find it low on battery or service. They'll develop extreme anxiety over not being able to check their notifications. This phobia is usually a symptom of phone addiction, which is common among the modern generation.6. Optophobia: Fear of opening your eye. This phobia enables patients to feel discomfort with the simple act of opening their eyes. As a result, they usually prefer to stay indoors and away from brightly-lit areas as it can be severely inconvenient to perform daily tasks without opening their eye.7. Ephebiphobia: Fear of adolescence. This phobia triggers the fear of the youth demographic, specifically teenagers. Patients might be led to believe that teenagers are dangerous, violent, or untrustworthy, so they choose to avoid them and stay away from areas populated by teenagers.8. Pogonophobia: Fear of bearded people. This phobia ignites nervousness around beards due to unpleasant experiences with bearded people or just the concealing nature of beards themselves. Patients with this condition struggle to talk to bearded people properly or even look at their faces.9. Decidophobia: Fear of decision-making. Making tough choices is generally intimidating but it's a matter of mental health for those struggling with this phobia. they won't easily rely on their instincts, opinions, and judgments, and would much rather take advice from external sources such as friends, family, or the internet.10. Arachibutyrophobia: Fear of getting peanut butter stuck on the roof of your mouth. Those who consume peanut butter frequently are aware of this sensation where the substance gets stuck in your upper mouth. It causes an unpleasing and discomforting feeling that's hard to get rid of. So, patients suffering from this condition tend to avoid peanut butter and other sticky edibles."},{"question":"Can you write me a scary story in ten sentences or less that includes an old man, clowns, and a basketball?","answer":"The old man rose from his bed, ready to begin his day. He stretched his hands above his head as he always did but suddenly froze when he heard a strange noise. The sound stopped and he began to dress himself when he heard it again- almost like the bouncing of a basketball. He threw his shirt on and began to follow the sound. It seemed to be coming from his basement, so he proceeded down the stairs, as he was not a very fearful person. The steps came to an end and he set one foot down and then two, when his second foot hit the floor, a sudden chill overcame him. Suddenly shaking uncontrollably, he continued to follow the noise when all of a sudden he became unable to move, stuck to the spot he was standing. Laughter began to fill his ears and all at once, there were clowns surrounding him. One and then two and then too many clowns to count lifted him above their heads and began to carry him off. The last thing he saw before he fell unconscious were the yellow eyes of a clown."},{"question":"Here is a review of \\"The Old man and the sea\\" by Earnest Hemmingway. Summarize this and provide what stands out in it as a book:\\"Dreamers, they never see the riptide coming. But then who can really blame them? Better to sail an ocean of hope than a sea of despair. Never mind what lies beneath: a world without dreamers would be a nightmare.Santiago, the old man in Ernest Hemingway’s 1952 novella, is a dreamer. But with age, his dreams have changed, scuffed and sanded down by decades of fishing the Gulf Stream: no longer does his sleeping mind drift to the great events throughout his life but instead just to a place, a childhood memory: lions playing on an African beach. And he wonders: “Why are the lions the main thing that is left?”Santiago is a simple man. Fishing is his life, while baseball, the Gran Ligas, is his religion. A New York Yankee, “the great DiMaggio”, is his earthly god. But lately the sea has been cruel, and the old man has endured 84 days without a catch. He thinks and speaks of luck but is not prone to superstition. He is reverent but not pious, wary of devotion, although he could waver. When it suits, when hope takes the bait under the deep blue sea, Santiago offers to pray should he require not only strength but fortitude to land his prize: “I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin de Cobre if I catch him. That is a promise.”With his village status of saleo, “the worst form of unlucky”, his body racked and gnarled by years of labour but with blue eyes “cheerful and undefeated”, he sets out on the 85th day since his last catch and rows the skiff far, away from the deep wells that have offered no reward, towards “the schools of bonita and albacore” where he might fare better: “My big fish must be somewhere.”He is not wrong. But it is then, with his quarry hooked, that the true test begins. Day becomes night becomes day, and with little or no sleep the old man loses track of time and islands of Sargasso weed drift by. Eating raw bonito and dorado to maintain strength, while slowly sapping the marlin’s will, Santiago regrets his poor planning: “I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.” But his words are laced with hope that he will return to the sea.He will win the battle but lose the prize, and rue the desperation that carried him beyond practical bounds. He laments the ruins of his lionheart dream, and yet he remains unbowed: “A man can be destroyed but not defeated.”I was revisiting this fable when news broke that an elderly priest had been slain at the Normandy altar where he was presiding over mass. After the horror had ebbed, I returned to Hemingway and found solace. Words have a power no violence can breach. Whispered in a church or shouted in a storm, words are a lifelong friend. And Hemingway’s words, in this slim volume, are consistently affecting, as steady a comfort as a lighthouse beam.The Old Man and the Sea is a beautiful tale, awash in the seasalt and sweat, bait and beer of the Havana coast. It tells a fundamental human truth: in a volatile world, from our first breath to our last wish, through triumphs and pitfalls both trivial and profound, what sustains us, ultimately, is hope.\\"Dreamers, they never see the riptide coming.

Becoming a new mother is extremely challenging, so we have made a list of 10 simple don’ts to make your transition into motherhood just a little easier. 1. Don’t Do It Alone! Call for help, whether it's a friend, a partner, or a family member; you don’t need to do it all by yourself. 2. Don’t Cry When They Cry. Babies are going to cry, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad mother. Don’t get down if your baby is crying; it’s perfectly normal. 3. Don’t Neglect YOU. So many mothers forget to take time for self-care! You can’t care for your baby if you’re not taking care of yourself. 4. Don’t Believe Everything You Hear. There is almost too much motherly advice available these days. And focusing on all of it will drive you insane! Find the tips and tricks that work for you, and leave the rest behind. 5. Don’t Get Impatient. It takes time to ease into motherhood. Don’t forget to be patient with yourself and the process. 6. Don’t Forget Your Baby is Unique. Not all babies are the same! What worked for another baby simply might not work for yours, and that’s okay! You’ll get to know your baby’s unique needs and personality in no time. 7. Don’t Forget It’s All a Phase. At the end of the day, everything is a phase when you have a baby. So if you’re in a particularly challenging one, just remember, it will pass. 8. Don’t Have Specific Expectations.

Write 4 paragraphs, 300-350 words.  ","answer":"Ryuunosuke was as excited as anyone else. He was finally getting to play the VRMMO Angel's Requiem. It was rumored to be the best VRMMO to date and was the first game to be released on the second version of the full dive technology. Ryuunosuke bought the VR and game bundle, unable to contain his excitement. The game launched, and he was thrilled by the experience. It was exactly as he expected it to be. The visuals were stunning, the gameplay was beyond fluid, and all the small and awkward bits from the first version of the VR headset had been smoothed out. Ryuunosuke felt like he was playing the game in his own body. It was when he went to log out that he realized something strange. There was no logout button. Where the button should have been was simply blank.He ran back to the starter town to find hundreds or maybe even thousands of players with the same issue. None of them could log out, either. It had everyone in a panic. What was going on? What exactly happened? Was this some kind of bug, or were they simply missing something? As Ryuunosuke asked himself these questions, he recalled the pain he'd felt during the fight with some low-level monsters. He shouldn't have felt that kind of pain. That was beyond the VR headset's capabilities. This wasn't a game anymore, he realized. This was reality. They had all slipped into Angel's Requiem, not as players but as actual people. He didn't know how or why. Ryuunosuke's instincts kicked in. He knew where this would lead. Chaos would break out. People might turn violent. Things weren't going to end well for someone weak. He left the village that instant. If he was going to survive the fallout, he needed to be stronger than anyone else. The best way was to get ahead before anyone. He wouldn't die here.

Obstacles in meditation are not a problem, they are the path to finding freedom amidst it all. – Jack KornfieldNo matter what form of meditation we practice, sooner or later inner obstacles will arise. They arise naturally when we stop our busy lives and bring attention to our inner experience. On first becoming quiet we will can encounter the unfinished business we carry. There may be untended longings, unacknowledged grief, unrequited hopes, unexpressed love or our underlying fears and hurts. And as we get quieter still we can find ourselves facing the mystery of our own mortality, of death. In all spiritual traditions as attention is given to these problems, our understanding and compassion deepens, for it is through these that the path often unfolds. As my teacher Ajahn Chah used to say, “Where do you learn the most, when times are easy or when times are hard?”In the Christian mystical tradition, The Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross talks about the periods of loneliness, fear, and doubt that one goes through after the initial awakenings into the light. Evagrius, a fourth-century Christian monk who lived in the Egyptian desert with the Christian Desert Fathers wrote a text describing the demons that come to people who go into the desert to undertake a meditation practice. These include the demons of pride, the demons of fear, the demons of lust, the noonday demon of laziness and so forth. In Zen, there are descriptions of further kinds of obstacles that arise in intense meditation. Practitioners might experience makyo. These are hallucinations involving vision, hearing, smell, or other senses.How does one understand and work with these difficulties? Buddhist teachings say begin right where you are, with the most common hindrances such as physical pain and restlessness, anger, doubt and fear. Instead of resisting or trying to get rid of them, which usually keeps them stuck, you can name and acknowledge them kindly and surround them with mindfulness and compassion. Make space for them and soften around them. Breathe and become a loving witness. Invite them to open and show you their dance. As you let them open without resistance, they soften or disperse or transform into other energies. But not always. Sometimes they become quite intense for a time, but without resistance and a patient curiosity they will eventually change. They always do. And with this practice you learn a deep trust. You find that awareness can hold it all. You become the spacious awareness itself. Then as meditation deepens beyond the everyday level, even the more extreme, delightful or terrifying energies, visions, mental states, and difficulties become workable.To find freedom requires a steadying of the heart, a trust in attention, a willingness to be present for it all. Like the sign in a Las Vegas casino that says, “You must be present to win”, the very obstacles that arise become your place to awaken.","answer":"Obstacles we encounter when trying to better ourselves and our mindset are not a problem; they are a path to finding freedom.Sooner or later, we will encounter obstacles in therapy, self-reflection, or while trying to stay in the present moment of our lives. Obstacles are bound to arise when we try to slow down our busy lives and think more critically about ourselves and our inner experience. We might discover some unfinished business our thoughts wander to. We might feel longing, grief, unexpressed love, underlying fear and hurt, or unrequited hopes. And when we really stop to analyze what is going on in our thoughts, we may even face the mystery of our own mortality. Anxious thoughts about death may be buried in there. But as we deepen our attention to these aspects of our thoughts, our understanding and compassion for ourselves and others can deepen, too. We forget we can learn the most from something that was hard, rather than something that was easy. When we begin a journey of therapy or deep self-reflection to heal the wounds in our minds, it is not uncommon for loneliness, fear, and doubt to emerge. We may also be forced to confront our pride, lust, laziness, and so on. Instead of resisting those feelings and moods or being surprised when they occur, we can name and acknowledge what they are in a kind way and look at them both objectively for what they are and also with compassion. Witness them, rather than feeling like you have to be subject to their will. If you don't encounter them with resistance, your mind and body can relax and the thoughts and feelings may begin to disperse. In this process, you are shifting your mindset from one that feels afflicted by these thoughts and emotions to one that looks at them more objectively, like studying clouds and watching them pass by. Sometimes, the emotions are very intense, and we won't make progress over night. But with diligent patience and curiosity, change will eventually happen. What you are really doing in this process is learning trust. You are trusting that these feelings can arise and that it is going to be okay. You are becoming more skillful about what thoughts and emotions drive your actions and mood, and which ones don't need to, including the most extreme, delightful, and terrifying thoughts. In confronting the wounds of our mind and lives, we also discover freedom. But to do so, we must trust the process, remain patient, and be willing to investigate the deepest darkest parts of our mind. They can only be healed if we learn to look at and work with them."},{"question":"Rewrite the paragraphs into a list of questions and answers to be used in a history test about the French and Indian War.In the first engagement of the French and Indian War, a Virginia militia under 22-year-old Lieutenant Colonel George Washington defeats a French reconnaissance party in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Don't include numbers that are part of dates or times, numbers in word format, and don't include commas in large numbers.Dropbox lays off 500 employees, 16% of staff, CEO says due to slowing growth and ‘the era of AI’Ingrid Lunden@ingridlunden / 10:42 AM EDT•April 27, 2023 CommentBERLIN, GERMANY - APRIL 22: The logo of the filehosting service Dropbox is shown on the display of a smartphone on April 22, 2020 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)Image Credits: Thomas Trutschel / Getty ImagesCloud storage giant Dropbox today joined the fray of tech companies announcing layoffs. The company today announced that it would be laying off 16% of its staff, equivalent to about 500 employees, due to slowing growth, and — in the words of CEO Drew Houston — because “the AI era of computing has finally arrived.”These appear to be the first layoffs the company has made since January 2021, when it laid off 315 employees in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic.The latest cull was announced to staff in a memo from CEO and co-founder Drew Houston, as well as in an SEC filing.The SEC filing noted that the company will incur charges of approximately 37 million to 42 million in connection with layoffs, which will be recorded in Q2. Q1 results, which will be reported next Thursday, May 4, will be in-line or even above expectations, it added.Ironically, even with the strong results, and the fact that Dropbox is profitable, Houston said the company is choosing to take a preemptive step to cut jobs and invest in new areas to keep up with the pace of change, given that growth is slowing.“While our business is profitable, our growth has been slowing. Part of this is due to the natural maturation of our existing businesses, but more recently, headwinds from the economic downturn have put pressure on our customers and, in turn, on our business. As a result, some investments that used to deliver positive returns are no longer sustainable,” he wrote.The interesting thing is that he also cites AI as a major factor.“Second, and more consequentially, the AI era of computing has finally arrived,” he continued. “We’ve believed for many years that AI will give us new superpowers and completely transform knowledge work. And we’ve been building towards this future for a long time, as this year’s product pipeline will demonstrate.”For those who have been warning that AI will inevitably lead to the loss of more jobs, this will come as an alarming development. The more cynical might argue that it’s an easy and timely excuse for cutting costs right now, to keep the market and investors optimistic that Dropbox is changing with the times and itself won’t get disrupted in the next wave of innovation.Houston said that impacted staff will be getting notified today and will be finished with work by tomorrow. The company had 3,125 employees prior to the move today.More than 184,000 people have been laid off in the tech sector in 2023 across nearly 620 tech companies, according to the Layoffs.fyi tracker.More to come.----","answer":"500, 16%, 315, 19, 37, 42, 2, 1, 3125, 184000, 620"},{"question":"I want you to write your own version of the popular children’s story The Three Little Pigs.

They each decided that they would take a different tactic and see which one would work. The first alcoholic, Joe, chose to remove all alcohol from his life. He took everything out of the house, refused to go to bars, and avoided liquor stores at all costs. For the first few days, it worked. He didn’t drink anything because nothing was available. But then, just one Saturday later, he was at a work event where there was an open bar, and he caved and had a drink. And then several more. The second alcoholic, Sue, tried a different path. She decided that she would read a book about quitting addictions. The book came highly recommended, and apparently, after reading the book, she wouldn’t even want to pick up a drink. Unfortunately, the book didn’t work at all. She drank the whole time she was reading it. The third alcoholic, Luis, chose to join a local Alcoholics Anonymous chapter. He started going to meetings several times a week and even got a sponsor who he could call night and day when he was tempted to drink. To Luis’s surprise, it was actually working. Although he still wanted a drink, he didn’t do it because of his incredible support system. When the three met up again, Luis told them what he had found at AA after they reported their failed tactics. And Luis, Sue, and Joe all headed to a meeting together.

The playground is full today, the children like marbles racing over the bridges and down the slides. Henderson is nowhere to be seen. He must still be sick. George has a sinking feeling he'll be up here for the whole break. He ducks his chin, trying to not cry. He should try to have more than one friend so that when one is sick he is not alone. But what if both are sick? Then he'd need three. Four? He could never be friends with four people. Four people didn't even talk to him at school besides his teachers. George felt himself giving in, waiting to hear the bell ring, when something tugged on his jacket. Lusia smiled up at him. She motioned using the monkey bars, and George nodded. He didn't want to get in the way of her fun. He thought maybe he might as well sit by the door when she tugged his jacket again. She didn't understand her hand gestures, so he shook his head. She glowered and tugged him to the bars, motioning for him to go. He climbed up and thought maybe she could be his friend. He skipped the bars as he went across and heard clapping behind him.

Highway 447 had faded to gray, its painted markings worn away by dust and wind years ago. The land framing the road was brown with scrubby vegetation for as far as she could see, except—Nina squinted. Something huge and black in the distance marred the landscape. It had to be a solar farm. Finally. It wasn’t California, but she thought she might be just days from Reno. She had a sudden urge to go see the bright lights and magical casinos. Maybe she would, later. First, she needed a place to rest, and that solar farm might still be operating.Dodge Flats, the sign said. It proclaimed itself a proud member of the SEA. Solar Energy Association, the pre-eminent power mega industry before everything died. She surveyed the area. Nina’s eyes fell upon the main office building, a squat, sturdy structure, functional and without beauty. Behind it lay rows and rows of enormous black solar panels. A surge of excitement coursed through her veins as she realized the potential it held. She made her way towards the building, cautious yet eager. With any luck, the power lines would still be intact.Inside, she found a dim room empty except for several desks with computer terminals, all covered with a fine layer of dust. Holding her breath, Nina looked to her right and ever so gently flipped the switch she found there. A series of overhead lights snapped on, flickering but spilling precious light over the room. Nina could not contain her excitement, and she screamed an animal cry of triumph. Here, she would set up her base, prepare for the coming winter, and when it passed, renew her search for other survivors.

","answer":"1. The Dover Demon. In 1977, in the space of two days, three teenagers, all of whom were separate at the time of the sightings, swear they saw a creature with “large eyes that glowed and tendril fingers.” When authorities plotted the sightings on a map, the path was a straight line for two miles, but the creature was never found.  That’s the only time the creature was ever spotted in Dover, Massachusetts, but those three sightings sparked legends for decades. 2. Yowie – also known as Sasquatch, Skunk Ape, Bigfoot, and Yeti (depending on where you go to hear about sightings). This large, hairy, humanoid creature has many names, and many cryptozoologists believe that there are hundreds of these creatures across the world because of the numerous locations of supposed sightings. Grainy photographs have captured massive footprints and what could be eyes in the wilderness, while other pictures show human-like figures, covered in hair, from very far away. The first-ever reported sighting of Bigfoot was in 1811 in Alberta, Canada, but Native Americans have talked of similar creatures in their stories and folklore for centuries. 3. The Jersey Devil. The folklore of The Jersey Devil spawns from a story about Mother Leeds, a New Jersey woman with twelve children. She discovered that she was pregnant with her thirteenth child and, in a fit of rage, cursed her pregnancy, offering the child to whoever listened. When the baby was born, it sprouted the features of a goat, horse, and bat all at once, then flew off into the trees. Some of The Jersey Devil's legend has been proven as fact. There was a Mother Leeds, and she left a written will to 12 children, but there’s never been documented evidence of the thirteenth child. There have been over 1,000 sightings of The Jersey Devil up until 2016, and the cryptid is often blamed for any bad luck that New Jersey farmers have with livestock and crops. 4. Champ (or Champy) Sea serpents have been the subject of cryptozoological sightings for centuries, but Champ is one of the most famous in Vermont, New York, and parts of Canada where Lake Champlain extends for 125 miles. There have been 300 sightings since 1609, but the most notable was a report in 1970 that described the creature as “a twenty-foot-long serpent, thick as a barrel, with a head like a horse.” "},{"question":"Using the text below, summarize what leads to a \\"dopamine deficit state\\" and its effects.But, in modern life, we live in a world of abundance rather than scarcity, and Lembke says our brains weren't evolved for the \\"fire hose of dopamine\\" of sugar, social media, TV, sex, drugs or any number of dopamine-triggering stimuli so easily available. In short, Lembke says, almost every behavior has become \\"drugified.\\"When we're repeatedly exposed to our pleasure-producing stimuli, our brains adjust and, eventually, we need more and more just to feel \\"normal,\\" or not in pain.

Overexposure to these stimuli leads to dependence, such that progressively more is needed to feel normal.

Can you write a short perspective piece for an individual TIE fighter pilot? Try to base it around an ambush on Rebel ships.","answer":"I dropped into the tiny cockpit before sealing my helmet. No sense wasting any more pressurized air than necessary, after all. I gripped the control yokes, my flight gloves flexing with familiar resistance. I was ready for this. I felt it in my bones.According to the briefing, we would be deployed the moment our Star Destroyer dropped out of hyperspace. It was always a jolt to drop from the TIE launch tram. The thing was an engineering masterpiece, but it still hit the pit of your stomach like a prize fighter.With open space in front of me, though, I was truly in my element. No matter what ship those rebel scum wrapped themselves in, they could never escape the cleansing effect of laser fire. I was eager to show them.Within seconds of our arrival in the system, my squadron was ordered to disable or destroy the Pelta-Class frigate in orbit around this unimportant planetoid. As one of the largest ships in the system, there was little doubt of its importance. I dove in, spinning around the pathetic defensive fire from a BTL Y-Wing along the way. On my display, I saw that my wingman did the same, barely faltering from our course toward the target. That simple pair of Y-Wings probably constituted the Rebel Alliance’s entire standing defensive screen. Given how quickly we’d appeared on their doorstep, they had almost zero chance of mustering more fighters before we reached our objectives.I zipped around behind the Pelta, firing my laser jabs at the aft shield motivators. Their destruction wouldn’t kill the shields outright, but it would limit their power across the aft end of the ship. That would make the rest of my squadron’s attacks on the engines far more effective. My wingman and I would now provide covering fire while the remainder of our squadron dug into the ship’s engine section. And even given my TIE’s limited visibility, I noticed the flashes from exploding engine chambers. That brought a smile to my face.A flurry of radio calls confirmed our success. All that remained for my wingman and I now was to clear a path back to the Star Destroyer.

No more than a single paragraph, 5-7 sentences.","answer":"The scene is a small town in a rural area surrounded by woods; the townspeople are quiet and guarded physically and emotionally. The main character is a young woman who enters the town to visit an old family friend who sent her a note asking for help, only to discover that the friend has disappeared before she arrived. The bulk of the movie has her trying to investigate the disappearance of her friend, but no one will answer her questions about it, and few people will speak to her at all. However, she has a creepy feeling that she is being stalked by someone or something, and although the audience does not see what it is for most of the film, we can tell it's getting closer due to the sounds and movements of objects, etc. Finally, when the woman feels that she is about to uncover the antagonist (as the clues have led her to an abandoned cabin in the woods), she finally discovers that she is being watched by carnivorous albino deer who also killed her friend (and many others from the town) by kidnapping them, gutting them with their antlers, and eating them. She is unable to save herself, and the deer consume her completely, thereby continuing to keep everyone else in danger, including her boyfriend, who (in the last frame) is seen heading to the same town to find her."},{"question":"Write a review for a vacation rental property called Tziki’s Casa.

Can you run me through a list of ways to get involved in community theatre?","answer":"I surely can! Here are some of the ways you can get involved in community theatre.1. Find community theatre groups - One way to get yourself into the community theatre scene is by joining local theatre groups. You can search for local community theatres on google or google maps, although they don't always have websites so they can be tricky to find. Once you locate a local theatre, go to its website if it has one. If you want to act, you can try to find an auditions page on the site. If there isn't a site, you could also look for the theatre on Facebook. 2. Get notified about auditions and events -  You can also find ways to get involved with community theatre by getting notified about events and auditions. You could sign up for their newsletter or by looking for upcoming auditions or events for community theatre groups. You can also ask via e-mail.3. Volunteer - There is more to theatre than just acting. There is also set building and painting, prop management, costuming, makeup, an entire crew, and more. If you want to get involved but aren't ready to act, volunteering for one of these positions can help you become part of the group.4. Audition - In community theatres, you don't always need experience. They're also typically looking for new people to act with them, with very little experience. You can start auditioning for smaller or non speaking parts and when you get comfortable, work your way into larger roles."},{"question":"Write a paragraph about Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.

A Harvard-educated lawyer, he early became identified with the patriot cause; a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, he led in the movement for independence.During the Revolutionary War he served in France and Holland in diplomatic roles, and helped negotiate the treaty of peace. From 1785 to 1788 he was minister to the Court of St. James’s, returning to be elected Vice President under George Washington. Adams’ two terms as Vice President were frustrating experiences for a man of his vigor, intellect, and vanity. He complained to his wife Abigail, “My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.”When Adams became President, the war between the French and British was causing great difficulties for the United States on the high seas and intense partisanship among contending factions within the Nation.His administration focused on France, where the Directory, the ruling group, had refused to receive the American envoy and had suspended commercial relations. Adams sent three commissioners to France, but in the spring of 1798 word arrived that the French Foreign Minister Talleyrand and the Directory had refused to negotiate with them unless they would first pay a substantial bribe. Adams reported the insult to Congress, and the Senate printed the correspondence, in which the Frenchmen were referred to only as “X, Y, and Z.” The Nation broke out into what Jefferson called “the X. Y. Z. fever,” increased in intensity by Adams’s exhortations. The populace cheered itself hoarse wherever the President appeared. Never had the Federalists been so popular.Congress appropriated money to complete three new frigates and to build additional ships, and authorized the raising of a provisional army. It also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, intended to frighten foreign agents out of the country and to stifle the attacks of Republican editors. President Adams did not call for a declaration of war, but hostilities began at sea. At first, American shipping was almost defenseless against French privateers, but by 1800 armed merchantmen and U.S. warships were clearing the sea-lanes. Despite several brilliant naval victories, war fever subsided. Word came to Adams that France also had no stomach for war and would receive an envoy with respect. Long negotiations ended the quasi war. Sending a peace mission to France brought the full fury of the Hamiltonians against Adams. In the campaign of 1800 the Republicans were united and effective, the Federalists badly divided. Nevertheless, Adams polled only a few less electoral votes than Jefferson, who became President.On November 1, 1800, just before the election, Adams arrived in the new Capital City to take up his residence in the White House. On his second evening in its damp, unfinished rooms, he wrote his wife, “Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.” Adams retired to his farm in Quincy. Here he penned his elaborate letters to Thomas Jefferson. Here on July 4, 1826, he whispered his last words: “Thomas Jefferson survives.” But Jefferson had died at Monticello a few hours earlier.","answer":"John Adams (1735-1826) was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, educated in law at Harvard University and is one of the earliest to be identified with the cause of independence. He served in both the First and Second Continental Congress. As a diplomat for the fledgling country of America, he became a diplomat to France and Holland and, from 1785 to 1788 was the American minister to the Court of St. James. As such, he negotiated the treaty of peace with Britain. Elected George Washington’s Vice President, he found the office to be “the most insignificant … ever” invented. Adams took office in 1797 and spent most of his presidency tackling conflicts with France. In 1880, just prior to losing the presidential election to Thomas Jefferson, Adams and his wife moved into the White House, writing the wish that “none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.” In 1801, he retired to his farm in Quincy, Massachusetts where he often wrote to Thomas Jefferson. Adams died on July 4, 1826, uttering his last words, “Thomas Jefferson survives.” Ironically, Jefferson had himself died hours earlier."},{"question":"What is the origin of the world's most widely spoken language, Mandarin Chinese?","answer":"Mandarin Chinese, known as \\"Putonghua\\" in mainland China, is the world's most spoken language by native speakers.

Many community colleges offer night classes in philosophy in that price range. You'll learn about logic and critical thinking. You'll also learn about knowledge, aesthetics, and ethics. 2. Attend a conference. There are conferences held on a variety of topics. Find one that interests you and get registered.

Go to a second-hand bookstore and buy as many books as you can on any topic that interests you, then read them. Make notes in the margins, highlighting and underlining words. Look up whatever you don't understand. Reading more books is one of the best ways to enhance your knowledge and critical thinking skills, and make you more open-minded. "},{"question":"I have a creative writing blog and want to do a long post about strategies to combat writers block. Can you give me some ideas? I want these recommendations to give writers ideas of concrete steps to take when they're struggling with writers block, not too many abstract ideas. The target audience is people who are writing fiction novels rather than shorter projects or nonfiction works.","answer":"Sure, I can help with that. Here are some things to do when you're struggling with writer's block:1. Take a walk. Sometimes, getting your blood flowing and your heart pumping can serve to awaken new creative impulses in the brain. Bring a smartphone or notepad on your walk so you can jot down any ideas that come to mind while you're on the go. You may find it helpful to listen to music as you walk or do some pointed people-watching for inspiration.2. Re-read your work. Sometimes, writer's block can be a symptom of feeling exhausted and discouraged. Writing a novel is a long and difficult undertaking, so while you're in the messy middle and yet to reap any of the rewards that come with a finished product, you may need to go back and re-read some of your earlier work to remind yourself how far you've come, feel proud of your progress, and get a better feel for the established pacing of your story. 3. Focus on outlines and planning. Writer's block isn't always a sign of creative burnout. Sometimes it's difficult to write what comes next because you don't really know where your story is going. You can use your time to focus on making a detailed outline that functions as a map, telling you exactly where to go next in your book. Alternatively, you could focus on drafting character or place names, fleshing out character profiles, solidifying worldbuilding elements, or any other practical logistics that need to be in place to make the world of your story feel real to readers. 4. Read a book by another author. There are two strategies you could take here. First, you could opt to read something by an author whose work inspires you to grow as an author, perhaps an author who does an exemplary job with some of your favorite aspects of fiction writing. On the flip side, though, great authors can sometimes serve to intimidate or discourage authors who are working on rough drafts, so you might prefer instead of pick up a book that is noticeably flawed. Reading a \\"bad\\" book can sometimes inspire writers by giving them confidence in their own abilities and demonstrating that perfectionism is not necessarily the key to getting published. 5. Talk to other writers. Writer's block happens to the best of us, and sometimes it can be helpful just to voice your concerns and frustrations out loud to someone who understands what you're struggling with. Other writers may also have suggestions that can help get you unstuck in your creative process. 6. Skip ahead to an exciting scene. If you're feeling stuck where you are, then go ahead and skip ahead to an upcoming scene that you're more excited about writing. Often, doing so will help to make it easier to fill in the blanks between what you've already written and the future scene you're excited about because when the future scene is fully fleshed out, it will be easier to determine what needs to happen in the plot to connect point A to point B. 7. Focus on editing. Sometimes it's hard to know where your story is going next because the earlier plot points you've written have backed you into a corner. Or, alternatively, maybe the parts of the story you've already written have left you with too many options for paths leading forward, an overabundance of Chekhov's guns and red herrings, too many characters, or an overly complicated story arc. It may be helpful to backtrack and edit the beginning of the story so that you can see a simpler trail leading from beginning to end."},{"question":"I want a how-to list about how to change a screw-in lightbulb.

Wild rabbits don't have this problem and make their homes in various temperature extremes. Wild rabbits can be found in woods, forests, meadows, grasslands, deserts, tundra and wetlands. Wild rabbits create their own homes by tunneling into the ground. These tunnel systems are called warrens and include rooms for nesting and sleeping. They also have multiple entrances for quick escape. Warrens can be as deep as 9.84 feet (3 meters) underground, according to the Textbook of Rabbit Medicine. Rabbits are very social creatures and live in large groups called colonies. The busiest time of day for rabbits is at dusk and dawn, according to the Proceedings of the 8th World Rabbit Congress. This is when they venture out to find food. The low light allows them to hide from predators. Predators — which include owls, hawks, eagles, falcons, wild dogs, feral cats and ground squirrels — are a constant threat. The rabbit’s long legs and ability to run for long periods at high speeds are likely evolutionary adaptations to help them elude things that want to eat them.","answer":"1.

The Chair “When my sister Betsy and I were kids, our family lived for awhile in a charming old farmhouse. We loved exploring its dusty corners and climbing the apple tree in the backyard. But our favorite thing was the ghost. We called her Mother, because she seemed so kind and nurturing. Some mornings Betsy and I would wake up, and on each of our nightstands, we’d find a cup that hadn’t been there the night before. Mother had left them there, worried that we’d get thirsty during the night. She just wanted to take care of us. Among the homes’ original furnishings was an antique wooden chair which we kept against the back wall of the living room. Whenever we were preoccupied, watching TV or playing a game, Mother would inch that chair forward, across the room, toward us. Sometimes she’d manage to move it all the way to the centre of the room. We always felt sad putting it back against the wall. Mother just wanted to be near us. Years later, long after we’d moved out, I found an old newspaper article about the farmhouse’s original occupant, a widow. She’d murdered her two children by giving them each a cup of poisoned milk before bed. Then she hung herself. The article included a photo of the farmhouse’s living room, with a woman’s body hanging from a beam. Beneath her, knocked over, was that old wooden chair, placed exactly in the center of the room.”Use some examples from the text to show how you concluded that it is or isn't a scary story. ","answer":"The author intended this to be read as a scary story because the children initially thought that the ghost that they call \\"Mother\\" is kind and thoughtful, and caring. She leaves a cup on each of their nightstands and they see it as a gesture in which she doesn't want them to get thirsty. They watch tv and see her inching her chair towards them sometimes even making it to the middle of the room. They see it as her just wanting to be close to them. Years later, after moving out they realize that the cups on the nightstands were the poisoned milk that the widow gave her children before hanging herself in the living room.  The chair that was moved to the middle of the room was the same chair she used to hang herself. What their perception was and the actuality of the ghost and her intentions is what makes the story scary and a little creepy.

Brainstorm a few ways and how I can do each.","answer":"Here are some ways you can reduce stress; however, I am not a clinician, and it is important to speak to a professional if you need help.1. Eat and drink healthy foods and beverages- while coffee is a go-to for many people on the go, overdrinking coffee can lead to more stress and anxiety. Limit your intake of unhealthy foods and beverages, specifically those with high sugar content.2. Exercise regularly- Exercising can release endorphins that boost your mood and give you more energy.

The code above that you provided is about a method called \\"smallerNumbersThanCurrent\\"Here's how the Java function works from beginning to end.1. Starting with the first line, the code first creates an integer array named 'a' that is instantiated to the size of the input array 'nums'. Basically, it is creating a new array that will be the same size as the array that gets passed in as a parameter 'nums'.2. The function then goes into a for loop that iterates through each entry in the input array, starting with the entry at position 0.3. A count variable is then instantiated with the data type of integer, this variable ends up being used to count how many numbers are less than the current number that the variable 'i' is at in the loop.4. A nested loop is created that compares which value is greater at various positions. For example, if nums[i] is greater than nums[j] then it would increment the count and add the current value of the count to the newly created array 'a' at position 'i' after the counter 'j' has reached the end of the array.5. Finally, after iterating through all potential combinations and comparisons, the function returns an integer array 'a'.To summarize, the code calculates how many elements in an array are less than the current number in the array and returns a new array 'a'."},{"question":"If I want to learn about the history of Niagra Falls, get close to the falls, and end the night with some beers, where could I go?","answer":"Sure!

The post should have a short eye-catching intro and lead quickly into 4 tips to avoid burnout. Include a call to action at the end.","answer":"2 in 3 full-time employees say they have experienced burnout at some point in their careers. It is an epidemic that is still on the rise. So how can you protect yourself and avoid burnout? 👇🏼 Start with these 4 steps: 1. Use your PTO ✈️It sounds simple, but did you use every day of your PTO last year? Most people didn't - and it shows. Time away from the office helps us to reset and recharge. When we don't have that time, it's easy to start feeling overwhelmed and overloaded.2. Have a self-care routine 🛀🏼Spend at least a little time each day doing something that helps you recharge. Then establish a weekly and monthly schedule to take it to the next level. Self-care includes things like exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, reading, meditating, and journaling. 3. Find a hobby you enjoy 🏂🏼It's easy to become consumed by work. But you need something to remind you that there's a whole wide world out there with a lot of important and joyful things happening in it. Starting a new hobby or picking up an old one you haven't had time for is a great way to add a bit of joy back into your routine. Snowboarding, knitting, running on the beach, gardening — it doesn't matter what it is. All that matters is that you find something that fills your cup.4. Reach out to those around you 🤗Isolation and burnout go hand-in-hand. Life seems a lot more overwhelming when we're trying to face it alone. Prioritize spending time with your family and friends. They'll help you stay grounded. If there aren't currently many people in your life that can help you in this way, reach out to meet new ones! It's not easy to avoid burnout amidst the hustle culture we have today. But navigating this challenge successfully will make you a valuable and desirable employee. And more importantly, it will help you to find and enjoy a true work-life balance. "},{"question":"Write a caption for a photo post of a woman on a beach in Costa Rica.

St. Michael's Day was held on September 29th, and was a festival that shared many of the same features of Lughnasadh.When I recollect my childhood memories from Wales, I remember my family's celebration of this day and it always takes me back to the making of the Struan Micheil or Michael's Bannock.The Struan Micheil was a special cake, more like a heavy bread, that was made from all of the different types of grain that were harvested during that time of year by my family from all around the surrounding area.I remember various large round loaves that were marked with deep crosses. These loaves were then fire cooked. Within my family, each woman's fire contained special sacred woods in which their loaves were baked. My grandmother's contained sacred oaks, rowan, and some various bramble wood that she loved the best because to her it smelled of the dark brambles or blackberries that it would soon harvest and was \\"best\\" for her fire and her bannock. I also remember how various women each spoke of the different ingredients they used and why. I also remember that I did not care for bannock made with sheep's milk!I have been blessed with having the awesome pleasure of owning my grandmother‘s bannock recipe which was willed to me and will one day be passed down to the next generation of my family. I think that of all I have experienced, her recipe is by far the best, and I will always fondly remember the smell coming from the cook fire for the rest of my life.I have researched many recipes on bannock that have included different grain types, the availability of various grains and flours, and the times during the year that the bannock loaves were cooked and for what purposes they were made.I found that Wales and Ireland were not as similar as I had thought they might be. In Ireland, the bannock is typically made from a wheat flour. Barley flours were used extensively in Wales. Bannock loaves provided a main staple food and were eaten at feasts as well as all of the daily meals. They acted as the prime form of breads and cakes in the days of old.During the times of the harvest, my grandmother made and put up as many loaves or cakes as she had enough flour to cook. All during September, she and the family cooked enough bannock loaves that would supply them throughout the harvest season, the coming Winter. and throughout most of the Spring.Folk tradition has it that the baker imbues each cake with a blessing during every stage of the bannock: mixing the ingredients, kneading the dough, leaving it to proof, baking the cake, and a special blessing if it was for a gift. Therefore, care must also be taken during this day in respect to how many cakes are cooked. I have also found that it is traditional for many in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland to bless each bannock as it is removed from the fire.All day long my family baked.There were also processions, songs to Michael, and horse racing in the afternoon that almost everyone attended. We then returned to our home early in the evening to enjoy music, dancing and the exchange of gifts. It seemed that over the years the gift exchange was done more so at Samhain and during Yule after we moved to the United States.My family still cooks a bannock for many holidays. Michael's Mass has past us now this year, however, Samhain is upon us and maybe during your celebration this year, someone would perhaps like to add the custom of preparing the bannock to their own celebrations. Do not be afraid to use and try different flours of your region as well as whole grains and spices.Although I do not know the exact time period that bannock originated; my family’s original recipe has been handed down within my family and dates to 1538.The following is a simplified version of the bannock recipe that you can try at home. It is has been further adapted from the recipe that was used by my grandmother, Lady Ethel of Wales, and myself.Bannock Recipe1 Cup Barley flour1 Cup Wheat flour1/2 Cup Rolled Oats1 Cup White Sugar1/2 to 1 Cup Sultanas or White Raisins1 1/2 Cup Buttermilk2 tbsp. Baking Powder2 tbsp. Baking Soda1 tbsp. Coarse Ground Salt1 tbsp. Allspice1 tbsp. Cinnamon1 tbsp. Cloves1 tbsp. NutmegInstructionsGas Mark 400 Fahrenheit or 200 Celsius for 20-25 minutes.Electric Oven 375 Fahrenheit or 190 Celsius for 40-45 minutes.In a large bowl, sift both flours fine, add salt, baking powder and soda to sifter. Re-sift the mixture of flours, salt, and baking soda then add the spices and sift. Remove sifter and add the next set of ingredients by tossing in the rolled oats, sugar, and sultanas. Slowly add the buttermilk and mix by hand until mixture forms a ball. Next, turn the dough out onto a well-floured board. Knead, turn about 50 or 60 times, and re-flour as needed.You will then need to decide the desired size of your loaf. You can turn this into a large loaf, or split it into two medium cakes. Separate the dough into small rounded balls and then flatten it into a small round flat cake about 3/4 inch thick. For medium or large sized loaves, score the top of each cake with a cross. Bake as directed above.","answer":"September 29th is when St. Michael's Day is celebrated."},{"question":"What about this number: 2134445555?","answer":"The area code 213 is from the downtown part of the City of Los Angeles and surrounding areas."},{"question":"What is the capital of Australia?","answer":"The capital of Australia has been Canberra since 1908.

When the British exiled him to the Seychelles in 1896, along with the King of Asante Prempeh I and other members of the Asante government, Yaa Asantewaa became regent of the Ejisu–Juaben district. After the exile of Prempeh I, the British governor-general of the Gold Coast, Frederick Hodgson, demanded the Golden Stool, the symbol of the Asante nation.[2] This request led to a secret meeting of the remaining members of the Asante government at Kumasi, to discuss how to secure the return of their king.","answer":"In the era of her brother's reign, Yaa Asantewaa witnessed the Ashanti Confederacy's tumultuous journey through perilous times, engulfed in the throes of civil war that swept across 1883 to 1888.

Brainstorm some examples.","answer":"1. Sight towers: A common trope in open-world games is the need to \\"activate\\" towers or other markers to unlock sections of the world. While intended to give the player a sense of the scale of the game world, they can be a dull unnecessary chore. 2. Repetitive side quests: The need to complete a repetitive task every time a section of the world is unlocked or the plot is progressed is detrimental to immersion and renders the game feeling perfunctory and diminishes player choice. 3. Unnecessary strategic layer: In settings where the player is the commander of an army or leader of a faction, it may seem to make sense to provide a strategic gameplay element. This would have the player command troops, manage resources, and make decisions on behalf of their faction. However, this can be poorly implemented and can result in players wasting their time playing a bad strategy game instead of a good action or role-playing game. 4. Unbalanced gambling minigame: Open-world games commonly feature gambling minigames where players can bet in-game currency. As these mini-games can be an afterthought and poorly balanced, they are frequently exploited by players to destroy the difficulty curve for themselves by gaining unlimited money. This is worsened as they would gain these infinite resources in a repetitive, uninteresting manner rather than by playing the actual game. 5. Broken economy: Many open-world games feature a large variety of items and currencies, which are not always well balanced in terms of their value to the in-game economy. Thus players may find themselves able to become incredibly wealthy in unintended and unconventional ways. This can diminish the sense of reward given for major in-game accomplishments and destroy the difficulty curve for players who would find the game too easy with infinite resources. What do you think of those suggestions for your article? I would be happy to discuss any of these common criticisms of open-world games further to help you with your article.

"},{"question":"What is the moral of the story?Here is the story:There was once a young boy who had a problem controlling his temper. When he became angry, he would just say anything that came to his mind and hurt people. So his father gave him a bag of nails and a hammer and said, “Every time you get angry, hammer one nail into the fence in our backyard”.The first few days the boy hammered so many nails that he emptied half the bag. Over the weeks, the number of nails he hammered to the fence reduced and gradually, his temper was much in control. Then came a day when he didn’t lose his temper at all. His father asked him to remove one nail each day so that he manages to control his temper.Finally, on the day the child was removing the last nail, his father says, “You have done well, boy. But do you see the holes in the wall? The fence is never going to be the same, even after repainting. Likewise, when you say mean things in anger, you will leave a scar in the person’s mind, as the nails did to the fence”.1. It's okay if a child can't control his anger.2. The holes in the fence represent the boy's love.3. There is no moral to this story.4. Anger is like a knife. When you stab someone with a knife, the wound might heal but the scar remains.","answer":"4. Anger is like a knife.

Looking around, there's a long stretch of road both left and right of me. In front of me, there was no one. That's okay. I didn't tell anyone that I would be released today. It has been a long journey. Has it been 10 years? Maybe 20 years? Time doesn't feel real the longer you've been in prison. All I have are the clothes on my back and about 100 to my name. My family doesn't live in this state. I have no friends. To anyone asking, my life has become a blank slate. I could do anything I wanted. It might be easy to just do another crime so I can get housing. At least that would be guaranteed. But I want my freedom. The first steps outside felt nothing like the steps pacing around my cell trying to kill time. Cold winters and hot summers, I felt them all. Now, I can do anything I want to. First things though, I need to find housing that'll accept a previous convict. I'll take anything I can get for 100. I start to walk to the left, not sure if this direction will even take me to the closest town. I just moved on instinct. These feet know nothing else besides moving around in a circle.

Epidermis: The outside layer of the skin. New skin cells form at the bottom of this layer and then go to the top within two to four weeks. Each day, people naturally lose approximately 30,000 to 40,000 dead skin cells. This layer also has melanin, which gives skin its color. 2. Dermis: The middle layer of the skin. This layer has nerve endings that send messages to the spinal cord or brain to tell people how things feel. This layer also has tiny blood vessels that bring nutrients and oxygen to skin cells and remove waste. 3. Subcutaneous Layer: The bottom layer of the skin. This layer is mainly fat to help bodies stay warm and absorb shocks when hitting something. This layer also helps attach the skin to other tissues and has hair follicles to help body hair grow.

Make it serious, fun, and dangerous but with a happy ending.","answer":"Zeta was a young mage who had recently graduated from Magic School. But before she could become a full-fledged wizard, she still had to go through a magical rite of passage: conquering the Cave of Wonders and discovering its secret. This was no mere test; many mages had died trying to complete this task. First, Zeta had to take a long boat ride to the island where the cave was located. To her dismay, the boat left as soon she as she got out, making her wonder how she would ever get back home.Zeta stepped into the massive chamber. There were three rooms. The first room contained a series of puzzles that required her to cast spells she learned from school. She got through them all and was rewarded with a scroll with a single word on it. It was a strange word, one she didn't recognize. She tried casting a spell with it, but nothing happened.The second room contained a series of moving floors with an endless pit below. Zeta had to use every movement spell she knew to cross it safely. There were a couple of close calls, but she managed her way across. Again, her reward was a scroll with a mysterious word on it. It was a different word this time, but still it did nothing.The final room was filled with treasure. Diamonds, gold, priceless heirlooms, every valuable object imaginable. Just as Zeta was about to pick up a diamond, she sensed that death would befall her if she touched any of the treasure. With great effort, she walked past it all and received the third scroll containing the final word. Zeta returned to the main chamber. Suddenly, an orb appeared in the center. Zeta thought for a minute and realized that she had to cast a spell using the three words on the scrolls. The first two times she tried to do so, nothing happened because the order of the words wasn’t correct. The third time, though, she finally said the words in the right order and was instantly teleported to the Magic School. It was a teleportation spell! All of her friends who already passed the rite were waiting for her, ready to celebrate her success.

Add the year that Richard III died so it has some context in the article. Make sure to use American English spelling throughout.More than two centuries ago, the historian William Hutton noted Richard III's posthumous ability to divide opinion. For some, Richard possessed \\"angelic excellence\\"; others painted him in \\"the blackest dye\\". Hutton acknowledged that \\"Richard's character, like every man's, had two sides\\" before concluding wryly, \\"though most writers display but one\\". The public response to the spectacular discovery of his skeleton in a Leicester car park last year shows that little has changed. His bones are now as contested as his reputation, with distant descendants of the last Yorkist king claiming he should be reinterred in York rather than Leicester. There is, still, something about Richard.Interweaving two stories whose chapters dovetail throughout the book, The King's Grave claims to show Richard in a new light. Philippa Langley, the driving force behind the \\"Looking for Richard\\" project, gives a blow-by-blow account of the search, from fundraising to dig; historian Michael Jones, meanwhile, explores Richard's usurpation, reign and death at Bosworth, seeking to contextualise his grabbing of power and the disappearance, on his watch, of the princes in the Tower. Both authors, in their different ways, see the discovery of his grave as an opportunity to put the record straight, to \\"put a stop to the stigmatising and vilification\\" of Richard, and to \\"allow for complexity\\" in considering his personality and reign.","answer":"Over 200 years ago, a historian named William Hutton wrote about how Richard III's story still seems to cause people to have widely differing opinions about him. And this is for someone who died in 1485, over 500 years ago! Some people thought Richard was angelic and good while others thought he was evil. Hutton thought that every person has two sides but when writing about Richard III, he thought that most writers choose one side over the other. Even today, after the discovery of Richard III's skeleton in a parking lot in Leicester England, his story - and character - is still being argued about. Even some of his distant descendants want Richard III, as the last Yorkist king, to be buried in York rather than in Leicester. There are two sides to every person and in the book, The King's Grave, the writers are trying to show both sides to Richard. Philippa Langley was the person most responsible for the \\"Looking for Richard\\" project. In the book, she gives the story of how the project came about, how the fundraising helped, and how the dig progressed. The other writer, historian Michael Jones, is looking at the life of Richard III, including his reign and how he was killed at Bosworth Field. Jones is also questioning the disappearance of the two princes, Richard III's nephews, who were kept locked up in the Tower of London and eventually disappeared. Jones questions the fact that the boys disappeared while Richard was on the throne. Both Langley and Jones are treating the discovery of Richard III's skeleton as an opportunity to find out more about this king whose story seems to be continually rewritten.

Especially since now, I'm allowed to sleep at the foot of my human's bed.Anyway, you may not be aware of this - I know I wasn't at first - but most humans (and dogs too I guess) really enjoy continuing that sleep into the morning.

Consider adding some hanging baskets and window boxes as well.2. Red and Orange Plants - choose plants that have a bright red or orange bloom. These are attractive to hummingbirds and also rich in nectar.3. Groupings - group similar plants together and keep in mind blooming seasons so that there is always something blooming.4. Perches - leave some small branches and twigs exposed so the hummingbirds can easily stop and rest nearby.5. Pesticides - plan on either minimizing or ideally completely eliminating pesticides in your garden.6.

Cruise returns for the sequel (as the title bears his character, Pete \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell's name) as well as an appearance by Val Kilmer, who played \\"Iceman\\" in the first film. The cast is rounded out by stellar performances from newcomers to the series, including Miles Teller and Jon Hamm, among others.\\"Maverick\\" follows the story of Cruise's Maverick, now a Captain in the United States Navy, who is assigned to become the new instructor of the Navy's Top Gun school for elite pilots. The mission this time: teach the new pilots to fly a dangerous mission behind enemy lines and disable their weapons capabilities before they decide to strike domestic soil. Upon his return to Top Gun, Maverick rekindles a long-lost love in the movie's new female co-lead, Penny, played by acclaimed actress Jennifer Connelly.

Learn some tricks that use ordinary objects that you might have on your person (coins, paper money, a piece of thread) or something that would be available at a party (playing cards, drinking cups). 4. Play a game - Always sure to get a party started and encourage mixing and mingling among partygoers, playing a game can be entertaining and will give you a chance to get to know others in a fun setting. Play a physical game like Twister or Charades, card games like Poker or Hearts, or board games like Monopoly.5. Show off some interesting pictures - People love looking at photos and getting to know what others look like in candid situations. If you have photos of yourself on vacation to an exotic location or simply having fun during a recent trip, consider showing them around at the party. They will give insight into who you are as a person, and it may also allow others to show you what pictures they have of themselves."},{"question":"Write an acrostic poem about fishing using the word lakes","answer":"Lit up by the bright blue sky All filled with fish waiting to fly Knock on wood that you’ll catch a fish Everyone knows you never speak too soon on the lake Stress-fee living on the blue "},{"question":"My dear friend Sue has taken a big leap and started her own business!

Funded with Soviet money, early projections suggested that the completion of the first reactor alone would have catered to over 15% of Cuba’s energy needs [1]. Inside Cuba's Unfinished Nuclear Power StationConstruction began in 1983, as the foundations were lain for the two reactors along with a sizeable turbine hall at a site close to the Caribbean.

It cocked its head to the right as if it had asked me a question. I sighed in relief. But the fox turned and leaped back through the alfalfa, his bushy tail gracing the violet blooms.

Her usual colleagues were sitting around the table, but one seat had been occupied by a large bear wearing a suit and tie.Janice was taken aback by the sight, but as she looked around, she noticed everyone else acted as though nothing was out of the ordinary. Not wanting to cause a scene, she cautiously sat down and did her best to act as if this was normal. As the meeting began in earnest, she noticed the bear nodding at the right moments, pretending to take notes, and even attempting to join in on the conversation with deep-sounding grunts, but despite its best efforts, the bear's awkward movements and vocalizations became increasingly apparent until Janice could no longer ignore them.\\"Excuse me,\\" Janice finally spoke up for all to hear. \\"Is that a bear?\\"The room went silent, and all eyes turned to her.

Above all, practice, strong working routines, and a commitment to depth are at the heart of success as a writer. Hard-earned experience brings the ability to write good content with few errors, quickly, and then it’s just a matter of applying the proper discipline and structure. One of the least-appreciated things about mental work is that you simply can’t do it for eight-hour stretches like physical work. Instead of trying to stretch out work time, the most important thing to do is maximize the quality of your writing time. Setting a chair and table on the balcony and leaving phones and other devices out of sight is a great start to immersing yourself in your work. Commit to highly productive stretches of work for 60-90 minutes, then take a break, move around, and give your mind and eyes a rest. It’s entirely possible to achieve four or five such streaks a day, and the quality and reliability of the work will be far greater than that of an eight-hour session of distracted and inconsistent work.

They were going to put them in a dinosaur zoo! They called it Jurassic Park. Elmo would love to see a dinosaur zoo. Wouldn’t you?But there was a problem before the zoo was finished. Some of the dinosaurs were dangerous and they hurt a worker. The zoo’s leaders needed some experts to make sure it would be a good zoo. So, they called some dinosaur experts along with a math expert for some reason. The experts took a tour along with some kids. But a bad guy caused more problems. He wanted to steal stuff, and he turned off all the electricity so nobody would know what he was doing. When the power was out, the dinosaurs escaped! Another person got hurt by the T-rex dinosaur and the rest of them had to run away. They spent all day and night getting back to the zoo’s main building where the workers were. Meanwhile, the workers and one of the dino experts had a lot of trouble turning the electricity back on. Elmo usually just flips the light switch, but they had to go to a special building to do it. The first guy who tried got hurt by some smart and speedy dinosaurs called Raptors. Eventually, they turned the power on, but the dinosaurs were already loose.After the people who ran away finally walked back to the building, they had to hide from the raptors. The Raptors almost got them, but a T-rex showed up just in time and protected them! That gave them a chance to go to a helicopter and fly away from the island!It sure is a scary story, but it’s also exciting, don’t you think? What would you do at a zoo full of dinosaurs?

"},{"question":"Determine whether the author of this op-ed supports or opposes new abortion laws based on the following excerpt:The South Carolina House once again passed a ban on abortion at six weeks, before many know they are pregnant, setting up a clash in the state Senate, where five female lawmakers had previously mounted a successful filibuster (the state Supreme Court had struck down a virtually identical law last year, but since the court’s composition changed, Republicans are betting that the new court will reverse course). And in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, one of the likely frontrunners for the 2024 GOP nomination, signed into law another six-week ban with narrow exceptions (the state’s ultraconservative Supreme Court is expected to overturn existing precedent and allow the law to go into effect).For those seeking abortions, or women experiencing life-threatening conditions that may not fit narrow exceptions to abortion bans, the closest option in the South may be Virginia, where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is pushing for a ban at 15 weeks, or Washington, DC.With travel becoming prohibitively expensive and often complex, this region — known for the nation’s worst maternal mortality rates — will almost certainly be an even more dangerous place to be pregnant. For some, it comes as no surprise that the South would define itself as an anti-abortion region. But in reality its status as the center of anti-abortion America was not historically inevitable.","answer":"The author opposes the new abortion laws. This is because of the sentence, \\"With travel becoming prohibitively expensive and often complex, this region — known for the nation’s worst maternal mortality rates — will almost certainly be an even more dangerous place to be pregnant.\\" This shows that the author believes that these new laws are harmful to women and are therefore bad."},{"question":"Write a piece of prose about how it feels to experience romantic love for someone who is far away.

Currently, the USPS allows mailboxes to be painted any color and offers no restrictions regarding the color of the box. One regulation regarding the color of your mailbox has to do with the carrier flag.

Chandler recommended using currant or crab-apple jelly. What really made the sandwich popular was that during World War II, peanut butter and jelly were on the military list of rations. With peanut butter being shelf-stable and transportable, grapelade (grape jelly) also portable and sweet, plus newly available pre-sliced bread--peanut butter and jelly became a huge part of the U.S. soldier's life.  Once those soldiers came home, peanut butter and jelly sales skyrocketed.  Kids and parents loved it because it was easy to make and tasty. "},{"question":"What is the difference between a panster and a plotter? Is one better than the other? I am writing a blog post on it, but for right now I just wasnt some brief tips so I can research further. For now, just a couple of paragraphs is fine, I just need something to get me going.","answer":"A panster writes \\"by the seat of their pants\\". They start with a general idea, or maybe even just a character, and just let the story go where their imagination goes. Stephen King, Diana Gabaldon, and George R.R. Martin are great examples of pansters.  A plotter is a writer who outlines the story before they write a word of it. The most famous plotters are J.K. Rowling and James Patterson. Then, there are authors who combine a bit of both, like Agatha Christie. As far as what is best, it really depends on both the writer and the story. A panster may write an entire first draft without outlining. A plotter usually outlines everything first - settings, characters, scenes - and then starts writing. The drawback to pantsing is the writer might box themselves into a corner and need to re-write. The drawback to plotting is that as the story continues, the characters begin driving the story and tweaks need to be made. Genre is also a consideration, as it is much easier to pants science fiction than a mystery. "},{"question":"Can you help me write an email to my husband explaining why we need a vacation?

Where Do Foxes Live In Winter?Extremely adaptable, foxes live in various environments ranging from the forest, prairie, and tundra, to places inhabited by humans like farmlands and urban areas. As the fox’s natural habitat disappears, they move into urban and suburban areas to look for food.Foxes are found on every continent except Antarctica.There are at least 12 species, five of which live in the continental United States. Two types of foxes are most known for living in towns, cities, and other urban areas. The most common kinds of foxes you may see in your neighborhood are the Gray Fox and the Red Fox.In CitiesFoxes love habitats with lots of variety in vegetation and prey.That is why they are often found on the edges of different ecosystems. For example, foxes love suburban areas because it is where the forest meets the city. These edge spaces provide more diversity in food and prey. Foxes aren’t anything to be afraid of, however! Here’s what to do if you see a fox in your yard.DensFoxes do not migrate long distances. Instead, they stay near home. To prepare for the birth of her kits, a female fox finds an enclosed shelter to inhabit or modify for her young. While the female fox may be a stay-at-home parent, the male is responsible for providing food for his growing family.Other Animals ShelterA fox may dig a den, but will likely steal shelter from other small mammals like rabbits or chipmunks.Like other predators, foxes will conserve their energy as necessary. If the work has already been completed, why waste time digging another den?Holes In The GroundA fox may commandeer a den from another small mammal, or they may find a natural hole in the ground to make their den.Rainwater runoff that creates erosion as it flows downhill often hollows out loamy soil enough to create an open-air hole in the earth, perfect for a family of foxes in winter. Hollowed Out Tree StumpsUnlike the red fox, a gray fox prefers above-ground dens, such as a hollowed-out tree stump. When a tree dies, it rots from the inside out, creating a perfectly insulated home to raise young and store food.If you come across a fallen tree, look for a hollowed-out stump nearby. You might spot a fox family!Rock CrevicesIf your environment includes mountains or other rock formations, you may find your neighborhood fox living in a rock.To humans, this may seem like a damp and dismal location for a home, but to a fox, a cave provides shelter from the elements and insulation from extreme temperatures.Rock crevices are a common place to find foxes during the day.In The SnowIf foxes do not have young ones to care for, they can sleep outside in the snow. Their thick fur keeps their skin warm and dry.In addition, snow built up around and over the fox adds insulation and keeps the fox warm. Foxes are well suited to winter climates in their range; they prepare for winter by eating excess food and storing fat deposits on their body.As a result, foxes are very comfortable in the snow!","answer":"Foxes can be found in many environments including forests, prairies, tundras, farmlands, and urban regions near forests.

Include the date April 28, 2023 at the top.","answer":"Letter to the EditorApril 28, 2023Topic: Road RepairsI am a homeowner in [Town]. My house is a 30-minute commute by car to my place of work. Every day, I drive the I-100 route from my home to work, from my home to the grocery store, or from my home to the school my kids attend to pick them up. And every day that I travel on the I-100, I am greeted by the approximately 100 potholes dotted along the 1-mile-long stretch of road. I am familiar with the number of potholes in the road because I have been traveling over this dilapidated roadway for close to two years now, wondering when the local authorities will decide to fix it and make it driveable again.I'll be clear when I say that [Town] is not a rainy place, nor is it a place that experiences many earthquakes or other natural disasters that could render the road undrivable. However, the I-100 is a frequently used public throughway - one that can see anywhere between 50-100 cars a minute on a slow day! Most - if not all - commuters of the I-100 rely on this stretch of road to get to the many surrounding areas including shops, schools, businesses, and gas stations. By leaving the road unfixed for two years, the local government has done its constituents a huge disservice and has left many of us with a bad taste in our mouths.I refuse to believe that the insane amount of money I pay in taxes to my local government is being misappropriated or mishandled in such a way that they can spend money to build a brand-new park but can't spend enough money to fix the road leading to it. It is unconscionable that our government would be this backward in its thinking.So, consider this idea for a change: instead of printing stories about the new animals at the zoo or why almond milk prices are increasing, maybe print a story or two to give some exposure to the issues that matter. In this case, you can talk about why the local government is refusing to spend money on much-needed infrastructure repair.- [Signature]"},{"question":"Can you write me a bash script that runs a program 50 times and calculates the average and standard deviation of the time it takes to run.

Write it in a casual, upbeat and energetic voice and use personal anecdotal experience as the framework to explain these concepts. ","answer":"Hey yogis! Today we're going to talk about the secret to nailing arm balances and inversion poses. Before you roll your eyes and groan that you're not strong enough, skinny enough, or flexible enough, hear me out! I'm convinced that none of these challenges are actually deal breakers when it comes to unlocking these intimidating poses, and hopefully, by the end of this post, you will be, too. Every time I unlock a new, difficult pose--whether it's a crow pose, handstand, or flying splits--I'm always shocked at how easy it feels. That's because these poses don't actually require as much strength or flexibility as we usually believe they do. Sure, core strength is an integral element of any balance pose, but you don't need washboard abs. Getting into these poses in the first place doesn't require extraordinary strength, but it does require the following: -Alignment. Standing on your hands is relatively easy when you stack your shoulders over your wrists and hips over your shoulders. You'll run into trouble if your hands are too close together or too far apart. -Engaged core. Even if your abs are fairly weak, you can still activate the core as you land in the pose to build strength while practicing and to make your body feel lighter (just like in \\"light as a feather, stiff as a board\\").-Hand posture. To balance on the hands, your palms need to be slightly tented and fingers spread, gripping the mat like claws. This gives your fingers room to move and steady your balance if you feel like you might fall, whereas if they're already flat on the mat, they can't do anything to help you. -Drishti. Holding a focal point with your gaze is one of the most important keys to balance poses. If your eyes start wandering around the room, you will start wobbling. It also is helpful to send your gaze forward in balances and inversions. If you look down, you will likely fall down. -Belief. Fear is probably the single greatest hurdle that aspiring arm balancers need to overcome. It's understandable--no one wants to fall on their face. But you might be surprised how effective it is to relax, visualize yourself in a pose, and even use little cheats to prove to yourself that you're capable.

This theory explains several concepts that are relevant in the observable world: the composition of a pure gold necklace, what makes the pure gold necklace different than a pure silver necklace, and what occurs when pure gold is mixed with pure copper. Before discussing the atomic theory, this article explains the theories that Dalton used as a basis for his theory: the law of conservation of mass and the law of constant composition.Law of Conservation of Mass: (1766-1844)The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass present before a chemical reaction is the same as the total mass present after the chemical reaction; in other words, mass is conserved. The law of conservation of mass was formulated by Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) as a result of his combustion experiment, in which he observed that the mass of his original substance—a glass vessel, tin, and air—was equal to the mass of the produced substance—the glass vessel, “tin calx”, and the remaining air.Historically, this was a difficult concept for scientists to grasp. If this law was true, then how could a large piece of wood be reduced to a small pile of ashes? The wood clearly has a greater mass than the ashes. From this observation scientists concluded that mass had been lost. However, the illustration below shows that the burning of word does follow the law of conservation of mass. Scientists did not take into account the gases that play a critical role in this reaction.Law of Constant CompositionJoseph Proust (1754-1826) formulated the law of constant composition (also called the law of definite proportions). This law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance. Joseph Proust based this law primarily on his experiments with basic copper carbonate. The illustration below depicts this law; 31 grams of H2O and 8 grams of H2O are made up of the same percent of hydrogen and oxygen.","answer":"Welcome to the online course \\"Unraveling the Atomic Theory: A Journey into Mass and Composition!\\" In this course, we will explore the scientific theory proposed by John Dalton[1766-1844] known as the Atomic Theory. Get ready to uncover the secrets behind the composition of matter and its observable properties.

Put a cat joke after each paragraph, at the start of the article and the end. Put a space between each joke and paragraph. Keep the tone light and humorous.","answer":"What's a cat's favorite show? Claw and Order.Some 14,000 years ago, animals started trading their role as predators or prey for pets. Dogs of course made the transition first when wolves became human's companions and protectors. Cats, however, waited to join human society until around 8,000 years ago. Cats hung around villages and cities to catch rodents after the latter quickly learned that crops were an easy meal. Humans accepted cats after noticing they kept the rodent population in check, and cats decided that living among people wasn't all that bad.What do cats like to eat on a hot day? A mice-cream cone.Today cats and dogs have shed their predator and prey images and even their pet status. Dogs spend their days at doggie daycare, serve as ring bearers for weddings, enjoy a trip to the beach and dress up for Halloween. Cats own the internet with rumba-riding cat videos, sleep on their human's beds and eat food fit for people.  Owning a pet has been shown to help lower blood pressure, relieve stress and depression and increase the human life span. But perhaps the greatest benefit of having a pet is the unconditional love and companionship they provide. In return, cats and dogs are loved and cherished and considered vital family members.Why did the cat eat lemons? He was a sour puss!"},{"question":"Can you explain how electric heaters work? Include the mechanics behind them in simple terms. Also include at least 2 reasons why switching to an electric heater is a good idea. Keep it between 100-150 words.","answer":"Electric heaters work by sending electricity through a heating element inside of the heater. The heating element is made with some type of electrically resistant material and that resistance causes the element’s temperature to rise and begin emitting heat. This heat is typically transferred to the heater’s core before sending it to the casing of the heater which holds onto that heat and transfers it to its surroundings. Electric heaters are a great addition to your home because they are highly energy efficient compared to other popular electric heating methods. Many of them are also programmable which allows you to keep the temperature of your home at the right temperature at all times of the day."},{"question":"Why do some countries restrict trade?","answer":"Trade restrictions are typically undertaken to protect companies and workers in the home economy from competition by foreign firms. A protectionist policy is one in which a country restricts the importation of goods and services produced in foreign countries."},{"question":"My house has a spooky vibe. Do you have to disclose that your house is haunted when you go to sell it? Mention any applicable laws. Keep it under 175 words. It should only be one paragraph.","answer":"Typically when a house goes on the market, most states require you to fill out a disclosure form that lays out any known issues with the house. No states require hauntings or paranormal activity in the disclosures, so potential ghostly activity does not legally need to be disclosed. Minnesota is the only state that mentions hauntings in its disclosure law, and that is to relieve sellers from having to disclose any non-material facts, including any perceived paranormal activity. If you are specifically asked if a house is haunted, you may choose to answer that truthfully. There are also cases where hauntings are open and notorious. This is when hauntings are well-known and the home may be stigmatized, which could affect the material value of the home. A home that was the location of a high-profile murder, for instance, could fall into this category. If your home just has a “spooky vibe,” that is not something that legally needs to be disclosed."},{"question":"Please classify this piece of text.

Here is the text:As the growth of the cotton industry led inexorably to an increased demand for enslaved Africans, the prospect of slave rebellion—such as the one that triumphed in Haiti in 1791—drove slaveholders to make increased efforts to prevent a similar event from happening in the South. Also in 1793, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which made it a federal crime to assist an enslaved person trying to escape. Though it was difficult to enforce from state to state, especially with the growth of abolitionist feeling in the North, the law helped enshrine and legitimize slavery as an enduring American institution.","answer":"In 1793, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act that prohibited people from assisting people escaping from slavery."},{"question":"Write a post for my lifestyle blog.

Frida was the smallest elephant in her village by a long shot. Her legs were wobbly, and her trunk was thin. The other elephants never made fun of her, but they never asked for her help with anything. If something big needed to be moved, they asked Max. Max was the biggest, strongest elephant in the whole town. Everyone loved him because he helped them and because, as even Frida could admit, he looked REALLY cool. There wasn't a problem Max couldn't solve. Or at least, that's what everyone thought...One day, the whole village was celebrating the birthday of the very youngest in the group - Maggie. Frida always felt awkward because, even though Maggie was much younger than her, Frida was much, much smaller than Maggie. But she went to the party anyways, determined to have a good time. Just as the cake cutting was about to begin, however, Maggie let out a loud yelp. Everyone turned to look. Maggie's birthday balloon was floating away into the sky! And to make matters worse, she had tied her favorite stuffie, Poppy, to the end of the balloon! Everyone watched in fear as Poppy and the balloon came to rest on the top branch of the tallest tree in the village. It was a very old and VERY big tree -- alive for much longer than any of the elephants in the town. No one knew what to do!!Max was determined to get the balloon down. He wrapped his trunk around the tree and tried to uproot the whole thing, but as much as he tugged and grunted, the tree stood firm. Maggie started to cry. Suddenly, Frida had an idea! It might not work, she thought, but she was the only one who could do it! To the amazement of everyone at the party, Frida started to CLIMB the tree! Now, of course, any normal elephant would be much too heavy for a tree, but Frida was no normal elephant! She climbed to the top, carefully untied Poppy and the balloon, and brought them safely back to the ground. The whole town cheered! From then on, Frida was a hero too, and a reminder that the strongest isn't always the best.

Don't use any rhyming words. Kendrick's spirit feels present at many points on Malibu. .Paak's quicksilver flow on \\"Your Prime\\" feels teleported in directly from To Pimp a Butterfly as the music flows expansively from creamy soul harmonies to trap cadences.

And now they can add hanging out with therapy dogs to that list. Virtual canine comfort is emerging as a successful way for students to reduce their stress as they interact with therapy dog-handler teams.Because they are nonjudgmental, engaging and welcoming, interacting with therapy dogs can be used as a complementary intervention that reduces student stress which may encourage students to seek more formal support services if needed. Once introduced on campus, the interest from students typically surpasses most programs’ abilities to meet the demand.Even prior to COVID-19, being a college student was considered a stressful experience; college administrators have increasingly been seeking innovative ways to encourage students to safeguard their mental health. Spending time with therapy dogs is one proactive way for students to chip away at potentially debilitating levels of heightened stress.In-person canine visitation programs or canine-assisted interventions are themselves a relatively new way for students to enhance their well-being. Programs such as the University of British Columbia’s Building Academic Retention through K9s (B.A.R.K.) program at the Okanagan campus was established in 2012 as a way for students to reduce their homesickness, decrease their stress and foster interpersonal connections.Analysis of the world, from expertsSeveral randomized controlled trials out of the B.A.R.K. lab, and elsewhere, now attest to the efficacy of spending time with therapy dogs to elicit a host of well-being outcomes.Restrictions on in-person sessions saw the B.A.R.K. program collaborate with human-animal interaction researcher Christine Tardif-Williams’ pre-recorded virtual canine comfort modules.We set out to conceptualize, design and deliver a series of virtual canine comfort modules that mirrored, as close as possible, the experience of students in an in-person canine visitation session. These sessions consisted of a trained dog-handler team following a script that saw handlers welcome students and encourage reflection around stress reduction and mindfulness. Students were also asked to reflect on their social support networks.Students could access these modules remotely, which support the well-being of students who are geographically isolated or in areas where well-being resources are overtaxed or nonexistent.The modules are posted online on a platform that students (and others) can access without needing to sign-up for an appointment or join a waitlist.The University of British Columbia’s B.A.R.K. program studies how canine therapy can support students and others.Stress reductionPrior to releasing these modules, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess how the modules would affect students’ self-ratings of stress. We assigned 467 undergraduate students to either synchronous (via Zoom) or asynchronous (pre-recorded YouTube videos) five-minute sessions that invited them to observe a dog—handler team or a handler-only condition.We assessed well-being before and after the sessions using measures like anxiety, loneliness, connections to others, positive and negative affect. We found that all students, regardless of condition, reported significant pre-to-post improvements in self-reports of most well-being measures. However, the conditions in which the therapy dog was present elicited the most significant reduction in self-reports of stress.Although additional research is needed, these initial findings are encouraging. They support the contention that, for students for whom attending in-person sessions are not an option, accessing virtual canine therapy modules can offer a momentary reduction in stress.Unlike in-person sessions that are scheduled at the convenience of program personnel, virtual canine comfort modules may be accessed as needed by students. Further, college instructors can make use of virtual canine comfort modules as part of “brain breaks” incorporated into a lecture to encourage students to reflect on, and take care of, their well-being.","answer":"B.A.R.K., or the University of British Columbia's \\"Building Academic Retention through K9s\\" is a program established at this university's Okanagan campus in 2012. The main focus was to overall reduce stress, reduce homesickness, and to develop personal relationships with these canines. With the increase of online courses, B.A.R.K. ran several trials to see if therapy dogs would make an impact somehow in online classes.The results from these trials showed many outstanding benefits for students and their mental health, including;- Reduced feelings of Anxiety.- Reduced feelings of loneliness.- Improved connections with other classmates.These results have come from self-reports of well-being from the students."},{"question":"I have so many plastic grocery bags at my house and I would like to do something besides just throw them away. Give me some ideas for ways to reuse them at least one more time, even if they are then thrown away eventually.","answer":"Those plastic grocery bags certainly can multiply quickly. There are many uses for them. Here is a list of ways to reuse your bags at least one more time before throwing them away:1. Line your small trash cans. Smaller trash cans such as the ones in the bathroom can be lined with plastic grocery bags, which helps to keep the can clean and odor-free.2. Use them as emergency trash bags for the car. Keep a handful of bags rolled up in the glove box so they're handy when you're out and need one.3. Use them as wet bags. Take a few plastic grocery bags with you the next time you visit the pool or beach. They can be great for keeping wet clothes and towels separate.4. Pack your shoes in them in suitcases. Instead of putting your shoes loosely in your suitcase, put them in a plastic grocery bag to keep the soles from dirtying your clean clothes.5. Pick up dog poop. Keep a handful handy for dog walks, and use plastic grocery bags instead of buying poop bags.6. Stuff some into your shoes and purses to help them to retain their shape. Ball up plastic grocery bags and stuff all the shoes and purses in your closet.7. Use them for packing and moving. You can wrap a few bags around breakables before packing them into boxes to protect them from breakage. 8. Store paint brushes or rollers in them. When you're going to come back to your painting project, just put your wet brush or roller into a bag until later. 9. Line a paint tray. Using a plastic bag to line your paint tray will make cleanup super easy when you're done.10. Line your cat's litter box. Having a plastic bag in the litter box makes cleaning out the box so much easier, eliminating the need to empty and wash it.

I never used to be like this. I used to be a normal human, going along my life with a stable job, good friends, and a healthy diet. I felt like I was at a pretty good point in my life. One day, a few friends and I went to a casino to celebrate one of our friend's birthday. Simple enough, right? We got a few drinks, gambled a bit, and went home merry, no harm at all. I had never gambled before, but there couldn't have been too much to it, right? We started at a poker table. The dealer explained the rules to me and what a \\"Hit\\" and a \\"Stand\\" meant. My friends were pretty giddy, throwing 100 down at the table instantly and grabbing their poker chips. It was for a good occasion, so I also put 100 down on the table. We got our cards and had some fun. On one turn, I called hit and got 21! I must've won about 1,000 at that table alone! My friends were a little jealous, but it was all in good fun. We left the poker table and went to a roulette table next. I used to see these in movies all the time where the actors would always score big. I figured since I won a lot at poker, I could afford to throw a bit more money here. I put down 250 at the table and called black. The roulette started and the sound of the ball rolling around the spinning roulette was hypnotic. I was enjoying the cheers of the crowd hoping to influence the speed of the ball as it continued spinning. Slowly the ball started jumping around, and it landed on 15, black. I won! It was exhilarating. My friends and I all cheered and drank some more. It was a good day.Fast forward to today. I keep coming back to this casino, hoping to get the same thrill that I had that day. It might be impossible, but I keep trying. Something is telling me to keep going. So I pull the lever once more.Please gamble responsibly.

Add some tips, too.","answer":"Ingredients:- 1 cup all-purpose flour- 2 tablespoons sugar- 2 teaspoons baking powder- 1/2 teaspoon salt- 1 cup milk- 1 egg- 2 tablespoons vegetable oilInstructions:1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then add the milk and vegetable oil. Whisk together until well combined.3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix - a few lumps are okay.4. Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop the batter onto the pan for each pancake.5. Cook the pancakes for 2-3 minutes on one side, or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to look set.6. Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown.7. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as butter and syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.Tips:- For fluffier pancakes, separate the egg and beat the egg white until stiff peaks form. Fold the beaten egg white into the batter just before cooking.- To keep the pancakes warm while you cook the rest of the batch, place them on a baking sheet in a preheated 200°F oven.- If you prefer thinner pancakes, add a little more milk to the batter. If you prefer thicker pancakes, use less milk.- Experiment with different flavor additions, such as vanilla extract, cinnamon, or blueberries, to make your pancakes extra delicious.

He also thinks he would be great as a duo with cheddar cheese or almond butter. Keep it under 400 words.","answer":"In a time not so long ago, in a vast and beautiful apple orchard, there was an apple named McIntosh. His friends called him Mac. Mac was a very special apple, not only because he was juicy, tart, plump, and sweet, but also because he had a grand plan to save the world.You see, McIntosh was convinced that the best way to keep the world healthy and happy was by keeping the doctor away. But how could he do that? By being the perfect fruit, of course! Everyone knows that an apple a day keeps the doctors away. McIntosh made it his mission in life to be the most nutritious and delicious apple in the entire orchard. That way anyone who ate him would be filled with energy, vitamins, and even joy.Mac loved the idea of making people happy, and what makes people happier than a healthy, warm, delicious apple pie?  Apple pies bring people together and make them smile. He dreamed of being the star ingredient in every salad, snack, and dessert, his crisp skin contrasting perfectly bibb lettuce, edamame, or a buttery crust, and the scent of cinnamon and sugar filling the air.Of course, MacIntosh couldn't save the world all alone. He needed a partner, someone who would complement his flavor, texture, and nutrients. That's when he had an amazing idea: why not team up with a healthy partner like cheddar cheese or almond butter? Mac knew that cheddar cheese was the perfect match for his tartness, acidity, and crunchy texture and that together, they could create a hearty dish that would satisfy even the pickiest eaters. And as for almond butter, he imagined a creamy and nutty spread that would compliment his crunchiness, elevate his tart sweetness to a whole new level, and turn every snack into a healthy and scrumptious treat. Why choose only one sidekick? They could be a terrific trio!So, with his mission crystal clear, and his dream pie and snack already in the making, MacIntosh set out to save the world, one healthy, juicy bite at a time. Who knows, maybe someday, he will become the most beloved fruit in the world and everyone will eat him daily. This way, the apple that everyone loves and trusts, will heal the world, keep the doctor away, and be the hero that saves the day."},{"question":"Create 10 titles for possible short stories for children.

It should have a section called Authority at a Glance, which wil include definitions of domain, page, and professional authority. Include a section called Ratings and Reviews at a Glance that discusses what review sites are and a big-picture idea of how they can help or hurt a brand. This should be under 400 words. ","answer":"Boost Your Ratings and Reviews for More AuthorityThanks to the internet, anyone can publish content online. It’s getting to be a crowded space, but those who have authority will be able to build their brand and increase their profits more easily. Authority at a GlanceWhat is meant by authority? It can mean different things. Authority operates on several levels. There is domain authority, page authority, and professional authority.Domain Authority - Domain authority relates to your domain traffic. Is your URL a frequently visited site that attracts not only new but repeat visitors? Or do they visit once and click out?Page Authority - Page authority is often measured by search engine results. Is your page in the top 10 on the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) delivered by Google and other top search engines?Professional Authority - Regarding professional authority within your niche, name recognition would often measure your level of authority. Would your name garner instant recognition from fellow experts in your niche?If you’re struggling with all three of these areas, paying attention to your ratings and reviews can help improve your authority and garner more sales. Ratings and Reviews at a GlanceYour reputation has a lot to do with your authority level, whether you are looking at domain authority, page authority, or professional authority. One of the easiest and most effective ways to boost your authority is to make it a point to give your ratings and reviews a little TLC. However, before you can get to work on that, you need to know more about ratings and reviews, as well as where to find them.Ratings and reviews can be found on \\"review sites\\" such as Yelp, as well as other places online such as social media sites and even on your own website. If you are a brick-and-mortar business, you know just how your ratings can encourage or discourage people's visiting habits. Some rating sites will also allow people to post reviews. Again, reviews can make or break a business, especially if they are not accurate. A malicious poster can trash the reputation you’ve worked so hard to build with just the click of a mouse. Conversely, a high rating and good review can build consumer confidence and make those who read the information more willing to give your business a chance."},{"question":"I'm trying to learn how to meditate and am struggling to maintain focus and block distractions. Give me some tips on how to get into a regular meditation practice that I can do in the morning before work. Don't include tips that require me to go outside.","answer":"Here are some helpful tips for learning how to maintain focus during a morning meditation!1. Start small and build upIf you have trouble maintaining focus throughout your entire meditation, start with just two or three minutes. Once your body and mind get used to the feeling of meditation, maintaining stillness will become easier. Build slowly, adding a minute or two every week. You can even set a timer so you don't have to focus on how long it's been. 2. Use the Hong-Sau TechniqueTo perform the Hong-Sau Technique, sit perfectly upright with your legs folded. Slowly inhale for a count of eight, and then slowly exhale for the same count. During your inhale, say \\"hong\\" in your head. On each exhale, say \\"sau\\" in your head. Repeat six times to gain concentration and focus. 3. Focus on comfortInstead of trying to maintain perfect posture, try to choose a position that is comfortable for you. Find a place with limited distractions where you can feel at peace. If you're more comfortable laying down or keeping your eyes open, that's ok too. 4. Consume raisins Studies show that eating about half a cup of raisins, which contain boron, can help improve focus and attentiveness. 5. Try a guided meditationGuided meditation can help you maintain focus and eliminate distractions by providing something to give you something to concentrate on that is related to your practice. 6. Use earplugsEarplugs are a great way to eliminate distractions from outside noises. Noise-canceling headphones or white noise is another way to remove noisy distractions. Let me know if you would like any more suggestions, or if you want me to expand on any of the ideas listed here!"},{"question":"Write a short personal essay for high school English class in 1994. The student can spell and punctuate well but she's pretty cringey.","answer":"Who am I? You ask. To understand that, you first have to understand who my boyfriend and friends are. I first met my boyfriend, Christopher Michael Bradley, at the skating rink on September 26, 1992. I'll always remember the day he asked me out for the first time. Our very first date was to go see the movie Aladdin together at Eastland Mall. He's sweet and funny and very special. My other best friends are Melina, Kisha, Kim, and Leighann. I love hanging out with them, and I love it when Kim does my nails most of all. Sometimes we get out in Kisha's Jeep and just drive all around town with nowhere to go. We love to go to the movies together, have sleepovers, go out and eat, dance, and try to meet cute guys. That brings me to who I am. I'm a girl who is really good at writing things -- stories, essays, plays, and poems, for example. I sing high soprano in the school ensemble, and I love playing the piano. I'm good with kids and animals and great at doing hair and makeup. I also love doodling all over everything, even if I'm not really good at art. If you look in my locker, you'll see pieces of who I am: all of my school books, my cheerleading uniform, juice, Aqua-Net hairspray, a ton of makeup in my Caboodle, fresh white socks (always have extras), other people's clothes, notes from Kisha, and whatever I happen to be selling to raise money for STUCO. The things I love also tell a story about who I am. My favorite thing to wear is a green velvet dress. I love wide-legged jeans, palazzo pants,  short shorts, rompers, empire waist tops, and my black-and-white polka dot bikini. I adore a steamy romance novel, going to basketball games, and listening to alternative music after midnight on the college radio station. My favorite perfumes are Love's Baby Soft, Vanilla Fields, and Calvin Klein Obsession. Most importantly, my favorite class is English because I love writing essays like these. In conclusion, who I am is just a regular girl who loves her friends and the English language. I suppose I'm pretty boring, after all.

It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located about 50 mi (80 km) east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties. In addition to being Oregon's highest mountain, it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence, and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America.The height assigned to Mount Hood's snow-covered peak has varied over its history. Modern sources point to three different heights: 11,249 ft (3,429 m), a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey (NGS),[1] 11,240 ft (3,426 m) based on a 1993 scientific expedition,[6] and 11,239 ft (3,425.6 m)[7] of slightly older origin. The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields. It is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range.[8] Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt,[9] though based on its history, an explosive eruption is unlikely. Still, the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7%, so the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) characterizes it as \\"potentially active\\", but the mountain is informally considered dormant.[10]Mount Hood is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc.

Ethereum (ETH) - Russian-founded Ethereum is an application platform that puts storage resources across the internet, and it's similar to peer-to-peer streaming services. The resources on Ethereum are paid by Ether, which is the cryptocurrency the platform is named after. Ethereum allows for contracts built into its software DNA, and the currency pays out when conditions are met. You can mine Ether with Ethereum's resources, and it is possible for the cryptocurrency to go through inflation.3. Ripple (XRP) - The Ripple cryptocurrency is controlled by Ripple Labs Inc, which is connected to the banking industry. Ripple has been taken on by large banking companies such as Bank of America and UPS, and it's used in securing transactions internationally. Ripple comes with low transaction fees and a high speed.4. Zcash (Zec) - Bitcoin transactions are on public record, but Zcash is a private currency. It has a \\"zero-knowledge\\" security implementation, which makes it a safe option. It also works with a blockchain mechanism that doesn't link old and current transactions. Zcash can be mined with a gaming GPU.5. Dash (DASH) - The name dash comes from the words digital and cash, and it used to be called Xcoin and then Darkcoin.

The machine was excited to be seeing the happy faces of children getting ice cream and to be dispensing bubble gum to them as well. Life became swell at the ice cream shop. Business was good. Kids came in and got so excited when they would get a brightly colored gumball. One rainy day, the machine noticed the man who owned the shop bringing in a door for the kitchen. The door was set up to block customers from getting back into restricted areas. The machine thought the door was so interesting. Later when the door was set up, the machine asked it if it was excited about its new job. The door said, \\"Yes, of course, and I can't wait to meet new friends. How long have you been here? Is it busy? Are there a lot of kids?\\" The machine thought it was cute how curious the door was. They talked for hours. The next day was very busy. Many people were coming in and out of the new door. The machine took notice and started to realize just how beautiful the door was. When the shop had a quiet moment, the machine looked at the door and said, \\"You're doing a great job on your first busy day. I'm pretty new, and I was a mess my first day.\\" The door said, \\"Thank you! I like your attitude. Can we be friends?\\" The gumball machine was so happy and said, \\"I would love nothing more.\\""},{"question":"How many continents are there?

Here are them all listed in alphabetical order: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America."},{"question":"Hi Ai!  Today I'm looking for your help in building out a bucket list.  What five items should I do before I die?  I'm looking for adrenaline-seeking activities, with no specific budget in mind.","answer":"Oh, how fun! Yes, let me help you by giving you some of my ideas!:1) Go bungee jumping - Although a bit cliche, this type of event can be extremely adrenaline-inducing. Think about it. You're basically in free fall, and then at the last second, you are saved by a band! The fear of death is so right on the edge, yet it isn't too intense since you are aware of the band the entire time.2) Go snorkeling or scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia - For waters that are swarming with everything beautiful, yet also dangerous, such as sharks, jellyfish, and even the threat of undertows, this can be quite the adrenaline rush! When that first shark comes up, you get quite the rush!3) Go skydiving - Over 10,000 feet in the air. You're falling at terminal velocity. The freefall is quite unreal. It's just a few minutes, but no other fall will ever compare to the freefall experience when skydiving.4) Explore ghost towns in the Pacific Northwest. - This can be terrifying. You hear something that sounds like a scream, and you have no idea if it's coming for you, or if it was just old pipes. Your adrenaline spikes. The concept of the unknown can be quite adrenaline-inducing!5) Go to a nude beach - This can be quite a lot of adrenaline, simply working off of human insecurity. If you are typically a clothed person, going nude in front of dozens of strangers for the first time can be both scary and exciting; both of which cause quite a bit of adrenaline!"},{"question":"Pretend you are Batman but you want to quit being Batman and open a rare book store. Write a journal entry explaining why you’re sick of being Batman and the appeals of a rare book store. <275 words.","answer":"Everyone thinks that being Batman is so amazing, but honestly, I am so sick of it that I can barely stand it. I know I write about this a lot, but today it just seems like it’s all coming to a head. I have been Batman for years and years, taking care of this entire city and all its drama. And for what? I’m exhausted, and I have no life of my own. And I’m not saying I don’t want to have a job. I mean, I don’t want to be on permanent vacation; I have a really great work ethic. But I just don’t think this job is for me anymore. In my dreams, I own a small rare bookshop where I can sit all day and read. And every so often, talk to a person who comes in and also loves rare books. Those are the best kinds of people. The store would be tiny but not too dark. It would feel cozy and warm and welcoming. The complete opposite of my home at Wayne Manor. No one would need anything from me except to know where a book they were looking for was on the shelves. That’s it. The more and more I think about it, the more I know this is exactly what I want to do. And I have the money! I can make it happen. Okay, I’m doing it! I'm done being Batman as of today. And plans for the store start first thing tomorrow. "},{"question":"Do you like apple pie? Or any other pies at all?","answer":"Please hold, generating response... Error!

So far I can see that you've drawn a window, a character sprite, and a background, as well as doing timer calculation and drawing and handling keyboard input. To quit with Ctrl-Q we'll modify the event handling like so:# Handle quit event    for event in pygame.event.get():        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:            running = False         # listen for KEYDOWN        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:            # if KEYDOWN and keys ctrl AND q            if event.key == pygame.K_q and pygame.key.get_mods() & pygame.KMOD_CTRL:                 #quit                running = FalseThis code handles quit events in two ways. First, it listens for pygame.QUIT, which is triggered when the user clicks the X button to close the window, and second, it listens for the pygame.KEYDOWN event and if that event contains CTRL and Q, the quit event is triggered. "},{"question":"Can you suggest three places where I can go to meet people and make friends? I am an introverted adult.","answer":"Meeting new people and making friends can be a challenging task. However, with a little courage and confidence, it is possible to make friends as an introverted adult. Where to go to meet people largely depends on your interests. As a general rule, though, it is advisable to choose locations where you feel comfortable and safe. You also should be able to leave, should the situation change. Here are some suggestions of where to go to meet people and make friends:1. Out in nature: If you like the outdoors, you may be able to meet people with similar interests in organized outdoor events. You may also meet people on a nature walk, or while visiting a botanical garden.2. Art events: museums and art galleries may be good places to meet people. If you love art, try to attend an art exhibition or gallery opening.3. Online: If you prefer to stay indoors, you may find places to meet people online. Social media and other organized spaces - such as a pen pal club or online language learning portal - may be areas to explore.All in all, manage your expectations and have fun while meeting new people Some meetings may go better than others, and that's okay.
