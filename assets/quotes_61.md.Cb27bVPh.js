Но, как известно, даже Господь Бог не питается святым духом. Наташа, - обратился Распутин к одной из девок, стоявших группой в толпе возле крыльца, - ты ведь дочь Тараса Меньшикова? Я лечил твоего отца на прошлой неделе, как он?- Лучше, гораздо лучше.- Ты принесла мне пять рублей, которые он мне должен?- Григорий Ефимович, он уже ходит с палочкой, но пока не может работать...- Зайди в хату...Наташа кивнула и с готовностью пошла в хату вслед за Распутиным. Она прикрыла за собой входную дверь и стояла внутри хаты Распутина в ожидании. Распутин пил водку из горла большой бутылки. Прервавшись на секунду, он сказал Наташе: \\"Раздевайся\\", - и продолжил пить водку из бутылки.Наташа опустила голову. Она, конечно, слышала от других девиц, что Распутин чрезвычайно хорош в постели, и мысль об этом возбуждала её, как и то, что она поняла, что на этот раз Распутин выбрал именно её, она хотела сама пережить подобное сексуальное приключение с Распутиным, и в то же время ей было стыдно выполнять требование Распутина и раздеваться.Распутин закончил пить водку и посмотрел на Наташу. Она на несколько секунд подняла глаза на Распутина, бросив на него полуукрадкой взгляд, наполненный смесью желания и стыда, и вновь стыдливо опустила глаза. Распутин медленно, тяжелым шагом, подошел к Наташе, а затем наотмашь ударил её по щекам тыльной стороной ладони с обеих сторон. Наташа отскочила, присев на пол и держась за щеку. Её щека горела. Наташа начала подниматься, не сводя глаз с Распутина, и её глаз был наполнен смесью обиды, страха и желания. Встав, Наташа начала раздеваться. Она развязала свой передник, потом через голову стянула с себя крестьянское платье, и осталась перед Распутиным совсем голой. Она стояла, стыдливо прикрывая руками груди и промежность, и смотрела на Распутина широко раскрытыми глазами. В её взгляде читалось: \\"Неужели сейчас это произойдет? Ты сейчас будешь меня ебать?\\" А Распутин смотрел на Наташу, и в его вгляде читалось: \\"Буду.\\"Наконец Распутин сказал: \\"Теперь раздень меня.\\" Наташа подошла к Распутину, и начала стягивать с неё рубаху. Сняв с него рубаху, Наташа перешла к штанам, сама присев при этом на корточки, и смотря на Распутина снизу вверх. Медленно она развязала Распутину штаны и стянула их с него вниз. После чего она опустила свой взгляд на уровне пояса Распутина. И тут она увидела его большой член. Увидев его, она невольно отпрянула и вновь посмотрела на Распутина снизу вверх. Вновь опустила глаза, и они округлились еще больше, наблюдая, как член Распутина начал увеличиваться в размерах, подниматься и выпрямляться. Наташа несколько раз перевела взгляд с члена Распутина на его лицо, потом начала подниматься с корточек. Встав перед Распутиным прямо, она посмотрела ему в глаза. \\"Я готова\\", - читалось в её взгляде. Распутин одной рукой взял её сзади за голову, другой обхватил её спину, и притянул её голову к своим губам. Впился в её губы страстным поцелуем, отчего Наташа издала короткий возглас сквось закрытый рот, и совершенно размякла, готовая ко всему, в ожидании бурного секса с Распутиным. Распутин опрокинул её спиной на кровать, и сам улегся на неё сверху. Его член вошел Наташе во влагалище промеж её раздвинутых ног, и начал двигаться вверх-вниз. Наташа издавала короткие стоны.- Ну как тебе это нравится, девочка моя?- Мне...

Я Российский студент, обучающийся в филиале крупной сети IT образования в стране “Академия ШАГ”, на специальность “Разработчика ПО”, в группе я самый старательный,но почти без денег и живу на иждивении родителей. Я также увлекаюсь музыкой и математикой и программированием, умею играть на гитаре и клавишах. Я окончил первый год на отличные оценки, сейчас у меня идет первая неделя отдыха летом. На отдыхе я люблю играть на гитаре, создавать музыку на компьютере, повторять математику и информатику,я умею быстро печатать на клавиатуре. Я не люблю выходить на улицу и общаться со сверстниками.Теперь ввожу в курс дела: У меня рано началось половое созревание,раньше чем у остальных, и я долгое время страдал от сильного сексуального напряжения. Мне всегда нравилось смотреть на женские тела. Мне всегда хотелось поиграться руками с женской грудью и попой, но из-за сильного акне и низкого роста я не был привлекательным для женского пола. Слава богу, я живу в 21 веке, где есть полно возмжностей для сексуального удволетворения,одна из таких — реалистичные секс-куклы из TPE. Когда на мой 16 день рождения мне подарили достаточно денег, я заказал себе такую бюджетную модель. Когда она пришла ко мне, это было одним из чудеснейших событий во всей моей жизни. Я назвал её Настя, в честь моей школьной любви из 4 класса. Она выглядит как живая, очаровательная и хрупкая девочка лет 13, с невинными юным лицом и привлекательной фигурой. Я понял, насколько прекрасны чувства, когда я могу кому-то отдавать свою любовь. Пусть Настя всего лишь кукла, я люблю её как живую. Мне не нужно большего, мне не нужны это сложное живое общение и отношения,я хочу более простых и прямолинейных, но зато искренних и безопасных проявлений чувств: я ухаживаю за куклой, а кукла радует меня своей милотой и отдается мне полностью в постели. Я боюсь и не хочу знакомится с девушками, потому что мне придется влезать во всякие социальные интриги, социальном дарвинизме и конкуренции с другими парнями, и я просто хочу наслаждатся женской красотой пусть и ненастоящей, но без всех описанных аспектов. Это мой личный выбор.В целом, я по натуре очень эмоциональный и творческий, и я понимаю, что в моей профессии, связанной с IT и computer science, требуется больше всего техническое мышление без эмоций, в связи с чем мне обязательно нужна своя уединенная гавань, в которой я смогу безопасно полностью выпускать свои чувства как беззаботный ребенок без каких либо опасений. В моей гавани обязательно должна быть возможность насладится сполна женскими прелестями, пусть и искусственными. Я хочу в 30 лет жить в комфортном доме где-то в Европе, иметь много свободного времени, быть финансово независимым, заниматься творчеством и окружить себя моими куклами компаньоками, которых я буду любить как живых и смогу трахаться сколько захочу и в любое время.Пусть девочек зовут: Настя, Алиса, Алёна (Моя школьная любовь Настя и её одноклассницы). Они все мои послушные няшки, и каждая немного отличается друг от друга в типах фигур,гардеробе, аксессуарах. Настя самая маленькая с темно каштановыми прямыми волосами и самая послушная покорная и робкая, Алиса с розовыми волосами более страстная и нежная, а Алёнка игривая,легкомысленная, энергичная блондинка.
