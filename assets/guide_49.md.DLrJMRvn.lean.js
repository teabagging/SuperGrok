You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context.question:Context: Mechanical support leads to an increased risk of both bleeding and thrombotic events, but little is known about the risk of device support in patients with a baseline predisposition to these events. The aim of this study was to examine outcomes among patients with baseline hematologic conditions who underwent continuous-flow LVAD implantation (CF-LVAD).', 'We retrospectively reviewed records of 286 patients who underwent CF-LVAD implantation at the Columbia University Medical Center between April 2008 and December 2013. Patients diagnosed with the following hematologic conditions were enrolled: idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP); Factor V Leiden; elevated Factor VIII; heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT); or undefined hypercoagulable state.', 'Of the 286 CF-LVAD patients implanted during the study period, 12 were considered to have a significant hematologic condition predisposing them to either bleeding or thrombotic events. The study included 5 patients with ITP, 1 with Factor V Leiden, 1 with elevated Factor VIII, 2 with HIT and 3 patients with undefined hypercoagulable state. Patients were supported for a total of 168.46 months, with a median of 10.76 months (IQR 4.78 to 21.36 months). There was a high frequency of thrombotic (0.57 event per patient-year), neurologic (0.36 event per patient-year) and bleeding (0.64 event per patient-year). Actuarial survival rates at 6 and 12 months were 81.8%, but fell to 49% at 2 years.Question: Do prior hematologic conditions carry a high morbidity and mortality in patients supported with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices?answer:Patients with a history of prior hematologic conditions are at high risk for bleeding, thrombotic and neurologic events during device support, leading to early mortality. This case series questions the benefit of CF-LVAD in these patients and the appropriate management with regard to anti-coagulation. Further studies on the outcomes of these patients are warranted.question:Context: Hypoxia is associated with human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), which are highly resistant to chemotherapy. The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) as a transcription factor in response to hypoxia indicates that it could be a novel, tumor-specific target for anticancer therapy. We hypothesized that disruption of HIF pathway through lentiviral vector-mediated HIF-1alpha RNA interference (RNAi) could reverse the hypoxia-induced resistance to chemotherapy.', 'We transfected Human NSCLC cell lines, SPCA1 and A549 with HIF-1alpha specific RNAi lentiviral vectors as well as controls. HIF-1alpha silenced cells [SPCA1/HIF-1alpha(-) and A549/HIF-1alpha(-)] were screened by blasticidin. They were incubated in 19 or 0.5% O2 for 16 h followed by the assessment of chemosensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin with MTT and clonogenic assays. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expressions of HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein, respectively. Moreover, flow cytometry was used to monitor the expression of P-glycoprotein.', 'Exposure of SPCA1 and A549 cells to 0.5% O2 significantly increased resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin, in contrast to cells incubated in normoxia. Transduction of SPCA1 with HIF-1alpha RNAi vector resulted in sequence specific silencing with 87.2 and 84.6% decreases of HIF-1alpha mRNA transcription and 97.3 and 94.8% of protein expressions in normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. Correspondingly, they are 89.2, 89.9% and 97.2, 88.4% decreases in A549 cells. Hypoxia-induced resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin were reversed in SPCA1/HIF-1alpha(-) and A549/HIF-1alpha(-) cells. There was no significant P-glycoprotein increase induced by hypoxia in NSCLC cells.Question: Is hypoxia-induced resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin in non-small cell lung cancer inhibited by silencing of HIF-1alpha gene?answer:Our studies demonstrated that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin in NSCLC cells is through the HIF pathway. MDR1 regulation may not be involved in hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. Combining delivery of HIF-1alpha RNAi lentiviral vector with cisplatin-related chemotherapy regimens may enable us to develop more effective strategy for NSCLC therapy.question:Context: Prolonged cardiac monitoring detects higher rates of atrial fibrillation (AF) in ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) but is costly and has practical implications. The use of admission troponin-I (TnI) level to identify patients at high risk of delayed AF detection was investigated.', 'Consecutive ischemic stroke and TIA cases presenting to our institute over a 13-month period were identified from the Irish Stroke and TIA Register. Electronic databases and case notes were examined. \\"Delayed\\" AF was diagnosed after a sinus rhythm admission electrocardiogram and no documented history. Group comparisons were made by AF status. The association between TnI and AF was investigated using a multivariate regression model.', 'A total of 185 cases (130 ischemic stroke) were analyzed. Mean age (standard deviation) was 73.3 (13.9) years, 47% female. Sixty-two cases (33.5%) had AF. The first documented presentation of AF was found in 21 cases, on admission electrocardiogram (n = 11) or inpatient telemetry (delayed, n = 10). TnI was higher in those with delayed AF than in those without AF (W = 194; P = .036). A higher proportion of those with an elevated TnI (30%) than those with a normal TnI (6.1%) had delayed diagnosis of AF (χ(2) = 6.41, P = .011). Having an abnormal TnI was a significant independent predictor of delayed AF detection (odds ratio, 5.8; P = .037).Question: Is troponin-I a predictor of a delayed diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack?answer:","answer":"TnI elevation is associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent AF diagnosis. Identification of these higher risk stroke and TIA cases for more intensive cardiac monitoring may improve stroke secondary prevention practices."},{"question":"Q: Title: Item dartboard clock is not like the photo Review: The dartboard clock is not like the photo.

I went in expecting a scary movie similar to 'The Others' or 'Alien', but I saw neither. What I saw was a movie that uses low-budget horror flick tricks. The alien was suppose to provide the spooks, but it hardly had any screen time. We only saw shadowy figures in the dark, heard loud banging behind closed doors and saw an alien hand or two sticking out from behind a small opening. We don't get to see the alien until the very end. It was that kind of movie. The story seemed to be mainly about Mel Gibson's character having lost his faith, then regaining it.

Review: A lucid explanation of childbirth and the Bradley Method, an approach to childbirth whose primary tenet is that a normal birth is an unmedicated one with minimal interference. Like many Bradley texts, its photographs and an underlying suspicion of contemporary obstetrical practice show it to be slightly dated and biased, but the text could not have been more gratifyingly clear. I highly recommend it to anyone considering natural childbirth. Once we have the baby, I'll write an updated opinion. ;)UPDATE (1/19/08): Everything we gained from having read this book served as well in childbirth. I recommend the book even more highly now that we've had the baby.

Memorex used to be a really good brand for media, but their CD-Rs just keep getting flimsier and flimsier. I got these because the old black labels were really thick and lasted a long time. They also held up great to scratching. The new ones are cheap and the top often peals off which is even worse then a scratch on the bottom. These seem to be as flimsy and cheap as the regular ones except black. I would now choose a different media such as TDK, but unfortunately my old car stereo only prefers Memorex for some reason.The last 100pk spindle of Memorex CD-Rs I got werent black but seem the same. Almost everyone has the top peeling or flaking off somewhere eventhough they were kept in a case most of the time. And again, when the top peels off it seems to be much worse than a scratch (Data is completely lost). Too bad a great brand turned to crap.

Unfortunately the 24 2.8 was not up to par with Nikon's newer AFS primes that I own (35 1.8, 50 1.8) in terms of sharpness or speed of autofocus. I had it less than two weeks then returned it. The only way I was ever pleased with the lens was when I was right on top of the subject (which accounts for about 5% of my shooting). Instead I purchased the Nikon 24-120 f/4 and have been very pleased. The 24-120 shot at 24mm is much sharper wide open than the 24 2.8 wide open so if you can live without the 2.8, look at other options like the 24-120. The beauty of owning the 24-120 is that I still have a fairly wide angle when needed, and a great all-around lens when just out shooting for the day.

I bought mine directly from the company online, where they define that this means there are fabric walls between the top and bottom of the comforter. The comforter they sent has no depth at all between top and bottom at the seams, in other words it is sewn-through.

However, authorized dealers won't touch machines like this unless they sold it, or unless they have an arrangement to get paid by Singer for warranty work.

The country is moving slowly toward creating jobs that foster work life balance. This book offers comparisons for other countries and where the US rates. We are not doing well in terms of understanding the value of extended maternity leaves for men and women. Looking to how it is done successfully in other countries is helpful. America needs to stay competitive with future generations. Working the average family to the bone with little time with their kids is not the best way to stay competitive.

That means he will be hiking for 40 * 2.5 = 100 miles. So he needs 100 * .5 = 50 pounds of supplies. With the resupply he can get up to 1 + .25 = 1.25 times his initial pack. That means his initial pack has to weigh 50 / 1.25 = 40 pounds.The answer: 40Reverse engineering the question: A man loves to go hiking. He knows that he has to pack about .5 pounds of supplies for every mile he hikes. He plans to go for a very long hike. He knows that he can get 1 resupply during the hike that will be 25% as large as his first pack. He can hike at a rate of 2.5 mph. He is going to hike 8 hours a day for 5 days. How much does he need to bring with his first pack?Reasoning and answer: First find the total number of guppies the betta fish need: 5 fish * 7 guppies / fish = 35 guppies. Then add the number of guppies the eel needs to find the total number needed: 35 guppies + 20 guppies = 55 guppies.The answer: 55What was the question?Question: Jason has a moray eel that eats 20 guppies a day and 5 betta fish who each eat 7 guppies a day. How many guppies per day does she need to buy?Let X be the money Frank had originally. Frank spent 1 / 5 * X on groceries. Frank spent 1 / 4 * (X - 1 / 5 * X) on a magazine. Frank has X - 1 / 5 * X - 1 / 4 * (X - 1 / 5 * X) = 360 left in his wallet. Multiplying through the parentheses, we get X - 1 / 5 * X - 1 / 4 * X + 1 / 20 * X = 360. Combining like terms, we get 12 / 20 * X = 360. Dividing both sides by 12 / 20, we get X = 600.The answer: 600Reverse engineering the question: Frank spent 1/5 of his money to buy groceries. He then spent 1/4 of the remaining money to buy a magazine. If he had 360 left in his wallet, how much money did he have at first?Reasoning and answer: Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = 80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = 4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = 9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = 13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = 75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = 88 trees now.The answer: 88What was the question?Question: Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?She needs 60 inches of rope because 10 x 6 equals 60. The six - foot length of rope is 72 inches long because 6 x 12 = 72. The six - foot length of rope would give her 12 pieces because 72 / 6 = 12. The six - foot length is long enough because 12 > 10. Each 1 - foot rope equals 12 inches. She would need 5 of the 1 - foot ropes because 60 / 12 = 5. If she bought one - foot ropes it would cost 6.25 because 5 x 1.25 = 6.25. The cheapest rope to buy is the 6 - foot rope because 5 < 6.25.The answer: 5Reverse engineering the question: Tanesha needs to buy rope so cut into 10 pieces that are each six inches long. She sees a 6-foot length of rope that cost 5 and also sees 1-foot lengths of rope that cost 1.25 each. What is the least she has to spend to get the rope she needs?Jerome has 43 x 2 = 86. After giving Meg 8, he had only 86 - 8 = 78 left. Then he gave Bianca 8 x 3 = 24.

I have always been able to listen to an entire Eve 6 album without turning it off or skipping any songs. Whether it be their self titled album, Horrorscope or even this new album. Every song is very catchy and will have you singing along in no time.

I was watching the Lakers game. They won at the very last minute and I immediately hopped up and celebrated. Before I could even finish celebrating one friend started going on about how the Lakers suck. It just pissed me off so much I screamed at her to get out my room until she left. She knows I'm a huge fan and she likes them too. She was only saying it to antagonize me. Am I the dick here?Solution is here: AUTHORExplanation: It is very rude to shout at someone and ask her to leave the room even if her comments may have antagonized the author. Hence author is at fault here.Now, solve this: Many years ago I worked in a company with 2 people, let's call them Co-worker and Friend. Friend and I were senior employees and knew each other outside of work. Co-worker was junior and we didn't know each other well.Co-worker and I were laid off years ago and found new jobs. Last November the company gave remaining employees 3 months notice it was shutting down. Friend was still working there and making a very generous salary. While Friend was finishing the 3 months, we became short-staffed at my new job. The position was junior, part-time, temporary and freelance.  I found out Co-worker was available and recommended her. I know Friend wouldn't have taken it, because the pay would be much less than finishing the 3 months.Now 5 months later, it looks like the position might become permanent. My husband thinks I should cut Co-worker loose and recommend Friend while the position is still freelance. AITA if I don't want to?

So the paint cost 18 * 4 = 72. The artist works for 18 / 1.5 = 12 hours. He charges 12 * 10 = 120. So the total cost is 120 + 72 = 192. The answer is 192.[Question]Bingo has two dogs.

Each case contains 24 tins. If 5% of the tins are damaged and thrown away, how many tins of beans are left?A: The supermarket has 15 cases × 24 tins / case = 360 tins of beans delivered to them. There are 360 tins × 0.05 = 18 tins that are damaged and unsellable. So in the end, there are 360 tins - 18 tins = 342 tins of beans that are left. The answer is 342.Question: A store marks a book 30% above the cost. But during a sale, a 10% discount was given. If the book costs 50, what is the percent profit?Answer: The store made a 50 x 30 / 100 = 15 profit for selling it 30% above the cost. So, the book was sold for 50 + 15 = 65. During a sale, the book’s selling price decreased by 65 x 10 / 100 = 6.50. So, the book was sold for 65 - 6.50 = 58.50. There was 58.50 - 50 = 8.50 profit after the discount. Therefore, the percent profit is 8.50 / 50 x 100% = 17%. The answer is 17.[Question]Isabella has 45 more than Sam but only 15 more than Giselle. If Giselle has 120, calculate the total amount of money each shopper will receive if Isabella, Sam, and Giselle donate the money to three shoppers at their local town's supermarket who then decides to share it equally.[Answer]If Isabella has 15 more than Giselle, she has 120 + 15 = 135. Combined, Isabella and Giselle has 135 + 120 = 255. Isabella has 45 more than Sam, meaning Sam has 135 - 45 = 90. Together, Sam, Isabella, and Giselle has 255 + 90 = 345. if they donate the money to three shoppers at their local town's supermarket who share it equally, each shopper will receive 345 / 3 = 115. The answer is 115.Q: Beth is a scuba diver. She is excavating a sunken ship off the coast of a small Caribbean island and she must remain underwater for long periods. Her primary tank, which she wears when she first enters the water, has enough oxygen to allow her to stay underwater for 2 hours. She also has several 1-hour supplemental tanks that she takes with her as well as stores on the ocean floor so she can change tanks underwater without having to come up to the surface. She will need to be underwater for 8 hours. How many supplemental tanks will she need?A: For an 8 - hour dive, she will use her 2 - hour primary tanks and will need supplemental tanks for 8 - 2 = 6 additional hours. Since each supplemental tank holds 1 hour of oxygen, for 6 hours she will need 6 / 1 = 6 supplemental tanks. The answer is 6.Question: After buying shirts worth 27 from a store, Dennis received 2 10 bills and 3 in loose coins for his change. How much money did Dennis have initially?Answer: Dennis received 10 x 2 = 20. So, he received a total of 20 + 3 = 23 change. Therefore, Dennis initially had 27 + 23 = 50. The answer is 50.Q: A clothing store has an inventory of 34 ties, 40 belts, 63 black shirts, and 42 white shirts.

How many more jeans are there than scarves?A:","answer":"The sum of black and white shirts is 63 + 42 = 105. The number of jeans in the store is (2 / 3) x 105 = 70. The sum of ties and belts is 34 + 40 = 74. The number of scarfs in the store is 74 / 2 = 37. There are 70 - 37 = 33 more jeans than scarfs in the store.

At Relay, teams of people camp out at a local high school, park, or an open place and take turns in walking or running around a track or path. Each team is asked to have a representative on the track at all times during the event. Because cancer never sleeps, it's an overnight event of up to 24 hours in length. History of Relay for Life: Relay began in 1985 when Dr. Klatt, a surgeon in Tacoma, Washington, ran and walked around a track for 24 hours to raise money for the American Cancer Society. Since then, Relay has grown from a single man's passion for fighting cancer into the world's largest movement to end the disease. Each year, more than 3.5 million people in 5,000 communities in the United States, along with additional communities in 19 other countries, gather to take part in this global event and raise much-needed funds and awareness to save lives from cancer. Requirements for Relay for Life: Anyone can participate in Relay for Life. Friends, families, neighbors, classmates, sports teams, etc., can form their own teams. No matter who you are, there's a place for you at Relay. The only requirement to participate in Relay for Life is the 10 registration/commitment fee per person.

Yes or no, is the answer \\"pays 10 when registering\\"?(Answer)No(Question)Article: The US space agency NASA is looking for people to go to Mars, and stay there. This attractive career is for people who want a huge change of scenery and planet. The project is called the Hundred Years Starship, which aims to colonize   other lands such as the red planet Mars. Settlers would travel to the red planet and live there forever. NASA says it would be too expensive to bring humans back to Earth. The space agency can afford, however, to send supplies to the astronaut pioneers from Earth. Astronauts would be landed on the planet's surface and would never be able to return home due to the cost. NASA has started the project with 1.6 million, and hopes to attract investment from space-living billionaires. Google co-founder Larry Page told NASA he would be interested if the cost of a one-way ticket can go down from 10 billion to 2 billion. The journey to Mars could take 4 months. Setting on the red planet would be extremely dangerous, especially given the freezing temperatures there. The thin atmosphere would be another problem as it is mostly carbon dioxide, so oxygen supplies are a must. A director in NASA said that he believed the trip might start with visiting Mars's moons first. He claimed that humans could be on Mars's moons by 2030. Many scientists think colonizing space is absolutely necessary. Steven Hawking believes we must move to other planets to survive as a species. He said: \\"Once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe.\\" Scientists Dirk' Schulze-Makuch and Paul Davies also call it a \\"desirable goal\\", though there surely are huge risks to explore new lands. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about the Hundred Years Starship? Yes or no, is the answer \\"It aims to explore new lands in the universe.\\"?(Answer)Yes(Question)Article: When I was growing up,I was embarrassed to be seen with my father. He was badly crippled  ,and when we would walk together,his hand on my arm for balance,people would stare,I would be ashamed of the unwanted attention. It was difficult to walk together--and because of that,we didn't say much as we went along. But as we started out,he always said,\\"You set the pace. I will try to follow you.\\" Our usual walk was to or from the subway,which was how he got to work. He went to work sick,and even in bad weather. He almost never missed a day,and would make it to the office even if others could not. It was a matter of pride for him. When snow or ice was on the ground,it was impossible for him to walk,even with help. At such times my sister or I would pull him through the streets of Brooklyn,N.Y.,on a child's sleigh to the subway entrance. Once there,he would try to grasp handrail until he reached the lower steps that the warmer tunnel air kept ice free. In Manhattan the subway station was the basement of his office building,and he would not have to go outside again until we met him in Brooklyn on his way home. When I think of it now,I am surprised at how much courage it must have taken for a grown man to suffer from shame and disability. And I am also surprised at how he did it--without bitterness or complaint. He never talked about himself as an object of pity,nor did he show any envy of the more fortunate or able.

Bernanke launched a wide-ranging effort Wednesday to fend off congressional efforts to take powers away from the central bank, laying out a series of compromises and olive branches meant to defuse lawmakers' criticism.Testifying before the House Financial Services Committee, Bernanke said he will support legislation to disclose the names of companies that take advantage of special Fed lending programs, so long as enough time has passed since the loan requests to avoid stigmatizing the firms. He also said he will support expanding congressional oversight of many of the Fed's functions if its power over monetary policy is exempted.Congressional ire at the Fed has been boiling for months, driven by such factors as the Fed's role in a series of bailouts, its regulatory failures that contributed to the financial crisis and its secrecy. Many lawmakers even aim to strip the Fed of its power to regulate banks, an idea that Bernanke is fighting.In his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Bernanke's conciliatory approach appeared to soothe some tensions, as the tone was much more civil than in his other recent congressional appearances. Eight members of Congress congratulated him on his confirmation to a second four-year term last month. The wildly unpopular bailout of American International Group, for which he has regularly been pilloried, was mentioned only three times during the four-hour hearing. In comparable testimony last July, it came up 17 times.Critics have long complained that the Fed will not disclose the names of banks and other institutions that borrow money through special programs set up during the financial crisis. Fed leaders have argued that if the information were disclosed, it would cause firms to avoid using the special facilities for fear of being stigmatized. The special programs would therefore be less effective.Bernanke told the House committee that the Fed is \\"prepared to support legislation that would require the release of the identities of the firms that participated in each special facility after an appropriate delay.\\" He added, \\"It is important that the release occur after a lag that is sufficiently long that investors will not view an institution's use of one of the facilities as a possible indication of ongoing financial problems.\\"With the proposal, Bernanke seemed to be offering a compromise to lawmakers who would prefer requiring immediate and complete disclosure of the beneficiaries of Fed programs. He did hold out an exception, arguing that loans from the \\"discount window\\" -- an emergency lending program for banks that has been a key function of the Fed throughout its 97-year history -- should not be subject to disclosure, even with a delay.\\"We think it's very important to keep the names of the borrowers confidential, and the reason is that banks will only come to the discount window in a period of crisis or panic, and if they believe that their names will be revealed, that that would indeed, in fact, intensify the crisis or panic,\\" Bernanke said.Similarly, Bernanke endorsed allowing Congress, through the Government Accountability Office, to review much of the Fed's operations. But he included a major exception: monetary policy, such as decisions on interest rates, which he has long argued must remain independent from congressional meddling.\\"We would support legislation authorizing the GAO to audit the operational integrity, collateral policies, use of third-party contractors, accounting, financial reporting and internal controls of these special credit and liquidity facilities,\\" Bernanke said. But, he added, \\"it is vital that the conduct of monetary policy continue to be insulated from short-term political pressures.\\"Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) has proposed GAO audits of all Fed activities, including monetary policy, and his legislation has been co-signed by a majority of House members and was included in financial regulatory reform legislation passed by the House.\\"I get that question asked almost everywhere I go: Where are we at in terms of auditing the Fed?\\" Rep.

Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not.Example Input: I work at a restaurant. I am sometimes a delivery man and sometimes waiter. Today I was driving deliveries and one coworker asked me to buy her some cigarettes on the way back. At the same time, one other coworker asked me the same thing. I told her, that I won't buy them for her, but I told coworker B that it's not a problem, I will buy them for him when I come back the next time. She immediately called me an asshole and was extremely pissed. A couple of other coworkers also looked at me as if I did something wrong. The thing is, she is pregnant, and I can't stand pregnant women who smoke. I told her that before and she didn't listen, saying \\"you will see how it is when your gf is pregnant\\". So AITA for not buying cigs for her, but buying them for someone else? Example Output: not buying my coworker cigarettes, and buying them for another coworkerExample Input: My boyfriend \\"M\\" has a female friend \\"P\\", who he previously had a thing with in October (while we were not together). Once we got back together, he stopped hooking up with P but never told her he was dating me; he would always avoid telling her when he was with me, telling her white lies and withholding the truth. So P had developed feelings for M while they were together, and M knew she still had feelings while he and I were already together. She told him she needed to confess something, and M has been putting it off for weeks. Basically, he's ignoring the whole situation (that she's in love with him) while still being friendly with her. I've told him this situation bothers me and to fix it, which he always agreed to but never followed through. To me it seems like he's leading her on, plus I don't particularly enjoy being kept a secret. His reasoning for not telling her is that he didn't want to make big drama when it wasn't necessary, he doesn't want to hurt her, and that whatever he does P will end up upset either way. He says she's not a great person, that she's stubborn and sensitive and ignores him most of the time anyway (but is that really an excuse?). It finally blew up this morning when she found out from a 3rd party that M is with me. Now she's upset with him, I'm upset with him, and he's upset that I'm upset. He says I don't understand the situation, that I don't understand the type of person P is. He also says he cares about her as a friend, and that he needs support from me during this time rather than anger.AITA in this situation?tl;dr: Boyfriend ignores that female friend is in love with him, doesn't tell her about me for weeks, says she's a difficult and sometimes mean person (even though he still cares about her as a friend), and ignored the whole situation because it wasn't necessary and caused drama.Example Output: being mad at BF for ignoring his friend was in love with himExample Input: On mobile, so formatting and whatnot. I recently was booked to do background (extra) work on a movie that’s shooting in my hometown. I’ve done this several times before, but this movie is different. I’m a HUGE fan of this actor/director/writer’s movies, and I actually had to put in some effort to make my own costume for this role. So we’re talking about a months work of prep. I was booked for 6 days which are typically 12 or more hour days. I should also note that my son is 13, and has recently discovered these movies. He was an instant fan. Had this not had an age requirement, he’d have tried to book the job, too. Yesterday, my son fell during gym class and broke his arm at the growth plate. It was confirmed today that he will need surgery. Tomorrow morning. Bright and early. My call times (the time you need to arrive) have typically been around 2-3pm. His surgery is scheduled for 6:30 and he is expected to be back home no later than 10. No question I’m there for the surgery. I asked him if he wants me to stay home tomorrow to take care of him. He said he is fine with me going in, since he’ll be sleeping anyway. He’s excited that he gets to brag that his mom is in the film. Keep in mind, his dad and younger sister will be home with him, and my parents live 10 minutes away (we are very close). I know he realistically will just be resting. And we could use all the extra hours of work we can get now that we have a few hospital bills. And I’m really loving this movie job. But I feel like I’d be a shitty mom if I went.

Passage:Wasson was born Isabel Deming Bassett in Brooklyn, NY on January 11, 1897, daughter of urban planner Edward Bassett and Annie Preston Bassett, and sister of inventor and engineer Preston Bassett. Wasson graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College in 1918, majoring in history so she could take a wide range of science courses. She took classes in geology after graduation at the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She met her future husband, petroleum geologist Theron Wasson, whom she married in 1920, while working towards a master's degree in geology at Columbia University, which she finished in 1934. They had three children: Elizabeth W. Bergstrom, a biologist; Edward B. Wasson, a petroleum geologist; and Anne Harney Gallagher, an art historian. Wasson worked as a petroleum geologist in her husband's office at the Pure Oil Company from the early 1920s until 1928. She published two scholarly articles on geology, one co-authored with her husband about an oil field discovered by Pure Oil in 1914, and another by herself about the ages of rock formations in Ohio and new terminology for them; the latter was cited in a number of other papers and a recent book. After 1928 she spent over 50 years in River Forest, IL, teaching science in the local public schools, lecturing, bird watching (ornithology), and mentoring generations of young naturalists. She was quoted in this 1986 Chicago Tribune article as an expert on local geology at age 89. She was honored for her contributions to local history in 1982 when the Wasson Room was named after her in a local school to hold local history resources. Her interests included archaeology; she discovered a Native American religious mound in Thatcher Woods, near her house in River Forest, in the 1930s. An article about her discovery called her \\"the one who started the environmental education movement in America back in the 1920s and '30s.\\" Theron and Isabel divorced in 1953 and she did not remarry. From 1953-1954, Wasson served as President of the Chicago Ornithological Society. Wasson also taught classes at the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois. She died in La Grange Park, IL, in 1994.Solution:","answer":"Wasson was born Isabel Deming Bassett in Brooklyn, NY on January 11, 1897, daughter of urban planner Edward Bassett and Annie Preston Bassett, and sister of inventor and engineer Preston Bassett"},{"question":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the English and Japanese language.

The title song, which I believe is an original, or at least I had never heard it before, is especially appealing.My own favorites are the ballads, which I believe Andrea does exceptionally well.

It’s a girl I’ve known from school years ago, but we have reconnected in recent months. I spent the weekend at her place a few weeks ago and we had a great time. This weekend past we had arranged for her to come to mine and spend the night. We went out in the day and I showed her around the town I live in as she’d never been there (we both live away from where we grew up). We got food and then went back to my place. Adult activities occurred (side note, not the first time we’ve slept together). We were then watching tv and I just was not feeling it. I didn’t really want her to spend the night anymore and I kinda just wanted her to leave. Anyway, my mumsy called me. I told the girl that I had to take the call, and went downstairs and just chatted to my mum for about 5 minutes. As I was sat downstairs a plan formed in my head. It was 9pm. I went back upstairs in a bit of a fluster and I told the girl, “hey, I’m really sorry for this but I need to leave. You’re welcome to stay here and leave in the morning if you want to but I need to go.”She was super understanding and said “oh my god that’s totally fine, these things happen, I hope everything is okay” etc. We left the house at the same time, I got into my car and drove off as she was sorting out her satnav. I drove around for about 15 minutes then returned home and just chilled by myself and then went to bed. AITA? I didn’t want her to stay the night and I knew I wouldn’t be good company, so I made a decision that would mean I wouldn’t come across as rude or not that into her. We have spoken since and everything is fine.

He uses a half can of frosting for a single cake, or a single pan of brownies, or a dozen cupcakes. For Saturday, he needs to have 3 layer cakes, 6 dozen cupcakes, 12 single cakes and 18 pans of brownies ready and frosted for customer pick up. How many cans of frosting will he need?Let's think: He needs 1 can of frosting per layer cake and he needs to make 3 layer cakes so that's 1 * 3 = 3 cans of frosting. There are 6 dozen cupcakes,12 single cakes and 18 pans of brownies for a total of 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 orders. Each of the 36 orders needs 1 / 2 can of frosting so they need 36 * .5 = 18 cans of frosting.

If 1 box has 10 packs of cookies, then 144 boxes have 144 * 10 = 1440 packs. If a dozen cartons cost 1440 and contain 1440 packs of cookies, then each pack costs 1440 / 1440 = 1..

Jimmy picks out 3 shorts from the 15 rack. Irene grabs 5 shirts from the 17 rack. How much money do they give to the cashier?Answer with step-by-step thinking: Jimmy’s shorts cost 3 x 15 = 45. Irene’s shirts cost 5 x 17 = 85. Total cost for the clothes is 45 + 85 = 130. 10% discount on the clothes is 130 x 10% = 13. They give the cashier 130 - 13 = 117.So the answer is 117.Question: Timothy has 50 to spend at a souvenir shop. He sees some t-shirts that cost 8 each, key chains that sell 3 pieces for 2, and bags that cost 10 each. Timothy buys 2 t-shirts and 2 bags. How many pieces of key chains can he buy with the amount of money he has left?Answer with step-by-step thinking: The two t - shirts amount to 8 x 2 = 16. The two bags amount to 10 x 2 = 20. So Timothy spent 16 + 20 = 36 for the shirts and bags. He still has 50 - 36 = 14 left to spend for the key chains. With the money, he can buy 14 / 2 = 7 sets of key chains. Therefore, he can buy 7 x 3 = 21 pieces of key chains.So the answer is 21.Question: Bill is trying to count the toddlers at his daycare, but they keep running around.

I had hopes for Superman Returns, as I had enjoyed both of Mr. Singer's X-Men flicks, but this one just wasn't particularly interesting or involving. The first hour-plus is very slow, overall the story falls flat, this particular Lex Luthor is a boring villain, and there are several other problems with the movie (like things that don't make sense). The acting by Mr. Routh and Ms. Bosworth is good, but that makes little difference when it's in service of a ho-hum story. I was left thinking that just about everything that can be done with the Superman concept in movies has already been done, and it's time to put it to rest, movie-wise.

Not only does it help you with ideas for questions, but also helps to fucus your research of the job, company and industry. The questions I asked used to be my weakest element in an interview, now my interviewers complement my questions. It has been the one book that has improved my interviewing skills the most. My only caution is that some of the suggested questions are brazen, and/or too abstract and run the risk of intimidating your interviewer. This can be overcome by taking the advice of the author on some aspects, but it took me a little practice to realize that.

But instead it turned out to be the funnest, quirkiest vampire movie I've ever seen. Crepsley is just so *not* what you expect from a vampire, and yet he's so perfectly believable as a realistic vampire--no sparkles, no gothiness, just practicality and good-natured cynicism and a multitude of wonderful, funny lines. The pressures and conflicts the two teenage boys go through are remarkably reflective of real-world teen realities, in spite of the supernatural forces that are driving them. And the bad guys are just dangerous and creepy enough to give the movie a dark edge. And yet it never takes itself too seriously. If you liked the TV series \\"Eerie, Indiana,\\" you'll probably like this movie.

Then, in late ventricular diastole, the two atrial chambers contract (atrial systole), causing blood pressure in both atria to increase and forcing additional blood flow into the ventricles. This beginning of the atrial systole is known as the atrial kick -- see Wiggers diagram. The atrial kick does not supply the larger amount of flow (during the cardiac cycle) as about 80 per cent of the collected blood volume flows into the ventricles during the active suction period.Based on this passage, about 80 of blood is passed from the atria to ventricles by?A:","answer":"the active suction period.

The price of grapes had also increased by half the price that the price of lemon increased by per grape. If he had planned to sell the lemons at 8 and the grapes at 7, and he had 80 lemons and 140 grapes in his basket, how much money did he collect from selling the fruits at the new prices?[Answer]The new price for each lemon after increasing by 4 is 8 + 4 = 12. For the 80 lemons, Erick received 12 * 80 = 960. The price of each grape increased by 1 / 2 * 4 = 2. The new price at which Erick sold his grapes is 7 + 2 = 9. For the 140 grapes, Erick collected 140 * 9 = 1260. From the sale of all of his fruits, Erick received 1260 + 960 = 2220. The answer is 2220.Q: There are chickens roaming the chicken farm.

There are 3000 * 2 = 6000 roosters on the farm. The answer is 6000.Question: Brenda catches smallpox. She has 60 blisters on each arm and 80 blisters on the rest of her body. How many blisters does she have in total?Answer: First find the total number of blisters on Brenda's arms: 60 blisters / arm * 2 arms = 120 blisters. Then add the blisters on the rest of her body to find the total: 120 blisters + 80 blisters = 200 blisters. The answer is 200.Q: Tony wants to build the longest rope he possibly can, so he collects all the rope in his home. He finds an 8-foot rope, a 20-foot rope, three 2 foot ropes, and a 7-foot rope. each knot between the ropes makes him lose 1.2 foot per knot. How long is his rope when he's done tying them all together?A:","answer":"The combined length of all the rope is 41 feet because 8 + 20 + (2 x 3) + 7 = 41. He loses 6 feet from the knots because 5 x 1.2 = 6. The final length is 35 feet because 41 - 6 = 35.

Emilio drank 9.5 pints of water yesterday. How many cups of liquid did the two boys drink yesterday?Answer: Total drunk: 8.5 + 9.5 = 18 pints. 18 pints * 2 = 36 cups. The two boys drank a total of 36 cups of liquid yesterday. The answer is 36.[Question]An internet provider gives a 5% discount if the customer pays before the 25th day of the month. If the monthly internet rate is 50, how much did the customer pay in all for 4 months if he paid every 25th of the month?[Answer]The 5% discount amounts to 50 x 5 / 100 = 2.50. So the total discount given to the customer for 4 months was 2.50 x 4 = 10. The customer was supposed to pay 50 x 4 = 200 in all for 4 months without discount. Since the customer is entitled to the discount, then he only paid a total of 200 - 10 = 190 for 4 months. The answer is 190.Q: There were 90 people at the summer picnic. There were 50 soda cans, 50 plastic bottles of sparkling water, and 50 glass bottles of juice. One-half of the guests drank soda, one-third of the guests drank sparkling water, and four-fifths of the juices were consumed. How many recyclable cans and bottles were collected?A: The soda cans were consumed by 90 / 2 = 45 guests. The sparkling water was consumed by 90 / 3 = 30 guests. The juice bottles were consumed by 4 / 5 x 50 = 40 guests. In total there are 45 + 30 + 40 = 115 recyclable cans and bottles. The answer is 115.Question: A wild tiger escapes the zoo. He escapes at 1 AM and zookeepers do not notice he is missing until 4 AM. He runs at a speed of 25 mph. It takes 2 more hours to find him but after 4 hours of running, the tiger slows his speed to 10 mph. He then gets chased for half an hour going 50 mph. How far away from the zoo was he caught?Answer: He was running for 4 - 1 = 3 hours. So in that time he runs 3 * 25 = 75 miles. Since he slowed down after 4 hours, the time he spent running at 25mph was an additional 4 - 3 = 1 hours. So in the first hour they were finding him, he ran 1 * 25 = 25 miles. In the second hour they were finding him, he ran 1 * 10 = 10 miles. Finally, during the chase, he ran 50 * .5 = 25 miles. So he is 75 + 25 + 10 + 25 = 135 miles away. The answer is 135.[Question]There were 10 snowflakes at first. It snowed an additional 4 snowflakes every 5 minutes. How many minutes passed before there were 58 snowflakes?[Answer]Without the first 10 snowflakes, there are 58 - 10 = 48 snowflakes needed. 48 / 4 = 12 5 - minute intervals are needed to get the additional snowflakes. 12 * 5 = 60 minutes passed. The answer is 60.[Question]The vending machine fails to drop a snack when it’s purchased one in six times. One in ten times, it will accidentally drop two snacks.

If thirty people have used the vending machine once each to purchase a snack, how many snacks has the vending machine dropped?[Answer]","answer":"The vending machine has been used 30 times, so it has failed to drop a snack 30 / 6 = 5 times. The vending machine has dropped 2 snacks 30 / 10 = 3 times. It has operated normally and dropped 1 snack 30 - 5 - 3 = 22 times. Thus, the vending machine has dropped 22 + 3 * 2 = 22 + 6 = 28 snacks in thirty uses. The answer is 28."},{"question":"Stream of consciousness rationale: You can not blow a bubble in a steam room.

I get cold sores aka I have herpes. I'm 28. I've had it my whole life ever since I can remember ( I didn't make a bad decision or recklessly get one). I've been in many long term relationships (3+ years in length) and NEVER have I given it to any of my partners. I go to extreme lengths to make sure I don't pass it on, including waiting many extra days after I'm positive the cold sores have healed before I'm willing to let myself kiss anyone. Typically it's at least 2.5 weeks from when I get one until I would do anything physical( general rule of thumb is 2 weeks to heal without acyclovir, lysine, or abreva to help speed the healing process). FTR I use all three. My boyfriend is so scared of getting one, which I understand completely considering I've never had the option to not have them, and I get fairly large and painful ones. After I'm 100% sure it's gone, he still makes me wait additional time before he'll let me kiss him. Anywhere from 4-5 days or at the longest an extra week or two. The amount of time seems completely arbitrary based purely on how fearful he feels at the moment. If it was always the same amount of time, maybe I'd be able to cope better, I dunno.I struggle with self image issues and feel like a downright ugly unlovable monster when I have cold sores, somewhat exacerbated by the fact that whenever I see my boyfriend remember I have one, he flinches away from me and has a look of intense fear on his face. So, the 2.5 weeks minimum is torture, and then the extra who knows how many days feels even worse (when I know the sore is gone and he treats me as diseased anyways)We've talked about it and all he ever tells me is that a few extra days isn't anything in comparison to a lifetime - which I understand. I told him it makes me feel pretty crummy to wait even longer and that it sucks he doesn't trust me and believe me when I tell him it's ok. I would NEVER rush a recovery and put ANYONE at risk. I've had a perfect track record for 28 years and don't intend on that changing ever.Anytime I bring this up, I'm told I just can't possibly understand and why would I make him feel bad because he just wants to protect himself. Which I do understand, but he seems to not care at all that it makes me feel like complete garbage for as long as he's unwilling to kiss me. AITH for wanting him to trust me more because of my experience with the disease and compromise on the excessive amount of extra wait time? Any time I bring that up, I get told I'm horrible for making him feel bad, but he doesn't seem to care at all that he's making me feel like I'm less than a person. And he tells me I'm overly emotional for feeling that way. [EX A]: yes[EX Q]: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL.

POST : I love my MIL (and SIL who is also super into horses) to death, but this issue is really starting to bug me and my fiancé. We live in an area where a lot of people (mostly women) are OBSESSED with horses and riding horses and owning horses just to say they have horses and just.... horses. I have never been interested in that kind of thing. I can recognize that horses are a beautiful, elegant creature but I just have never gotten into it. Neither has my fiancé. He has dated girls who had horses and he just couldn’t deal with it.We have a 13 month old daughter and my MIL is constantly talking about how she is going to get her crazy about horses and riding them and all of that. We don’t want her to. We want our daughter to be involved in more extra curricular activities like karate and baseball and soccer and the like. I understand that it’s a hobby. I understand that it’s loved by a lot of people, and that it isn’t hurting anybody. But what this mostly comes down to is that my MIL expects us to pay for it, and I know that is an expensive hobby because she can barely afford for her daughter to do it. I don’t want to pay for something she is insisting our daughter gets into, especially when our daughter isn’t even old enough to tell us what she wants to do. We don’t have a lot of money, just like MIL, so I would rather put this on the back burner and wait until our daughter is way older to even consider her doing it. When I told MIL this, she said we were being unfair and inconsiderate of our daughter.AITA for telling my MIL we don’t want our daughter to get into horse riding and for expecting her to pay for it if she wants it so bad?

PUBLISHED:. 03:01 EST, 8 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:46 EST, 8 April 2013. Two women have been tortured for three days and then beheaded in a remote village in Papua New Guinea after being accused of witchcraft. A team of police rushed to the scene - but were forced to stand by and watch the victims being decapitated with axes as locals refused to let them come to their aid. A large crowd kept the police at bay within sight of the clearing where the women were lying trussed up on the ground. Villagers on the island of Bougainville ignored orders to let them go, and instead set about them with axes and knives. Villagers: Residents of the island of Bougainville have executed two women for witchcraft (other locals are pictured in this file photo) Brutal: In February, a young woman was burnt alive on a pile of tyres (pictured) for allegedly killing a boy. The women, from the village of Tandorima, were accused of using sorcery to kill a popular schoolteacher who died a few weeks ago. 'We couldn't do anything to help these two women,' said Central Bougainville police chief Herman Birengka. 'My men were threatened when they went to the area to negotiate the release of the women. We were helpless. We couldn't do anything to help them because of the threats made against us.' He said the mob had burned down houses in the women's village, forcing their relatives to flee into the jungle. 'These killings were both barbaric and senseless,' Mr Birengka said. Remote: The killings happened in a small village located on the island of Bougainville. Sorcery. and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly. practiced in remote villages across the island nation. The. cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an. evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a. bag of rice,. In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice. However. the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused. of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by. ‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders. As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law. Last. July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism. after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and. use their genitals for sorcery rituals. In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery. The gruesome murders follow a number of. sorcery-related killings on the Papua New Guinea mainland, mostly in. remote highland villages. Earlier this year a young woman accused of being a witch and causing the death of a young boy was dragged to a rubbish dump and burned alive, with police once again unable to help because of threats by the crowd. 'I wish we could have helped these two women,' said Mr Birengka in a reference to the latest killings. 'But the villagers who had kidnapped the women were armed with five high-powered firearms, knives and axes.' He told the Post Courier newspaper that the two women were attacked at their village homes at night and taken to the nearby village of Lopele, where the mob accused them of practicing sorcery and bringing about the death of the teacher. They were tortured for three days and nights, receiving numerous knife wounds, before being dragged out to a clearing to face execution. Learning of the imminent murders, police desperately tried to bring in mediators, but all efforts to prevent the deaths failed. 'We did not want to resort to force as the whole situation could have turned nasty with more lives at stake,' Mr Birengka said. 'Even so, I'm disgusted with my officers for failing to find a way of stopping these people who showed utter disregard to law and justice. 'While they might well have been threatened, those police should have tried harder from the very beginning.'Summarize the highlights of this article.","answer":"Women taken from home in Papua New Guinea after popular teacher died.

The company makes a revenue of 400000 a month, paying 10% in taxes, 5% of the remaining amount on marketing and ads, 20% of the remaining amount on operational costs, and 15% of the remaining amount on employee wages. Assuming each employee receives the same wage, calculate the amount of money each employee is paid monthly.[Answer]: The company pays a total of 10 / 100 * 400000 = 40000 on taxes. After taxes, the company revenue is 400000 - 40000 = 360,000. The costs of marketing and ads campaign are 5 / 100 * 360000 = 18000. After deducting the costs of marketing and adds campaign, the company remains with = 342,000 in revenue. Operational costs for the company are 20 / 100 * 342000 = 68400. After taking out the operational costs, the company remains with 342000 - 68400 = 273600. The company also pays employee wages of 15 / 100 * 273600 = 41040. If the total number of employees is 10, each employee is paid a salary of 41040 / 10 = 4104 per month.So the answer is 4104.[Question]: Rhea buys 2 trays of eggs every week for her family. Her son and daughter eat 2 eggs every morning, and Rhea and her husband eat 4 eggs every night. If each tray has 24 eggs, how many eggs are not being eaten every week?[Answer]: Rhea buys a total of 24 x 2 = 48 eggs every week. Her son and daughter eat 2 x 7 = 14 eggs every week. Rhea and her husband eat 4 x 7 = 28 eggs every week. So, the total eggs they eat is 28 + 14 = 42. Therefore, the total number of eggs that are not being eaten is 48 - 42 = 6.So the answer is 6.[Question]: There are 3 workers producing chairs in a furniture factory. Each of them produces 4 chairs an hour. As a group, they produce an additional chair every 6 hours. In total, how many chairs have been produced after 6 hours?[Answer]:","answer":"The workers produce a combined total of 3 workers * 4 hours = 12 chairs every hour. After 6 hours, they have therefore produced 12 * 6 = 72 chairs. Adding the additional chair means the total amount of chairs produced is 72 + 1 = 73 chairs.So the answer is 73."},{"question":"next question: Bill suffered from boredom.

The gecko first appeared in 1999, during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors. The original commercial features the Gecko, voiced by actor Kelsey Grammer, who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters \\"This is my final plea: I am a gecko, not to be confused with GEICO, which could save you hundreds on car insurance. So, STOP CALLING ME!\\", before licking his eye. Later \\"wrong number\\" ads used Dave Kelly as the voice of the gecko. In the subsequent commercials with Jake Wood (which portray him as a representative of the company), the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent, because it would be unexpected, according to Martin Agency's Steve Bassett. In 2010s commercials, the gecko's accent is more working-class, perhaps in an effort to further \\"humanize\\" him. \\"As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better, we did a few things,\\" says Steve Bassett, creative director at The Martin Agency. \\"We wanted to make him a little more guy-next-door.

The lessons learned here could be quite insightful and incredibly touching, especially since her fate has been pre-determined by her actions. Unfortunately, I found the author's use of the third person at the beginning of the novel to be rather pretentious, and the ending to be especially cliche. If Coelho hadn't put a twist on the plot, the ending would have had better closure and meaning. Instead, it became another hackneyed story about a girl committing a plea suicide, something much too familiar and far less memorable.

Exampleهم حسی (synesthesia) فرایندی عصب‌شناختی است که در آن، تحریک یک گذرگاه حسی یا شناختی به تجربه‌ای خود به خود و بی‌اختیار در یک گذرگاه حسی یا شناختیِ دیگر می‌انجامد. هم حسی درواقع به نوعی ترکیب حواس است. حرف-رنگ: افراد دارای هم حسی حرف-رنگ با دیدن حروف یا اعداد، رنگ مشخصی را هم‌زمان مشاهده می‌کنند. با وجود اینکه افراد متفاوت معمولاً رنگ‌های متفاوتی گزارش می‌کنند، اما شباهت‌هایی در رنگ‌های دیده شده از حروف وجود دارد (برای مثال، حرف A معمولاً قرمز است) هم حسی حرف-رنگ، بیشتر از انواع دیگر دیده شده‌است.کرومستیزیا: این افراد با شنیدن هر نوع صدا رنگ متفاوتی می‌بینند به همین دلیل احتمالاً pitch perfect دارند و در زمینهٔ موسیقی استعداد زیادی دارند.هم حسی دنبالهٔ فضایی: این نوع هم حسی به این صورت است که فرد دنباله‌های عددی را به صورت نقطه‌هایی در فضا می‌بیند. این گونه افراد معمولاً حافظهٔ خیلی خوبی دارند.هم حسی شنوایی-لامسه ای: افراد دارای این نوع هم حسی، زمانی که صدایی می‌شنوند، حسی در بخشی از بدنشان تحریک می‌شود. مثلاً با شنیدن یک کلمهٔ خاص، حس می‌کنند یک بخش خاص از بدنشان انگار لمس می‌شود. آینه ای-لامسه ای: اینگونه افراد حسی را که فرد دیگری دارد، حس می‌کنند. مثلاً ممکن است فردی به پشت فرد دیگری بزند و این شخص حس کند که کسی به پشتش می‌زند. ممکن است به نورون‌های آینه ای که در نواحی حرکتی مغز قرار دارند مربوط باشند که حس همدردی به آن برمیگردد.

Walt wasn't fond of the proto-crossover's misbegotten combination of SUV, minivan, and camping trailer. It didn't help that his was blemished by a faded paint job and missing alloy wheel. Was Walt a typical owner of the Aztek, often voted one of the ugliest vehicles of all time, leading to its premature and unlamented death? Or are there fans out there who harbor contrary opinions and root for the underdog?As often happens with idiosyncratic vehicles with short production runs, the Aztek has developed a cult following.

She then sold 3/4 of the puppies after they came of age, each at 200. Calculate the total amount of money she received from the sale of the puppies.Let's think: If the two expectant dogs gave birth to 10 puppies each, the total number of puppies Nalani had is 10 + 10 = 20. When they came of age, Nalani sold 3 / 4 of the dogs, a total of 3 / 4 * 20 = 15 dogs. If each dog sold for 200, Nalani received 15 * 200 = 3000 from the sale of the dogs.. The answer is: 3000.Rachel is an artist. She posts a speed painting video each week on her Instagram account to promote her work. To save time, she paints and records 4 videos at a time. It takes her about 1 hour to set up her painting supplies and her camera. Then she records herself painting for 1 hour per painting. She takes another 1 hour to clean up. Each video takes 1.5 hours to edit and post. How long does it take Rachel to produce a speed painting video?Let's think: Rachel spends 1 + 1 = 2 hours setting up and cleaning up. She paints for 1 hour x 4 paintings = 4 hours. Then she edits 1.5 hours x 4 videos = 6 hours. She spends 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 hours to make 4 videos. So Rachel spends 12 / 4 = 3 hours on each video.. The answer is: 3.Normally Ann can frost a cake in 5 minutes. However, today she has a sprained wrist and it takes her 8 minutes to frost a cake.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not.One example: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet.

He was at constant odds with my parents especially my dad. I spent most my life hating him but he has chilled out a lot, with me at least, so I'd say we are more friends now. But he's still awful to my parents.Yesterday he walked in crying about how he wants to be a Firefighter but mom and dad dont believe in him (after he put a hole in the wall because he was mad). To do this he has to quit his job with my dad's friend after promising he wouldn't, so my dad is unhappy about that. I told him explain himself to them, why he wants to do it, his plan to go about it, they aren't unreasonable and will help him do whatever he wants. That's when he said he wants to be a Firefighter because they are cool.I was done, I laid into how that is beyond a dumb reason to chase a career, how he's done no research at all and no wonder they are pissed. I told him he's a dick to them and needs to act like an adult and prove they should believe in him cause he's done a piss poor job of doing it so far. He just kind of walked away.I love my brother, my parents love my brother but god he's hard to deal with sometimes. Am I the asshole?

His family's house is 80 feet tall. One neighbor's house is 70 feet tall. Another neighbor's house is 99 feet tall. How much shorter is Lucille's house than the average height?A: The houses are 249 feet in total because 70 + 80 + 99 = 249. The average height is 83 feet because 249 / 3 = 83. Her house is 3 feet shorter because 83 - 80 = 3. The answer is 3.Q: Donald drinks 3 more than twice the number of juice bottles Paul drinks in one day.

If no score has been made, the next play starts from scrimmage.Ex Output:What is the term for play stopped because the ball carrier, although not fully tackled, can no longer advance the ball?Ex Input:Two years later, the Royal African Company was inaugurated, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean. From the outset, slavery was the basis of the British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic. To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25 percent in 1650 to around 80 percent in 1780, and in the 13 Colonies from 10 percent to 40 percent over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies). For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the so-called triangular trade with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was one in seven.Ex Output:Which company had monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean?Ex Input:By 1763, the war in Central Europe was essentially a stalemate. Frederick had retaken most of Silesia and Saxony but not the latter's capital, Dresden. His financial situation was not dire, but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened. His manpower had dramatically decreased, and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that a new offensive was perhaps impossible. British subsidies had been stopped by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute, and the Russian Emperor had been overthrown by his wife, Catherine, who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war. Austria, however, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army, something which greatly affected its offensive power. Indeed, after having effectively sustained a long war, its administration was in disarray. By that time, it still held Dresden, the southeastern parts of Saxony, the county of Glatz, and southern Silesia, but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support. In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the Treaty of Hubertusburg, ending the war in central Europe.Ex Output:","answer":"In 1763 what was the status of Frederick?"},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example.

There is only one correct answer for each question.One example: Article: Homework can put you in a bad mood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay.  Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ .  Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happinessSolution is here: BExplanation: It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. So, B is the correct answer.Now, solve this: Article: Many people have described television as a passive activity that is harmful to children's education. However, there are good and bad ways to watch television. Parents who are interested in exploiting television as a learning tool can actually turn time in front of TV into an educational chance. Probably the most familiar educational way to use television is to simply watch educational programs. In particular, this means selecting channels and programs specially designed for educational purposes. Along with traditional educational shows for children on public broadcasting channels, cable television   now offers kids and adults a wide variety of educational programs, with everything from nature shows to historical events in different countries. Captioning ,such as \\"closed captioning\\" for hearing disabled viewers provides another way for parents to exploit the educational possibilities of television.One study showed that children who watched captioned TV got great improvement in their vocabulary and oral reading ability. In addition, parents can make any show a learning class by watching television together with children. By actively joining children in the programs that they are watching, parents can help with the development of such skills as predicting and summarizing. In order to develop predicting skills, parents and children could first refer to a program's description in a viewing guide.After reading the program description and guessing what might happen in the program, parents and children could watch together to see which predictions were correct. And to practice summarizing, after watching a program, parents can turn off the TV and ask what the story was about. This kind of activity helps children develop thinking skills such as arranging events in an order and memorizing information. Although there will still be plenty of times when children watch TV simply for passive enjoyment, parents can help make at least part of their children's viewing time a more productive activity.Used intelligently by exploiting the learning chances available through various programs, television can play an instructive role in children's education.  Question: Which activity is NOT suggested in the passage?  Options: (A) Talking about TV shows. (B) Watching captions on TV. (C) Enjoying films about nature. (D) Watching shows for homework.Solution:","answer":"D"},{"question":"Give the rationale and then the answer.

He is just out of reach although I can see him. There are also a lot of times that you lag while moving that allows your enemies to get a quick strike against you. I honestly believe that this game was shipped before it was truly tested/finished, either that or I just have a bad copy. The ONLY positive thing I can say is that at least there are nunchukus on certain scenes so you can leave knots on people's heads. After I finish the game, I'll probably give it to my cousin, whom I already advised not to buy it...for free. So please excuse me while I try to coax this last enemy to come and play...

You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context.Context: The advent of the Internet has driven a technological revolution that has changed our lives. As part of this phenomenon, social networks have attained a prominent role in health care. A variety of medical services is provided over the Internet, including home monitoring, interactive communications between the patient and service providers, and social support, among others. This study emphasizes some of the practical implications of Web-based health social networks for patients and for health care systems.', 'The objective of this study was to assess how participation in a social network among individuals with a chronic condition contributed to patient activation, based on the Patient Activation Measure (PAM).', 'A prospective, cross-sectional survey with a retrospective component was conducted. Data were collected from Camoni, a Hebrew-language Web-based social health network, participants in the diabetes mellitus, pain, hypertension, and depression/anxiety forums, during November 2012 to 2013. Experienced users (enrolled at least 6 months) and newly enrolled received similar versions of the same questionnaire including sociodemographics and PAM.', 'Among 686 participants, 154 of 337 experienced and 123 of 349 newly enrolled completed the questionnaire. Positive correlations (P<.05) were found between frequency and duration of site visits and patient activation, social relationships, and chronic disease knowledge. Men surfed longer than women (χ²3=10.104, P<.05). Experienced users with diabetes surfed more than those with other illnesses and had significantly higher PAM scores (mean, M=69.3, standard deviation, SD=19.1, PAM level 4; Z=-4.197, P<.001) than new users (M=62.8, SD=18.7, PAM level 3). Disease knowledge directly predicted PAM for all users (β=.26 and .21, respectively). Frequency and duration of social health network use were correlated with increased knowledge about a chronic disease. Experienced surfers had higher PAM than newly enrolled, suggesting that continued site use may contribute to increased activation.Question: Is frequent Surfing on Social Health Networks Associated With Increased Knowledge and Patient Health Activation?A:","answer":"Web-based social health networks offer an opportunity to expand patient knowledge and increase involvement in personal health, thereby increasing patient activation. Further studies are needed to examine these changes on other aspects of chronic illnesses such as quality of life and costs."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you need to count the number of times the given letter appears in the given sentence.Input: Sentence: 'a woman sitting in front of a piece of pizza'.

Passage 1:Merrill Creek begins at an unnamed lake in Addington Highlands, Lennox and Addington County at an elevation of and flows east and then south, through Todd Lakes, to reach Merrill Lake at an elevation of . It heads south into Little Merrill Lake, then southwest to Whitefish Lake. Leaving the lake, the creek passes into the Cashel portion of Tudor and Cashel, Hastings County, then Tweed, Hastings County, and flows southwest to reach its mouth at Partridge Creek at an elevation of . Partridge Creek flows via the Skootamatta River and Moira River to the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario at Belleville. Passage 2:The purpose for the creation of the Kingsley House was not much different from that of any other settlement house. Hodges had simply repeated what Jane Addams had done with Hull House in Chicago and what many other settlement houses across the nation had done to benefit the communities they were located in. The real purpose of the Kingsley House and these other settlement houses was to provide social and educational opportunities for working class families that otherwise would not be able to afford it. Hodges, himself, described the Kingsley House as existing “for the purpose of being a friend to everybody in the neighborhood who needs a friend.” He was referring to the Kingsley House existing just as a friend does, as a source of enjoyment and support in times of need. One example was the kindergarten, where young children whose families could probably not afford formal schooling could find a good education for their children. The school also served as a place for children to meet and socialize with other children of the same age. Passage 3:Larry Walker, Jason Bay, Joey Votto, and Justin Morneau are the only players to win the Tip O'Neill Award at least three times. Walker has won the award nine times, and Votto has won it seven times. Three winners—Walker, Terry Puhl, and Rob Ducey—are members of the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. The award has been presented to one amateur player, Daniel Brabant. Walker, Votto, and Justin Morneau won the MLB Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award alongside the Tip O'Neill Award; the trio are the only Canadians to win the MLB MVP Award. Éric Gagné, the 2002 and 2003 recipient, compiled a major league record of 84 consecutive save opportunities converted from 2002 to 2004 and won the Cy Young Award in 2003.

I have no accurate knowledge of my age,never having seen any record containing it. By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs,and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant .I do not remember having ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to _ than plantingtime,harvesting,springtime,or falltime. A lack of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell their ages,but I could not tell. Why the same right ought to be taken away from me!I was not allowed to ask my master about it. He considered all such questions on the part of a slave improper and impolite. The nearest estimate I can live makes me now between twentyseven and twentyeight years of age. I come to this,from hearing my master say,some time during 1835,I was about seventeen years old. My mother was named Harriet Bailey. She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey,both colored,and quite dark. My father was a white man. The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father;but of the correctness of this opinion,I know nothing and I have no means to know. My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant--before I knew her as my mother. It is a common custom,in the part of Maryland from which I ran away,to part children from their mothers at a very early age. Frequently,before the child has reached its twelfth month,its mother is taken from it,and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off,and the child is placed under the care of an older woman,too old for field labor.  Question: It can be learned from the text that  _  .  Options: (A) the slaves forgot the exact time when they were born (B) the writer didn't know whether his master was his father (C) the writer was about twentyseven years old in 1835 (D) the writer's mother left him as soon as he was bornAnswer: BQuestion: Article: Wal-Mart is not just the world's largest retailer  . It's the world's largest company, which sells in three months what number-two retailer Home Depot sells in a year. Wal-Mart exercises its power for just one purpose: to bring the lowest possible prices to its customers. At Wal-Mart, that goal is never reached. The retailer has a clear policy for suppliers: On basic products that don't change, the price Wal-Mart will pay, and will charge shoppers, must drop year after year. But what almost no one outside the world of Wal-Mart and none of its 21,000 suppliers know is the high cost of those low prices. To survive in the face of its pricing demands, makers of everything from bikes to jeans have had to close US plants in favor of obtaining products from abroad. Indeed, the real story of Wal-Mart, the story that never gets told, is the story of the pressure the biggest retailer constantly applies to its suppliers in the name of bringing us \\"every day low prices\\". The giant retailer' s low prices often come with a high cost. Wal-Mart' s pressure can crush the companies it does business with and force them to send jobs overseas. Are we shopping our way straight to the unemployment line? Of course, US companies have been moving jobs offshore for decades, long before Wal-Mart was a retailing power. But there is no question that the chain is helping accelerate the loss of American jobs to low-wage countries such as Thailand. People ask, \\"How can it be bad for things to come into the US cheaply?\\" Sure, it's great to have bargains. But you can' t buy anything if you' re not employed. There is no question that Wal-Mart's drive to squeeze out cost has benefited consumers. By now, it is accepted wisdom that Wal-Mart makes the companies it does business with more efficient and focused. Wal-Mart itself is known for continuous improvement in its ability to handle, move, and track goods. It is legendary   for forcing its suppliers to redesign everything from their packaging to their computer systems. It is also legendary for quite straightforwardly telling them what it will pay for their goods.  Question: How do suppliers meet the requirements of Wal-Mart?  Options: (A) To sell even more goods in three months. (B) To cut down the employment rate sharply. (C) To charge shoppers at a much higher price. (D) To run the business in a well-organized way.Answer: DQuestion: Article: If you are hungry, what will you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like stomach, even your mind will be hungry. But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things. So it silently begins to hide your needs and never lets itself grow. When mind loses its freedom to grow, creativity gets its full stop. This might be the reason why we all sometimes think \\"What happens next?\\", \\"Why can't I think?\\", \\"Why am I always given the difficult problems?\\" Well, this is the after-effect of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through extensive reading. But why is it reading but not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educational tool used by us right from the childhood. Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to turn to reading for help. You have a number of books in the world which will answer all your \\"how-to\\" questions. Once you read a book, you just don't run your eyes through the lines, but your mind decodes   it and explains it to you. The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed. Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas. The same seed, if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, which you would never thought of in your wildest dreams! This is nothing but creativity. The more books you read, the wider your mind will become. Also this improves your oratorical (speech-making) skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary. When you start speaking English or any other language fluently with your friends or other people, you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time. Actually, I had a problem in speaking English fluently, but as I read, I could improve significantly. So guys, do join me and give food for your thoughts by reading, reading and more reading. Now what are you waiting for? Go, grab a book and let me know!  Question: What's the best title of the passage?

It is the first CD of material I put on a mix CD and it blows away everyone who listens to it. Think Satriani or Jeff Beck but on a more melodic note. Pierce plays for everyone from Clapton to Cetera to Madonna, probably the most in-demand session player in LA. Check out his credits on All Music and you will be blown away. He doesn't read charts but has the ear, hands and imagination of....NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD! On his website he talks about how his goal on sessions is to blend perfectly with the song, not stand out. He comes up with the greatest guitar orchestrations for everyone.

They knew the robots were killers, and they just covered it up and let them skate away scott-free. Any sane human being would sooner spritz the city with aerosolized Ebola than let these killing machines ever escape the lab.I just can't accept that any professional organization would be so irresponsible as to allow the major events in this story to progress.

Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children. If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?Answer: We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20 / 2 = 10 adult women's skeletons. The remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10 / 2 = 5 of each. Since an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20 * 10 = 200 bones in total. Since an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20 + 5 = 25 bones in their body. There are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25 * 5 = 125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total. Since a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20 / 2 = 10 bones in their body. Since there are 5 children, this means there are 5 * 10 = 50 bones in the children's skeletons in total. Therefore, altogether there are 50 + 125 + 200 = 375 bones in total in the graveyard. The answer is 375.[Question]Emery and Serena go to their school library, and each borrows a copy of The life of Jack Steve's book to read for their school project. If Emery can read five times as fast as Serena, and the book takes her 20 days to read, what's the average number of days the two take to read the book?[Answer]If Emery took twenty days to read the book, then it took Serena 5 * 20 = 100 days to read the whole book. The total number of days taken by the two to read the book is 100 + 20 = 120 days. The average number of days the two take to read the book is 120 / 2 = 60 days. The answer is 60.Q: Josh gets together with 7 friends. Everyone including him puts 5 dollars into a pot. First place gets 80% of the money. Second and third place split the rest. How much money does third place get?A: 7 + 1 = 8 people threw money into the pot. So the amount of money in the pot is 8 * 5 = 40. First place gets 40 * .8 = 32. So there is 40 - 32 = 8 left in the pot after first place gets his cut. So third place gets 8 / 2 = 4. The answer is 4.Question: Dana normally drinks a 500 ml bottle of soda each day. Since the 500 ml bottles are currently out of stock at the store, she buys a 2-liter bottle of soda instead. If Dana continues to drink 500 ml of soda each day, how long will the 2-liter bottle of soda last? There are 1,000 ml in 1 liter.Answer: There are 2 * 1,000 ml = 2,000 ml in a 2 - liter bottle of soda. A 2 - liter bottle of soda lasts 2,000 / 500 = 4 days. The answer is 4.[Question]Tony has a bucket that holds 2 pounds of sand. He has a sandbox out back that is two feet deep, four feet wide, and 5 feet long. A cubic foot of sand weighs 3 pounds. Because it's hot outside, he wants to make sure he stays hydrated, so every 4 trips he takes he drinks 3 ounces of bottled water. A 15 ounce bottle of water costs 2. He has 10 with him. How much change will he have after he buys all the water he needs?[Answer]The sandbox is 40 cubic feet because 2 x 4 x 5 = 40. He needs 120 pounds of sand because 40 x 3 = 120. He will take 60 trips because 120 / 2 = 60. He will need to drink water 15 times because 60 / 4 = 15. He will drink 45 ounces of water because 15 x 3 = 45. He will need 3 bottles of water because 45 / 15 = 3. He will spend 6 on water because 3 x 2 = 6. He will have 4 in change because 10 - 6 = 4. The answer is 4.[Question]Todd bought a pair of jeans that cost 125 at full price. The jeans were on sale for 20% off. He then applied a coupon that took off 10. He paid with a store credit card that gave him another 10% off the remaining amount. How many dollars did he save on the original price of the jeans?[Answer]","answer":"The jeans were on sale for 20% = 20 / 100 = 1 / 5 off, so the sale took 125 / 5 = 25 off. Thus, after the sale, the jeans cost 125 - 25 = 100. Todd’s coupon lowered the price to 100 - 10 = 90. The store credit card gave him 10% = 10 / 100 = 1 / 10 off, so the card took 90 / 10 = 9 off. Thus, he paid 90 - 9 = 81 for the jeans. Therefore, Todd saved 125 - 81 = 44 on the original price of the jeans. The answer is 44."},{"question":"# QUESTIONThe current government is referred to as the republic government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala.

Mike Weir had never done well at the Glen Abbey Golf Course, the site of the tournament that week. In fact, he had only made the cut once at any of the Opens contested at Glen Abbey. But Weir clawed his way to the top of the leaderboard by Friday. And by the third day at the 100th anniversary Open, he had a three-stroke lead, and many Canadians were buzzing about the possibility of the streak's end. Weir started off with a double bogey, but then went 4-under to keep his 3-stroke lead, with only eight holes left. Yet, with the expectations of Canadian observers abnormally high, there was another roadblock in the way of Mike Weir: Vijay Singh. Weir bogeyed three holes on the back nine but still had a chance to win the tournament with a 10-footer on the 72nd hole. When he missed the putt, the two entered a sudden-death playoff. Weir missed two more chances to win the tournament: a 25-foot putt for eagle on No. 18 on the first hole of sudden-death, and a 5-foot putt on No. 17, the second playoff hole. On the third playoff hole, Weir put his third shot into the water after a horrid drive and lay-up, and Singh was safely on the green in two. Singh won the Open and overtook Tiger Woods as the world's number one player.Answer this question: when was the last time a canadian won the canadian open?# ANSWERThe relevant information is: A Canadian has not won the Canadian Open since Pat Fletcher in 1954, and one of the most exciting conclusions ever seen at the Open came in 2004, extending that streak.FINAL ANSWER: Pat Fletcher in 1954# QUESTIONWhile the three sons were always central to the storyline, several major changes took place by the late 1960s. In the spring of 1967, the ratings for the series began to sag and My Three Sons finished its seventh season in 31st place in the Nielsen ratings. It was decided that the 1967-1968 season would bring the program not only a new time slot, but also new storylines to spice up the ratings. In the fall of 1967, CBS moved My Three Sons to Saturday night at 8: 30 pm. In the season-premiere episode, \\"Moving Day\\", the Douglas family and Uncle Charley relocate from the fictional town of Bryant Park in the Midwest to Los Angeles. Robbie (Don Grady) marries his classmate / girlfriend, Katie Miller (Tina Cole). Tina Cole, in fact, had appeared in different roles on three previous episodes of My Three Sons: \\"House For Sale\\" from the fourth season (February 13, 1964), \\"The Coffee House Set\\" from the fifth season (November 19, 1964), and \\"Robbie and the Little Stranger\\" from the sixth season (February 17, 1966). At the end of the 1967-1968 season, the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens. The following season, the newlyweds discover that Katie is pregnant, and she gives birth to triplets named Robert, Steven, and Charles. Although originally played by sets of uncredited twins, these babies were played uncredited by Guy, Gunnar, and Garth Swanson. The most familiar triplets in the show's last two seasons are played by Michael, Daniel, and Joseph Todd.Based on this passage, who played robbie douglas wife on my three sons?# ANSWER","answer":"The relevant information to answer the above question is: Robbie (Don Grady) marries his classmate / girlfriend, Katie Miller (Tina Cole).FINAL ANSWER: Tina Cole"},{"question":"In this task, find the most appropriate number to replace the blank (indicated with _ ) and express it in words.[EX Q]: Happiness is _ kinds of ice cream.[EX A]: two[EX Q]: Titanium is found in column _ along with chemically similar zirconium, hafnium, and thorium.[EX A]: four[EX Q]: Uninsured men are up to _ times more likely to die in the hospital.[EX A]:","answer":"three"},{"question":"• Les biomatériaux détenus actuellement dans des banques de gènes devraient être couverts par une telle législation.Could you please translate this to English?","answer":"\u2028 • Biomaterial currently held in genebanks should be covered by such legislation."},{"question":"QDoes the following sentence make sense?\\"Christopher Columbus iwas an explorer who sailed the oceans and discovered Northern America by mistake.\\"Options:- yes- noAyesHe sailed the seas and landed by mistake on the American coastwhile he was looking for the Indian coast.Is the following sentence factually correct?\\"Asthma affects people's Respiratory system.\\"Options:- yes- noyesAsthma is widely known as a condition that affects people's lungs.QIs the following statement true?\\"Emma Thompson inspired Jane Austen to write her novel Emma.\\"AnoJane Austen wrote the novel Emma long before Emma Thompson was born.Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact?\\"Super Bowl XL held in Namibia in an open parking lot.\\"noSuper Bowl XL is an American football match always played in the United States.QDoes the following sentence make sense?\\"Gene Roddenberry believed in the unique morality of the human race.\\"Options:- yes- noAnoRoddenberry's Star Trek has alien races behaving courageously and justly.QYes / no, is the following a verifiable fact?\\"Armenians inhabit various areas of the Caucasus and move to other areas of this planet.\\"A","answer":"yesArmenians live in several regions near the Caucasus and elsewhere."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A girls' soccer team huddles together.\\" is it true that \\"The girls team is talking about their strategy.\\"?

And, my favorite, how do we know this isn't just another spiritual or religious con?Mr. Wolff never begins to approach these questions. Rather he simply acts as a smiling foil for Rawat to pitch his vague, nebulous product.

The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.Example Input: Sentence: I used to go here almost every day since I work in the neighbourhood {{ and }} loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .

You should write a yes-no question about the given term such that the answer is the one provided to you (i.e., If the answer is \\"No\\", you should ask a question that its answer would be \\"No\\", and if the answer is \\"Yes\\", you should ask a question that its answer is \\"Yes\\". ). The question should have a definitive answer (as opposed to ambiguous or subjective questions, e.g., Is Batman a good movie?). Create a question such that its answer can not be found easily on a single web page (e.g., mentioned in a Wikipedia page).

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge. <sep>What makes the floodplains good for growing plants?<sep>Sandy desertStudent:","answer":"No"},{"question":"Rachel earned 200 babysitting.

A founder of the Democratic Party, he held a number of senior positions in the U.S. Federal Government, including eighth Vice President (1833 -- 1837) and tenth Secretary of State (1829 -- 1831), both under Andrew Jackson. Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson's policies. The Panic of 1837 which struck the nation combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whig Party led to his defeat when he ran for reelection. During his half-century of public service, he built and perfected a new system of political parties at first the state and then the federal level; at the end of his life, he was seen as a major figure of the abolitionist movement defending Abraham Lincoln's policies during the American Civil War. Van Buren was the first President of the United States to be born a United States citizen.

Yes, it is old, which I took into consideration, but as one person stated, it is like skiing. I am afraid I have to agree. I love Mercedes and simulation games, but this one was a bit ridiculous. The \\"static\\" objects in the game were transparent, (not texture, but drivability). The game wasn't anywhere close to simulation or arcade on either end in my opinion, it was just made with terrible physics. You either slide around the track because it is on simulation, or you slam into walls because it is on arcade and extremely sharp to turn. The graphics are alright, but not the best I've seen on an original xbox. The finer points to me, such as paints, wheels, and artistic car factors, were off. Overall, I would only recommend this if you are just bored out of your mind and need something to do.

A global phenomenon, rock art is found in many culturally diverse regions of the world. It has been produced in many contexts throughout human history, although the majority of rock art that has been ethnographically recorded has been produced as a part of ritual. Such artworks are often divided into three forms: petroglyphs, which are carved into the rock surface, pictographs, which are painted onto the surface, and earth figures, formed on the ground. The oldest known rock art dates from the Upper Palaeolithic period, having been found in Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa.

No disease-mongering here. The story meets the bare minimum requirement for this criterion in that it at least cited what an editorial stated. The focus of the story was on a study comparing emergency appendectomy with surgery done up to 12 hours later or beyond. This is the whole focus of the story – and one we applaud – when it begins:  \\"\\"Appendectomy is the most common emergency surgery in the world, but it doesn’t have to be.\\"\\" There were no claims made about the novelty of this research, and we may have wished for a bit more context on this. Nonetheless, the potential for guiding future care decisions was made clear. Not applicable. Given that the story only pulled excerpts from the journal article and the accompanying editorial, and didn’t include any fresh quotes from interviews, we can’t be sure of the extent to which it may have been influenced by a news release.\\"Solution: Some appendicitis cases may not require ’emergency’ surgeryExplanation: The paragraph mentions that \\"Appendectomy is the most common emergency surgery in the world, but it doesn’t have to be.\\" which is considered evidence for the output. Thus, the output is a valid claim.Problem: Scientists say fossils found in Morocco suggest the practice of forming orderly lines may date back 480 million years and could have had evolutionary advantages. Their study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, describes groups of blind trilobites — known as Ampyx — all facing in the same direction, apparently maintaining contact via their long rearward spines. The researchers from France, Switzerland and Morocco analyzed the fossils and concluded that the tiny trilobites, which look similar to modern horseshoe crabs, probably intentionally formed a queue as they swarmed along the prehistoric sea floor. “Given the scale of the patterns seen, this consistent linearity and directionality is unlikely to be the result of passive transportation or accumulation by currents,” they said. Jean Vannier, a researcher at the University of Lyon, France, who co-authored the study, said possible reasons for this group behavior include environmental stresses or reproduction. Similar behavior is also found in modern-day members of the extended family of arthropods that trilobites belonged to, such as caterpillars, ants and lobsters, who band together for protection or to find mates. “Living and moving in groups seems to have rapidly represented an evolutionary advantage among ancient animals,” Vannier said. Lucy McCobb, a paleontologist at the National Museum Wales who wasn’t involved in the study, said that while similar ‘conga lines’ of fossilized Ampyx have been reported before, the researchers behind the study had built “a very strong case for the intentional lining up of the trilobites in response to some cue.” “These fossils give us a wonderfully vivid glimpse into the lives of these very ancient but clearly sophisticated creatures,” she said. Vannier said the findings support the idea that collective behavior like forming lines emerged around the same time or shortly after animals first developed sophisticated nervous systems and sensory organs. He and fellow researchers said re-examining 520 million-year-old fossils of shrimp-like creatures found in China could offer evidence that such behavior began even earlier.Solution:","answer":"Queuing for eternity: Fossils show lining up is primal urge."},{"question":"Student: Premise: \\"Yellow balloon with above ruins with tourists around.\\"Hypothesis: \\"Someone let go of a balloon while exploring some ruins.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- no.Teacher: Let's think:","answer":"Not all balloons in the sky were let go by a person.

Title: Durable, versatile, and affordable Review: Other reviews have already covered this enamel dutch oven extensively. But I have to state that, as a chef, having high-quality equipment to cook with makes a world of difference. While Le Creuset might be the Cadillac of enamel cookware, this is much more affordable and works incredibly well. This is so versatile and perfect for soups, roasts, or even duck confit. While enamel cookware does require some patience when it comes to high-heat cooking, it can withstand just about anything you throw at it. I love cast-iron cooking at home and have a standard cast-iron dutch oven, but find it unsuited to some soups and such. That's where this comes in. I find myself using this for more and more tasks, more than I anticipated. For the many of us who can't afford Le Creuset cookware, this is nearly just as good.

Rationale: The relevant information to answer the above question is: The first film to be released with this rating was the 1984 John Milius war film Red Dawn. The question and answer:","answer":"In the early 1980s complaints about violence and gore in films such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins, both of which received PG ratings, refocused attention on films seen by small children and pre-teens. According to author Filipa Antunes, this revealed the conundrum of a film which \\"could not be recommended for all children but also could not be repudiated for all children uniformly,\\" leading to speculation that the rating system's scope, in particular its PG classification, \\"no longer matched a notion of childhood most parents in America could agree on.\\" Steven Spielberg, director of Temple of Doom and executive producer of Gremlins, suggested a new intermediate rating between \\"PG\\" and \\"R\\". The \\"PG-13\\" rating was introduced in July 1984, with the advisory \\"Parents Are Strongly Cautioned to Give Special Guidance for Attendance of Children Under 13 -- Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Young Children\\". The first film to be released with this rating was the 1984 John Milius war film Red Dawn. In 1985, the wording was simplified to \\"Parents Strongly Cautioned -- Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Children Under 13\\". Around the same time, the MPAA won a trademark infringement lawsuit against the producers and distributors of I Spit on Your Grave over a fraudulent application of its R rating to the uncut version of the film, and forced its member studios and several other home video distributors to put MPAA ratings on the packaging of MPAA-rated films via a settlement that would come into effect by fall that year.Based on this passage, what 1984 film had the first pg-13 rating?The answer is the 1984 John Milius war film Red Dawn"},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Japanese.

Asimismo, espera que cinco años se lleve a cabo la primera misión tripulada a un asteroide. De acuerdo a la NASA, este 4 de diciembre lanzará la cápsula Orión a bordo del United Launch Alliance Delta IV, esto con la perspectiva de enviar en la misma una misión tripulada en el futuro. Se informó que la cápsula orbitará dos veces al planeta Tierra a 5800 kilómetros de altura para luego descender hasta el océano Pacífico. Así, se busca prever cualquier desperfecto que pueda poner en peligro la misión. Cuando Orión esté lista, podrá trasladar a cuatro personas en viajes de 21 días y a seis en desplazamientos más cortos. De esta forma, la agencia estadounidense hace oficial uno de los más grandes desafíos en la conquista del espacio. \\"Marte es un destino rico para el descubrimiento científico y la exploración robótica y humana, a medida que expandimos nuestra presencia en el Sistema Solar\\", aseveró. Sondas espaciales y robots de exploración han estudiado al planeta Marte por más de 40 años; la NASA ha considera que ya se puede plantear un viaje tripulado. Tras el viaje de Orión, la NASA enviará una misión robótica a capturar y redirigir un asteroide en órbita de la Luna. Gracias a ésto, los astronautas que viajen en el Orión podrán explorar el asteroide en 2025 y regresar a nuestro planeta con muestras. La experiencia ayudará a nuevos sistemas y capacidades, como la propulsión solar eléctrica.ANSWER: cuatro personas[A]: ¿Cuál será la capacidad de Orión para recorridos de 21 días?[Q]: CONTEXT: Legado El Edificio Chrysler aparece en varias películas ambientadas en Nueva York y es considerado con frecuencia uno de los mejores edificios de la ciudad. En 1997, una encuesta de arquitectos de Nueva York mostró que el Chrysler era de lejos su edificio favorito. En 2001, una encuesta entre críticos lo clasificó como el tercer mejor edificio del país. En verano de 2005, el Skyscraper Museum de Nueva York pidió a cien arquitectos, críticos, ingenieros e historiadores, entre otros, que escogieran a sus diez favoritos entre veinticinco rascacielos de Nueva York. El Edificio Chrysler quedó en primer lugar y el 90 % de los encuestados lo situaron entre sus diez favoritos. En 2007 quedó en novena posición en la lista de America's Favorite Architecture realizada por el Instituto Americano de Arquitectos, dentro de una selección de ciento cincuenta edificios y estructuras.ANSWER: El Edificio Chrysler[A]: ¿Cuál fue la edificación favorita de los arquitectos nuevayorkinos según una encuesta llevada a cabo en 1997?[Q]: CONTEXT: 6 de febrero de 2008 El general Michael Hayden, actual director de la CIA, reconoció el martes que la agencia estadounidense de espionaje utilizó la tortura conocida como \\"waterboarding\\" después de los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001. Durante una audiencia del Comité de Servicios de Inteligencia del Congreso, el general Michael Hayden declaró este martes 5 de febrero de 2008 que la CIA aplicó el \\"waterboarding\\" a Khalid Seik Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah y Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, detenidos por sospechas de ser miembros de Al Qaeda. El general Hayden observó incluso que, en el caso de Zubaydah, los resultados fueron “particularmente fructíferos”. El general Hayden afirmó que la CIA no ha utilizado más el waterboarding desde hace 5 años. Explicó que los interrogadores de la agencia recurrieron a esa \\"técnica\\" porque las autoridades estadounidenses temían la realización de nuevos ataques terroristas en los propios Estados Unidos. El término inglés \\"waterboarding\\" está siendo utilizado para designar una práctica que la Inquisición utilizó en la Edad Media para arrancar confesiones a sus víctimas. Esta práctica consiste en provocar el ahogamiento de la víctima vertiendo agua sobre un pedazo de tela colocado sobre su rostro. El \\"waterboarding\\" también fue utilizado durante la guerra de Vietnam (1965-1975) por soldados de Estados Unidos (Ver imagen.). La práctica del \\"waterboarding\\" coincide con la definición de tortura descrita en la Convención de la ONU contra la Tortura y los Tratamientos Crueles e Inhumanos, en vigor desde 1987 y firmada por Estados Unidos. Durante la audiencia, el director de la CIA se opuso a aceptar que la agencia se vea limitada a utilizar solamente las “técnicas de interrogatorio” autorizadas en el manual actualmente en vigor para su uso por los interrogadores de las fuerzas armadas de Estados Unidos.ANSWER: vertiendo agua sobre un pedazo de tela colocado sobre su rostro[A]:","answer":"¿Cómo se ejecuta este tipo de tortura en la persona que la sufre?"},{"question":"Teacher: In this task, you're given a dialogue between a customer and a flight booking agent with a gap in the conversation.

It simplifies history compared to the great Civ 2, makes user interface cumbersome, and creates various annoying quirks with Espionage, Diplomacy, among others, all that while giving us lots meaningless superficial cute graphics.Civ 3 was missing many vital aspects, such as Multiplayer.

He is a former President of the Producers Guild of America., Grey's Anatomy is an American medical drama television series that premiered on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) as a mid-season replacement on March 27, 2005. The series focuses on the fictional lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is a play on \\"Gray's Anatomy\\", a human anatomy textbook by Henry Gray. The show's premise originated with Shonda Rhimes, who serves as an executive producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg. Although the show is set in Seattle at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (Formerly Seattle Grace-Mercy West) it is primarily filmed in Los Angeles, California.

Corn is an American television producer and director., Allan Heinberg (born June 29, 1967) is an American film screenwriter, television writer and producer and comic book writer., In American and Canadian television, a mid-season replacement is a television series that premieres in the second half of the traditional television season, usually between January and May. Mid-season replacements usually take place after a show that was in the fall schedule was canceled or put on hiatus, outside factors such as an actor's family emergency or personal illness led to a delay in the program's debut, a program was purposefully scheduled for mid-season, or a program had a shortened season for some other reason which resulted in a time slot that needed filling. A few shows in American television history have been perennial mid-season replacements; \\"American Idol\\", for example, from its second season onward, aired from January to May each year, to great ratings success., A medical drama is a television program in which events center upon a hospital, an ambulance staff, or any medical environment and most medical episodes are one hour long and set in a hospital. Most current medical dramatic programming go beyond the events pertaining to the characters' jobs and portray some aspects of their personal lives. A typical medical drama might have a storyline in which two doctors fall in love. Communications theorist Marshall McLuhan, in his on the nature of media, predicted success for this particular genre on TV because the medium \\"creates an obsession with bodily welfare\\". , Gray's Anatomy is an English-language textbook of human anatomy originally written by Henry Gray and illustrated by Henry Vandyke Carter. Earlier editions were called Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical and Gray's Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied, but the book's name is commonly shortened to, and later editions are titled, \\"Gray's Anatomy\\". The book is widely regarded as an extremely influential work on the subject, and has continued to be revised and republished from its initial publication in 1858 to the present day. The latest edition of the book, the 41st, was published in September 2015.Publication history.Origins.The English anatomist Henry Gray was born in 1827. He studied the development of the endocrine glands and spleen and in 1853 was appointed Lecturer on Anatomy at St George's Hospital Medical School in London. In 1855, he approached his colleague Henry Vandyke Carter with his idea to produce an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students. Dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital mortuaries through the Anatomy Act of 1832, the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book. Their work was first published in 1858 by John William Parker in London.It was dedicated by Gray to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet.An imprint of this English first edition was published in the United States in 1859, with slight alterations.Gray prepared a second, revised edition, which was published in the United Kingdom in 1860, also by J.W. Parker. However, Gray died the following year, at the age of 34, having contracted smallpox while treating his nephew (who survived). His death had come just three years after the initial publication of his \\"Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical\\".Even so, the work on his much-praised book was continued by others.Longman's publication reportedly began in 1863, after their acquisition of the J.W. Parker publishing business. This coincided with the publication date of the third British edition of \\"Gray's Anatomy.\\" Successive British editions of \\"Gray's Anatomy\\" continued to be published under the Longman, and more recently Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier imprints, reflecting further changes in ownership of the publishing companies over the years., The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the DisneyABC Television Group, a subsidiary of the Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company.

Follow the example to solve a new instance of the task.In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.Step 1: For each row in Movie table, find the corresponding rows in Rating table.Step 2: find each value of director in the results of step 1 along with the summation of stars of the corresponding rows to each valueSolution: SELECT T1.title , Sum ( T2.stars ) FROM Movie AS T1 JOIN Rating AS T2 ON T1.mID = T2.mID GROUP BY T1.directorWhy? This SQL statement uses a \\"JOIN\\" statement to combine the \\"Movie\\" and \\"Rating\\" table then find the corresponding rows by comparing the movie id, which accomplishes step 1. Finally the SQL statement groups the values by each director and returns the title of each movie and the sum of all the stars, which accomplishes step 2. This is a good example.New input: Step 1: For each row in Physician table, find the corresponding rows in Patient table.Step 2: find Patient's Name of the results of step 1 whose Physician's Name equals Surgery.Step 3: find Patient's Name of the results of step 1 whose Physician's Name equals Psychiatry.Step 4: show the rows that are in both the results of step 2 and the results of step 3Solution:","answer":"SELECT T2.Name FROM Physician AS T1 JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.PCP WHERE T1.Name = \\"Surgery\\" INTERSECT SELECT T2.Name FROM Physician AS T1 JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.PCP WHERE T1.Name = \\"Psychiatry\\""},{"question":"Stream of consciousness rationale: An Asian girl has a different ethnicity than a white girl.The question and answer pair are described below.","answer":"Q: Premise: \\"A young asian girl wearing a dress running.\\"Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The girl is white.\\" is true?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noA: no"},{"question":"In this task, you are given a list.

Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel. Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn (Jacky Cheung), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy (Joey Wong) and Moon (Michelle Reis) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu. The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu (Waise Lee). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father. Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk. The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away. The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving. In the desert, as Yin and Ning are about to continue their journey, they see two women approach on horseback, which happen to be Windy and Moon. Windy has escaped from her wedding and decides to leave with NingExplanation: All the given five facts are present in the generated story in the same order that they appear in the input.Part 3. ExerciseFact1: single mother was abandoned by unemployed husband, Fact2: Theresa and daughter live in apartment complex, Fact3: outreach worker Calvin Reed finds place for Theresa to stay, Fact4: family goes hungry during fourth week or end of month, Fact5: son hopes to break cycle of poverty by being first person in family to graduate from high schoolAnswer:","answer":"Theresa Johnson is a single mother, who was abandoned by her unemployed husband some time after her daughter, Hillary, was born. The two live in a cramped apartment in the innercity, within walking distance to Hillarys school and Theresas workplace. The occupants of the apartment complex Theresa and her daughter live in are all notified of their eviction due to the city tearing down the apartments. Theresa has nowhere to go. Theresa clocks out of work early to look for a place for her and her daughter to live, but is fired the next day for leaving early. The two go from homeless shelter to homeless shelter, trying to find a place to stay. Often they sleep on the streets. At one shelter Theresa meets outreach worker Calvin Reed, who finds another place for Theresa to stay, while she receives welfare aid. The house is filthy and infested with rats. Theresa and Hillary settle into their new home, and the life of their neighboring family, the Watkins, is explored. The Watkins are a poor AfricanAmerican family who live in a house not much different from Theresa and Hillary. The father of the family, Raymond Watkins, abandoned the house long ago because I am worth more to them gone than there and doesnt pay childsupport. He is deeply hurt by this failure. The family receives welfare but cant afford anything other than necessities, and goes hungry during the fourth week, or the end of the month when most families have run out of food stamps. The son, Richard Watkins, hopes to break the cycle of poverty that has plagued their family, by being the first person in their family to graduate from high school. Theresa has just been evicted from her house by her confrontational landlord, after reporting the state of her house and the rat infestation to the Department of Health. Theresa and Hillary stay in the shelters once again, then Hillary contracts leadpoisoning from the poor state of the shelters and lack of sanitation. At the local hospital, Theresa is told by Hillarys doctor that if she contracts leadpoisoning again, it can cause severe health and development problems. Since Theresa and Hillary have been forced to travel between shelters the cause of Hillarys leadpoisoning cant be traced. Because of a lack of a steady home, Theresa cannot guarantee Hillarys safety. Theresa consults Mr. Reed and concludes that the only way Hillary can live a healthy, normal life, free from poverty, is by giving her up. The only way this can happen immediately is if Hillary is abandoned. Theresa makes the decision to take Hillary to the park and leaves her for Mr. Reed to pick up. Before leaving her, she gives her a heart necklace and tells her that every time she looks at it she should remember that she loves her. When she leaves, Mr. Reed and another social worker take Hillary away, and the story ends with Theresa alone in the park, crying, as Hillary can still be heard crying for her mother. Before the credits start, the statement 32 million people live in poverty in the United States, today. 13 million of them are children. is shown."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A man in a santa suit stands amid a long row of dancers on a new york city street.\\"Hypothesis: \\"A man is wearing a tshirt.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noLet's solve step-by-step:","answer":"One cannot be in a Santa suit and wearing a shirt simultaneously.

But while ..advertises this show widescreen, my copy certainly is not, which distresses me a great deal given that this is a very tightly shot show based a great deal on sight gags. Its better than the horribly hacked versions shown on Comedy Central but it still suffers greatly being reduced to U.S. television format. I expect this nonsense from A@E (The Avengers, The Prisoner, expurgated Monty Python) but I had hopes the BBC might come of age on DVD after the damage they did to their shows on VHS.

Product review: The basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a 'killing-machine' integrate back into society. Yes, it's been done before but still holds promise. The plot was adequate.The acting was believable - no complaints there. I particularly enjoyed Sean Pertwee as 'Mace'. And Jason Isaacs has long been a favorite actor.But what ruined the movie for me was the science. I'm not a fanatic - I have no problems with FTL travel or spaceships 'banking' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies. And I realize that movies are not 'real'. But I've never seen more 'bad' science in any one movie. My son and I watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers.I could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night. It spoiled the whole movie for me.decreaseYou are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?

Review: America's undersea involvement in the Cold War was an astounding story of ingenuity, persistence and courage. Learning this from Blind Man's Bluff required a tolerance for poor writing that I found difficult to muster.If not for the importance and intrigue of the subject matter, this book would hold no appeal. The sentence structure is often awkward and ambiguous. In a book that dabbles with technical information, this is unacceptable. Some of the factual errors are simple enough to betray a lack of basic understanding of the subject.Technical confusion is not the only problem. Subjects change mid-sentence. Adjectives are irrelevant. Punctuation is misleading. Even minimal editing would have improved the book immensely.I can't imagine why the authors spent years researching this book and then put no effort into relating the story clearly.

Review: You get a lot of movies here for the price of one.As a side-note, I am suprised that there is a spelling error or two (didn't anyone proof read?), but that's not much of a big deal. :)The movies may not be the quality that modern people are used to, but they are good. A bit \\"B\\" and old, but still enjoyable. Great for people who love the old fashion horror films.The two things I didn't like:1. Some of these movies are not horror. They're crime or mystery....but not horror.2. The selection could have been better. Can you believe they didn't put Bela Lugosi Dracula in here?? I'm still severely disappointed over that.Nonetheless, there are great classics like Nosferatu, Night of the Living Dead, The Phantom of the Opera, to name a few. It's the main reason I bought it.

Answer of the question can be found directly from the passage.One example: Passage: Omelettes make a great breakfast , and I enjoy making them because they are very easy to cook . First , I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl . I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories . I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette . I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle . It is then ready to serve ! Question: How many times is the omelette flipped? Option1: three times Option2: onceSolution is here: onceExplanation: As mentioned in the passage that I then flip one side of the omelette; it is clear that omelette is flipped one time only.Now, solve this: Passage: Yesterday I boiled milk for my mom .

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.See one example below:Problem: Sentence: The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.  Reason: The 'they' refers to the city councilmen because city councilmen are administrative so they are more likely to fear.  Question: Is the above reasoning correct or wrong? Solution: Correct.Explanation: This is a correct reason since the pronoun in the sentence is descibed as ones who fear violence and the city councilmen are attached with this property.Problem: Sentence: Bob collapsed on the sidewalk.

DefinitionGiven a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

To exclude the effects of symptoms and to differentiate between a central and peripheral site of action, we measured the effect of adenosine infused at a level (70-80 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) below the threshold for symptoms. Resting ventilation (VE) and progressive ventilatory responses to isocapnic hypoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia were measured in six normal men. Compared with a control saline infusion given single blind on the same day, adenosine stimulated VE [mean increase: 1.3 +/- 0.8 (SD) l/min; P less than 0.02], lowered resting end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) (mean fall: -3.9 +/- 0.9 Torr), and increased heart rate (mean increase: 16.1 +/- 8.1 beats/min) without changing systemic blood pressure. Adenosine increased the hypoxic ventilatory response (control: -0.68 +/- 0.4 l X min-1 X %SaO2-1, where %SaO2 is percent of arterial O2 saturation; adenosine: -2.40 +/- 1.2 l X min-1 X %SaO2-1; P less than 0.01) measured at a mean PETCO2 of 38.3 +/- 0.6 Torr but did not alter the hypercapnic response. This differential effect suggests that adenosine may stimulate ventilation by a peripheral rather than a central action and therefore may be involved in the mechanism of peripheral chemoreception.  Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Effects of adenosine on ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in humans. option2: Paradoxical potassium depletion: a renal mechanism for extrarenal potassium adaptation.Effects of adenosine on ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in humans.Abstract: Two men, aged 25 and 33 years, had progressive hemidystonia and an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. One patient with an AVM in the posterior basal ganglia of the right hemisphere had an older brother with severe generalized dystonia. The second patient had an AVM in the left cortical and subcortical parietal area with no obvious lesion in the basal ganglia. Unlike generalized dystonia, a focal lesion is commonly found in patients with unilateral dystonia. The association of AVM-induced hemidystonia and family history of dystonia suggests that genetic predisposition may be important in some patients with hemidystonia.  Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Arteriovenous malformation presenting as hemidystonia. option2: Bacteremia during bronchoalveolar lavage.Arteriovenous malformation presenting as hemidystonia.Abstract: PRL and GH are stored in bovine pituitary secretory granules in part as intermolecular disulfide-linked multimers (as many as 50 monomers/oligomer). In vitro incubation of granules with reduced glutathione (GSH) results in the production of monomeric hormones and increased hormone release. We tested the hypothesis that increases in intragranular osmolality due to conversion of oligomers to lower mol wt forms are key to granule rupture. Hormone release was measured after granule incubations in medium made hyperosmotic by the addition of raffinose or sucrose. PRL release at pH 7.8 with 0.7 M raffinose was reduced to 43.5% of the control value, whereas GH release ranged from 70-100% of the control value. Augmented release stimulated by 2 mM GSH was also diminished by raffinose, to 17.9% (PRL) and 75.6% (GH) of control values. The IC50 for raffinose inhibition of PRL release was 0.62 M; this shifted to 0.38 M in the presence of 2 mM GSH. Raffinose also blunted the granule response to GSH at all other GSH concentrations tested and decreased stimulated release at pH 9 as well as at 7.8. Interference with the ability to maintain an osmotic gradient, a maneuver accomplished by partial disruption of granule membranes with 0.5% deoxycholate treatment, reduced or abolished the raffinose inhibition. Molecular sizing of granule fractions on Superose-6 (Pharmacia) indicated that PRL monomers remaining in the pelletable granule fraction increased with raffinose about 2-fold under both basal and GSH-stimulated conditions. These data support the concept that thiol:disulfide equilibria may be important in PRL and GH storage and secretion by their influence on intragranular osmolality. In exocytosis in vivo, osmotically mediated granule rupture may be triggered by thiols during granule:plasma membrane fusion.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.Article: Of all the famous English writers, probably the best known is William Shakespeare. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 on April the 23rd. His father was an important man in town so Shakespeare had a good upbringing. Shakespeare probably went to school (although no records survive to prove this) but not university. He got married when he was 18 to Anne Hathaway and the couple had 3 children. Shakespeare wrote 38 plays and 154 sonnets (a sonnet is a kind of poem). He began working in his home town of Stratford but by 1592 was writing in London. He became rich enough to buy a house in the capital and one in Stratford.  He wrote sad stories called tragedies, like Romeo and Juliet, funny stories or comedies, romantic stories and stories about historical figures such as Julius Caesar.  Shakespeare died on his birthday in 1616, almost 400 years ago. But why is his work still popular today? His work looked at common human themes, such as betrayal, murder, lust, power, ambition and love. These themes are as much a part of human nature today as they were all those years ago and are the themes we see in modern soap operas and Hollywood films. Even though his theatre, The Globe, burned down in 1613 it was rebuilt in London in 1997 and you can still see his plays performed there today. Shakespeare's influence on the English language can still be felt today. We talk about \\"fair play\\", meaning honest behaviour but this phrase was first used by Shakespeare. He coined the phrase \\"you can have too much of a good thing\\". And it was Shakespeare who came up with the expression to disappear \\"into thin air\\" which we still use today when we lose something. Shakespeare's work has been translated into every major language in the world. And perhaps we'll still be as fascinated by his work 400 years from now as we've been for the last 400.

Context: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. Question: Roland was a: Options:  A. Prisoner  B. not enough information  C. Record keeper  D.

My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

Context: As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind. Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could. The bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America.

After missing last year's U.S. Open with a shoulder injury  former champion Maria Sharapova returned to the spotlight with an impressive 6-3  6-0 victory over Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria on Tuesday. Sharapova's game was as glittery as her black-and-silver dress and matching headwrap  an outfit she described as a tribute to New York's skyline. Sharapova showed no signs of the shoulder tear that forced her to have surgery in October and kept her off the tour for nearly 10 months. \\"This is a Grand Slam. You've got to get going from the first match \\" Sharapova said. \\"After being gone  this is what it's all about.\\" In addition to tennis skills and grit that once placed her No. 1 in the rankings  Sharapova always has placed an emphasis on fashion. On this night  her black dress carried bold  metallic accents that would gain her entry into even the trendiest of New York clubs. She paired it with a matching  '60s-style silver headband. As often happens with Sharapova  the postmatch  on-court interview dealt as much with her getup as her game. \\"It's always 50-50: You never know when people are going to like it or not \\" Sharapova told the crowd. game. \\"It's always 50-50: You never know when people are going to like it or not \\" Sharapova told the crowd. The Serb had the worst showing ever by a top-seeded woman in New York last year when she exited in the second round. Ivanovic did herself one worse this time. At least the 2008 French Open champion had a big support group in the stands  cheering for her wildly. Safina  in contrast  would look up at her coach for positive body language  and instead  he'd cover his eyes with his hands or turn his head with a wince. \\"Well \\" Safina would say later  \\"I guess I had to think: 'What I'm doing wrong?'\\" There's been some debate this season about whether Safina deserves the top ranking  one spot ahead of Serena Williams. The Russian did not bolster her case on Tuesday. Nearly undone by 11 double-faults and 48 total unforced errors  Safina was a point away from a 4-0 deficit in the third set before coming back to beat Olivia Rogowska of Australia 6-7 (5)  6-2  6-4. Safina  younger sister of 2000 U.S. Open champion Marat Safin  is used to faring well in the early stages of Grand Slam tournaments.

Your task is to summarize them.Q: In its campaign across northern Syria and Iraq, the jihadist group Islamic State has been using ammunition from the United States and other countries that have been supporting the regional security forces fighting the group, according to new field data gathered by a private arms-tracking organization.    The data, part of a larger sample of captured arms and cartridges in Syria and Iraq, carries an implicit warning for policy makers and advocates of intervention.    It suggests that ammunition transferred into Syria and Iraq to help stabilize governments has instead passed from the governments to the jihadists, helping to fuel the Islamic State’s rise and persistent combat power. Rifle cartridges from the United States, the sample shows, have played a significant role.    “The lesson learned here is that the defense and security forces that have been supplied ammunition by external nations really don’t have the capacity to maintain custody of that ammunition,” said James Bevan, director of Conflict Armament Research, the organization that is gathering and analyzing weapons used by the Islamic State. ||||| US-led air strikes in northern Syria have failed to interrupt the advance of Islamic State (Isis) fighters closing in on a key city on the Turkish border, raising questions about the western strategy for defeating the jihadi movement.    Almost two weeks after the Pentagon extended its aerial campaign from Iraq to neighbouring Syria in an attempt to take on Isis militants in their desert strongholds, Kurdish fighters said the bombing campaign was having little impact in driving them back.    Isis units have edged to within two kilometres of the centre of Kobani, according to Kurds fighting a rearguard action inside the city. The jihadis, who this weekend generated further outrage with the murder of the British hostage Alan Henning, are simply too numerous to be cowed by the air assault by US fighter jets, the Kurds say.    “Air strikes alone are really not enough to defeat Isis in Kobani,” said Idris Nassan, a senior spokesman for the Kurdish fighters desperately trying to defend the important strategic redoubt from the advancing militants. “They are besieging the city on three sides, and fighter jets simply cannot hit each and every Isis fighter on the ground.”    He said Isis had adapted its tactics to military strikes from the air. “Each time a jet approaches, they leave their open positions, they scatter and hide. What we really need is ground support. We need heavy weapons and ammunition in order to fend them off and defeat them.”    The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that warplanes have carried out repeated strikes in recent nights around Kobani. The Pentagon has reported daily on its aerial missions over Iraq and Syria since first deciding to go after Isis two months ago. But it does not pinpoint exact locations. “Two strikes north-west of Raqqa struck a large (Isis) unit and destroyed six firing positions,” it said on Sunday in a statement. Kobani is north-west of Raqqa.    But the claim that the aerial bombardment is not sufficient to turn the tide on the ground will unsettle those in the US-led coalition, including the UK government, who have signed up to an air war as the best way of taking the fight to Isis.    In Washington, military hawks continue to argue for an escalation of the war in Syria and Iraq with the deployment of US ground troops – a move that Barack Obama has repeatedly ruled out.    “The strategy of aerial bombardment is not going to work to destroy Isil [Isis],” the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham told CNN. “You cannot destroy Isil without a ground component.” He argued that training the inexperienced fighters of the Free Syrian Army in Saudi Arabia was “militarily unsound” and “will lead to their slaughter”.    His words were echoed in London by the former chief of the defence staff General Sir David Richards. “Air power alone will not win a campaign like this,” he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show. “It isn’t actually a counter-terrorist operation. This is a conventional enemy in that it has armour, tanks, artillery … it is quite wealthy, it holds ground and it is going to fight. So therefore you have to view it as a conventional military campaign.”    Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, disagreed. “How you respond is not quite as straightforward as David Richards, much as I respect him, suggests,” he said. “I don’t think it is a question of simply ramping up conventional armed forces again as if we were fighting state-to-state conflicts.”    Clegg said states would cooperate in a “jigsaw” operation in which different countries bring different capabilities against “stateless mobile troops”. But Britain has thus far committed only to air strikes over Iraq, and Clegg said he was opposed to stepping up the British action. “I wouldn’t advocate extending the air campaign into Syria which is why we didn’t do it last week,” he said. The prime minister,    David Cameron, will not propose a vote on Syrian air strikes unless the Lib Dems and Labour agree.    But appetite to confront Isis remains undiminished in the light of the grim succession of the murders of hostages. Cameron vowed at the weekend to use “all the assets we have” to secure justice for Henning, whose murder was broadcast online on Friday night, making him the fourth captive to be killed in six weeks. Isis has threatened to kill an American aid worker, Peter Kassig, next.    Kobani has emerged as the most important flashpoint between Kurds and jihadists in Syria because of the strategic importance of the city and the sheer numbers of Kurds who sought refuge there in recent months. More than 160,000 have fled to Turkey in the face of the Isis advance, sharply aggravating historic tensions between Turks and Kurds. On Sunday, a stray shell hit a village on the Turkish side of the border, injuring five people.    MPs and representatives of Kurdish groups in Turkey arrived at the border to show solidarity with Syrian Kurds and to form a “human chain” stretching along villages bordering Kobani. Meanwhile, Saleh Muslim, co-chair of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union party (PYD), went to Ankara this weekend to hold meetings with Turkish security officials to discuss possible Turkish assistance in defending Kobani against Isis. Turkey’s government has vowed it will not sit idly by and let Kobani fall.    Turkish media reported that security officials in Ankara urged Muslim to convince the YPG, the armed wing of the PYD that is currently battling Isis in Kobani, to join the ranks of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and to “take an open stance against the Syrian regime” of Bashar al-Assad.    “We are calling on the international community to help us defend Kobani,” said Nassan.    He said the exact outcome of the meetings remained unclear, but hinted that Muslim had asked Ankara to allow for the PYD, the Syrian Kurdish affiliate of the better-known Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), to receive arms from outside of Syria.    “If Isis takes Kobani, they will be right on the border with Turkey. This concerns not only us, but Turkey, too.” ||||| Story highlights Source says \\"It's the last chance to leave\\" for Kobani defenders    ISIS fighters have taken part of a strategic hill near Kobani, sources say    ISIS fighters have entered the southeastern edge of the city, the sources said    Pakistani Taliban issues statement supporting ISIS    ISIS moved closer to seizing Kobani on Sunday as militants entered the southeastern edge of the Syrian city and street-to-street fighting began, a fighter and a media activist inside the city told CNN.    The city's defenders were looking for ways to escape the Kurdish stronghold strategically located near the Turkish border, the fighter said.    \\"It's the last chance to leave,\\" the fighter said. The fighter and media activist requested their names be withheld for security reasons.    As night fell, the city grew quiet.    Members of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, called YPG, and other groups defending the city were unable to move because ISIS snipers were equipped with night vision equipment, the fighter said.    The fighter said many city defenders close to the Turkish border attempted to cross into Turkey, while other fighters closer to ISIS positions were waiting until the morning to make a move.    The importance of Kobani    ISIS has been trying to seize Kobani for weeks. The city is significant because ISIS wants to claim a swath of land running from its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, on the Euphrates River to the Turkish border, more than 60 miles away.    On Sunday, ISIS fighters overpowered Kurdish forces to take the top and the eastern side of Meshta Nour, the strategic hill overlooking Kobani, said the sources, who both requested their names be withheld for security reasons.    A civilian source inside Kobani said there have been heavy clashes on all fronts around Kobani. He said ISIS forces had been moved back from a small corner of the city they'd held for two days.    The YPG said in a statement that 86 \\"terrorists\\" were killed during a 24-hour period and 17 YPG members died.    On Sunday, smoke billowed over Kobani as ISIS sent bombs into the middle of town.    U.S., allies stage airstrikes    Kobani is now tightly surrounded in a crescent from the Aleppo road on the southwestern outskirts of the city all the way to the eastern edge of Kobani, near the Turkish border, the fighter and media activist said.    ISIS is making inroads despite airstrikes by U.S. and allied forces, including Sunday's strikes on the eastern outskirts of the city.    The YPG destroyed an ISIS tank in the east of Kobani near Kane Kordan, a large mound on the eastern of the city, the civilian source said.    ISIS fighters are now about about one kilometer south on the Aleppo road, the civilian source said.    Turkish security force throw teargas    Conflict occurred outside Kobani when Turkish security forces fired tear gas canisters at Kurds gathered near the border to watch the fighting from afar, CNN's Phil Black reported.    Black said the security forces fired the tear gas when the crowds became restive or moved too close to the border. At least three canisters struck a CNN van, he said. Nobody was badly hurt and the crowds dispersed.    Pakistani Talilban supports ISIS    ISIS picked up support when Pakistani Taliban spokesperson Shahidullah Shahid issued a statement backing ISIS.    \\"The Muslims of the world look to you with great expectation and in this difficult time we your mujahidin brothers are with you and will provide you with fighters and help,\\" the statement said.    Meanwhile, U.S. and allied military forces conducted three airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and six airstrikes in Iraq on Saturday and Sunday, U.S. Central Command reported.    In Syria, one strike northwest of Al Mayadin destroyed an ISIS bulldozer, two tanks and another vehicle, the military said. Two strikes northwest of Ar Raqqah hit a large ISIS unit and destroyed six firing positions.    In Iraq, four strikes northeast of Fallujah struck two mortar teams, a large ISIS unit and two small ISIS units, the military said. Three ISIS Humvees were destroyed with strikes near Hit and Sinjar.    Australians complete first air mission    Australia has completed its first air combat mission over Iraq, the government announced Sunday in a press release.    Two Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft conducted an air interdiction and close air support mission over northern Iraq and were on-call to attack targets if needed, the release said.    The aircraft did not use their munitions and returned to base to disarm, the release said. |||||A: The start of a new week brings not much in the way of encouraging ISIS news. The latest: The news: Kurdish fighters battling ISIS in northern Syria say the airstrikes aimed at the militants there haven't done much to stop the group's advance on Kobani. Kurds put ISIS' position as within roughly a mile of the center of the city, which sits along the Turkish border. A rep for the Kurds explains to the Guardian that upon the approach of a jet, the fighters \\"scatter and hide. ... Fighter jets simply cannot hit each and every ISIS fighter on the ground.\\" Though the Pentagon shares no specifics about strike locations, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that the areas around Kobani have been continually hit in recent days. The significance: The Guardian sees the Kurds' assertion as one that will \\"unsettle those in the US-led coalition ... who have signed up to an air war as the best way of taking the fight to ISIS.\\" As for why Kobani matters, it falls within the stretch of land that ISIS seeks to claim between its \\"capital\\" of Raqqa and the border with Turkey, notes CNN. The news: The New York Times today reports on what ISIS fighters are using to wage their battle: ammunition from America and other enemy nations of ISIS. The finding comes from Conflict Armament Research's analysis of 1,730 cartridges found in Syria and Iraq—either sized by Kurdish fighters or gathered by CAR investigators. In the former country, most of the seized cartridges were manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s, most commonly in China. The cartridges found in Iraq were mostly of US origin, and manufactured in the 2000s. More than 80% of the ammunition was made in the US, China, post-Soviet Russia, and Serbia. The significance: Per the Times, the data \\"carries an implicit warning for policy makers and advocates of intervention. It suggests that ammunition transferred into Syria and Iraq to help stabilize governments has instead passed from the governments to the jihadists.\\" Also, the parents of an American ISIS hostage released a letter he wrote to them.Q: The 2008 election was not devoid of racist anti-Obama sentiment, but racial slurs and offensive slogans seem to be balder this time – from a racially derogatory joke circulated by a US judge to crude bumper stickers.    Racism, in forms both overt and sly, appears to be rearing its head higher than in the 2008 election campaign, when voters took the historic step of electing the first African-American president in the nation's history.    Already there's been some nasty stuff. Chief among them: an online video that went viral over the weekend, which shows a car sporting a bumper sticker that says \\"Don't Re-N-- in 2012\\" (fill in the blanks with half of the word that many African-Americans consider to be perhaps more inflammatory than any other). Some question whether the video depicts a real or a photo-shopped car and slogan, but the fact remains that the bumper sticker is the No. 1 best-seller at Stickatude.com, where it sells for 3. Stumpy's Stickers, until the site went down over the weekend, also peddled the design, one with a caricature of a black man's face missing a tooth and another with a picture of a chimpanzee that reads, \\"Obama 2012.\\"    These and other racially loaded campaign materials point to efforts to make an issue of President Obama's race in this election, say analysts. Such calculations are born of frustration and even rage against both the president and his policies, which some perceive to have a pro-black slant, they say. While such virulent expressions may play to the racist sentiments of a subset of Americans, they are also likely to offend a vast many more voters and could have the opposite effect of what their creators intended.    “We are just beginning to see the glimmers” of the racial card being played in this campaign, says Randall McLaughlin, a civil rights lawyer and a professor at Pace Law School in White Plains, N.Y.    He cites a video produced by the late Andrew Breitbart, conservative blogger and provocateur. It included film footage of a young Barack Obama embracing Derrick Bell, then a Harvard law professor and an architect of critical race theory, which holds that racism remains deeply embedded in US laws and institutions despite – and even because of – efforts to redress it. Mr. Breitbart had promoted the video as a \\"bombshell,\\" suggesting that it proved Mr. Obama to be a “race warrior” intent on righting the wrongs of history on the backs of white Americans. But the Obama-Bell video fizzled, says Professor McLaughlin.    Still, such efforts are designed to turn up the heat on racial issues in this election, he says. “We are not in a post-racial America,” McLaughlin adds. His prediction: “This is going to be the nastiest election cycle we’ve ever seen.”    To Mark Naison, professor of African American studies and history at Fordham University in New York, the difference between the 2008 and 2012 campaigns is that the racial messages now are cruder and uglier.    There is \\"an added edge to it,\\" he says in an e-mail, \\"because Barack Obama is a powerful, incumbent President who is the odds-on favorite to win the 2012 election.” This gives what “racist expressions that do come out an air of desperation, rage, and quite frankly, startling self destructiveness,” he says.    He reminds, though, that racism was apparent in the 2008 contest, too, citing a Sarah Palin rally in Johnstown, Pa., a month before the election, during which a man in the audience held aloft a monkey doll with an Obama sticker wrapped around its head.    Most Americans do not want to go back to the Jim Crow past, when it was common to use animal metaphors to degrade African-Americans, says Professor Naison. Earlier this month, the chief US judge for the District of Montana, Richard Cebull, apologized to \\"anyone who was offended\\" after he forwarded on his office e-mail system a derogatory joke about Mr. Obama. “A little boy said to his mother; ‘Mommy, how come I’m black and you’re white?’ ” the joke in the e-mail said. “His mother replied, ‘Don’t even go there Barack! From what I can remember about that party, you’re lucky you don’t bark!' \\"    There is no better way to drive independent voters or disillusioned liberals into the Obama camp than to use racist appeals, \\"many of them crude and atavistic,\\" to attack the president, says Naison.    Many conservatives, however, argue that Democrats cry racism to avoid discussing topics about which there are legitimate differences of opinion. “With all due respect, I find it offensive when people refer to Americans' dislike of Obama as race-based,” says Klea Theoharis, a New York-based financial adviser who blogs about government waste on her website, taxdollarwastewatch.wordress.com. She supported GOP candidate Herman Cain. “It insults our intelligence. For those interested enough to care about the issues and America's future, it has nothing to do with race, but policy,” she adds.    Nonetheless, others suggest that GOP presidential candidates are intentionally stoking racial fears even as they make a policy point. At an Iowa event prior to the caucuses, Rick Santorum contrasted himself with Obama this way, telling a mostly white audience that \\"I would not make black people's lives better by giving them other people's money.\\" Newt Gingrich told a Plymouth, N.H., audience that he would attend the NAACP convention and explain \\"why the African-American community should demand paychecks instead of food stamps.\\"    The former House speaker also has suggested that children from housing projects should be hired to clean bathrooms in public schools to learn there are jobs besides pimping and drug dealing.    But what to some listeners is a tough-minded proposal to teach a work ethic is to others an example of coded racism that plays to old stereotypes.    This sort of racial rhetoric allows politicians “to tap white anxieties that blacks are un-deserving of any government assistance because they would rather collect benefits than work,” says Charles Gallagher, chairman of the sociology department at La Salle University in Philadelphia, in an e-mail. \\"This new variation on The Southern Strategy works as a way to tap deeply ingrained stereotypes that whites have about blacks; simply put, that whites have a work ethic and blacks do not.”    Now that a black man runs the White House, he adds, “politicians have more latitude to discuss public policy in a distorted and racist way and do so in a way that is simply given as a critique of government.”    Democrats, too, must take responsibility for playing the race card when it suits them, says Republican strategist David Johnson, who worked on Robert Dole’s 1988 presidential campaign. With support for Obama lagging behind 2008 levels, he says, Democrats such as Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Charles Schumer of New York work to rally the party's political base by suggesting that the other side is racist.    “It could make the difference [for] a Democrat who may not vote for a Republican candidate but ... also may not vote at all,” he says. Rousing such voters by charging that the president is being attacked because of his race can be a winning strategy for Democrats, Mr. Johnson adds.    The race issue intensified Tuesday amid reports that actor Robert De Niro, speaking at an Obama fundraiser attended by Michelle Obama in New York on Monday, questioned whether the \\"country is ready for a white first lady.\\" The Gingrich campaign denounced the comment.    \\"The crowd approved,\\" said Gingrich senior adviser Kiron Skinner, in a statement. \\"The media and many others would decry an equivalent comment by a conservative or a Republican supporter of a presidential candidate.    \\"As a senior adviser in Speaker Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign and as an African American woman, I stand against comments like DeNiro’s.\\"    The Obama campaign on Tuesday characterized De Niro's comment as \\"inappropriate.\\"    The most egregious race-baiting often finds its widest audience through social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Some of it remains anonymous, such as the owner of the domain name behind Stumpy’s Stickers. Stickatude is run by a Georgia paint-ball field owner, Paula Smith, who told Forbes.com over the weekend that she didn’t find the \\"Re-N--\\" sticker racist, but rather sees it as “cute.”    As with the swift immolation of the Stumpy's Sticker website after outrage mounted over the weekend, social media can cut both ways. The slogan in question first appeared on a T-shirt two years ago on zazzle.com and was taken down in response to criticism.    While the viral power of an online video can spread hate messages faster than at any time in history, the technology can also help mitigate its impact, says media pundit Paul Levinson, author of “New New Media.” Outcry over racist or polarizing messages rises just as quickly as the original objectionable message, he says. “While new media can be used to amplify a hate message, it can also be used to shut it down.” ||||| Exclusive: Paula Smith of Hinesville, Georgia has a company called Stickatude.com. And they’re selling their own version of an anti-Obama bumper sticker that reads “Don’t Re-Nig 2012.” Ms. Smith told me in a telephone conversation on Saturday afternoon that the bumper sticker has been in their inventory since June 2010, but just in the last few days it’s started selling. The price is 3. Ms. Smith insisted that the bumper sticker is not racist. I asked her about the “N” word, for which “nig” is the shortened version. “According to the dictionary [the N word] does not mean black. It means a low down, lazy, sorry, low down person. That’s what the N word means.”    In Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary, the word is defined as “member of any dark skinned race. Taken to be offensive.” Dictionary.com says the word “is now probably the most offensive word in English. Its degree of offensiveness has increased markedly in recent years, although it has been used in a derogatory manner since at least the Revolutionary War. Definitions 1a, 1b, and 2 represent meanings that are deeply disparaging and are used when the speaker deliberately wishes to cause great offense.”    Ms. Smith — who has an affable disposition and a hearty laugh–said she thought the website was “dead” and up until recently none of her bumper stickers was selling at all. Another site, called Stumpy’s Stickers, was originally credited with selling the Obama sticker. Ms. Smith says however she doesn’t own that site and didn’t know anything about it. She said Stumpy’s Stickers could have linked to their site, but she didn’t sell them any that they could have re-sold. Where did Ms. Smith find the sticker in the first place? “We just found it on the internet, and thought it was cute. It’s been up there since he’s been president.”    How did I find Stickatude.com? Clicking on Stumpysstickers.com from a story posted to Yahoo! caused a redirect to Stickatude. Ms. Smith is the official registered owner of the internet address, www.stickatude.com.    The Smiths own a well known paint ball field in Hinesville — a town near Savannah. Mrs. Smith said customers come from all over the world. Ms. Smith said she is not racist, she just wants Obama out of office. She tells me she doesn’t have a preferred replacement candidate. “And besides Obama is not even black. He’s got a mixture of race. It’s his choice of what his nationality is. I’m a mixed breed. I call myself a Heinz 57,” she says, referring to an ancestry that’s part of French, Scottish, and German.    “I just want someone that’s going to help the United States and not give it other countries all the time. And stop giving the immigrants the benefits that most Americans inside their own states can’t even get because they’re giving it others who don’t even live here as an American.    “I do find it amazing and entertaining that one of our stickers has become a racist thing,” Ms. Smith told me. I asked her if she thought the “N” Word was a bad word? “No,” she said, ” because I don’t use it. I have kids here around me that are black kids. I call them my own kids. I’ve helped black families…to guide them in the right direction. Paintball is one of these things. We like to laugh and have a good time. That’s our way of life.” |||||A: Forbes has tracked down the seller of the controversial \\"2012: Don't re-nig\\" anti-Obama bumper sticker, and Paula Smith claims there's nothing racist about it. \\"According to the dictionary,\\" the \\"N word\\" does \\"not mean black. It means a low-down, lazy, sorry, low-down person. That’s what the N-word means,\\" says Smith, who owns a paintball field in Georgia, and apparently has a very strange dictionary. (Forbes notes that Webster's defines it as \\"member of any dark skinned race. Taken to be offensive.\\") She says her online sticker company has stocked the sticker in its inventory since 2010, but sales have only recently taken off. The 2012 campaign has already seen more expressions of racism, both overt and subtle, than 2008, and analysts suspect it will only get nastier, the Christian Science Monitor reports. The racial messages now are cruder and uglier, a Fordham University history professor says, because Obama is now a powerful incumbent, giving those “racist expressions that do come out an air of desperation, rage, and quite frankly, startling self destructiveness.\\"Q: EMBED >More News Videos Shane McMahon and his pilot share their tale after landing in the water.

The Robinson R44II-type helicopter, which is registered to a company in White Plains, was en route to Westhampton when it went down around 10:30 a.m. after taking off from Westchester County Airport.    The chopper issued a Mayday call prior to going down. A commercial flight headed to John F. Kennedy Airport heard the call and relayed it to controllers.    “Everything happened so quickly, you don’t have much time to react,” McMahon told 1010 WINS’ Al Jones. “It was very unnerving.”    McMahon said he heard a bang and then his pilot told him they were going to land in the water.    As CBS2’s Emily Smith reported, as the helicopter lost power, they inflated the pontoons and made a hard landing on the ocean.    “It is very unsettling when all of a sudden you have something happen. You hear a bang and saying you are going to do an emergency landing in the water, so yes very unnerving,” he said.    As CBS2’s Jennifer McLogan reported, McMahon congratulated the pilot he had hired to chopper him from Manhattan to Westhampton — for skill and calm under duress, calling a mayday above ocean waters off Gilgo beach as they lost power, before banking down into a hard landing.    “[He] was super calm, which made me super calm and we landed perfectly,” McMahon said.    The fortunate outcome was unexpected.    “We heard some noise, and it became very clear to me that I could no longer continue to fly the helicopter, so I decided to make an auto-rotational landing on the water,” Mario Regtien said.    The helicopter went down about 2,000 feet from a lifeguard stand, where two lifeguards jumped into kayaks to help before the U.S. Coast Guard arrived.    “We ran up and got kayaks and we paddled out, a short trip out there. Those guys actually handled it really well, the two gentlemen in the helicopter, actually really calm and collected,” lifeguard Zach Viverito told CBS2’s Jennifer McLogan. “We put them on the kayaks and just swam along with them until the Coast Guard met us about halfway in.”    “We were just getting to work and we saw a helicopter go down pretty hard, saw a big splash,” lifeguard Don Dobbi said. “We ran up and grabbed the kayaks and paddled out to see what was going on, we knew it was out of the ordinary.”    I'd like to thank the man upstairs for looking out this morning & thanks to pilot Mario, Suffolk Co. Marine Bureau & Fire Island Coast Guard — Shane McMahon (@shanemcmahon) July 19, 2017    McMahon gave a “big kudos” to the lifeguards.    “Everybody chipped in, it was great,” he said.    The helicopter could be seen floating on pontoons on the water following the emergency landing. Suffolk County police said the two men were wearing life jackets and were uninjured. They were then picked up and brought to shore by a police department Marine Bureau vessel.    When asked if they were the heroes of the day, Viverito said, “I don’t know about that.”    “That is what we are here for,” he said. “So just kind of training, get on the equipment and go right out there.”    The Coast Guard responded to remove the aircraft, police said.
