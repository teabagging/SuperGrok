During your review, you notice that the provider has 120 patient charts to audit. Each chart takes approximately 15 minutes to review. If the audit team has 3 consultants working 8 hours per day, how many days will it take the team to complete the audit of all 120 patient charts?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the team of 3 consultants to complete the audit of all 120 patient charts, given that each chart takes approximately 15 minutes to review. Here's how we can tackle this step-by-step:1. Determine the total time required to review all charts:   - Each chart takes 15 minutes to review.   - There are 120 charts in total.   - Total time required = Number of charts × Time per chart   [   text{Total time required} = 120 text{ charts} times 15 text{ minutes/chart} = 1800 text{ minutes}   ]2. Calculate the total available working time per day for the team:   - Each consultant works 8 hours per day.   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.   - Therefore, each consultant works (8 times 60 = 480) minutes per day.   - There are 3 consultants, so the total available working time per day is:   [   text{Total working time per day} = 3 text{ consultants} times 480 text{ minutes/consultant} = 1440 text{ minutes}   ]3. Calculate the number of days required to complete the audit:   - Divide the total time required by the total working time per day:   [   text{Number of days} = frac{text{Total time required}}{text{Total working time per day}} = frac{1800 text{ minutes}}{1440 text{ minutes/day}}   ]4. Perform the division to find the number of days:   [   frac{1800}{1440} = 1.25   ]   - Since the number of days must be a whole number, and the team cannot complete the task in fewer than the calculated number of days, they will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they will need 2 days to complete the audit.# 2"},{"question":"The bakery owner, Jamie, wants to create a standout sign to showcase their specialty baked goods.

Jamie plans to add 200 new websites equally distributed among the three data centers. After adding these new websites, how many more websites can the second data center host before reaching its full capacity?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many websites can still be added to the second data center after distributing the new websites equally among the three data centers.Step 1: Determine the current number of websites in each data center.- First data center: 320 websites- Second data center: 450 websites- Third data center: 275 websitesStep 2: Calculate how many websites will be added to each data center.Jamie plans to add 200 new websites equally distributed among three data centers. To find out how many websites each data center will receive, we divide 200 by 3.[ text{Websites per data center} = frac{200}{3} approx 66.67 ]Since we cannot add a fraction of a website, we must distribute the websites as evenly as possible. One way to handle this is by distributing 66 websites to two data centers and 68 websites to the third data center. However, we can distribute 66 websites to each and distribute the remaining 2 websites later.For simplicity, let's distribute 66 websites to each data center for now.Step 3: Calculate the new total of websites for each data center after distribution.- First data center: (320 + 66 = 386)- Second data center: (450 + 66 = 516)- Third data center: (275 + 66 = 341)Step 4: Calculate the capacity remaining for the second data center.The second data center has a maximum capacity of 500 websites. However, after adding 66 websites, the second data center currently has 516 websites which is over its capacity. Therefore, the distribution isn't even feasible. Let's reconsider the distribution so that the second data center doesn't exceed its capacity:Instead, let's distribute:- 66 websites to the first data center.- 64 websites to the second data center.- 70 websites to the third data center.Now, recalculate:- First data center: (320 + 66 = 386)- Second data center: (450 + 64 = 514)- Third data center: (275 + 70 = 345)However, this doesn't solve the issue because 514 is still over the capacity of 500.Step 5: Correct the mistakeActually, let's distribute as 66 websites each, and the remaining 2 can be added where they fit without exceeding capacities. Let's finalize:- First data center: (320 + 66 = 386)- Second data center: (450 + 66 = 516) but this is not feasible.- Third data center: (275 + 70 = 345)After reassessment, the solution requires proper distribution not exceeding each data center's capacity, the second data center already exceeds its capacity with 450 websites. Thus, none can be allocated to it.Hence, the correct solution is to add websites elsewhere. Given the constraints, the second data center cannot host any more websites without first redistributing.# 0"},{"question":"A former student of Al-Yasmin International School, Sarah, is planning a reunion with her old classmates.

If Alex's radio show starts at 8:00 AM, at what time will Alex finish playing the jingles and discussing them?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Alex to play the jingles and discuss them, and then calculate the end time based on the start time.Step 1: Determine the total time taken to play the jingles.- Alex plays 5 different jingles.- Each jingle lasts for 2 minutes.- Therefore, the total time for the jingles is (5 text{ jingles} times 2 text{ minutes/jingle} = 10 text{ minutes}).Step 2: Determine the time taken for the discussion.- Alex talks for 3 minutes to discuss the history behind each jingle.- Therefore, the discussion time is 3 minutes.Step 3: Calculate the total time for the jingles and the discussion.- Total time = Time for jingles + Time for discussion- Total time = 10 minutes + 3 minutes = 13 minutesStep 4: Determine the end time of Alex's segment.- The radio show starts at 8:00 AM.- Add the total time of 13 minutes to the start time.- 8:00 AM + 13 minutes = 8:13 AMThus, Alex will finish playing the jingles and discussing them at 8:13 AM.# 8:13 AM"},{"question":"Julia, an environmental protectionist, is organizing a tree planting event in her neighborhood. She plans to plant a total of 120 trees along a local riverbank to help prevent soil erosion. Julia has recruited 8 volunteers to help her with the planting. Each volunteer, including Julia, will plant the same number of trees. However, Julia realized that she needs to reserve 15 trees to be planted later in a nearby park. How many trees will each person plant along the riverbank?","answer":"Let's solve the problem step-by-step:1. Total Trees: Julia plans to plant a total of 120 trees.2. Trees Reserved for Park: Julia needs to reserve 15 trees for a nearby park. Therefore, the number of trees that will be planted along the riverbank is:   [   120 - 15 = 105   ]   So, 105 trees will be planted along the riverbank.3. Number of People Planting Trees: Julia has recruited 8 volunteers. Including herself, there are:   [   8 + 1 = 9   ]   So, there are 9 people in total to plant trees.4. Trees Each Person Will Plant: Each person will plant an equal number of trees. Therefore, the number of trees each person will plant is:   [   frac{105}{9} = 11.6667   ]   However, since each person can only plant a whole number of trees, we need to double-check our division. Let's recompute using integer division:   [   lfloor frac{105}{9} rfloor = 11   ]   This means each person will plant 11 trees, but since we are not using up all 105 trees, we need to verify:5. Verification and Remainder: If each person plants 11 trees, then:   [   11 times 9 = 99   ]   This means 99 trees are planted, leaving:   [   105 - 99 = 6   ]   So, there are 6 trees left over. Julia can choose to plant these additional 6 trees herself, or distribute them among the volunteers.Given the constraint of equal distribution, let's ensure each person can plant an equal number by adjusting, if needed.Re-evaluation:- If each person plants 11 trees, the distribution is even.- The remaining 6 trees can be managed separately, either by Julia planting them additionally or by distributing one more tree to 6 of the 9 people.Thus, under strict equal distribution with no leftover trees, each person will plant 11 trees, and we confirm that 11 trees is the correct number for an initial equal distribution.# 11"},{"question":"Alex is a science fiction enthusiast who loves narrative-driven video games. Recently, Alex discovered a new sci-fi video game series where each game offers a rich storytelling experience. The series consists of 3 different games.- The first game takes 12 hours to complete one playthrough.- The second game takes 15 hours for one playthrough.- The third game takes 18 hours for one playthrough.Alex plans to play through each game twice to explore different storylines and endings. After completing all the playthroughs, Alex wants to replay 1 of the games again to discover a hidden storyline, adding an additional 20% of the time it took for one playthrough of that game.How many total hours will Alex spend playing through the entire series, including the additional replay for the hidden storyline?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Alex will spend playing through all the games, including the additional replay for the hidden storyline. Let's break this down step-by-step:1. Calculate the total time for the initial playthroughs:   - Each game is played twice, so we calculate the time for each game:     - First game: ( 2 times 12 text{ hours} = 24 text{ hours} )     - Second game: ( 2 times 15 text{ hours} = 30 text{ hours} )     - Third game: ( 2 times 18 text{ hours} = 36 text{ hours} )      - Total time for all initial playthroughs is the sum of the above:     [     24 text{ hours} + 30 text{ hours} + 36 text{ hours} = 90 text{ hours}     ]2. Calculate the additional time for the hidden storyline:   - Alex chooses one game to replay for a hidden storyline, adding an additional 20% of the time it took for one playthrough of that chosen game.   - We need to determine which game Alex chooses. Let's assume Alex chooses the third game (the choice is arbitrary unless specified otherwise):     - One playthrough of the third game is 18 hours.     - Additional time for the hidden storyline is ( 20% ) of 18 hours:       [       0.2 times 18 text{ hours} = 3.6 text{ hours}       ]3. Calculate the total time Alex spends:   - Add the time from all initial playthroughs to the additional time for the hidden storyline:     [     90 text{ hours} + 3.6 text{ hours} = 93.6 text{ hours}     ]Therefore, Alex will spend a total of 93.6 hours playing through the entire series, including the additional replay for the hidden storyline.# 93.6"},{"question":"A news producer invited an influencer to be a guest on their show to share fresh perspectives.

The park needs to be divided into two equal rectangular playgrounds and a walkway around the perimeter. The total area of the park is 2,400 square meters. The walkway is 2 meters wide and runs along the entire perimeter of the park. If the length of the park is twice its width, how much area is designated for each playground after the walkway is constructed?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the park and then calculate the area of each playground after accounting for the walkway.1. Define Variables:   - Let the width of the park be ( w ) meters.   - Then the length of the park is ( 2w ) meters since the length is twice the width.2. Calculate the Area of the Park:   - The total area of the park is given as 2,400 square meters.   - Therefore, the equation for the area is:     [     w times 2w = 2,400     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     2w^2 = 2,400     ]   - Divide both sides by 2:     [     w^2 = 1,200     ]   - Solve for ( w ) by taking the square root of both sides:     [     w = sqrt{1,200}     ]     [     w = 20sqrt{3} approx 34.64     ]3. Calculate the Dimensions of the Park:   - Width ( = 20sqrt{3} ) meters   - Length ( = 2 times 20sqrt{3} = 40sqrt{3} ) meters4. Adjust for the Walkway:   - The walkway is 2 meters wide and runs along the entire perimeter.   - The inner dimensions (excluding the walkway) are reduced by 4 meters in both width and length (2 meters on each side).   - Inner width = ( 20sqrt{3} - 4 )   - Inner length = ( 40sqrt{3} - 4 )5. Calculate the Adjusted Area (Inner Area):   - Inner area = (inner width) (times) (inner length)   - Inner area = ( (20sqrt{3} - 4) times (40sqrt{3} - 4) )6. Simplify the Expression:   - Let's distribute and calculate:     [     (20sqrt{3} - 4)(40sqrt{3} - 4) = 20sqrt{3} times 40sqrt{3} - 20sqrt{3} times 4 - 4 times 40sqrt{3} + 4 times 4     ]     [     = 2400 - 80sqrt{3} - 160sqrt{3} + 16     ]     [     = 2416 - 240sqrt{3}     ]     - This represents the total inner area (for the two playgrounds).7. Divide the Inner Area Between the Two Playgrounds:   - Since the two playgrounds are equal, each playground has:     [     frac{2416 - 240sqrt{3}}{2}     ]8. Calculate Each Playground's Area:   - Each playground's area = ( frac{2416 - 240sqrt{3}}{2} )After calculating this, we need to express it in a more simplified numerical form (using approximate values) to find the final answer.9. Numerical Calculation:   - Approximate ( sqrt{3} approx 1.732 )   - Calculate the value:     [     240sqrt{3} approx 240 times 1.732 approx 415.68     ]     [     2416 - 415.68 approx 2000.32     ]   - Divide by 2 for each playground:     [     frac{2000.32}{2} approx 1000.16     ]Therefore, the area designated for each playground is approximately 1000.16 square meters.#1000.16"},{"question":"An IT technician named Alex is helping a teenager, Jamie, secure their home network.

Alex advises that the password should be at least 12 characters long, with half of the characters being numbers. Jamie decides to create a password where 3 of the characters are special symbols, such as \\"!\\" or \\"#\\". How many letters are in Jamie's password?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters are in Jamie's password based on the given conditions. Step-by-step Solution:1. Total Length of Password:    - The password is at least 12 characters long. However, for the purposes of this problem, we will assume it is exactly 12 characters long since no additional length is specified.2. Characters in the Password:   - The password includes letters, numbers, and special symbols.3. Special Symbols:   - Jamie decides to include 3 special symbols in the password.4. Remaining Characters:   - With 3 special symbols, the remaining characters in the password are (12 - 3 = 9) characters.5. Numbers in the Password:   - According to Alex's recommendation, half of the characters should be numbers.   - This means half of the 12-character password, which is ( frac{12}{2} = 6), should be numbers.   - However, since 3 characters are already special symbols, the 6 numbers should be from the remaining 9 characters.6. Letters in the Password:   - If 6 of the remaining 9 characters are numbers, then the rest must be letters.   - Therefore, the number of letters is (9 - 6 = 3).Thus, there are 3 letters in Jamie's password.# 3"},{"question":"Dr. Ada is a computer scientist who specializes in artificial intelligence.

How many more codes does Alex need to give to each team after the initial distribution to ensure all 120 codes are equally distributed among the 5 teams?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to perform two main steps: 1. Initial Distribution of 100 Codes:   - Alex initially thinks there are only 100 codes and divides them equally among 5 teams.   - To find the number of codes each team gets initially, divide 100 by 5:     [     frac{100}{5} = 20     ]   - So, each team initially receives 20 codes.2. Adjustment for Actual Distribution of 120 Codes:   - The actual number of codes is 120, and they need to be equally distributed among 5 teams.   - To find the number of codes each team should receive, divide 120 by 5:     [     frac{120}{5} = 24     ]   - So, each team should receive 24 codes.3. Determine Additional Codes Needed:   - Each team initially received 20 codes, but should actually receive 24 codes.   - To find out how many more codes each team needs, subtract the initial allocation from the final allocation:     [     24 - 20 = 4     ]Therefore, Alex needs to give 4 more codes to each team to ensure all 120 codes are equally distributed.# 4"},{"question":"A professional hiker named Alex is planning a long-distance trek and wants to ensure proper recovery and injury prevention.

In your game, each player collects vampire cards, each representing a different vampire clan. There are a total of 5 clans, and each clan has 8 distinct cards.During a game night, you invite 4 friends to play your game, making it a total of 5 players including yourself. At the beginning of the game, each player receives an equal number of cards from each clan. After distributing the cards, you notice that there are 10 cards left. How many cards did each player receive at the start of the game?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cards each player received at the start of the game. Here is the step-by-step solution:1. Total Number of Cards:     There are 5 clans, and each clan has 8 distinct cards. Thus, the total number of cards is:   [   5 times 8 = 40 text{ cards}   ]2. Cards Left After Distribution:     After distributing the cards, there are 10 cards left.3. Cards Distributed:     The number of cards distributed is the total number of cards minus the cards left:   [   40 - 10 = 30 text{ cards}   ]4. Number of Players:     There are 5 players in total.5. Cards Each Player Receives:     The cards are distributed equally among the players. Therefore, each player receives:   [   frac{30}{5} = 6 text{ cards per player}   ]6. Verification:     We need to ensure that each player receives an equal number of cards from each clan. Since each player receives 6 cards in total and there are 5 clans, each player should receive:   [   frac{6}{5} = 1.2   ]   This does not make sense as a non-integer number of cards from each clan cannot be distributed equally. Thus, this suggests a contradictory condition in the problem statement given the current setup.Let's re-evaluate the conditions:- If each player must receive an equal number of cards from each clan, with 5 clans, they would receive a multiple of 5 cards in total.- Since 6 is not a multiple of 5, and the cards are supposed to be distributed equally among clans, the problem setup might inherently contain a contradiction or an error in specifying how the cards are distributed amongst clans.Upon reevaluation, consider if there could be an adjustment needed in the distribution method or an understanding error:- If the 10 cards left over are not part of the equal distribution, then each player could potentially receive 6 cards in total, but not necessarily an equal number from each clan, indicating a possible oversight in the equal distribution clause if applied literally.Thus, the problem as stated cannot be resolved without adjusting the condition about equal distribution from each clan, or accepting that the current outcome is the best logical distribution given the constraints.After considering the logical constraints:- Each player received 6 cards in total, but the statement about equal distribution from each clan may not hold given the setup.# 6"},{"question":"A supplier company sells raw materials at competitive prices but has questionable environmental practices.

She decides to investigate by visiting her favorite local bakery. The current minimum wage is 10 per hour, and the bakery pays its workers this rate. The bakery sells 100 loaves of bread each day, with each loaf priced at 3, and the daily wages account for 100 of the bakery's expenses.Jamie suggests raising the minimum wage to 15 per hour. Assuming the bakery adjusts its prices only to cover the increase in wages, by how much should the price of each loaf increase (assuming the bakery still sells 100 loaves daily and maintains the same profit margin)?","answer":"To find out by how much the price of each loaf should increase to cover the increased wages, we can follow these steps:1. Calculate the Current Daily Wages:   - The bakery currently pays 10 per hour for its workers.   - The daily wages account for 100 of the bakery's expenses.2.

Initially, the price per unit of this commodity was 50. A historian wants to understand the economic impact on families who purchase this commodity. If a family buys 10 units of this commodity every month, how much more will they spend in a year after the price increase compared to before the price increase?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the additional cost incurred by a family due to the increase in the price of the commodity. We'll do this step-by-step:1. Initial Price Calculation:   - The initial price per unit of the commodity is 50.   - A family buys 10 units every month.   - Monthly cost before price increase = 10 units * 50/unit = 500.2. Price Increase Calculation:   - The price increases by 20%.   - Amount of increase = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10.   - New price per unit after increase = 50 + 10 = 60.3. New Monthly Cost Calculation:   - New monthly cost after price increase = 10 units * 60/unit = 600.4. Additional Monthly Spending:   - Additional cost per month due to price increase = New monthly cost - Initial monthly cost   - Additional cost per month = 600 - 500 = 100.5. Annual Additional Spending Calculation:   - Since the family buys the commodity every month, we calculate the additional spending for 12 months.   - Additional spending in a year = 100/month * 12 months = 1200.Thus, the family will spend an additional 1200 in a year after the price increase compared to before the price increase.# 1200"},{"question":"Professor Thompson, who lives next door and often shares fascinating stories about the history of USC, recently mentioned that the university was founded in 1880.

The bridge itself weighs 3 tons, and it is expected to hold up to 15 people at a time, with each person weighing an average of 70 kilograms. How many tons of weight can the bridge safely support in total, including the weight of the bridge and the people on it?","answer":"To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps:1. Calculate the total weight that the bridge is expected to hold due to people:   - Each person weighs an average of 70 kilograms.   - It is expected to hold up to 15 people at a time.   First, convert the weight of a person from kilograms to tons:   - 1 ton = 1000 kilograms   - Therefore, the weight of one person in tons = 70 kg / 1000 = 0.07 tons   Now, calculate the total weight of 15 people in tons:   - Total weight of 15 people = 15 * 0.07 tons = 1.05 tons2. Calculate the total weight of the bridge and the people:   - The weight of the bridge itself is 3 tons.   - The total weight due to people is 1.05 tons.

If each person received an equal number of Iron Man action figures, how many action figures did each person get?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:1. Determine the number of action figures Robert's cousin had:   - Robert had 12 Iron Man action figures.   - His cousin had 8 fewer than Robert.   - So, his cousin had (12 - 8 = 4) Iron Man action figures.2. Calculate the total number of action figures:   - Robert had 12 action figures.   - His cousin had 4 action figures.   - The total number of action figures combined is (12 + 4 = 16).3. Divide the total action figures among everyone:   - They decided to share these action figures equally with three of their friends.   - So, in total, there are 5 people: Robert, his cousin, and three friends.4. Calculate the number of action figures each person gets:   - Divide the total number of action figures by the number of people:    - (frac{16}{5} = 3.2).Since you cannot have a fraction of an action figure in this context, there might be some additional context or assumption needed. If we assume that each person should receive a whole number of action figures, they would receive 3 full action figures each, with 1 action figure remaining undistributed. However, based on the problem statement, it seems like each person should receive an equal number, so let's assume in this context they would split any remaining action figures as possible (though it's not clear from the problem statement directly).Thus, if the problem allows for fractional figures or if the question is more theoretical:Each person receives 3.2 action figures, but likely, each receives 3 action figures if only whole figures are considered, with some left over.#3"},{"question":"Professor Smith, an Australian infectious disease expert, is collaborating on a research project with Adeel Butt.

For the third show, 3 clients who had already auditioned for the first show and 2 clients who had auditioned for the second show were also invited. How many unique clients in total received auditions for any of the reality shows this month?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of unique clients who received auditions for the reality shows, considering the overlaps specified in the problem. We'll approach this by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.1. Identify Clients for Each Show:   - Let ( A ) be the set of clients who auditioned for the first show.   - Let ( B ) be the set of clients who auditioned for the second show.   - Let ( C ) be the set of clients who auditioned for the third show.   According to the problem:   - ( |A| = 4 ) (4 clients for the first show)   - ( |B| = 5 ) (5 clients for the second show)   - For the third show, 3 clients from ( A ) and 2 from ( B ) were invited.2. Determine Overlaps:   - The problem states that the third show invites 3 clients from the first show's set (( A )) and 2 from the second show's set (( B )).   - Therefore, the intersection of sets ( A ) and ( C ) (clients from the first show invited to the third show) is 3: ( |A cap C| = 3 ).   - The intersection of sets ( B ) and ( C ) (clients from the second show invited to the third show) is 2: ( |B cap C| = 2 ).3. Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:   We want to find the total number of unique clients, i.e., ( |A cup B cup C| ).   The inclusion-exclusion principle states:   [   |A cup B cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A cap B| - |A cap C| - |B cap C| + |A cap B cap C|   ]   Note:   - We don't know ( |A cap B| ) directly, but we know that ( C ) is fully contained in ( A cup B ) (since ( C ) only takes clients from ( A ) and ( B )), implying ( |A cap B cap C| = 0 ).4. Calculate ( |C| ):   - Set ( C ) is formed by 3 clients from ( A ) and 2 from ( B ). Since the problem doesn't state that these 5 clients are all distinct, we assume the worst-case scenario where there might be some overlap. However, since ( C ) is a subset of ( A cup B ), we assume in the absence of further information that ( |C| = 5 ).5. Calculate ( |A cup B cup C| ):   - Combine all given information:     - ( |A| = 4 )     - ( |B| = 5 )     - ( |C| = 5 )     - ( |A cap C| = 3 )     - ( |B cap C| = 2 )     - Assume ( |A cap B| = 0 ) (since not specified and ( C ) appears to bridge ( A ) and ( B ) without further overlaps)   Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:   [   |A cup B cup C| = 4 + 5 + 5 - 0 - 3 - 2 + 0 = 9   ]Therefore, the total number of unique clients who received auditions is:# 9"},{"question":"A recent graduate named Alex, who aspires to become a software architect, is working on a project that involves building a small software application.

After distributing 30 blocks to the students, the number of blocks left is:   [   40 - 30 = 10 text{ blocks}   ]Therefore, after distributing the blocks according to the pattern, Ms. Sarah will have 10 blocks left.# 10"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(o=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return o.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||o.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},J={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},j={key:1};function F(o,e,l,u,n,r){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),s("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",J,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=i=>n.searchQuery=i),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),s(w,null,b(r.filteredPoems,(i,f)=>(a(),v(m,{key:f,poem:i},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),s("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...i)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...i))},[n.isLoading?(a(),s("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),s("span",H,"See more"))],8,N)):x("",!0)])}const R=d(I,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-ca69b657"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/23.md","filePath":"library/23.md"}'),z={name:"library/23.md"},O=Object.assign(z,{setup(o){return(e,l)=>(a(),s("div",null,[k(R)]))}});export{W as __pageData,O as default};
