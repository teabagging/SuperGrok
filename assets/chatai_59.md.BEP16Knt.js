As judged by confocal microscopy, both proteins appeared in a diffuse cytosolic pattern, but they also could be found in a dense perinuclear and nuclear location.Frequently ubiquitinated proteins are targeted to the proteasome for degradation in the cytosol.More recently, proteasome-mediated degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, production and loading of antigenic peptides onto HLA molecules, and transient homing of diverse virion proteins required for entry and/or egress have been shown to be coordinated at the centrosome.We conclude that N-terminal sequences of Wld(S) protein influence the intranuclear location of both ubiquitin proteasome and NAD(+) synthesis machinery and that an evolutionary recent sequence mediates binding of mammalian Ube4b to VCP.Two new forms of proteasomes, designated as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated proteasome (ERa proteasome) and ER membrane-bound proteasome (ERb proteasome), were purified to homogeneity from 0.0125 and 2.5% sodium cholate extracts, respectively, of a rat liver microsomal fraction.The proteasome is a large multicatalytic, proteinase complex located in the cytosol and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.Subcellular distribution of proteasomes implicates a major location of protein degradation in the nuclear envelope-ER network in yeast.JAB1, which is thought to bind p27KIP1 and transport it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for proteasome/ubiquitin-mediated degradation, was found to be localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in undifferentiated and differentiating tumors whereas located predominantly in the nucleus of differentiated tumor cells.20S proteasomes are present in all areas where ATPase subunits are detected, consistent with the presence of intact 26S proteasomes.Inhibition of proteasomes located in axons resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in these axons.All these observations indicate that the mouse sperm proteasome participates in the binding to the zona pellucida and the acrosome reaction and that there is a pool of proteasomes located on the sperm head..Thus, newly synthesized apoB is localized throughout the entire ER and degraded homogeneously, most likely by neighboring proteasomes located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane.While misfolded and short-lived proteins are degraded in proteasomes located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, the degradation of organelles and long-lived proteins in the lysosome occurs by the process of autophagy.The GFP-tagged proteasomes were located within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.Proteasomes are large multicatalytic proteinase complexes located in the cytosol and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.Immunohistochemically, proteasomes (26S) were located in the cytoplasm in normal human muscle, but the staining intensity was weak.In DMRV, proteasomes often were located within or on the rim of rimmed vacuoles, and in the cytoplasm of atrophic fibers.","answer":"The proteasome can be found in perinuclear and nuclear location, as well as in cytosolic compartments, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Proteasome-mediated degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, production and loading of antigenic peptides onto HLA molecules, and transient homing of diverse virion proteins required for entry and/or egress have been also shown to be coordinated at the centrosome."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the preemptive analgesic efficacy of oral ketorolac versus intramuscular tramadol after a mandibular third molar surgery. A parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out. Thirty patients were randomized into two treatment groups using a series of random numbers: Group A, oral ketorolac 10 mg plus intramuscular placebo (1 mL saline solution); or Group B, oral placebo (similar tablet to oral ketorolac) plus intramuscular tramadol 50 mg diluted in 1 mL saline solution. These treatments were given 30 min before the surgery. We evaluated the time of first analgesic rescue medication, pain intensity, total analgesic consumption and adverse effects. Patients taking oral ketorolac had longer time of analgesic covering and less postoperative pain when compared with patients receiving intramuscular tramadol. According to the VAS and UAC results, this study suggests that 10 mg of oral ketorolac had superior analgesic effect than 50 mg of tramadol when administered before a mandibular third molar surgery.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"mandibular\\", \\"third molar\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"adverse effects\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"analgesic rescue medication\\", \\"placebo\\", \\"ketorolac\\", \\"tablet\\", \\"analgesic\\", \\"tramadol\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"pain intensity\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"analgesic covering\\", \\"postoperative pain\\", \\"analgesic effect\\", \\"postsurgical pain\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"treatments\\", \\"VAS\\", \\"preemptive analgesic\\", \\"removal\\", \\"Preemptive analgesia\\", \\"surgery\\", \\"evaluated\\", \\"treatment\\", \\"evaluate\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"Group A\\", \\"Group B\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"clinical trial\\", \\"parallel\\", \\"double-blind\\", \\"randomized\\", \\"placebo-controlled\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001).This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer.A novel HER2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline TP53 mutationsThe Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages.Patients carrying a TP53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER2) amplification (83%) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases (16%);These findings suggest that breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited TP53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of HER2.","answer":"Her2 status is positive"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

METHODS Retrospective analysis of data obtained from a recently reported r and omized split-mouth localized experimental gingivitis trial involving 96 healthy non-smokers .  Gingival and plaque index , gingival crevicular fluid volume ( GCF ) , angulated bleeding score , and the derived parameter cumulative plaque exposure ( CPE )  were recorded at days 0 , 7 , 14 , and 21 . The primary outcome variable to express severity of inflammation was GCF and each subject was a statistical unit . Based on subject distribution of GCF-day 21 residuals after st and ardization for CPE-day 21 , two sub- population s ( upper and lower distribution quartiles ) were selected . They were , respectively , defined as \\" high responders \\" ( HR ) ( n=24 ) and \\" low responders \\" ( LR ) ( n=24 ) and characterized by significantly different severity of gingivitis to similar amounts of plaque deposits . The same analysis was repeated at days 7 and 14 . Prevalence of HR and LR was compared between days using the chi(2 ) [ ML ] test . RESULTS For both day 7 and day 14 , the quartile distribution of LR and HR was statistically significant ( p=0.02 ) . Fifty percent of LR and 71 % of HR presented a consistent level of susceptibility to plaque-induced gingival inflammation even after only 7 and /or 14 days of plaque accumulation . CONCLUSIONS These findings support the concept that the subject-based susceptibility to plaque-induced gingival inflammation is an individual trait , only partly related to the length of time of exposure to plaqueTitle 2:Dynamics of initial subgingival colonization of 'pristine' peri-implant pockets.Abstract 2:BACKGROUND Periodontitis and peri-implantitis are linked to the presence of several key pathogens . The treatment of these infectious processes therefore involves the reduction/eradication of bacteria associated with periodontitis . METHODS This prospect i ve , split-mouth , single-blind study followed the colonization of ' pristine ' sulci created in 42 partially edentulous patients during implant surgery ( e.g. abutment connection ) . The hypothesis was that the composition of the maturing subgingival plaque in these ' fresh ' peri-implant pockets would soon ( within 2 weeks ) be comparable to the subgingival microbiota of teeth with similar clinical parameters ( reference sites ) , including the presence of bacteria associated with periodontitis . Per patient , four subgingival plaque sample s were taken from shallow and medium pockets around implants ( test sites ) , and teeth within the same quadrant ( undisturbed microbiota as control sites ) , 1 , 2 , 4 , 13 , 26 and 78 weeks after abutment connection , respectively . The sample s were analysed by either checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization , or cultural techniques , or real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) for intra-subject comparisons ( teeth vs. implant , for comparable probing depths ) . RESULTS Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and real-time PCR revealed a complex microbiota ( including several pathogenic species ) in the peri-implant pockets within 2 weeks after abutment connection . After 7 days , the detection frequency for most species ( including the bacteria associated with periodontitis ) was already nearly identical in sample s from the fresh peri-implant pockets ( 5 % and 20 % of the microbiota belonging to red and orange complex , respectively ) when compared with sample s from the reference teeth . Afterwards ( e.g. between weeks 2 and 13 ) , the number of bacteria in peri-implant pockets only slightly increased ( + /-0.1 log value ) , with minor changes in the relative proportions of bacteria associated with periodontitis ( 8 % and 33 % of the microbiota belonging to red and orange complex , respectively ) . Although small differences were seen between teeth and implants at week 2 with cultural techniques , a striking similarity in subgingival microbiota was found with this technique from month 3 on , with nearly identical detection frequencies for bacteria associated with periodontitis for both abutment types . CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that the initial colonization of peri-implant pockets with bacteria associated with periodontitis occurs within 2 weeksTitle 3:Reversibility of experimental peri-implant mucositis compared with experimental gingivitis in humans.Abstract 3:OBJECTIVE To monitor clinical , microbiological and host-derived alterations occurring around teeth and titanium implants during the development of experimental gingivitis/mucositis and their respective healing sequence in humans . MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifteen subjects with healthy or treated periodontal conditions and restored with dental implants underwent an experimental 3-week period of undisturbed plaque accumulation in the m and ible . Subsequently , a 3-week period with optimal plaque control was instituted . At Days 0 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 and 42 , the presence/absence of plaque deposits around teeth and implants was assessed , ( plaque index [ PlI ] ) and the gingival/mucosal conditions were evaluated ( gingival index[GI ] ) . Subgingival/submucosal plaque sample s and gingival/mucosal crevicular fluid ( CF ) sample s were collected from two pre-determined sites around each experimental unit . CF sample s were analyzed for matrix-metalloproteinase-8 ( MMP-8 ) and interleukin-1beta ( IL-1Î² ) . Microbial sample s were analyzed using DNA-DNA hybridization for 40 species . RESULTS During 3 weeks of plaque accumulation , the median PlI and GI increased significantly at implants and teeth . Implant sites yielded a greater increase in the median GI compared with tooth sites . Over the 6-week experimental period , the CF levels of MMP-8 were statistically significantly higher at implants compared with teeth ( P<0.05 ) . The CF IL-1Î² levels did not differ statistically significantly between teeth and implants ( P>0.05 ) . No differences in the total DNA counts between implant and tooth sites were found at any time points . No differences in the detection frequency were found for putative periodontal pathogens between implant and tooth sites . CONCLUSION Peri-implant soft tissues developed a stronger inflammatory response to experimental plaque accumulation when compared with that of their gingival counterparts . Experimental gingivitis and peri-implant mucositis were reversible at the biomarker level . Clinical ly , however , 3 weeks of resumed plaque control did not yield pre-experimental levels of gingival and peri-implant mucosal health indicating that longer healing periods are neededTitle 4:Quality of reporting randomised clinical trials in dental and medical researchAbstract 4:Objective To assess 1 ) the quality of reporting r and omised clinical trials in dental ( RCT -Ds ) and medical research ( RCT -Ms ) , 2 ) the quality of RCT reports in relation to the journal impact factor , 3 ) the source of funding , and 4 ) the quality of RCT -Ds in different areas of dental research . Design R and om sample s of 100 RCT -Ds and 100 RCT -Ms published in 1999 were evaluated for quality of reporting under blinded conditions with the Jadad quality assessment scale . In addition , correlation between the quality scores and journal impact factor or source of funding , as well as area of dental research were analysed . Results The quality of RCT -Ds and RCT -Ms published in 1999 was generally inadequate . The quality was largely equivalent in RCT -Ds and RCT -Ms . There was no correlation between the quality scores and the journal impact factor or the source of funding . Some differences were found in the quality scores between different areas of dental research . Conclusions The results from these RCT -Ds and RCT -Ms show that most of them were imperfect in the reporting of methodology and trial conduct . There is a clear need to improve the quality of trial reporting in dental and medical researchTitle 5:Comparison of two full-mouth approaches in the treatment of peri-implant mucositis: a pilot study.Abstract 5:OBJECTIVES The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that an additional full-mouth disinfection results in a greater clinical and microbiological improvement compared with sole mechanical debridement within one session in patients with peri-implant mucositis and treated chronic periodontitis . MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 13 partially edentulous patients ( mean age 51.5 years ) with treated chronic periodontitis and 36 dental implants with mucositis ( bleeding on probing and /or a gingival index > or = 1 at least at one site at baseline , absence of peri-implant bone loss during the last 2 years before baseline ) . After r and omized assignment to a test and a control group , patients received a one-stage full-mouth scaling with or without chlorhexidine . Clinical and microbiological examination was performed at baseline , after 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 months . Additional microbial sample s were taken 24 h after treatment . Microbiological analysis was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction . RESULTS Both treatment modalities result ed in significant reductions of probing depth at implant sites after 8 months , with no significant group differences . The bacteria at implants and teeth could be reduced in every group 24 h after treatment ; however , this reduction was not significant after 8 months . CONCLUSIONS Both treatment modalities led to an improvement of the clinical parameters and a temporary reduction of the microflora at implants with mucositis , but without significant inter-group differences after 8 monthsTitle 6:Anti-infective treatment of peri-implant mucositis: a randomised controlled clinical trial.Abstract 6:AIM To compare the effectiveness of two anti-infective protocol s for the treatment of peri-implant mucositis . MATERIAL S AND METHODS Twenty-nine patients with one implant diagnosed with peri-implant mucositis ( bleeding on probing [ BOP ] with no loss of supporting bone ) were r and omly assigned to a control or test group . Following an assessment of baseline parameters ( probing depth , BOP , suppuration , presence of plaque ) , all patients received non-surgical mechanical debridement at the implant sites and were instructed to brush around the implant twice daily using a gel provided for a period of 4 weeks . The test group ( 15 patients ) received a chlorhexidine gel ( 0.5 % ) , and the control group ( 14 patients ) received a placebo gel . The study was performed double blind . After 4 weeks , patients were instructed to discontinue using the gel and to continue with routine oral hygiene at the implant sites . Baseline parameters were repeated at 1 and 3 months . RESULTS At 1 month , there was a statistically significant reduction in the mean number of sites with BOP and mean probing depth measurements at implants in both groups . There were also some statistically significant changes in these parameters from 1 to 3 months . However , there were no statistically significant differences between test and control groups . One month following treatment , 76 % of implants had a reduction in BOP . Complete resolution of BOP at 3 months was achieved in 38 % of the treated implants . The presence of a submucosal restoration margin result ed in significantly lower reductions in probing depth following treatment . CONCLUSIONS Non-surgical debridement and oral hygiene were effective in reducing peri-implant mucositis , but did not always result in complete resolution of inflammation . Adjunctive chlorhexidine gel application did not enhance the results compared with mechanical cleansing alone . Implants with supramucosal restoration margins showed greater therapeutic improvement compared with those with submucosal restoration marginsTitle 7:The effect of a triclosan dentifrice on mucositis in subjects with dental implants: a six-month clinical study.Abstract 7:OBJECTIVE The objective of the present clinical study was to assess the effect of the use of a dentifrice containing triclosan on peri-implant mucositis in subjects that had been restored with dental implants . METHODS The trial was design ed as a double-blind , r and omized , two-treatment , parallel-group clinical study . Sixty male and female subjects , aged 30 - 70 years , were recruited . All subjects had lost teeth due to periodontal disease , and had been restored with a minimum of two implants at least one year prior to the start of the trial . Subjects were r and omly assigned to two treatment groups . The subjects in the test group ( Test ) brushed their teeth and implant-supported restorations with a dentifrice containing triclosan , while the control subjects brushed with a sodium fluoride dentifrice .  Only subjects with a minimum of one implant site showing clinical signs of peri-implant mucositis , i.e. , bleeding after probing , were enrolled in the study . Clinical examinations were performed at baseline , and after three and six months . The following parameters were scored : Probing pocket depth ( PPD ) , bleeding on probing ( BoP ) , and plaque . The change from baseline within each treatment group at three months and six months was evaluated for all parameters using ANOVA and ANCOVA . RESULTS Subjects with peri-implant mucositis who used a dentifrice containing 0.3 % triclosan , as an adjunct to mechanical tooth brushing , exhibited significantly fewer clinical signs of inflammation than subjects who used a regular fluoride dentifrice at six months . The BoP scores were reduced from 53.8 % to 29.1 % in the Test group , whereas in the same interval there was an increase from 52.3 % to 58.8 % in the Control group . Furthermore , the individual mean PPD , as well as the frequency of sites with 5 mm and > or = 6 mm deep pockets , were reduced significantly more in the Test than in the Control group . CONCLUSION The regular use of a dentifrice containing triclosan may reduce the clinical signs of inflammation in the mucosa adjacent to dental implants","answer":"Neither of studied treatments gave complete resolution of peri-implant mucositis .Different treatment strategies need to be studied ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

( ) , [ rbola ] according to general relativity , accounts exactly for the gravitational interaction . owing to the universality of gravitation , which means that all particles feel @xmath12 the same , it turns out possible to describe the gravitational interaction by considering a riemann spacetime with the curvature of the levi  civita connection , in which all particles will follow geodesics .this is the stage set of einstein s general relativity , the gravitational interaction being mimicked by a geometrization of spacetime .    on the other hand , a nontrivial tetrad fieldcan also be used to define the linear cartan connection ^ _= h_a^_h^a _ , [ car ] with respect to which the tetrad is parallel : _ h^a __ - ^ _ h^a _ = 0 .[ weitz ] for this reason , tetrad theories have received the name of teleparallelism , or absolute parallelism . plugging in eqs.([gmn ] ) and ( [ lci ] ) , we get ^ _= ^ _ + k^ _ , [ rel ] where ^ _ = [ conto ] is the contorsion tensor , with t^ _ = ^ _ - ^ _ [ tor ]if now we try to introduce a spacetime with the same properties of the cartan connection @xmath13 , we end up with a weitzenbck spacetime  @xcite , a space presenting torsion , but no curvature .this spacetime is the stage set of the teleparallel description of gravitation .considering that local lorentz indices are raised and lowered with the minkowski metric @xmath14 , tensor indices on it will be raised and lowered with the riemannian metric @xmath15  @xcite .universality of gravitation , in this case , means that all particles feel @xmath13 the same , which in turn means that they will also feel torsion the same .    from the above considerations, we can infer that the presence of a nontrivial tetrad field induces both , a riemannian and a teleparallel structures in spacetime .the first is related to the levi  civita connection , a connection presenting curvature , but no torsion .the second is related to the cartan connection , a connection presenting torsion , but no curvature .it is important to remark that both connections are defined on the very same spacetime , a spacetime endowed with both a riemannian and a teleparallel structures .    as already remarked , the curvature of the cartan connection vanishes identically : ^ _ = _ ^ _ + ^ _ ^ _ -

Twenty basic and instrumental activities of daily living have been selected, and divided into two groups, comparable for difficulty. Ten normal elderly subjects (age 68.0 +/- 4.8 years; MMSE score: 28.7 +/- 0.9; education: 7.6 +/- 3.5 years) were asked to perform the two groups of daily activities and the time required to perform the tasks of each group was recorded and used as a reference. Ten mild and mild-moderate AD patients (age 77.2 +/- 5.3 years; MMSE score: 19.8 +/- 3.5; education: 7.3 +/- 4.7 years) without major behavioural disturbances constituted the experimental group. Patients were evaluated in all 20 daily activities and the time employed was recorded at baseline and after a 3-week training (1 h/d, 5 d/week) period.

Low resolution receivers 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  As communication systems scale up in speed and bandwidth, the power consumption and cost of high-precision (e.g., 6-12 bits) analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) becomes the limiting factor in modern receiver architectures based on digital signal processing. In this paper, we consider the effects of lowering the precision of the ADC on the performance of the communication link. We focus on the most extreme scenario, in which the receiver employs one-bit ADC at baseband. While this constraint impacts every aspect of design ranging from synchronization and channel estimation to demodulation and decoding, in this initial exposition, we focus on the Shannon-theoretic limits imposed by one-bit ADC for an ideal discrete-time real baseband Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Results are obtained both for non-spread and spread spectrum systems. While binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is optimal in a non-spread system, we obtain less predictable results for spread spectrum system, including the sub-optimality of BPSK and non-monotonicity of mutual information with signal-to-noise ratio for a fixed constellation. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We study the performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels with coarsely quantized outputs in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, where the channel is perfectly known at the receiver. This analysis is of interest in the context of ultra-wideband (UWB) communications from two aspects. First the available power is spread over such a large frequency band, that the power spectral density is extremely low and thus the SNR is low. Second the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for such high bandwidth signals should be low-resolution, in order to reduce their cost and power consumption. In this paper we consider the extreme case of only 1-bit ADC for each receive signal component. We compute the mutual information up to second order in the SNR and study the impact of quantization. We show that, up to first order in SNR, the mutual information of the 1-bit quantized system degrades only by a factor of 2/pi compared to the system with infinite resolution independent of the actual MIMO channel realization. With channel state information (CSI) only at receiver, we show that QPSK is, up to the second order, the best among all distributions with independent components. We also elaborate on the ergodic capacity under this scheme in a Rayleigh flat-fading environment. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  The compressive sensing (CS) framework aims to ease the burden on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by reducing the sampling rate required to acquire and stably recover sparse signals. Practical ADCs not only sample but also quantize each measurement to a finite number of bits; moreover, there is an inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the bit depth. In this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the emphasis from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In particular, we explore the extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture just their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal reconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide a lower bound on the best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that i.i.d. random Gaussian matrices provide measurement mappings that, with overwhelming probability, achieve nearly optimal error decay. Next, we consider reconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the binary e-stable embedding property, which characterizes the robustness of the measurement process to sign changes. We show that the same class of matrices that provide almost optimal noiseless performance also enable such a robust mapping. On the practical side, we introduce the binary iterative hard thresholding algorithm for signal reconstruction from 1-bit measurements that offers state-of-the-art performance. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  With bandwidths on the order of a gigahertz in emerging wireless systems, high-resolution analog-to-digital convertors (ADCs) become a power consumption bottleneck. One solution is to employ low resolution one-bit ADCs. In this paper, we analyze the flat fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with one-bit ADCs. Channel state information is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and receiver. For the multiple-input single-output channel, we derive the exact channel capacity. For the single-input multiple-output and MIMO channel, the capacity at infinite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is found. We also derive upper bound at finite SNR, which is tight when the channel has full row rank. In addition, we propose an efficient method to design the input symbols to approach the capacity achieving solution. We incorporate millimeter wave channel characteristics and find the bounds on the infinite SNR capacity. The results show how the number of paths and number of receive antennas impact the capacity. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  We develop channel estimation agorithms for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Since the mmWave MIMO channel is sparse due to the propagation characteristics, the estimation problem is formulated as a one-bit compressed sensing problem. We propose a modified EM algorithm that exploits sparsity and has better performance than the conventional EM algorithm. We also present a second solution using the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm to solve this optimization problem. The simulation results show that GAMP can reduce mean squared error in the important low and medium SNR regions.Literature Review:","answer":"An alternative to analog and hybrid architectures at the receiver is to reduce the resolution and thus power consumption of the ADCs to a few or as little as one bit. This leads to a different approach as illustrated in Fig. 7 , where a pair of low resolution ADCs are used to sample the in-phase and quadrature components of the demodulated signal at the output of each RF chain. This makes a tradeoff between having more RF chains and fewer power hungry ADCs. The case of a one-bit ADC is especially interesting as it has negligible power consumption compared to other components in the front-end (a one-bit ADC at ultra-high sampling rate of 240 GS/s consumes around 10 mW  ). Data interface circuits connecting digital components to DAC/ADCs are also power hungry when working at mmWave frequencies BIB001 . The power consumed by the high speed interfacing cards also depends on the resolution, so reducing the number of bits in the ADC not only reduces the power consumed by the front-end in the MIMO receiver, but also limits the consumption of the baseband circuitry. The fundamentals of communicating with one-bits ADCs are different BIB002 - BIB005 . For example, the optimum signal constellation is discrete and is limited by the ADC resolution at the receiver. In MIMO systems, the low SNR capacity gap between one-bit and infinite-resolution ADC is only 1.96 dB BIB003 . At high SNR, at most 2 2Nr bps/Hz is achievable if the rank of the channel is no less than N r . Capacity characterization with low-resolution ADCs is an ongoing research challenge. The use of few-and one-bit ADCs has several signal processing implications. The role of channel state information is different, e.g. channel inversion precoding may be better than eigenbeamforming BIB005 , as discussed further in Section IV-E. This might lead to different hybrid precoding optimizations that are compatible with one-bit ADCs. Acquiring channel state information is also more challenging. Although the channel-estimation error with one-bit ADCs decreases at best quadratically per measurement bit (versus exponentially in the conventional case), it also decreases with the sparsity of the channel BIB004 . This suggests that relatively few measurements may suffice and that one-bit compressive sensing algorithms can be employed for channel estimation BIB006 , as discussed further in Section V-C. Future work is still needed to develop mmWave specific channel estimation algorithms, especially those designed in conjunction with appropriate transmit and receive signal processing algorithms."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families, including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika virus), and coronaviruses (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E] and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV [MERS-CoV]). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.","answer":"[\\"Mechanism\\", \\"Treatment\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

In rice, most of these CpG clusters are associated with genes. Rice genes are grouped into one of the five classes according to the position of an associated CpG cluster. Among them, class 1 genes, which harbor a CpG cluster at the 5'-terminus, share similarities with human genes having CpG islandsSegmental distribution of genes harboring a CpG island-like region on rice chromosomesHighly-expressed Arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked GC-skew in the TSS compared to genes with low expression levels. We therefore propose that the GC-skew around the TSS in some plants and fungi is related to transcription. It might be caused by mutations during transcription initiation or the frequent use of transcription factor-biding sites having a strand preference. In addition, GC-skew is a good candidate index for TSS prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among CpG islands and genesPreliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward.

Here, we performed a targeted next-generation sequencing of 796 genes implicated in DNA repair in 189 Finnish breast cancer cases with indication of hereditary disease susceptibility and focused the analysis on protein truncating mutations. A recurrent heterozygous mutation( c. 904_916del, p. Arg304ValfsTer3) was identified in early DNA damage response gene, MCPH1, significantly associating with breast cancer susceptibility both in familial( 5/145, 3. 4%, P = 0. 003, OR 8. 3) and unselected cases( 16/1150, 1. 4%, P = 0. 016, OR 3. 3). A total of 21 mutation positive families were identified, of which one-third exhibited also brain tumors and/or sarcomas( P = 0. 0007). Mutation carriers exhibited significant increase in genomic instability assessed by cytogenetic analysis for spontaneous chromosomal rearrangements in peripheral blood lymphocytes( P = 0. 0007), suggesting an effect for MCPH1 haploinsufficiency on cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, 40% of the mutation carrier tumors exhibited loss of the wild-type allele. These findings collectively provide strong evidence for MCHP1 being a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene, which warrants further investigations in other populations.Introduction:Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, and the contribution of hereditary susceptibility to its development has been well recognized. Numerous breast cancer susceptibility genes are involved in the DNA damage response, strongly indicating that certain pathways of DNA repair and checkpoint control are necessary for preventing malignancy, particularly in breast epithelial cells. These susceptibility genes, including the major ones BRCA1 and BRCA2 along with PALB2, are all characterized by several rare, loss-of-function mutations, usually protein truncations. These heterozygous germline mutations predispose carrier individuals to breast, but to some extent also to ovarian cancer[1]. However, as the currently known moderate-to-high risk genes explain only 30% of the familial and 5% of the total breast cancer incidence[1â3], the identification of new genetic susceptibility factors and understanding of their contribution to disease onset is imperative. For this purpose we have performed a targeted next-generation sequencing of altogether 796 genes involved in diverse DNA repair signaling pathways in individuals with indication of hereditary disease susceptibility, originating from the genetically isolated Northern Finnish population. Based on their strong prior evidence for breast cancer association, the analysis was focused on protein truncating mutations, which were evaluated for cancer association by case-control comparisons. This initial sequencing revealed a deletion in the MCPH1 gene, encoding an early DNA damage response protein. We show here that this recurrent mutation significantly associates with breast cancer susceptibility, and that MCPH1 has an integral role in the maintenance of genomic instability and acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.Discussion:Current study provides strong genetic evidence for the association of MCPH1 c. 904_916del heterozygosity with inherited breast cancer predisposition, and adds yet another link to human disease for the multifunctional MCPH1 protein. In the currently studied cohorts the MCPH1 c. 904_916del mutation explains 3. 4% of the familial and 1. 4% of the unselected cases, these frequencies being comparable to that observed for Finnish PALB2 c. 1592delT founder mutation[3]. Although c. 904_916del alleleâs frequency in familial cohort is lower than the frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which collectively explain 20% of the Finnish breast and ovarian cancer families[25, 26], in unselected cases the combined frequency of different BRCA1/2 mutations( 1. 8%)[27] is roughly the same as observed for this single MCPH1 mutation. Based on case-control comparisons, the MCPH1 c. 904_916del carriers have a comparable breast cancer risk to that observed for the Finnish PALB2 c. 1592delT carriers, evaluated by using both unselected breast cancer( 3. 3-fold risk for MCPH1 and 3. 9-fold risk for PALB2) and familial breast cancer cohort( 8. 3-fold risk for MCPH1 and 11. 3-fold risk for PALB2)[3], the risk being at least moderate and potentially high. PALB2 has recently been reported to confer a breast cancer risk comparable to that of BRCA2 mutations, indicating the need to include it in the clinical diagnostics along with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing[28]. As MCPH1 is also important for brain development, demonstrated by the fact that inherited biallelic MCPH1 mutations result in microcephaly, it is of note that many of the currently identified MCPH1 c. 904_916del carrier families also exhibited brain tumors. The importance of MCPH1 for prevention of malignancy, particularly in breast epithelial cells, has been indicated by previous studies reporting somatic MCPH1 downregulation in multiple breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer specimens[4, 29]. MCPH1 alterations have also been reported in TCGA datasets retrieved from cBioPortal Cancer Genomics database[30], not only in breast tumors( about 7%) but also in other malignancy types observed in the currently identified carrier families( sarcomas 3. 5%, brain tumors 1% and lung cancer 8%). The current genetic data brings now firm evidence for the role of MCPH1 in breast cancer prevention. The effect of MCPH1 c. 904_916del mutation on the maintenance of genomic integrity and cancer predisposition is also supported by the significant increase in chromosomal rearrangements observed in the untransformed cells of the mutation carriers, and the tumor suppressor role of MCPH1 is reinforced by loss of wild-type allele in 40% of the MCPH1 c. 904_916del mutation carrier breast tumors. Altogether, this data indicates that common causal molecular events can occur both in inherited forms and in non-inherited forms of breast cancer. In order to reveal the molecular details linked to this mutation and its role in cancer predisposition more detailed functional characterization using genome editing of breast epithelial cells is required. These subsequent studies on MCPH1 c. 904_916del carriers could serve as a model for somatically MCPH1 deficient cancers as well. The identification of MCPH1 as a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene further reinforces the essential involvement of compromised DNA DSB response pathway in malignancy development. Thus, targeted high depths of coverage next-generation sequencing of the genes from DSB pathway provides an excellent approach for the identification of novel rare germline mutations predisposing to this common disease. The use of founder populations provides further advantage for this: geneâs contribution to hereditary cancer susceptibility is easier to prove, if many families harboring the same predisposing mutation can be identified. Even though the currently identified MCPH1 c. 904_916del is evidently Finnish founder mutation, ExAC database reports it in other populations as well, although at much lower frequency, thus warranting further investigations. Given the mutation spectrum of MCPH1 gene reported in ExAC, other population specific breast cancer associated MCPH1 mutations are also likely to exist. Altogether, the current results collectively provide strong evidence for MCHP1 being a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene, which will provide further tools for the clinical risk assessment of individuals with family burden of this disease.","answer":"Although the contribution of hereditary susceptibility to breast cancer is well-established , the majority of predisposing factors still remain unidentified .

Introduction<p>Ciprofloxacin (CIP), chemically 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-7-(piperazin-1-yl)-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, belongs to the class of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics [1]. It is used to treat bacterial infections such as gastrointestinal, Intra-abdominal, skin, respiratory tract, urinary tract, and bone and joint infections, among others [2]. Doxycycline (DOX), chemically (4S,4aR,5S,5aR,6R,12aS)-4-(Dimethylamino)-3,5,10,12,12a-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydrotetracene-2-carboxamide, is an antibiotic which belongs to the group of tetracyclines [1]. It is used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic prostatitis, sinusitis, acne, and rickettsial infections in addition to the general indications for all members of the tetracycline antibiotics group [2].</p><p>Both ciprofloxacin and doxycycline hyclate are official in the British and United States Pharmacopoeia, and their official method of assay is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [1, 3]. Several analytical methods such as spectrophotometry [4, 5], fluorimetry [6], ultra-performance liquid chromatographic [7], HPLC [8], high-performance thin-layer chromatography [9], high-performance capillary electrophoresis [10], and capillary electrophoresis [11] have been reported for the determination of ciprofloxacin while spectrophotometry [12, 13] and HPLC [14, 15] are for the determination of doxycycline hyclate alone or in combination with other medicines.</p><p>In recent years, the application of chemometrics, particularly multivariate calibration methods, is playing a crucial role in the multicomponent analysis of pharmaceutical mixtures [16]. Multivariate calibration methods such as PCR and PLS applied to spectral data are being increasingly used for instrumental methods without separation techniques [17, 18]. Multivariate calibration of PCR and PLS have been applied for simultaneous UV-Vis spectrophotometric determination of ciprofloxacin and ornidazole [19], ciprofloxacin and tinidazole [20], ambroxol and doxycycline [21], and Î²-lactam antibiotic binary mixtures [22] in pharmaceutical formulations.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to introduce alternative analytical procedures based on the chemometric-assisted spectrophotometric methods for the simultaneous determination of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline hyclate in laboratory-prepared synthetic and pharmaceutical mixtures. Using an apparatus at a time for the simultaneous determination of both drugs using water as a solvent is a great benefit for developing nations because of the efficient use of the instrument and cheap solvent. Therefore, these analytical methods might be helpful specifically in developing countries where resource is limited.</p>2.1. Apparatus and Software<p>Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on a double-beam UV-VIS spectrometer (PG Instruments, Lutterworth, England), equipped with 1âcm matched quartz cells, connected to a computer loaded with UV-Win PC software. All absorption spectra were saved and subsequently exported UV-Win software to Microsoft Excel program for statistical manipulation. Minitab 7.1 version software was employed to determine concentrations of combinations for calibration and validation sets while UnscramblerÂ® X 10.5 version was used for PCR and PLS model development and data analysis.</p>2.2. Reagents and Samples<p>Pharmaceutical grade ciprofloxacin and doxycycline were obtained from Addis Pharmaceutical Factory (Adigrat, Ethiopia). Distilled water was used throughout the work. Commercial samples, ciprofloxacin tablets labeled to contain 500âmg (Serviflox, Sandoz and Zindolin, Remedica) and doxycycline hyclate labeled to contain 100âmg capsules (Doxicad, Cadila), and tablets (Remycin, Remedica), were purchased from the local pharmacies in Mekelle, Ethiopia.</p>2.3. One-Component Calibration<p>This was examined in the concentration range of 1â10âÎ¼g/mL for ciprofloxacin and 5â25âÎ¼g/mL for doxycycline hyclate. Absorbance values were recorded at Î»max of each drug (272ânm for CIP and 275ânm for DOX) against distilled water as blank. Linear dynamic range for each drug was studied by least square linear regression of concentration and the corresponding absorbance.</p>2.4. Preparation of Stock and Working Standard Solutions<p>Accurately weighed and transferred (10âmg) either of the standard drugs into 100âmL volumetric flask was dissolved in about 80âmL of distilled water and diluted to volume with the same solution. Suitable aliquots of the stock solutions were diluted with the solvent to obtain the appropriate working standard solutions according to the linear calibration range for each drug.</p>2.5. Construction of Calibration and Validation Sets<p>The calibration and validation mixtures were prepared by combining working standard solutions of CIP and DOX in different ratios in their concentration linearity ranges. The concentrations of mixtures were determined by general factorial design (2 factors at 5 level of each factor) for calibration set and (2 factors at 3 level of each factor) for validation set. A total set of 25 and 9 calibration (Table 1) and validation (Table 2) mixtures were independently prepared, respectively. The absorption spectra of all mixtures were recorded over the range 200â400ânm with 2ânm interval.</p>2.6. Analysis of the Marketed Formulations<p>Twenty tablets or capsules were accurately weighed and finely powdered. Tablet or capsule powder equivalent to ciprofloxacin (100âmg) and doxycycline hyclate (150âmg) were accurately weighed and transferred into 100âmL volumetric flask, and 50âmL of distilled water was added. The solution was well shaken and ultrasonicated for 15âmin. Then, the solution was filtrated in a 100âmL volumetric flask through a Whatman filter paper # 42 filter paper. The residue was washed three times with 10âmL water, and the volume was completed to 100âmL with water. Suitable aliquots of the stock solutions were mixed and diluted with the solvent to obtain the appropriate working sample solution for UV measurements at the specified range.</p><p>Synthetic mixture was used for the combination of working standard solutions while pharmaceutical mixture referred to the combination of sample solutions throughout this work.</p>2.7. Accuracy Study<p>The accuracy of the method was performed at three levels 80, 100, and 120% of the working concentration of sample. Calculated amounts of standard solution of CIP and DOX were spiked into sample solution, and the resulting solutions were scanned in the range of 200â400ânm. The accuracy of the method was evaluated as the percent recovery of the added amounts of the standard to the previously analyzed sample. The developed method was validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.</p>3.1. Multivariate Calibration Analysis<p>The UV absorption spectra of ciprofloxacin, doxycycline hyclate, and their mixture are given in Figure 1. The calibration and prediction sets were designed in 25 and 9 laboratory-made mixtures (Tables 1 and 2) as described in Section 2.5. The absorbance spectra which showed a significant overlap were recorded between 200 and 400ânm in the intervals as ÎÎ» = 2ânm at 100 wavelengths. Multivariate calibrations such as PCR and PLS are therefore required for such analysis due to presence of interference.</p><p>A number of laboratory synthetic mixtures (Table 2) were subjected to the PCR and PLS analysis to prove the suitability of the calibration model for determination of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline hyclate in the pharmaceutical sample solutions. The model was built with the help of the Unscrambler software. The findings were satisfactory as the concentrations of each drug predicted by the model are close to the actual concentrations.</p><p>The predictive abilities of the models were evaluated by root-mean-square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP), and correlation coefficient (r2) (Table 2). With cross-validation, the same calibration set samples were used for both model estimation and testing. Leave-one-out cross-validation, leaving out one sample at a time, was employed to validate the PCR and PLS models in model development. The models were also validated by prediction of the concentration of analytes in separate validation set which was not used in the model development (Table 2). The RMSEP generated from validation set is the estimated prediction error that accurately reflects all sources of variability in the calibration method. To validate the model, both RMSECV and RMSEP must be as low as possible for a model [23]. Reasonable correlation coefficient was obtained for each drug in the validation set samples by PCR- and PLS-optimized models, demonstrating good predictive abilities of the models.</p>3.2. Accuracy<p>The reliability and validity of the proposed method were examined by the standard addition technique at 80%, 100%, and 120% of the test concentration. The mixtures were analyzed, and the percent recoveries ranged from 97.50% to 101.87% (Table 3). These findings confirmed that the excipients in pharmaceutical products do not interfere with the determination of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline hyclate.</p><p>Precision of the developed method was examined as intra- and interday precisions. Six determinations of the drug solution were performed for three consecutive days for the evaluation of intermediate precision. The percent relative standard deviations of both precisions were <2%, revealing the good precision of the method.</p>3.3. Analysis of Real Samples<p>The proposed methods were applied for the assay of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline hyclate in laboratory prepared mixtures of their pharmaceutical preparations. The assay results are shown in Table 4. The findings were found to be in a good agreement with the concentration taken for the formulations. This revealed that the matrices and/or excipients did not interfere with the quantifications.</p><p>The developed techniques are much easier than HPLC methods stipulated in pharmacopeias [1, 3] and other existing analytical methods [7, 8, 14, 15]. The methods employed distilled water as a solvent, and the procedures do not involve any sample pretreatment.</p>4. Conclusion<p>The developed UV spectrophotometric methods in combination with PCR and PLS can be used for the simultaneous determination of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline hyclate in laboratory-prepared binary mixtures of their either pure powder forms or pharmaceutical preparations. The proposed techniques do not need any sample pretreatment, and they are rapid, precise, and accurate. Therefore, these methods could be suitable for quality-control laboratories especially in developing nations, where resource is limited.</p>","answer":"Two chemometrics methodsâprincipal component regression and partial least squaresâwere developed for simultaneous spectrophotometric estimation of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline hyclate in pharmaceutical dosage forms without any pretreatment.

Beer's law was obeyed for both drugs in the concentration ranges of 1â10 Î¼g/mL for ciprofloxacin and 5â25 Î¼g/mL for doxycycline hyclate. Two sets of standard mixtures, 25 as a calibration set and 9 as a validation set, were prepared. The calibration models were evaluated by cross-validation and external validation over synthetic mixtures.

BACKGROUND: Sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor active against various solid tumours, induces oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a new form of oxidative necrosis, in some cancer cells. Clinically-applicable biomarkers that reflect the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells are lacking. METHODS: We used gene expression microarrays, real-time PCR, immunoblot, protein-specific ELISA, and gene reporter constructs encoding the enzyme luciferase to study the response of a panel of cancer cells to sorafenib. Tumour explants prepared from surgical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples and serum samples obtained from HCC patients receiving sorafenib were also used. RESULTS: We observed that genes of the metallothionein-1 (MT1) family are induced in the HCC cell line Huh7 exposed to sorafenib. Sorafenib increased the expression of MT1G mRNA in a panel of human cancer cells, an effect that was not observed with eight other clinically-approved kinase inhibitors. We identified the minimal region of the MT1G promoter that confers inducibility by sorafenib to a 133 base pair region containing an Anti-oxidant Response Element (ARE) and showed the essential role of the transcription factor NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2). We examined the clinical relevance of our findings by analysing the regulation of MT1G in five tumour explants prepared from surgical HCC samples. Finally, we showed that the protein levels of MT1 increase in the serum of some HCC patients receiving sorafenib, and found an association with reduced overall survival. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that MT1 constitute a biomarker adapted for exploring the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"Huh7\\", \\"MT1\\", \\"metallothionein-1\\", \\"Metallothionein-1\\", \\"NRF2\\", \\"MT1G\\", \\"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We recently showed that resistance exercise and ingestion of essential amino acids with carbohydrate ( EAA+CHO ) can independently stimulate mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling and muscle protein synthesis in humans . Providing an EAA+CHO solution postexercise can further increase muscle protein synthesis . Therefore , we hypothesized that enhanced mTOR signaling might be responsible for the greater muscle protein synthesis when leucine-enriched EAA+CHOs are ingested during postexercise recovery . Sixteen male subjects were randomized to one of two groups ( control or EAA+CHO ) . The EAA+CHO group ingested the nutrient solution 1 h after resistance exercise . mTOR signaling was assessed by immunoblotting from repeated muscle biopsy samples . Mixed muscle fractional synthetic rate ( FSR ) was measured using stable isotope techniques . Muscle protein synthesis and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation during exercise were significantly reduced ( P < 0.05 ) . Postexercise FSR was elevated above baseline in both groups at 1 h but was even further elevated in the EAA+CHO group at 2 h postexercise ( P < 0.05 ) . Increased FSR was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR and S6K1 ( P < 0.05 ) . Akt phosphorylation was elevated at 1 h and returned to baseline by 2 h in the control group , but it remained elevated in the EAA+CHO group ( P < 0.05 ) . 4E-BP1 phosphorylation returned to baseline during recovery in control but became elevated when EAA+CHO was ingested ( P < 0.05 ) . eEF2 phosphorylation decreased at 1 and 2 h postexercise to a similar extent in both groups ( P < 0.05 ) .

Previousstudies along this topic can be mainly divided into two types of data generations. First, aregression problem, for example, assumes that each sample y is generated as y = 1 K K k=1 Ï(w k x), wherew k â R d is the weight vector of the kth neuron, 1 â¤ k â¤ K, and the input x â R d is Gaussian. This typeof regression problem has been studied in various settings. In particular, BID28 studied the single-neuron model under ReLU activation, BID38 ) studied the onehidden-layer multi-neuron network model, and BID19 ) studied a two-layer feedforward networks with ReLU activations and identity mapping. Second, fora classification problem, suppose each label y â {0, 1} is drawn under the conditional distribution P(y = 1|x) = 1 K K k=1 Ï(w k x), where wk â R d is the weight vector of the kth neuron, 1 â¤ k â¤ K, and the input x â R d is Gaussian. Such a problemhas been studied in BID21 in the case with a single neuron.For both the regression and the classification settings, in order to recover the neural network parameters, all previous studies considered (stochastic) gradient descent over the squared loss, i.e., qu (W ; x, y) = DISPLAYFORM0Furthermore, previous studies provided two types of statistical guarantees for such model recovery problems using the squared loss. More specifically, BID38 showed that in the local neighborhood of the ground truth, the Hessian of the empirical loss function is positive definite for each given point under independent high probability event. Hence, their guaranteefor gradient descent to converge to the ground truth requires a fresh set of samples at every iteration, thus the total sample complexity will depend on the number of iterations. On the other hand, studiessuch as BID21 BID28 establish certain types of uniform geometry such as strong convexity so that resampling per iteration is not needed for gradient descent to have guaranteed linear convergence as long as it enters such a local neighborhood. However, such a stronger statisticalguarantee without per-iteration resampling have only been shown for the squared loss function. In this paper, we aim at developingsuch a strong statistical guarantee for the loss function in eq. (2), which is much more challenging but more practical than the squared loss for the classification problem.In this paper, we have studied the model recovery of a one-hidden-layer neural network using the cross entropy loss in a multi-neuron classification problem.In particular, we have characterized the sample complexity to guarantee local strong convexity in a neighborhood (whose size we have characterized as well) of the ground truth when the training data are generated from a classification model.This guarantees that with high probability, gradient descent converges linearly to the ground truth if initialized properly.In the future, it will be interesting to extend the analysis in this paper to more general class of activation functions, particularly ReLU-like activations; and more general network structures, such as convolutional neural networks BID10 BID37 .","answer":"We provide the first theoretical analysis of guaranteed recovery of one-hidden-layer neural networks under cross entropy loss for classification problems."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The use of NUROMAX before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied. There are no clinical data on concomitant use of NUROMAX and other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane decrease the ED50 of NUROMAX by 30% to 45%. These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action by up to 25%. Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as NUROMAX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

The anticonvulsant effect of either clonazepam (0.2-6.4 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (2.5-40 mg/kg) alone or in combination with diphenylhydantoin (4-16 mg/kg) was studied against electroconvulsions in mice. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally, diphenylhydantoin - 75 min and the benzodiazepines - 60 min before the test. Adding either clonazepam or chlordiazepoxide (in doses moderately increasing the convulsive threshold) was more effective than doubling the dose of diphenylhydantoin. Both the interaction between benzodiazepines and diphenylhydantoin at the level of the receptor for picrotoxin-barbiturates and benzodiazepine-induced potentiation of specific diphenylhydantoin binding are likely to contribute to the observed phenomenon. On the other hand , a diphenylhydantoin-induced increase in the total number of specific benzodiazepine binding sites seems of minor importance since clonazepam ( with a high affinity for these sites ) and chlordiazepoxide ( with a low affinity ) were equipotent in the enhancement of the combined treatment efficacy .sentence: On the other hand , a diphenylhydantoin-induced increase in the total number of specific benzodiazepine binding sites seems of minor importance since clonazepam ( with a high affinity for these sites ) and chlordiazepoxide ( with a low affinity ) were equipotent in the enhancement of the combined treatment efficacy .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Machine learning methods applied to computational imaging have proven very successful, but have so far largely focused on retrieving a single optimal solution for a given task. Such retrieval is arguably an incomplete description of the solution space, as in ill-posed inverse problems there may be many similarly likely reconstructions. We minimise an upper bound on the divergence between our approximate distribution and the true intractable posterior, thereby obtaining a probabilistic description of the solution space in imaging inverse problems with empirical prior. We demonstrate the advantage of our technique in quantitative simulations with the CelebA dataset and common image reconstruction tasks. We then apply our method to two of the currently most challenging problems in experimental optics: imaging through highly scattering media and imaging through multi-modal optical fibres. In both settings we report state of the art reconstructions, while providing new capabilities, such as estimation of error-bars and visualisation of multiple likely reconstructions.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The goal of compressed sensing is to estimate a vector from an underdetermined system of noisy linear measurements, by making use of prior knowledge on the structure of vectors in the relevant domain. For almost all results in this literature, the structure is represented by sparsity in a well-chosen basis. We show how to achieve guarantees similar to standard compressed sensing but without employing sparsity at all. Instead, we suppose that vectors lie near the range of a generative model @math . Our main theorem is that, if @math is @math -Lipschitz, then roughly @math random Gaussian measurements suffice for an @math recovery guarantee. We demonstrate our results using generative models from published variational autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. Our method can use @math - @math x fewer measurements than Lasso for the same accuracy.[2]: [3]: While deep learning methods have achieved state-of-theart performance in many challenging inverse problems like image inpainting and super-resolution, they invariably involve problem-specific training of the networks. Under this approach, each inverse problem requires its own dedicated network. In scenarios where we need to solve a wide variety of problems, e.g., on a mobile camera, it is inefficient and expensive to use these problem-specific networks. On the other hand, traditional methods using analytic signal priors can be used to solve any linear inverse problem; this often comes with a performance that is worse than learning-based methods. In this work, we provide a middle ground between the two kinds of methods â we propose a general framework to train a single deep neural network that solves arbitrary linear inverse problems. We achieve this by training a network that acts as a quasi-projection operator for the set of natural images and show that any linear inverse problem involving natural images can be solved using iterative methods. We empirically show that the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods using wavelet sparsity prior while achieving performance comparable to specially-trained networks on tasks including compressive sensing and pixel-wise inpainting.","answer":"A second emerging class of learning based methods in CI is that of maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference with generative models. In these frameworks, similarly to MAP inference with analytical priors, the solution is found by minimising the Euclidean distance to the observations @math . However, instead of regularising the solution with some penalty function, the signal of interest is assumed to be generated by a pre-trained generative model as @math , where @math is the generative model's latent variable [1] . As the generative model is trained with an example set that the target signal is assumed to belong to, generated images are expected to retain empirically learned properties [3] . The solution is then found by performing the following minimisation, In such a way, the solution is constrained to be within the domain of the generative model, as the recovered @math is by definition generated from @math , but at the same time agreement to the measurements is directly induced. Though the optimisation problem is not convex, certain theoretical bounds were derived for the cases of linear observation processes by and more recently phase-less linear observation processes [2] ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The strategies predisposed to maintain organismal homeostasis and grant selective advantage rely on anticipatory phenomena facing periodic modifications, and compensatory phenomena facing unpredictable changes. Biological processes bringing about these responses are respectively driven by the circadian timing system, a complex of biological oscillators entrained to the environmental light/dark cycle, and by regulatory and metabolic networks that precisely direct the body's adjustments to variations of external conditions and internal milieu. A critical role in organismal homeostatic functions is played by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) complex, which senses environmental and endogenous compounds, influences metabolic responses controlling phase I/II gene expression, and modulates vital phenomena such as development, inflammation and adaptive immunity. A physiological cross-talk between circadian and AHR signaling pathways has been evidenced. The alteration of AHR signaling pathway deriving from genetic damage with polymorphisms or mutations, or produced by exogenous or endogenous AHR activation, and chronodisruption caused by mismatch between the body's internal clock and geophysical time/social schedules, are capable of triggering pathological mechanisms involved in metabolic, immune-related and neoplastic diseases.

Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:In colored graphs, node classes are often associated with either their neighbors class or with information not incorporated in the graph associated with each node.We here propose that node classes are also associated with topological features of the nodes.We use this association to improve Graph machine learning in general and specifically, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). First, we show that even in the absence of any external information on nodes, a good accuracy can be obtained on the prediction of the node class using either topological features, or using the neighbors class as an input to a GCN.This accuracy is slightly less than the one that can be obtained using content based GCN.Secondly, we show that explicitly adding the topology as an input to the GCN does not improve the accuracy when combined with external information on nodes.However,  adding an additional adjacency matrix with edges between distant nodes with similar topology to the GCN does significantly improve its accuracy, leading to results better than all state of the art methods in multiple datasets.One of the central assumptions in node classification tasks is that neighboring nodes have similar classes (Ji & Han, 2012; Berberidis & Giannakis, 2018; Zhu et al., 2003b; Sindhwani et al., 2005) .This has been extensively used in node classification tasks (Belkin & Niyogi, 2004; Zhu et al., 2003a) .Such approaches are now often denoted as graph neural networks (i.e. machine learning where the input is a graph/network) (Scarselli et al., 2008; Gori et al., 2005; Li et al., 2015) .Four main approaches have been proposed to take advantage of a graph in machine learning:â¢ Regularize the output requiring that neighboring nodes either in the graph or in its projection have similar classes.â¢ Use the graph to propagate labels and learn the best propagation.â¢ Use the graph to project the nodes to real valued vectors and use those for supervised or unsupervised learning.â¢ Use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for convolutions on the input of a node and its neighbors.Regularization or graph partitioning methods include among others partitioning the graphs based on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian (assuming that nodes with the same partition have similar classes).The Laplacian of a graph is : L = D âA , where D is a diagonal matrix, with the sum of each row in the diagonal and A is the adjacency matrix.This Laplacian is often weighted by multiplying it on the left and the right by D to normalize for the degree (Dhillon et al., 2007; Karypis & Kumar, 1995) .Other works have used variants of this idea, each using smoothness and graph distance differently (Belkin & Niyogi, 2004; Sindhwani et al., 2005) .An alternative approach is to use quadratic penalty with fixed labels for seed nodes (Zhou et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003a) .Multiple diffusion and information propagation models have also been proposed either through explicit diffusion, or through the projection of nodes into real valued vectors (Rosenfeld & Globerson, 2017) .For example, DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) , where a truncated random walk is performed on nodes.It then uses these sentences as an input to skipgram to compute a projection of each word into R N , maximizing the sentence probability.Planetoid Yang et al. (2016) also uses random walks combined with negative sampling.Duvenaud et al. (2015) uses a translation of subgraphs to hash functions for a similar task in the context of molecule classifications.A very similar approach was presented by Grover & Leskovec (2016) (Node2Vec) by projecting nodes minimizing the distance of neighbored nodes in a truncated random walk.The DNGR model (Cao et al., 2016) uses random walk to compute the mutual information between points (the PPMI-positive pointwise mutual information), and then a SVD decomposition to project into space.PPMI was used for word representations in Levy et al. (2015) and is a sparse high dimensional representation.Another possible approach is the projection of the graph (often using the Laplacian eigenvectors), and the usage of the projection for classification (and not only for a smoothness based regularization), where either the graph itself is used (in such a case, the eigenvectors themselves are used) or an input to the graph is used.In such a case, a convolution with these eigenvectors was used (Masci et al., 2015; Monti et al., 2017) .A Multi-Dimensional-Scaling (MDS) projection of the points in the graphs was also used for a similar goal (Belkin & Niyogi, 2002; Levy et al., 2015) .Alternative approaches were inspired again by word embedding methods (Mikolov et al., 2013) such as word2vec.These methods use the graph to define a context in relation to which the node embedding is constructed.When the data includes only the graph, the embeddings are used as features and fed into existing predictors (Perozzi et al., 2014) .These methods can be thought of as propagating features rather than labels.Henderson et al. (2011) defines local features to translate each node to a features vector and use those to predict classes.Recently, Kipfs and collaborators, in a seminal work, proposed a simplification of spectral based convolutions (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) , and instead use a two-layer approach, which can be summarized as:whereÃ is a normalized adjacency matrix:They test their work on multiple graphs with labeled nodes including CiteSeer, Cora, Pubmed, and Nell.Convolution approaches can also be used with the graph as a filter on the input.Most such convolutions are spectral (use the Laplacian eigenvectors).However, recent methods are based on random filters.Those include among others: Atwood & Towsley (2016) which defines predetermined convolutions with powers of the adjacency matrix and then combines these powers using learned weights to maximize the classification precision of either the full graph or the classification of nodes.Bruna et al. (2013) provide a multi-level graph convolution with pooling, where at each stage nodes are merged into clusters using agglomerative clustering methods, and combine it with a pooling method to represent the different resolution of images.This has been extended (Henaff et al., 2015; to different convolutional kernels (mainly spectral, but also diffusion-based kernels) and the classification of images, using ImageNet (see for a detailed review of all convolution methods).Vandergheynst and collaborators mainly use polynomial convolution in the spectral domain.Similar formalisms were used to study not only single snapshots, but also with recurrent networks time series of graphs, mainly again in image analysis (Seo et al., 2018) .Over the last 3 years, over 1,500 extensions and applications of GCN have been published in combination with many other learning methods, including among many others combinations of GCN with recurrent neural networks (Ling et al., 2019) , with GANs (Lei et al., 2019) and with active learning (Abel & Louzoun, 2019) .GCNs capture dependencies of nodes' features.However, current techniques consider only local neighborhoods.Thus, long-range dependencies can only be captured when these operations are applied repeatedly, propagating signals progressively through the data.To catch long-range dependencies, Kipf & Welling (2016) proposed stacking multiple layers of GCN.While this is possible in theory, it has never been successfully applied.In practice, GCN models work the best with 2-3 layers (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Monti et al., 2017; VeliÄkoviÄ et al., 2017; Levie et al., 2018; Fey et al., 2018) .Abu-El-Haija et al. (2018) proposed using NGCN train multiple instances of GCNs over different distances regions.While this led to good performance, it is highly inefficient and does not scale to long distances (as the number of models scales linearly with the desired length).However, long range correlations can be obtained from a different direction.Recently, a correlation has been shown between the topological attributes (e.g. degree, centrality, clustering coefficient...) of nodes and their class (Shi & Malik, 2000; Yang et al., 2013; Cannistraci et al., 2013; Rosen & Louzoun, 2015; Naaman et al., 2018) .Inspired by the improvement of non-local operations in a variety of tasks in the field of computer vision Wang et al. (2018) , we propose a novel non-local operation for GCN, based on the topology of the graph.Our operation is generic and can be implemented with every GCN to capture long-range dependencies, allowing information propagation to distant nodes.There are several advantages of using non-local operations:(a) In contrast to the standard local convolution layer, non-local operations capture long-range dependencies directly by computing interactions between any two nodes, regardless of their positional distance;(b) As we show in experiments, non-local operations are efficient and achieve their best results even with only a few layers;(c) Finally, our non-local convolution can be easily combined with other graph convolution techniques (e.g. GCN, GAT).Convolution methods to aggregate information from multiple distances are among the leading image classification methods.In images, most of these convolutions are symmetric and sometimes isotropic around each point.However, in contrast with images that are typically overlaid on a 2D lattice, graphs have a complex topology.This topology is highly informative of the properties of nodes and edges (Rosen & Louzoun, 2015; Naaman et al., 2018) , and can thus be used to classify their classes.This complex topology can be combined with convolutional networks to improve their accuracy.In undirected graphs, the topology can often be captured by a distance maintaining projection into R N , using unsupervised methods, such as the classical MDS (Kruskal, 1964), or supervised methods to minimize the distance between nodes with similar classes in the training set (Cao et al., 2016) .In directed graphs, a more complex topology emerges from the asymmetry between incoming and outgoing edges (i.e., the distance between node i and node j differs from the distance between node j and node i), creating a distribution of subgraphs around each node often denoted sub-graph motifs (Milo et al., 2002) .Such motifs have been reported to be associated with both single node/edge attributes as well as whole-graph attributes (Milo et al., 2002) .We have here shown that in a manuscript assignment task, the topology around each node is indeed associated with the manuscript class.In order to combine topological information with information propagation, we proposed a novel GCN where the fraction of second neighbors belonging to each class is used as an input, and the class of the node is compared to the softmax output of the node.This method can indeed produce a high classification accuracy, but less than the one obtained using a BOW input.Moreover, explicitly combining the topology as an input with the BOW reduces the accuracy.However, using the topology to add new edges between nodes with similar topological features actually significantly improves performance in most studied datasets.This suggests that the topology is better used to correlate between the class of distant nodes than to be actually used as an input.The results presented here are a combination of information propagation and topology-based classification.While each of these two elements was previously reported, their combination into a single coherent GCN based classifier provides a novel content independent method to classify nodes.With the current ever-increasing concerns about privacy, new content independent methods for node classification become essential.The citation networks contain scientific papers divided into classes by their research field.Edges describe citations in the data set.BOW is also available to describe each publication in the dataset.BOW can be either a 1/0 vector or a TF/IDF weighted word vector for PubMed.Coauthor CS and Coauthor Physics are co-authorship graphs based on the Microsoft Academic Graph from the KDD Cup 2016 challenge 3.Here, nodes are authors, that are connected by an edge if they co-authored a paper, node features represent paper keywords for each authors papers, and class labels indicate the most active fields of study for each author.Here are the parameters used for each of the models.For T-GCN and T-GAT the parameters were optimized for PubMed ( as observed by Monti et al. (2017) and VeliÄkoviÄ et al. (2017) ) except for Cora data for set which we used slightly different parameters (denotes as T-GCN Cora, and T-GAT Cora).The parameters are summarized in Table 3 .In all models, the activation function of the last layer is Softmax.The activation function of the first layer is presented In Table 3 .Hidden size X+Y means size of X for the original GCN operator and Y for the GCN on the dual graph.The two outputs are concatenated to a total of X+Y size.GAT heads X,Y,Z means X heads for the original GAT operator, and Y heads for the GAT on the dual graph.Z is the number of heads in the last layer.See Models And Data for more details.","answer":"Topology-Based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

Although considerable research has been devoted to the development of rank aggregation algorithms, one basic question is how to efficiently collect a large amount of high-quality pairwise comparisons for the ranking purpose. Because of the advent of many crowdsourcing services, a crowd of workers are often hired to conduct pairwise comparisons with a small monetary reward for each pair they compare. Since different workers have different levels of reliability and different pairs have different levels of ambiguity, it is desirable to wisely allocate the limited budget for comparisons among the pairs of items and workers so that the global ranking can be accurately inferred from the comparison results. To this end, we model the active sampling problem in crowdsourced ranking as a Bayesian Markov decision process, which dynamically selects item pairs and workers to improve the ranking accuracy under a budget constraint. We further develop a computationally efficient sampling policy based on knowledge gradient as well as a moment matching technique for posterior approximation. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed policy achieves high ranking accuracy with a lower labeling cost.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: There has been much interest recently in the problem of rank aggregation from pairwise data. A natural question that arises is: under what sorts of statistical assumptions do various rank aggregation algorithms converge to an 'optimal' ranking? In this paper, we consider this question in a natural setting where pairwise comparisons are drawn randomly and independently from some underlying probability distribution. We first show that, under a 'time-reversibility' or Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) condition on the distribution, the rank centrality (PageRank) and least squares (HodgeRank) algorithms both converge to an optimal ranking. Next, we show that a matrix version of the Borda count algorithm, and more surprisingly, an algorithm which performs maximum likelihood estimation under a BTL assumption, both converge to an optimal ranking under a 'low-noise' condition that is strictly more general than BTL. Finally, we propose a new SVM-based algorithm for rank aggregation from pairwise data, and show that this converges to an optimal ranking under an even more general condition that we term 'generalized low-noise'. In all cases, we provide explicit sample complexity bounds for exact recovery of an optimal ranking. Our experiments confirm our theoretical findings and help to shed light on the statistical behavior of various rank aggregation algorithms.[2]: There are various parametric models for analyzing pairwise comparison data, including the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and Thurstone models, but their reliance on strong parametric assumptions is limiting. In this work, we study a flexible model for pairwise comparisons, under which the probabilities of outcomes are required only to satisfy a natural form of stochastic transitivity. This class includes parametric models including the BTL and Thurstone models as special cases, but is considerably more general. We provide various examples of models in this broader stochastically transitive class for which classical parametric models provide poor fits. Despite this greater flexibility, we show that the matrix of probabilities can be estimated at the same rate as in standard parametric models. On the other hand, unlike in the BTL and Thurstone models, computing the minimax-optimal estimator in the stochastically transitive model is non-trivial, and we explore various computationally tractable alternatives. We show that a simple singular value thresholding algorithm is statistically consistent but does not achieve the minimax rate. We then propose and study algorithms that achieve the minimax rate over interesting sub-classes of the full stochastically transitive class. We complement our theoretical results with thorough numerical simulations.[3]: [4]: [5]: [6]: In this paper we present a general treatment of the preference aggregation problem, in which multiple preferences over objects must be combined into a single consensus ranking. We consider two instances of this problem: unsupervised aggregation where no information about a target ranking is available, and supervised aggregation where ground truth preferences are provided. For each problem class we develop novel learning methods that are applicable to a wide range of preference types. Specifically, for unsupervised aggregation we introduce the Multinomial Preference model (MPM) which uses a multinomial generative process to model the observed preferences. For the supervised problem we develop a supervised extension for MPM and then propose two fully supervised models. The first model employs SVD factorization to derive effective item features, transforming the aggregation problems into a learning-to-rank one. The second model aims to eliminate the costly SVD factorization and instantiates a probabilistic CRF framework, deriving unary and pairwise potentials directly from the observed preferences. Using a probabilistic framework allows us to directly optimize the expectation of any target metric, such as NDCG or ERR. All the proposed models operate on pairwise preferences and can thus be applied to a wide range of preference types. We empirically validate the models on rank aggregation and collaborative filtering data sets and demonstrate superior empirical accuracy.[7]: This paper is concerned with rank aggregation, which aims to combine multiple input rankings to get a better ranking. A popular approach to rank aggregation is based on probabilistic models on permutations, e.g., the Luce model and the Mallows model. However, these models have their limitations in either poor expressiveness or high computational complexity. To avoid these limitations, in this paper, we propose a new model, which is defined with a coset-permutation distance, and models the generation of a permutation as a stagewise process. We refer to the new model as coset-permutation distance based stagewise (CPS) model. The CPS model has rich expressiveness and can therefore be used in versatile applications, because many different permutation distances can be used to induce the coset-permutation distance. The complexity of the CPS model is low because of the stagewise decomposition of the permutation probability and the efficient computation of most coset-permutation distances. We apply the CPS model to supervised rank aggregation, derive the learning and inference algorithms, and empirically study their effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments on public datasets show that the derived algorithms based on the CPS model can achieve state-of-the-art ranking accuracy, and are much more efficient than previous algorithms.[8]: Given a set V of n elements we wish to linearly order them given pairwise preference labels which may be non-transitive (due to irrationality or arbitrary noise). The goal is to linearly order the elements while disagreeing with as few pairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two parameters: The number of disagreements (loss) and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference labels). Our algorithm adaptively queries at most O(e-6n log5 n) preference labels for a regret of e times the optimal loss. As a function of n, this is asymptotically better than standard (non-adaptive) learning bounds achievable for the same problem. Our main result takes us a step closer toward settling an open problem posed by learning-to-rank (from pairwise information) theoreticians and practitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? To further show the power and practicality of our solution, we analyze a typical test case in which a large margin linear relaxation is used for efficiently solving the simpler learning problems in our decomposition.","answer":"The dataset of partial rankings over items can be generated from a variety of sources including crowdsourcing services , online competition games (e.g., Microsoft's TrueSkill system ), and online users' activities such as browsing, clicking and transactions that reveal certain preferences. Learning a global ranking of a large set of items by aggregating a collection of partial rankings preferences has been an active research area for the past ten years (see, e.g., [7] [5] [3] [4] [2] [1] [8] [6] ). However, most work on rank aggregation considers a static estimation problem --- inferring a global ranking based on a pre-existing dataset. The problem we consider here is related to but significantly different from these works because we model crowdsourced ranking as a dynamic procedure where the inference of ranking and collection of data proceed concurrently and influence each other."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Building blocks for the construction of combinatorial glycopeptide librariesPaper sections:Introduction<p>The glycocalyx is a fringy or fuzzy polysaccharide layer coating most animal and many bacterial cells. It is covalently bound to the surface of the cell membrane through glycoproteins and plays a major role in numerous biologically important recognition mechanisms like cell-cell recognition, signal transduction and immunological processes [1][2][3][4]. Therefore, investigating the delicate carbohydrate-protein interactions on a molecular level is an inalienable prerequisite for a deep understanding of the fundamental cellular recognition processes involving the complex saccharides of the glycocalyx [5][6][7][8]. Unfortunately, isolation of pure carbohydrate material or specific glycoconjugates from natural sources remains a difficult, sometimes even an  unrealizable task, for naturally occurring saccharides exhibit micro-heterogenity which makes it nearly impossible to obtain pure material from such sources. Chemical or chemoenzymatic syntheses of complex oligosaccharides, on the other hand, may provide sufficient amounts of pure material for such studies. Despite the great achievements in oligosaccharide synthesis during the past decades, the preparation of complex oligosaccharides can be tedious, lengthy or circuitous, and the often intrinsic intricacy of a chemical saccharide synthesis makes it sometimes impossible to prepare a certain saccharide or glycoconjugate [9]. Therefore, gaining access to new glycoconjugates which are easily accessible by chemical synthesis and which are able to mimic the interaction between a specific protein and its natural oligosaccharide ligand are highly desirable [10][11][12][13]. In our previous work we introduced various trifunctional glycopeptide building blocks derived from aspartic acid, 3-aminomethyl-5-aminobenzoic acid [14] and from the PNA-like N-(2aminoethyl)glycine (AEG) backbone to which sugar moieties were linked through either simple alkyl chains [15,16], amino alcohols [17,18] or 1,2,3-triazoles [19][20][21]. These building blocks were used for automated SPOT synthesis on a cellulose surface in order to construct complex glycoconjugates which are able to specifically bind to lectins [15,18,20].</p><p>In continuation of these studies, we now describe the preparation of PNA-based glycoconjugate building blocks 1-3 as well as a dimeric glycoconjugate 4 in which the sugar moieties are attached through a malonyl linker (Figures 1-3). For these compounds we studied the cis/trans-rotameric structures via temperature-dependent 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Unfortunately, the amidic protons of the rotamers of the unprotected glycoconjugates could not be observed in the 1 H NMR spectra in D 2 O due to the fast H/D exchange with the solvent (Figure 2). Nevertheless, we could identify two rotameric forms exhibiting a cis/trans ratio of 2:1 which was in accordance with similar rotamers described in literature [22]. Hereupon, we report on our investigations concerning the structures of the fully protected conjugates 1 and 4 for the rotamers of which around the C-N bond we calculated the respective ÎG â¡ r -values.</p>Synthesis of building blocks<p>The preparation of building blocks 1a-d and 2a-d started from tert-butyl N-[2-(N-9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)aminoethyl)]glycinate hydrochloride (5) which was synthesized in 39% yield from tert-butyl bromoacetate according to the procedure published by Thomson et al. [23]. Acetyl protected glycosylaminomalonic acids 6a-d were prepared from the corresponding tert-butyl esters as previously described [14]. Coupling of 5 with acids 6a-d was achieved with either N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetramethyl-O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) (Scheme 1, Table 1). In general, HBTU gave higher yields of malonamides 1a-d than EDCI. Previously, we used</p>Entry<p>Starting material Coupling method Product Yield (%)</p><p>EDCI for coupling acids 6a-d to aniline derivatives because HBTU resulted in byproducts which were difficult to be removed [14]. Such byproducts were not observed here though.</p><p>Next, the tert-butyl ester groups of building blocks 1a-d were removed under acid conditions with a 2:1 mixture of formic acid and dichloromethane at room temperature to give the cor-responding free acids 2a-d in 97-98% yield (Scheme 1, Table 2).</p><p>Partially deprotected building block 3 was prepared from 1a as follows. First, removal of the Fmoc group in 1a under basic conditions with triethylamine in DMF gave the crude amino derivate which was acetylated with Ac 2 O to give building block</p>1D-NMR investigation<p>Glycoconjugates 1a,b and 4 were submitted to temperature-dependent 1 H NMR spectroscopy in order to reveal, verify and determine their cisand trans-rotameric structures (see also Figures 1-3). The 1 H NMR spectra of 1a and 1b in CDCl 3 at room temperature revealed two separate doublets at 8.19 and 7.99 ppm for 1a and 8.26 and 7.99 ppm for 1b, respectively for the anomeric amide proton indicating the presence of two rotamers (Figure 4 and Figure 5). The signals at lower field were assigned to the respective trans rotamers whereas the signals at higher field were assigned to the corresponding cis rotamers of 1a and 1b (see 2D NMR investigations below).</p><p>The 1 H NMR spectrum of the dimeric PNA glycoconjugate 4 in CDCl 3 showed the presence of four different rotameric structures (see also Figure 3). This was evident from eight distinct doublet signals for the anomeric amide protons (Figure 6).</p><p>Here, no unambiguous assignment of the observed doublets to respective cis/trans rotameric forms could be achieved by 2D NMR spectroscopy.</p><p>Since deuterochloroform is not suitable for temperature-dependent 1 H NMR experiments at higher temperatures which, in turn, are necessary for determining the coalescence temperature of both rotamers we measured the 1 H NMR of 1a in DMSO-d 6 , DMF-d 7 , and chlorobenzene-d 5 as well (Figure 7). In DMSO-d 6 and DMF-d 7 which both are common solvents for temperaturedependent NMR spectroscopy [24] the anomeric amide protons of the two rotamers of 1a were not sufficiently separated. Furthermore, Fmoc groups are known to be unstable in DMSO and DMF at higher temperatures [24,25]. Indeed, when 1a was heated in DMSO-d 6 above 60 Â°C a signal of dibenzofulvene at 6.21 ppm appeared, indicating the cleavage of the Fmoc group  in 1a (Figure 8). In chlorobenzene-d 5 (bp 131 Â°C), however, sufficient separation of the two anomeric amide protons of the rotamers of 1a were observed and no cleavage of the Fmoc group occurred. HÃ¶ck et al. [24] could also show that chlorobenze-d 5 does not cause cleavage of Fmoc groups in peptides up to 120 Â°C.</p><p>Figure 9 shows the temperature-dependent 1 H NMR spectra (7.65-8.30 ppm area only) of 1a in the temperature range between 25 and 100 Â°C. Heating the sample caused a downfield shift of the anomeric amide protons with coalescence (T c ) at 90-95 Â°C (363-368 K). Unfortunately, the amide signals partially overlapped with the proton signals of the Fmoc group at the coalescence temperature so that no exact coalescence temperature could be determined.</p>2D-NMR investigation<p>In order to unambiguously assign the anomeric amide signals (doublets) from the proton NMR spectra above to the corresponding cis/trans rotamers of 1a we measured the NOESY spectrum of conjugate 1a in CDCl 3 (see Supporting Information File 2). The spectrum indicates that the direct assignment of the amidic doublets to the respective cisor trans rotamers is not possible due to missing crosspeaks between the amidic signals and the methylene or 2-aminoethyl protons of the PNA backbone (Figure 12).</p><p>Nevertheless, crosspeaks between the amidic protons and the malonyl protons could be observed, and were used for an indirect assignment of the amidic doublets. Stronger NOE crosspeaks between the methylene protons of the side chain (3.20 ppm) and the methylene protons of the PNA backbone (3.93 ppm) indicated that the distance between these protons should be shorter in comparison to the distance of the protons with a chemical shift at 3.36 and 3.93 ppm. Therefore, the signal of the protons at 3.20 ppm and the doublet at 8.18 ppm belong to the trans rotamer whereas the doublet at 8.01 ppm should belong to the cis rotameric structure.</p>Calculation of ÎG â¡ r -values<p>In order to evaluate the rotation barrier around the tertiary peptide bond (C-N bond) we calculated the corresponding ÎG â¡ r values for building blocks 1a,b from the measured coalescence temperatures (T c ) by using the Eyring model [26]. The ÎG â¡ c values of the dimeric glycoconjugate 4 could not be determined though because no unambiguous assignment of the rotameric structures to the corresponding specific proton signals could be made. Nevertheless, the rotation barriers of glycoconjugate 4 should be rather similar to the barriers of building blocks 1a,b due to the almost identical coalescence temperatures (T c ).</p><p>The respective Î values (NH trans -NH cis ) were extracted from the corresponding 1 H NMR spectra of the specific building blocks 1a,b in chlorobenzene-d 5 at 25 Â°C (298 K). Table 3 summarizes the calculated ÎG â¡ c values and illustrates that there is only a small difference between the calculated ÎG â¡ r values of building blocks 1a and 1b in chlorbenzene-d 5 .

independent growth , the key question is , what is the nature of the changes in this coordination between adhesion and signaling in cancerous cells ?epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) describes a series of events originally recognized in embryogenesis and involves changes in epithelial cells that give rise to mesenchymal cells .bipolar cells with a filopodia - rich front end capable of invading the extracellular matrix ( ecm)  and at the very least , with motile morphology  .while numerous changes in molecular markers occur during emt , these are not universal to all emt cases .many of the phenotypic changes occurring during emt are reminiscent of those seen in adenocarcinoma cells during cancer progression , which involve an invasion of the ecm and movement away from the primary tumor to form distant metastases .this invasiveness is fundamental to both emt in embryogenesis and malignant tumor development , and the activation of key transcription factors and expression of other marker genes common to both processes supports the idea that emt is pathologically reactivated during malignant transformation .embryogenesis and tumorigenesis are , however , distinct in important ways : while embryogenesis is a highly ordered process that creates a functional organism , tumor progression is often disordered and unpredictable . with this in mind ,kalluri and weinberg   suggested a system for distinguishing similar processes involving cell plasticity and motility from one another by dividing emt into several subtypes .in addition , recent studies suggest that only a small subpopulation of carcinoma cells , the  cancer stem cells ( cscs ) both sustain tumor growth and promote metastasis .until recently , the accepted dogma in cancer research was that replicating epithelial cells accumulate several rounds of mutations that eventually lead to cancerous transformation .this idea has recently been challenged by the identification of cscs , which provide a new means for both the initiation and propagation of tumorigenesis . since stem cellscan self renew , proliferate , and differentiate , these properties can explain both the unrestricted growth and the differentiated patterns seen in malignant tumors .the wnt/-catenin signaling pathway was shown to regulate both self - renewal and oncogenesis in different tissues .furthermore , cells at the invasive front of colorectal carcinomas often express a csc phenotype , characterized by loss of e - cadherin and nuclear -catenin localization , an indication of active wnt signaling ( figure 1b and ) .colon cancer cells express unique proteins ( such as l1-cam and the phosphorylated form of the nuclear factor - kappa b [ nf-b ] subunit , p-65-p ) not found in the more differentiated areas of the tumor .( a and b ) serial tissue sections showed staining ( brown ) for l1-cam in the membrane of foremost invading cells ( a ) with marked nuclear staining of -catenin indicative of active wnt signaling ( b ) .( c and d ) serial sections displaying l1-cam in the invasive cells ( c ) and in the nuclei of the same cells that are positive for p-65-p , indicative of signaling by nf-b ( d ) . both the emt and csc concepts address key aspects of carcinogenesis , and mani et al.   showed that they can be linked to each other . by overexpressing the major emt regulators snail and twist inimmortalized human mammary epithelial cells , they induced an emt - like state ( decreased e - cadherin and increased expression of mesenchymal markers ) and showed that these cells had an increased ability to form mammospheres ( balls of non - adherent cells capable of differentiation ) , a property normally associated with mammary epithelial stem cells .they isolated cell populations from mouse mammary glands , human reduction mammoplasty tissues , and mammary carcinomas that express stem cell markers ( cd44/cd24 ) , and demonstrated that these cells also display mesenchymal markers .their ability to isolate mesenchymal - like breast cells from normal breast tissue , without evidence for tumors or metastases , points to the inherent plasticity of adult epithelial tissue cells , and shows that normal adult stem cells that underwent an emt are similar to mesenchymal stem cells .the epithelial phenotype is easily amenable to manipulation in both non - transformed   and carcinoma cells   by simply changing the density of cell cultures , further demonstrating the plasticity of epithelial cells . supporting a link between emt and cscs in mouse mammary tumors , the homeobox transcription factor six1 ( when activated in transgenic mice ) induced an emt - like conversion and caused mammary gland cancer by increasing the population of cells displaying csc markers , and included the activation of wnt/-catenin signaling .another exciting advance involves the description of new roles for e - cadherin in cancer progression .transgenic mice with conditionally disrupted e - cadherin function in type ii alveolar epithelial cells were crossed with mice that form benign lung adenomas due to a ras mutation .disruption of e - cadherin in the offsprings induced invasive carcinoma that metastasized into regional lymph nodes and bone marrow and promoted angiogenesis .this revealed a novel function of e - cadherin in angiogenesis and in tumor progression .even more remarkably , the systemic spread of cancer cells was shown to be an early step in oncogenesis in mammary cancer .untransformed mouse mammary cells engineered to express inducible oncogenes were intravenously injected into mice , who subsequently developed pulmonary metastases after the cells had implanted in the lungs and the oncogenes were induced .thus , cell transformation in the primary tumor can be bypassed and is not required for metastasis . since breast cancer cells have been found in the circulation of patients with small , non - invasive tumors , these findings suggest that metastases may develop in vivo without a classic emt .another major change in our view of the way cancer develops is the realization that cancer cells are no longer considered the only player in cancer progression .the cancer microenvironment , including stromal fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and bone - marrow - derived inflammatory cells , interact with cancer cells to promote cell migration , invasion , and metastasis .for example , cysteine cathepsins secreted by tumor - associated macrophages cleave e - cadherin at the cancer cell surface and promote emt .also , cells in the cancer microenvironment often secrete metalloproteases that breakdown the ecm and allow cancer cell invasion .inflammation - associated signaling pathways play a key role in metastasis development . in some cancers ,tumor - associated fibroblasts express proinflammatory genes very early in the tumorigenic process , promoting macrophage recruitment , neovascularization , and tumor growth  all of which are abolished when nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf-b ) signaling is inhibited .nf-b signaling was shown to be essential in breast cancer development , where it stabilizes snail , a major emt regulator . in colon cancer , the l1-cam - mediated metastasis to the liver was blocked when nf-b signaling was inhibited ( figure 1d ) . finally , a recent study has linked cscs , emt , and the tumor microenvironment in colon cancer progression and metastasis .activation of wnt target genes ( demonstrated by nuclear -catenin localization [ figure 1b ] ) , was shown to be a marker for colon cscs , defined by a set of specific the co - culturing of myofibroblasts with such cscs prevented their differentiation and resulted in the loss of clonogenicity .moreover , differentiated colon cancer cells were reprogrammed to express csc markers and regained their tumorigenicity when stimulated with myofibroblast - derived factors , further emphasizing the plasticity of normal and cancer cell phenotypes .the most challenging aspect in the study of cancer progression is to develop models enabling the visualization of the dynamic three - dimensional interactions between cancer cells in vivo , similar to some models used to visualize cell motility during embryogenesis .pathologists rarely observe emt in cancer tissues , and the invading cells in the surrounding stroma appear epithelial and not mesenchymal , and for the most part do not express stem cell markers . the question is : have these cells undergone a the answer to this question is critical for a deeper understanding of the biology of cancer and remains one of the hotly debated issues in the cancer - emt field .controversy also surrounds the definition and identification of cscs , or tumor - initiating cells .cscs express a set of markers common to non - transformed stem cells , and when cscs are isolated and injected in small numbers they can initiate tumor formation in mice .other investigators have found that cscs can be isolated by the expression of cd markers , which change as the phenotype of the cancer cell alters ( i.e. , cells that metastasize express a different set of cd markers compared to those that do not metastasize ) . in both cases , it remains unclear from where cscs arise , how they are classified and identified , and whether they exist at all , not to mention what the functional significance of the cds may be .future studies on the link between cscs and the necessity of an emt - like process during cancer progression will undoubtedly remain an exciting research topic at the front of molecular cancer research in the near future .","answer":"understanding the progression of a primary cancer to the metastatic stage has been the focus of extensive research for years .  commonly accepted concepts in this process ( i.e. , that of genetic instability and loss of normal cellular constraints on growth and motility ) are well established .  other important paradigms , such as the necessary change from an epithelial cell phenotype displaying cell - cell adhesions to a singular and motile mesenchymal - like cell phenotype ( possibly derived from a stem cell - like cell ) via a process similar to epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) , are less well understood . in this review  we will address studies linking emt and cancer stem cells during cancer development and observations that are challenging these concepts ."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

We present examples using the DBLP data set.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Internet search engines have popularized the keyword-based search paradigm. While traditional database management systems offer powerful query languages, they do not allow keyword-based search. In this paper, we discuss DBXplorer, a system that enables keyword-based searches in relational databases.

G-CNNs use G-convolutions, a new type of layer that enjoys a substantially higher degree of weight sharing than regular convolution layers. G-convolutions increase the expressive capacity of the network without increasing the number of parameters. Group convolution layers are easy to use and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead for discrete groups generated by translations, reflections and rotations. G-CNNs achieve state of the art results on CIFAR10 and rotated MNIST.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: An affine invariant representation is constructed with a cascade of invariants, which preserves information for classification. A joint translation and rotation invariant representation of image patches is calculated with a scattering transform. It is implemented with a deep convolution network, which computes successive wavelet transforms and modulus non-linearities. Invariants to scaling, shearing and small deformations are calculated with linear operators in the scattering domain. State-of-the-art classification results are obtained over texture databases with uncontrolled viewing conditions.[3]: A wavelet scattering network computes a translation invariant image representation which is stable to deformations and preserves high-frequency information for classification. It cascades wavelet transform convolutions with nonlinear modulus and averaging operators. The first network layer outputs SIFT-type descriptors, whereas the next layers provide complementary invariant information that improves classification. The mathematical analysis of wavelet scattering networks explains important properties of deep convolution networks for classification. A scattering representation of stationary processes incorporates higher order moments and can thus discriminate textures having the same Fourier power spectrum. State-of-the-art classification results are obtained for handwritten digits and texture discrimination, with a Gaussian kernel SVM and a generative PCA classifier.","answer":"Scattering convolution networks use wavelet convolutions, nonlinearities and group averaging to produce stable invariants [3] . Scattering networks have been extended to use convolutions on the group of translations, rotations and scalings, and have been applied to object and texture recognition [2] [1] ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Please write an abstract for this paper. Your response should include the abstract and no additional text.Paper text:it has been known for a long time that the pion vector form factor ( vff ) in the space - like region is very well described by a monopole ansatz of the type given by vector meson dominance ( vmd ) in terms of the rho meson .however , it has remained unclear whether there is a good reason for this from qcd or it is just a mere coincidence and , consequently , it is not known how to go about improving on this ansatz .    to begin our discussion ,let us define the form factor , @xmath0 , by the matrix element @xmath1 where @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 corresponds to space - like data .since the spectral function for the corresponding dispersive integral for @xmath4 starts at twice the pion mass , the form factor can be approximated by a taylor expansion in powers of the momentum for @xmath5 . at low momentum ,chiral perturbation theory is the best tool for organizing the pion interaction in a systematic expansion in powers of momenta and quark masses  @xcite . with every order in the expansion, there comes a new set of coupling constants , the so - called low - energy constants ( lecs ) , which encode all the qcd physics from higher energies .this means , in particular , that the coefficients in the taylor expansion can be expressed in terms of these lecs and powers of the quark masses .consequently , by learning about the low - energy expansion , one may indirectly extract important information about qcd .    in principle, the coefficients in the taylor expansion may be obtained by means of a polynomial fit to the experimental data in the space - like region   production experiments and , consequently , they necessarily correspond to values of the momentum above the @xmath6 cut , i.e. @xmath7 with @xmath8 . ] below @xmath9 .however , such a polynomial fit implies a tradeoff .although , in order to decrease the ( systematic ) error of the truncated taylor expansion , it is clearly better to go to a low - momentum region , this also downsizes the set of data points included in the fit which , in turn , increases the ( statistical ) error .in order to achieve a smaller statistical error one would have to include experimental data from higher energies , i.e. from @xmath10 . since this is not possible in a polynomial fit, the use of alternative mathematical descriptions may be a better strategy .one such description , which includes time - like data as well , is based on the use of the roy equations and omns dispersion relations .this is the avenue followed by @xcite , which has already produced interesting results on the scalar channel @xcite , and which can also be applied to the vector channel .other procedures have relied on conformal transformations for the joint analysis of both time - like and space - like data  @xcite , or subtracted omns relations  @xcite .further analyses may be found in ref .@xcite .    on the other hand , as already mentioned above , one may also consider an ansatz of the type @xmath11 even though the simplicity of the form of eq .( [ vmd ] ) is quite astonishing , it reproduces the space - like data rather well , even for a range of momentum of the order of a few gev , i.e. @xmath12 .if this fact is not merely a fluke , it could certainly be interesting to consider the form ( [ vmd ] ) as the first step in a systematic approximation , which would then allow improvement on this vmd ansatz .    in this article , we would like to point out that the previous vmd ansatz for the form factor ( [ vmd ] ) can be viewed as the first element in a sequence of pad approximants ( pas ) which can be constructed in a systematic way . by considering higher - order terms in the sequence ,one may be able to describe the space - like data with an increasing level of accuracy  .of course , whether this is actually the case and the sequence is a convergent one in the strict mathematical sense or , on the contrary , the sequence eventually diverges , remains to be seen .but the important difference with respect to the traditional vmd approach is that , as a pad sequence , the approximation is well - defined and can be systematically improved upon .    although polynomial fitting is more common , in general , rational approximants ( i.e. ratios of two polynomials ) are able to approximate the original function in a much broader range in momentum than a polynomial  @xcite. this will be the great advantage of the pads compared to other methods : they allow the inclusion of low and high energy information in a rather simple way which , furthermore , can in principle be systematically improved upon . in certain cases , like when the form factor obeys a dispersion relation given in terms of a positive definite spectral function ( i.e. becomes a stieltjes function ) , it is known that the pad sequence is convergent everywhere on the complex plane , except on the physical cut @xcite .another case of particular interest is in the limit of an infinite number of colors in which the form factor becomes a meromorphic function . in this casethere is also a theorem which guarantees convergence of the pad sequence everywhere in a compact region of the complex plane , except perhaps at a finite number of points ( which include the poles in the spectrum contained in that region ) @xcite . in the real world, in which a general form factor has a complicated analytic structure with a cut , and whose spectral function is not positive definite , we do not know of any mathematical result assuring the convergence of a pad sequence @xcite .one just has to try the approximation on the data to learn what happens .in this work we have found that , to the precision allowed by the experimental data , there are sequences of pas which improve on the lowest order vmd result in a rather systematic way .this has allowed us to extract the values of the lowest - order coefficients of the low - energy expansion .we would like to emphasize that , strictly speaking , the pad approximants to a given function are ratios of two polynomials @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( with degree @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) , constructed such that the taylor expansion around the origin exactly coincides with that of @xmath17 up to the highest possible order , i.e. @xmath18 . however , in our case the taylor coefficients are not known .they are , in fact , the information we are seeking for .our strategy will consist in determining these coefficients by a least - squares fit of a pad approximant to the vector form factor data in the space - like region .there are several types of pas that may be considered . in order to achieve a fast numerical convergence ,the choice of which one to use is largely determined by the analytic properties of the function to be approximated . in this regard , a glance at the time - like data of the pion form factor makes it obvious that the form factor is clearly dominated by the rho meson contribution .the effect of higher resonance states , although present , is much more suppressed . in these circumstancesthe natural choice is a @xmath19 pad sequence  @xcite , i.e. the ratio of a polynomial of degree @xmath20 over a polynomial of degree one  .notice that , from this perspective , the vmd ansatz in ( [ vmd ] ) is nothing but the @xmath21 pad approximant .    however , to test the aforementioned single - pole dominance , one should check the degree to which the contribution from resonances other than the rho may be neglected . consequently , we have also considered the sequence @xmath22 , and the results confirm those found with the pas @xmath19 .furthermore , for completeness , we have also considered the so - called pad - type approximants ( pts )  @xcite .these are rational approximants whose poles are predetermined at some fixed values , which we take to be the physical masses since they are known .notice that this is different from the case of the ordinary pas , whose poles are left free and determined by the fit . finally ,we have also considered an intermediate case , the so - called partial - pad approximants ( pps )  @xcite , in which some of the poles are predetermined ( again at the physical masses ) and some are left free .we have fitted all these versions of rational approximants to all the available pion vff space - like data  @xcite-@xcite .the result of the fit is rather independent of the kind of rational approximant sequence used and all the results show consistency among themselves .the structure of this letter is the following . in section[ sec : model ] we begin by testing the efficiency of the @xmath23 pads with the help of a model . in section [ sec : ff ] we apply this very same method to the experimental vff .firstly , in sec .[ sec : pal1 ] , we use the pad approximants @xmath23 ; then , in sec .[ sec : pal2 ] , this result is cross - checked with a @xmath24 pa . finally , in sec .[ sec : ptpp ] , we study the pad - type and partial - pad approximants . the outcome of these analyses is combined in section  [ sec : results ] and some conclusions are extracted .in order to illustrate the usefulness of the pas as fitting functions in the way we propose here , we will first use a phenomenological model as a theoretical laboratory to check our method .furthermore , the model will also give us an idea about the size of possible systematic uncertainties .we will consider a vff phase - shift with the right threshold behavior and with approximately the physical values of the rho mass and width .the form - factor is recovered through a once - subtracted omns relation , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , which plays the role of the vector form factor phase - shift  @xcite , is given by @xmath27 ,  ] ] with the @xmath28-dependent width given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .the input parameters are chosen to be close to their physical values : @xmath31 we emphasize that the model defined by the expressions ( [ model]-[width ] ) should be considered as quite realistic .in fact , it has been used in ref .@xcite for extracting the values for the physical mass and width of the rho meson through a direct fit to the ( timelike ) experimental data .    expanding @xmath4 in eq .( [ model ] ) in powers of @xmath32 we readily obtain @xmath33 with known values for the coefficients @xmath34 . in what follows , we will use eq .( [ expmodel ] ) as the definition of the coefficients @xmath34 . to try to recreate the situation of the experimental data  @xcite-@xcite with the model , we have generated fifty \`\` data '' points in the region @xmath35 , thirty data points in the interval @xmath36 , and seven points for @xmath37 ( all these momenta in units of gev@xmath38 ) .these points are taken with vanishing error bars since our purpose here is to estimate the systematic error derived purely from our approximate description of the form factor .we have fitted a sequence of pad approximants @xmath39 to these data points and , upon expansion of the pads around @xmath40 , we have used them to predict the values of the coefficients @xmath34 .the comparison may be found in table  [ table1 ] .the last pa we have fitted to these data is @xmath41 .notice that the pole position of the pads differs from the true mass of the model , given in eq .( [ param ] ) ..results of the various fits to the form factor @xmath4 in the model , eq .( [ model ] ) .the exact values for the coefficients @xmath34 in eq .( [ expmodel ] ) are given on the last column .the last row shows the predictions for the corresponding pole for each pad ( @xmath42 ) , to be compared to the true mass @xmath43gev@xmath38 in the model .

(2018) studied LSTMs with fully saturated weights (i.e. the activation functions evaluate to their asymptotic values instead of intermediate rational values) and showed that such models can express simplified counter languages.Merrill (2019) , on the other hand, showed that the general counter languages are an upper bound on the expressive capacity of saturated LSTMs.Thus, there seems to be a strong theoretical connection between LSTMs and the counter automata.Merrill (2019) ; Suzgun et al. (2019) ; Weiss et al. (2018) also all report experimental results suggesting that some class of counter languages matches the learnable capacity of LSTMs trained by gradient descent.Taking the counter machine as a simplified formal model of the LSTM, we study the formal properties of counter machines as grammars.We do this with the hope of understanding to what degree counter machines, and LSTMs by extension, have computational properties well-suited for representing the structure of natural language.The contributions of this paper are as follows:â¢ We prove that general counter machines, incremental counter machines, and stateless counter machines have equivalent expressive capacity, whereas simplified counter machines (Weiss et al., 2018) are strictly weaker than the general class.â¢ We demonstrate that counter languages are closed under complement, union, intersection, and many other common operations.â¢ We show that counter machines are incapable of representing the deep syntactic structure or semantics of boolean expressions, even though they can validate whether a boolean expression is well-formed.â¢ We prove that a certain subclass of the counter languages are semilinear, and conjecture that this result holds for all counter languages.We have shown that many variants of the counter machine converge to express the same class of formal languages, which supports that CL is a robustly defined class.We also proved that real-time counter languages are closed under a large number of common set operations.This provides tools for future work investigating real-time counter automata.We also showed that counter automata are incapable of evaluating boolean expressions, even though they are capable of verifying that boolean expressions are syntactically well-formed.This result has a clear parallel in the domain of natural language, where deciding whether a sentence is grammatical is a different task than representing its deep syntactic or semantic structure.A general take-away from our results is that just because a counter machine (or LSTM) is sensitive to surface patterns in linguistic data does not mean it can build correct semantic representations.Counter memory can be exploited to weakly match patterns in language, which might provide the wrong kinds of inductive bias for achieving sophisticated natural language understanding.Finally, we asked whether counter languages are semilinear as another way of studying their linguistic capacity.We concluded only that a quite weak subclass of the counter languages are semilinear, and encourage future work to address the general case.","answer":"We study the class of formal languages acceptable by real-time counter automata, a model of computation related to some types of recurrent neural networks."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Protein S deficiency is a recognized risk factor for venous thrombosis. Of all the inherited thrombophilic conditions, it remains the most difficult to diagnose because of phenotypic variability, which can lead to inconclusive results. We have overcome this problem by studying a cohort of patients from a single center where the diagnosis was confirmed at the genetic level. Twenty-eight index patients with protein S deficiency and a PROS1 gene defect were studied, together with 109 first-degree relatives. To avoid selection bias, we confined analysis of total and free protein S levels and thrombotic risk to the patients relatives. In this group of relatives, a low free protein S level was the most reliable predictor of a PROS1 gene defect (sensitivity 97. 7%, specificity 100%). First-degree relatives with a PROS1 gene defect had a 5. 0-fold higher risk of thrombosis (95% confidence interval, 1. 5-16. 8) than those with a normal PROS1 gene and no other recognized thrombophilic defect. Although pregnancy/puerperium and immobility/trauma were important precipitating factors for thrombosis, almost half of the events were spontaneous. Relatives with splice-site or major structural defects in the PROS1 gene were more likely to have had a thrombotic event and had significantly lower total and free protein S levels than those relatives having missense mutations. We conclude that persons with PROS1 gene defects and protein S deficiency are at increased risk of thrombosis and that free protein S estimation offers the most reliable way of diagnosing the deficiency.

We recently published on this topic which we term \\"Supply Centered Synthesis\\" (SCS) of API. 4 We examined this topic of supply chain security within the construct of Remdesivir's pyrrolotriazine synthesis (Fig. 1). The triazine passes through several low yielding steps, and as an early raw material, large quantities are required. We wondered if a preferred route could help overcome recent challenges related to supply and price. The only full route to the base triazine 1 was published by Bayer Healthcare 5,6 despite the biological importance of the pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine framework. 7 The sequence above nicely supplied preparative quantities of triazine (50 g scale); however, some aspects of the route warrant improvement.</p><p>1. The yield is 31% over four steps. Increasing yield would decrease consumption of raw materials.</p><p>2. Hydrazine is protected as a carbazate, and then carbamate 2 must be deprotected to reveal amine 3. This creates mass inefficiency, adds to the step-count, and decreases overall yield. 3. 2,5-Dimethoxytetrahydrofuran and tert-butyl carbazate are not commodity materials. 2,5-Dimethoxytetrahydrofuran is made in 2-steps from furan. 8 tert-Butyl carbazate is made in 4 chemical steps from tert-butanol and ammonia. 9 Derivatizing commodities requires additional chemical processing and creates waste. The ideal synthesis would increase overall yield, proceed from commodity materials, and reduce step-count, thus strengthening the remdesivir supply chain. This work describes efforts to do so from pyrrole which is abundant and made commercially in 1 step from furan, 11 Formyl groups are easily installed in the 2-position of pyrroles, 12 and aldehydes can be oxidized to nitriles via aldoxime intermediates. 13 Moreover, N-amination of pyrroles and indoles, though challenging, are known. 14 The hypothetical synthesis would intercept the penultimate intermediate 3 at this point, and the demonstrated literature condensation with formamidine acetate would render triazine 1. One could foresee how these transformation could be executed with reagents having high atom efficiency and market availability. Perhaps efficiency could be further increased by reducing the step-count and thus eliminating associated workups.  This effort began with functionalization of pyrrole (Fig. 2). We wondered whether isolation of the aldehyde or aldoxime intermediate was necessary. 2-Formyl pyrrole is a low melting solid not easily distilled or recrystallized in good yield. Moreover, waste will be generated in the process of purifying the aldehyde, aldoxime or other intermediates. Perhaps the iminium chloride salt could be used directly to form nitrile 4 in a one-pot process. Residual POCl3 and related species would need to be quenched due to chemical incompatibility with hydroxylamine; however, the HCl generated in the course of the quench could be used as catalyst for the dehydration of aldoxime. 15 This concept was validated experimentally with surprising simplicity by adding water or ethanol prior to adding the hydroxylamine salt to give the product in >80% AY (Entries 1-2). A recent paper nicely demonstrated use of DMPUâ¢HCl as a key additive, but in our case, DMF as solvent worked sufficiently well. 15c The yield was further improved to 90% AY by activating the oxime formed in situ with acetic anhydride and base (Entries 3-6). Distillation provided pure material for downstream investigations (Entries 8-9). There are very few examples of one-pot nitrile formation via strategies that make use of an oxidative Vilsmeier cascade. 16 This avoids the use of costly and high molecular weight iodine.</p>II: Assessing Amination Feasibility<p>The conditions of Hynes Jr. were used as a starting point to explore the critical amination (Fig. 3). Chloramine was made from bleach and ammonia then extracted into MTBE. Pyrrole 4 converted cleanly to the N-amino product (95% AY) despite reports of moderate yield. 14b,17 This serves as a drop-in replacement for 3 and improves yield to 88% as compared to 41% by the literature route. Unfortunately the reaction conditions are highly dilute (1 wt%) as a function of extracting monochloramine from water into MTBE, thus limiting overall throughput and jeopardizing supply. For this reason, we sought strategies which would increase throughput of N-amino-2-cyanopyrrole. This was also the likely Figure 3: Clean amination of pyrrole from bleach and ammonia under highly dilute conditions. conclusion of Bristol Myers Squibb, whose subsequent disclosures focused on improved efficiencies via in situ chloramine production in a biphasic mixture 18 and production of gaseous chloramine to negate the need for dilute organic solution. 19 We did not have success with the biphasic conditions and did not have access to the degree of engineering required for gaseous chloramine generation; however use of solid aminating reagents such as O-(4-Nitrobenzoyl)hydroxylamine provided a means to run reactions at 15-20 volumes, thus greatly increasing product throughput. 20 This reagent has been used at scale; 14d however, neither aminating reagent is available at commodity levels, they are not atom efficient, and there are safety concerns with use of these reagents at increasing temperatures and concentrations. 21 We thus focused on producing solutions to complement these existing strategies.</p>III: Increasing Amination Space-Time Yield<p>The remainder of our investigation centered on use of monochloramine. It is an optimal reagent to install the nitrogen atom because atom efficiency is high, and it is made from simple ingredients which can be accessed anywhere in the world, bleach and ammonia. To render monochloramine accessible, the volumes of extraction solvent (MTBE) must be mitigated. We sought better understanding of chloramine preparation and use, and produced 0.5-0.9 M NH2Cl/MTBE solutions which were five to ten times stronger than the reported value. Our study suggested that the literature procedure added NH2Cl in four-fold excess. Decreasing chloramine equivalents would greatly increase concentration by reducing MTBE consumption.</p><p>Probing the relationship between base and chloramine equivalents showed an interdependent nature, where as much chloramine as base is required (Fig. 4). Perhaps this is due to the acidic nature of chloramine which has an estimated pKa of 14. With 1.25 equivalents of base and 0.5 M NH2Cl, 25 volumes of MTBE are needed. In theory this can be decreased to a minimum of 17 volumes with a 0.9 M NH2Cl and 1.1 equivalents of NaH, which is an 80% reduction in solvent usage. Still, dilution remains at levels higher than desired.</p><p>Perhaps, an effectively high concentration \\"gaseous\\" form of chloramine can be accessed by recycling MTBE solvent (Fig. 4). The reagent can be considered gaseous because at the extreme, infinite recycle of MTBE, only chloramine, a gas, is consumed. Addition of chloramine in fractional charges with subsequent evaporation and recycle of MTBE would seem to present one such option for achieving that aim. With this strategy in mind, the chloramine was added to 4 in four portions of 10 volumes with the MTBE removed and reused at the end of each addition. The effective chloramine concentration becomes 2.0 M rather than 0.5 M. Assay yields of 3 matched those of the original procedure, and the total reaction volume was limited to 15 volumes (10 MTBE, 5 DMF)  with an end-point of 5 volumes and 20 wt% pyrrole in DMF. Effective cycle time for this operation can be achieved because MTBE is easily removed from reaction solution due to its low boiling point (55 ãC), and because the amination of pyrrole is very rapid, occurring in less than 5 minutes. This presents a reasonable path toward manufacturing, and 90% of solvent was recycled. Aminated pyrrole was made in 90% assay yield, and this result was scaled 100x to 10 g without change in performance. We concluded our amination investigation by addressing the hazards surrounding use of NaH in conjunction with DMF. 20,23</p>IV: On-Demand Chloramine<p>Even with a solution to the challenge of running dilute electrophilic aminations and despite the advantages of monochloramine, preparation and use of NH2Cl at scale poses further practical challenges. The reagent needs to be made on site as it is not available for purchase. One reason for the lack of market presence is likely a result of the limited half-life of chloramine which is on the order of days, 22 and also the difficulty in controlling titer of chloramine solutions. Chloramine is a dissolved gas and has a tendency to ef-fervesce out of solution. The need for onsite production would require a very large storage tank to hold the NH2Cl/MTBE solutionup to 40 reaction volumes are required.</p><p>Production of a chloramine generator 24 via continuous processing presents a solution for on-demand production, reagent instability, and solvent recycle (Fig. 5). Creation of a captive solvent recycle loop prevents build up of large solvent volumes which can limit space time yield. Further, continuous chloramine generation fits within a semi-continuous amination motif which benefits from frequent volume reduction via application of vacuum. High concentration aqueous chloramine solutions have been produced for on-site water treatment and manufacturing via a continuous stirredtank reactor (CSTR) at concentrations up to 2 M. 25 To demonstrate proof of concept, all that is needed is to modify the conditions of Hynes for continuous synthesis and separation. Chloramine was simultaneously made and extracted into MTBE in a CSTR with a 10 minute residence time. This biphasic mixture flowed into a gravity separator. Steady-state was reached within 30 minutes, and titration of the MTBE layer showed that ~0.45 M chloramine was produced as compared to 0.52 M solution as made in batch. The on-demand NH2Cl solution was flowed into a pot containing a solution of deprotonated pyrrole 4 in DMF. The system was placed under occasional vacuum to keep the reaction volume at a minimal level by splitting the charge of chloramine into four portions. The MTBE was collected by condensation in a separate pot, and then recycled to extract more chloramine. The total recycle rate of MTBE was 80-89%, and pyrrole 4 was aminated in 94% AY (1 g, 10 g scales). Optionally, the amination can also be conducted in flow. This demonstrates proof of concept for a chloramine generator which helps overcome throughput issues related to dilute aminations.</p>VI: Amination and Triazine Formation in One-Pot<p>For efficiency's sake we elected to telescope the synthesis through to the triazine rather than isolate at this stage (Fig. 6). Our prior experience with hydroxypropyl adenine (HPA) suggested that DMF might be a good solvent for the condensation reaction of the amino nitrile with formamidinium acetate. 26 Formamidine acetate was added to the amination reaction mixture and heated to form the triazine with this thought in mind. This provided material in 75% AY over two steps. A quick solubility study suggested that water or MTBE would be appropriate antisolvents. In situ concentration of reaction mixture followed by addition of water afforded the desired triazine in 60% IY over two steps.</p>â  Conclusions<p>This work describes an efficient means to produce the aminotriazine required for manufacturing remdesivir. Importantly, the synthesis makes use of highly abundant materials to bolster supply chain security. It is expected that these common materials will decrease costs associated with chemical inputs, an important objectives given concerns around remdesivir supply and price. The synthesis has high atom economy and avoids derivatization and protecting groups. Yield is approximately doubled over the prior procedure described for the triazine while step count is cut in half. This should facilitate improved throughput of this important API intermediate. The chemical solution involves a novel one-pot cascade for nitrile formation, avoiding generation and isolation of aldehyde as an intermediate. Further, the work presents a solution to the challenge of limited space time yield posed by highly dilute electrophilic amination conditions and enables access to non-commercial monochloramine, an atom efficient and desirable reagent.</p>","answer":"Pyrrolotriazine 1 is an important precursor to Remdesivir, and an efficient synthesis is disclosed. This route features atom economy and reduced derivatization of starting materials, by making use of highly abundant, commoditized raw material inputs. The yield of triazine was doubled from 31% to 59%, and the synthetic step count was reduced from 4 to 2. A one-pot cascade sequence was developed for direct cyanation of pyrrole. Amination and cyclization with formamidine acetate complete the synthesis. The problematic nature of typically dilute electrophilic aminations was solved with semi-continuous processing. Moreover, development of a continuous platform afforded access to the ideal yet non-commercial aminating reagent, monochloramine. These efforts help to secure the Remdesivir supply chain."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

As evidenced by the COVID-19 global pandemic, however, halting the spread of highly contagious diseases is notoriously difficult. Successful control strategies therefore have to rely on effective surveillance. Here, we describe how monitoring wastewater from urban areas can be used to detect the arrival and subsequent decline of pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. As the amount of virus shed in faeces and urine varies largely from person to person, it is very difficult to quantitatively determine the number of people who are infected in the population. More research on the surveillance of viruses in wastewater using accurate and validated methods, as well as subsequent risk analysis and modelling is paramount in understanding the dynamics of viral outbreaks.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The malignant cells of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) contain a reciprocal chromosomal translocation that fuses the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RAR alpha). To test the hypothesis that the chimera PMLRAR alpha plays a role in leukemogenesis, we expressed a PMLRAR alpha cDNA in myeloid cells of transgenic mice. PMLRAR alpha transgenic mice exhibited impaired neutrophil maturation early in life, which progressed at a low frequency over the course of several months to overt APL. Both the preleukemic state and the leukemia could be transplanted to nontransgenic mice, and the transplanted preleukemia could progress to APL. The APL recapitulated features of the human disease, including a response to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid caused the leukemic cells to differentiate in vitro and in vivo, eliciting remissions of both the preleukemic state and APL in mice. Our results demonstrate that PMLRAR alpha impairs neutrophil differentiation and initiates the development of APL. The transgenic mice described here provide an apparently accurate model for human APL that includes clear evidence of tumor progression. The model should be useful for exploring the molecular pathogenesis of APL and the mechanisms of the therapeutic response to retinoic acid, as well as for preclinical studies of therapeutic regimens.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"myeloid cells\\", \\"leukemic cells\\", \\"malignant cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"retinoic acid\\", \\"PMLRARalpha transgene\\", \\"PMLRAR alpha cDNA\\", \\"retinoic acid receptor alpha gene\\", \\"Retinoic acid\\", \\"promyelocytic leukemia gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"RAR alpha\\", \\"PMLRAR alpha\\", \\"chimera PMLRAR alpha\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Classical Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). We isolated several mutant PAH cDNA clones from a PKU carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion, corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal PAH gene. The deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 52 amino acids. Gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant PAH cDNA indicated that the deletion abolishes PAH activity in the cell as a result of protein instability. To determine the molecular basis of the deletion, the mutant chromosomal PAH gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a GT-- greater than AT substitution at the 5 splice donor site of intron 12. Thus, the consequence of the splice donor site mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during RNA splicing..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase\\", \\"phenylketonuria\\", \\"autosomal recessive human genetic disorder\\", \\"Classical Phenylketonuria\\", \\"PKU\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those institutions without such facilities or 2019-nCoV. This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2V uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2V infection. The anti-viral activities and anti-viral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs, including cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 mumol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 mumol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 mumol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 +/- 0.02] x 10vs. 1.00 +/- 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 mumol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP had potent anti-viral activities against both viral entry (0.46 +/- 0.12, vs.1.00 +/- 0.37, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication ([6.18 +/- 0.95] x 10vs. 1.00 +/- 0.43, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and further study of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

In this study we investigated whether also glycine fulfils the function as co-activator in glutamatergic activation of NMDA receptors in the neuronal apparatus of spontaneous motility in chick embryos. The successive application of glycine (5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight (e.w.) and glutamate (15 mg/kg e.w.) The successive application of glycine (5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight (e.w.) and glutamate (15 mg/kg e.w.) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of glutamate alone. This effect did not depend on the order of application of the drugs. In 13-day-old embryos, glycine was ineffective in both doses. It is concluded from these results that the modulatory effect of glycine is evidently a later developmental acquisition (after day 15 of incubation) in the embryogenesis of NMDA-ergic activation of spontaneous motility in chick embryos similarly as glycinergic inhibition.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"glycine\\", \\"glutamate\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Convergence at a linear rate is guaranteed when the following hold: (i) dimensions of hidden layers are at least the minimum of the input and output dimensions; (ii) weight matrices at initialization are approximately balanced; and (iii) the initial loss is smaller than the loss of any rank-deficient solution.  The assumptions on initialization (conditions (ii) and (iii)) are necessary, in the sense that violating any one of them may lead to convergence failure.  Moreover, in the important case of output dimension 1, i.e. scalar regression, they are met, and thus convergence to global optimum holds, with constant probability under a random initialization scheme.  Our results significantly extend previous analyses, e.g., of deep linear residual networks (Bartlett et al., 2018).Deep learning builds upon the mysterious ability of gradient-based optimization methods to solve related non-convex problems.Immense efforts are underway to mathematically analyze this phenomenon.The prominent landscape approach focuses on special properties of critical points (i.e. points where the gradient of the objective function vanishes) that will imply convergence to global optimum.Several papers (e.g. Ge et al. (2015) ; Lee et al. (2016) ) have shown that (given certain smoothness properties) it suffices for critical points to meet the following two conditions:(i) no poor local minima -every local minimum is close in its objective value to a global minimum; and(ii) strict saddle property -every critical point that is not a local minimum has at least one negative eigenvalue to its Hessian.While condition(i) does not always hold (cf.Safran and Shamir (2018) ), it has been established for various simple settings (e.g. Soudry and Carmon (2016) ; Kawaguchi (2016) ).Condition(ii) on the other hand seems less plausible, and is in fact provably false for models with three or more layers (cf. Kawaguchi FORMULA1 ), i.e. for deep networks.It has only been established for problems involving shallow (two layer) models, e.g. matrix factorization (Ge et al. (2016) ; BID12 ).The landscape approach as currently construed thus suffers from inherent limitations in proving convergence to global minimum for deep networks.A potential path to circumvent this obstacle lies in realizing that landscape properties matter only in the vicinity of trajectories that can be taken by the optimizer, which may be a negligible portion of the overall parameter space.Several papers (e.g. Saxe et al. (2014) ; BID1 ) have taken this trajectory-based approach, primarily in the context of linear neural networks -fully-connected neural networks with linear activation.Linear networks are trivial from a representational perspective, but not so in terms of optimization -they lead to non-convex training problems with multiple minima and saddle points.Through a mix of theory and experiments, BID1 argued that such non-convexities may in fact be beneficial for gradient descent, in the sense that sometimes, adding (redundant) linear layers to a classic linear prediction model can accelerate the optimization.This phenomenon challenges the holistic landscape view, by which convex problems are always preferable to non-convex ones.Even in the linear network setting, a rigorous proof of efficient convergence to global minimum has proved elusive.One recent progress is the analysis of BID3 for linear residual networks -a particular subclass of linear neural networks in which the input, output and all hidden dimensions are equal, and all layers are initialized to be the identity matrix (cf.Hardt and Ma (2016) ).Through a trajectory-based analysis of gradient descent minimizing 2 loss over a whitened dataset (see Section 2), BID3 show that convergence to global minimum at a linear rateloss is less than > 0 after O(log 1 ) iterations -takes place if one of the following holds:(i) the objective value at initialization is sufficiently close to a global minimum; or(ii) a global minimum is attained when the product of all layers is positive definite.The current paper carries out a trajectory-based analysis of gradient descent for general deep linear neural networks, covering the residual setting of BID3 , as well as many more settings that better match practical deep learning.Our analysis draws upon the trajectory characterization of BID1 for gradient flow (infinitesimally small learning rate), together with significant new ideas necessitated due to discrete updates.Ultimately, we show that when minimizing 2 loss of a deep linear network over a whitened dataset, gradient descent converges to the global minimum, at a linear rate, provided that the following conditions hold:(i) the dimensions of hidden layers are greater than or equal to the minimum between those of the input and output;(ii) layers are initialized to be approximately balanced (see Definition 1) -this is met under commonplace near-zero, as well as residual (identity) initializations; and(iii) the initial loss is smaller than any loss obtainable with rank deficiencies -this condition will hold with probability close to 0.5 if the output dimension is 1 (scalar regression) and standard (random) near-zero initialization is employed.Our result applies to networks with arbitrary depth and input/output dimensions, as well as any configuration of hidden layer widths that does not force rank deficiency (i.e. that meets condition(i)).The assumptions on initialization (conditions(ii) and(iii)) are necessary, in the sense that violating any one of them may lead to convergence failure.Moreover, in the case of scalar regression, they are met with constant probability under a random initialization scheme.We are not aware of any similarly general analysis for efficient convergence of gradient descent to global minimum in deep learning.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.In Section 2 we present the problem of gradient descent training a deep linear neural network by minimizing the 2 loss over a whitened dataset.Section 3 formally states our assumptions, and presents our convergence analysis.Key ideas brought forth by our analysis are demonstrated empirically in Section 4.Section 5 gives a review of relevant literature, including a detailed comparison of our results against those of BID3 .Finally, Section 6 concludes.For deep linear neural networks, we have rigorously proven convergence of gradient descent to global minima, at a linear rate, provided that the initial weight matrices are approximately balanced and the initial end-to-end matrix has positive deficiency margin.The result applies to networks with arbitrary depth, and any configuration of input/output/hidden dimensions that supports full rank, i.e. in which no hidden layer has dimension smaller than both the input and output.Our assumptions on initialization -approximate balancedness and deficiency margin -are both necessary, in the sense that violating any one of them may lead to convergence failure, as we demonstrated explicitly.Moreover, for networks with output dimension 1 (scalar regression), we have shown that a balanced initialization, i.e. a random choice of the end-to-end matrix followed by a balanced partition across all layers, leads assumptions to be met, and thus convergence to take place, with constant probability.Rigorously proving efficient convergence with significant probability under customary layer-wise independent initialization remains an open problem.The recent work of Shamir (2018) suggests that this may not be possible, as at least in some settings, the number of iterations required for convergence is exponential in depth with overwhelming probability.This negative result, a theoretical manifestation of the \\"vanishing gradient problem\\", is circumvented by balanced initialization.Through simple experiments we have shown that the latter can lead to favorable convergence in deep learning practice, as it does in theory.Further investigation of balanced initialization, including development of variants for convolutional layers, is regarded as a promising direction for future research.The analysis in this paper uncovers special properties of the optimization landscape in the vicinity of gradient descent trajectories.We expect similar ideas to prove useful in further study of gradient descent on non-convex objectives, including training losses of deep non-linear neural networks.A 2

regression), and shows that if the standard deviation of initialization is sufficiently small, with probability close to 0.5, a deficiency margin will be met.However, for this deficiency margin to meet a chosen threshold c, the standard deviation need be sufficiently large.Claim 3.There is a constant C 1 > 0 such that the following holds.Consider the case where DISPLAYFORM3 13 and suppose all entries in the matrices W j â R dj Ãdjâ1 , j = 1, . . . , N , are drawn independently at random from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero, whose standard deviation s > 0 is small with respect

requirement d0 â¥ 20 is purely technical, designed to simplify expressions in the claim.14 The probability 0.49 can be increased to any p < 1/2 by increasing the constant 10 5 in the upper bounds for s and c.15It is not difficult to see that the latter threshold is never greater than the upper bound for s, thus sought-after standard deviations always exist.","answer":"We analyze gradient descent

Tocilizumab may represent a new early effective second-line treatment option in corticosteroid-resistant anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.Tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis with corticosteroid-resistant progressive anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab, received weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper was superior to either 26-week or 52-week prednisone tapering plus placebo with regard to sustained glucocorticoid-free remission in patients with giant-cell arteritis. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine the durability of remission and safety of tocilizumab.Two RCTs have evidenced the efficacy of tocilizumab in addition to glucocorticoids (GCs) in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA).Recent randomized placebo-controlled trials have reported on the efficacy and safety of abatacept and mostly tocilizumab in inducing and maintaining remission of GCA.If a biological therapy is indicated, and in light of the data discussed in this review, the first choice would be tocilizumab in GCA and anti-TNF-Î± agents (mainly infliximab) in TAK.CONCLUSION: TCZ is effective in GCA.TNF-Î± blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis.A favorable outcome was rapidly observed both on clinical and biological data allowing a corticoid therapy sparing.<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: Tocilizumab is a promising treatment of giant cell arteritis but controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy.<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b>: Treatment of giant cell arteritis is based on prolonged corticosteroid therapy but adverse side effects are common especially in the elderly.<br><b>CASE REPORTS</b>: We report three patients with giant cell vasculitis treated by tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antibody, owing to resistance or intolerance to corticosteroid therapy.Several studies have reported that tocilizumab is effective for aortitis associated with Takayasu's arteritis and giant cell arteritis.TNF-Î± blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis.Preliminary clinical trial data suggest that abatacept and tocilizumab reduce the risk of relapse in GCA.Tocilizumab, an effective treatment for relapsing giant cell arteritis.TNF-Î± blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis.Tocilizumab is a promising treatment of giant cell arteritis but controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Although the liver is a cadmium-target organ, hepatocyte response involved in its toxicity is not yet elucidated. A link between this heavy metal treatment and Stat3 signaling pathways was examined in primary mouse hepatocytes. We provided evidence of a novel link among NADPH oxidase and Stat3 signaling, mediated by Src, EGFR, and Erk1/2. Cadmium activates NADPH oxidase. ROS produced by this oxidase activates Src, enable that in turn, transactivates EGFR that activates Stat3 in tyrosine, allowing its dimerization. Also, ROS from NADPH oxidase favors ERK1/2 activation that phosphorylates Stat3 in serine, resulting in a compensatory or adaptive survival response such as production of metallothionein-II in short Cd exposure times. However, after 12h CdCl2 treatment, cell viability diminished in 50%, accompanied by a drastic decrease of metallothionein-II production, and an increase in p53 activation and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.","answer":"[[\\"CdCl2\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"p53\\"], [\\"Cadmium\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"NADPH oxidase\\"], [\\"serine\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"Stat3\\"], [\\"CdCl2\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"Bax\\"], [\\"Cd\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"metallothionein-II\\"], [\\"CdCl2\\", \\"DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"metallothionein-II\\"], [\\"tyrosine\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"Stat3\\"]]"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Traditional Methods 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  We describe an object detection system based on mixtures of multiscale deformable part models. Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We present a novel boosting cascade based face detection framework using SURF features. The framework is derived from the well-known Viola-Jones (VJ) framework but distinguished by two key contributions. First, the proposed framework deals with only several hundreds of multidimensional local SURF patches instead of hundreds of thousands of single dimensional haar features in the VJ framework. Second, it takes AUC as a single criterion for the convergence test of each cascade stage rather than the two conflicting criteria (false-positive-rate and detection-rate) in the VJ framework. These modifications yield much faster training convergence and much fewer stages in the final cascade. We made experiments on training face detector from large scale database. Results shows that the proposed method is able to train face detectors within one hour through scanning billions of negative samples on current personal computers. Furthermore, the built detector is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithm not only on the accuracy but also on the processing speed. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  This paper addresses the problem of Face Alignment for a single image. We show how an ensemble of regression trees can be used to estimate the face's landmark positions directly from a sparse subset of pixel intensities, achieving super-realtime performance with high quality predictions. We present a general framework based on gradient boosting for learning an ensemble of regression trees that optimizes the sum of square error loss and naturally handles missing or partially labelled data. We show how using appropriate priors exploiting the structure of image data helps with efficient feature selection. Different regularization strategies and its importance to combat overfitting are also investigated. In addition, we analyse the effect of the quantity of training data on the accuracy of the predictions and explore the effect of data augmentation using synthesized data. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  We propose a method to address challenges in unconstrained face detection, such as arbitrary pose variations and occlusions. First, a new image feature called Normalized Pixel Difference (NPD) is proposed. NPD feature is computed as the difference to sum ratio between two pixel values, inspired by the Weber Fraction in experimental psychology. The new feature is scale invariant, bounded, and is able to reconstruct the original image. Second, we propose a deep quadratic tree to learn the optimal subset of NPD features and their combinations, so that complex face manifolds can be partitioned by the learned rules. This way, only a single soft-cascade classifier is needed to handle unconstrained face detection. Furthermore, we show that the NPD features can be efficiently obtained from a look up table, and the detection template can be easily scaled, making the proposed face detector very fast. Experimental results on three public face datasets (FDDB, GENKI, and CMU-MIT) show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting unconstrained faces with arbitrary pose variations and occlusions in cluttered scenes. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  We present a new state-of-the-art approach for face detection. The key idea is to combine face alignment with detection, observing that aligned face shapes provide better features for face classification. To make this combination more effective, our approach learns the two tasks jointly in the same cascade framework, by exploiting recent advances in face alignment. Such joint learning greatly enhances the capability of cascade detection and still retains its realtime performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy on challenging datasets, where all existing solutions are either inaccurate or too slow. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Face detection is a mature problem in computer vision. While diverse high performing face detectors have been proposed in the past, we present two surprising new top performance results. First, we show that a properly trained vanilla DPM reaches top performance, improving over commercial and research systems. Second, we show that a detector based on rigid templates - similar in structure to the Viola&Jones detector - can reach similar top performance on this task. Importantly, we discuss issues with existing evaluation benchmark and propose an improved procedure. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  Face detection has drawn much attention in recent decades since the seminal work by Viola and Jones. While many subsequences have improved the work with more powerful learning algorithms, the feature representation used for face detection still canât meet the demand for effectively and efficiently handling faces with large appearance variance in the wild. To solve this bottleneck, we borrow the concept of channel features to the face detection domain, which extends the image channel to diverse types like gradient magnitude and oriented gradient histograms and therefore encodes rich information in a simple form. We adopt a novel variant called aggregate channel features, make a full exploration of feature design, and discover a multiscale version of features with better performance. To deal with poses of faces in the wild, we propose a multi-view detection approach featuring score re-ranking and detection adjustment. Following the learning pipelines in ViolaJones framework, the multi-view face detector using aggregate channel features surpasses current state-of-the-art detectors on AFW and FDDB testsets, while runs at 42 FPSLiterature Review:","answer":"Traditional face detection methods  are based on hand-crafted features, and can be categorized into three classes: cascade methods, deformable parts model (DPM) BIB002 and aggregated channel features.

After that, more features like SURF BIB003 , HoG BIB004 , and LBP BIB001 are investigated on a similar structure of Viola-Jones detector. Other simpler features like pixel difference in NPD BIB005 , Joint Cascade BIB006 , etc. are developed to improve the computation speed. Another class of face detection methods based on structured models apply DPM BIB002 to cope with the intra-class variance. Most recently, researchers integrated multiple hand-crafted features in channels and achieved a higher accuracy. The representative work includes headhunter BIB007 and ACF-multiscale BIB008 which achieved the best performance among the traditional methods. These approaches mostly are able to achieve real-time detection on CPU, but hand-crafted features lack the robustness to complicated face variance like pose, expression, occlusion and illumination.

Duality of patterning refers for instance to the organization of the meaningful elements in a language at two distinct levels: a combinatorial level where meaningless forms are combined into meaningful forms and a compositional level where meaningful forms are composed into larger lexical units. The question remains wide open regarding how such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical framework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking. The aim of this paper is that of addressing these two aspects in a self-consistent way. First, we introduce suitable measures to quantify the level of combinatoriality and compositionality in a language, and present a framework to estimate these observables in human natural languages. Second, we show that the theoretical predictions of a multi-agents modeling scheme, namely the Blending Game, are in surprisingly good agreement with empirical data. In the Blending Game a population of individuals plays language games aiming at success in communication. It is remarkable that the two sides of duality of patterning emerge simultaneously as a consequence of a pure cultural dynamics in a simulated environment that contains meaningful relations, provided a simple constraint on message transmission fidelity is also considered.IntroductionIn a seminal paper, Charles Hockett BIBREF0 identified duality of patterning as one of the core design features of human language. A language exhibits duality of patterning when it is organized at two distinct levels. At a first level, meaningless forms (typically referred to as phonemes) are combined into meaningful units (henceforth this property will be referred to as combinatoriality). For example, the English forms /k/, /a/, and /t/ are combined in different ways to obtain the three words /kat/, /akt/, and /tak/ (respectively written 'cat', 'act' and 'tack'). Because the individual forms in them are meaningless, these words have no relation in meaning in spite of being made of the same forms. This is a very important property, thanks to which all of the many words of the English lexicon can be obtained by relatively simple combinations of about forty phonemes. If phonemes had individual meaning, this degree of compactness would not be possible. At a second level, meaningful units (typically referred to as morphemes) are composed into larger units, the meaning of which is related to the individual meaning of the composing units (henceforth this property will be referred to as compositionality). For example, the meaning of the word 'boyfriend' is related to the meaning of the words 'boy' and 'friend' which composed it. The compositional level includes syntax as well. For example, the meaning of the sentence 'cats eat fishes' is related to the meaning of the words 'cats', 'eat', and 'fishes'. In this paper, for the sake of simplicity, we focus exclusively on the lexicon level. This has to be considered as a first step towards the comprehension of the emergence of complex structures in languages.Quantifying duality of patterningIn this section we quantify the notion of duality of patterning as observed in real languages in order to provide suitable measures for the combinatoriality and compositionality.Modelling the emergence of duality of patterningWe now focus on the mechanisms that could lead to the establishment of duality of patterning in a lexicon. There have been a number of previous works devoted to explain the emergence of combinatoriality and compositionality. A thorough review of the attempts presented in literature is far from the scope of the present paper. Here we shall only focus on a few aspects which are relevant for our purposes.It should be remarked that the two facets of duality of patterning have often been studied independently from each other BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 . It should also be remarked that often studies in this ares have been focused on evolutionary times scales (e.g., BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 ), disregarding in this way the peer-to-peer negotiation taking place on cultural time-scales in large populations. In contrast, there is evidence suggesting that humans are capable of evolving languages with duality of patterning in the course of only one or two generations (consider for instance Nicaraguan Sign Language BIBREF10 or the emergence of Pidgins and Creole languages BIBREF11 ).Here we aim at explaining in an unitary framework the co-emergence of combinatoriality and compositionality. In addition, unlike previous approaches that looked for the emergence of meaning-symbols compositional mappings out of a small bounded set of predefined symbols available to the population, our approach adopts an open-ended set of forms and it does not rely on any predefined relations between objects/meanings and symbols. For instance we require combinatoriality to emerge out of a virtually infinite set of forms which are freely provided to a blank slate of individuals. Such set can only be limited by means of self-organization through repeated language games, the only purpose being that of communication. In addition, with our simple representation of the conceptual space, modeled as a graph, we do not hypothesize any predefined linguistic category or predefined meaning. This choice also allows to model the effect of differently shaped conceptual spaces and of conceptual spaces that may differ from individual to individual.Discussion and perspectivesIn this paper we have investigated duality of patterning at the lexicon level. We have quantified in particular the notions of combinatoriality and compositionality as observed in real languages as well as in a large-scale dataset produced in the framework of a web-based word association experiment BIBREF1 . We have paralleled this empirical analysis with a modeling scheme, the Blending Game, whose aim is that of identifying the main determinants for the emergence of duality of patterning in language. We analyzed the main properties of the lexicon emerged from the Blending Game as a function of the two parameters of the model, the graph connectivity p_{link} and the memory scale tau  . We found that properties of the emerging lexicon related to the combinatoriality, namely the words length distribution, the frequency of use of the different forms and a measure for the combinatoriality itself, reflect both qualitatively and quantitatively the corresponding properties as measured in human languages, provided that the memory parameter tau  is sufficiently high, that is that a sufficiently high effort is required in order to understand and learn brand new forms. Conversely, the compositional properties of the lexicon are related to the parameter p_{link} , that is a measure of the level of structure of the conceptual graph. For intermediate and low values of p_{link} , semantic relations between objects are more differentiated with respect to the situation of a more dense graph, in which every object is related to anyone else, and compositionality is enhanced. In summary, while the graph connectivity strongly affects the compositionality of the lexicon, noise in communication strongly affects the combinatoriality of the lexicon.These results are important because they demonstrate for the first time that the two sides of duality of patterning can emerge simultaneously as a consequence of a purely cultural dynamics in a simulated environment which contains meaningful relations. Many directions are open for future investigations. First of all to elucidate the emergence of duality of patterning at the syntax level beyond that of the lexicon. In addition many different manipulations of our modelling scheme are possible. One very interesting consists in relaxing the assumptions that the conceptual space of all the individuals are identical and modelled as a static graph, imaging instead that the conceptual space of each individual gets continuously reshaped by the interactions among the users. In this way one would realize a truly co-evolution of the conceptual spaces of the individuals and of their inventories of associations between objects and words. Finally it is worth mentioning how recent advances in information and communication technologies allow nowadays the realization of focused experiments also in the framework of the emergence of linguistic structures and a general trend is emerging for the adoption of web-games (see for instance the recently introduced Experimental Tribe platform: www.xtribe.eu) as a very interesting laboratory to run experiments in the social-sciences and whenever the contribution of human beings is crucially required for research purposes. This is opening tremendous opportunities to monitor the emergence of specific linguistic features and their co-evolution with the structure of out conceptual spaces.AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge support from the KREYON project funded by the Templeton Foundation under contract n. 51663.

The adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) -transporter ABCC2 (MRP2/cMOAT) can mediate resistance against the commonly used anticancer drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel. To overcome the ABCC2-depending drug resistance, two specific anti-ABCC2 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed for transient triggering of the gene-silencing RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in the cisplatin-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780RCIS. Since both siRNAs showed biological activity, for stable inhibition of ABCC2 a corresponding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) -encoding expression vector was designed. By treatment of A2780RCIS cells with this construct, the expressions of the targeted ABCC2 encoding mRNA and transport protein were inhibited. These effects were accompanied by reversal of resistance against cisplatin and paclitaxel. Thus, the data demonstrate the utility of the analyzed RNAs as powerful laboratory tools and indicate that siRNA- and shRNA-mediated RNAi-based gene therapeutic approaches may be applicable in preventing and reversing ABCC2-depending drug resistance.","answer":"[[\\"paclitaxel\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) -transporter\\"], [\\"cisplatin\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) -transporter\\"], [\\"cisplatin\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"ABCC2\\"], [\\"paclitaxel\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"ABCC2\\"]]"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

The M6P (mannose 6-phosphate) /IGF2R (insulin-like growth factor II receptor) interacts with a variety of factors that impinge on tumour invasion and metastasis. It has been shown that expression of wild-type M6P/IGF2R reduces the tumorigenic and invasive properties of receptor-deficient SCC-VII squamous cell carcinoma cells. We have now used mutant forms of M6P/IGF2R to assess the relevance of the different ligand-binding sites of the receptor for its biological activities in this cellular system. The results of the present study demonstrate that M6P/IGF2R does not require a functional binding site for insulin-like growth factor II for inhibition of anchorage-independent growth and matrix invasion by SCC-VII cells. In contrast, the simultaneous mutation of both M6P-binding sites is sufficient to impair all cellular functions of the receptor tested. These findings highlight that the interaction between M6P/IGF2R and M6P-modified ligands is not only important for intracellular accumulation of lysosomal enzymes and formation of dense lysosomes, but is also crucial for the ability of the receptor to suppress SCC-VII growth and invasion. The present study also shows that some of the biological activities of M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells strongly depend on a functional M6P-binding site within domain 3, thus providing further evidence for the non-redundant cellular functions of the individual carbohydrate-binding domains of the receptor.","answer":"[[\\"M6P\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"insulin-like growth factor II receptor\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

Sean O'Leary, MD, MPH, FAAP Answer YesAbstract:Background: There is evolving evidence of significant differences in severity and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children compared to adults.Underlying medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease are based on adult data, but have been applied across all ages resulting in large numbers of families undertaking social shielding (vulnerable group).We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with suspected COVID-19 at a Specialist Childrens Hospital to determine outcomes based on COVID-19 testing status and underlying health vulnerabilities.Methods: Routine clinical data were extracted retrospectively from the Institutions Electronic Health Record system and Digital Research Environment for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses.Data were compared between Sars-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (CoVPos / CoVNeg respectively), and in relation to presence of underlying health vulnerabilities based on Public Health England guidance.Findings: Between 1st March and 15th May 2020, 166 children (<18 years of age) presented to a specialist childrens hospital with clinical features of possible COVID-19 infection.65 patients (39.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus.CoVPos patients were older (median 9 [0.9-14] years vs median 1 [0.1-5.7.5] years respectively, p<0.001).There was a significantly reduced proportion of vulnerable cases (47.7% vs 72.3%, p=0.002), but no difference in proportion of vulnerable patients requiring ventilation (61% vs 64.3%, p = 0.84) between CoVPos and CoVNeg groups.However, a significantly lower proportion of CoVPos patients required mechanical ventilation support compared to CoVNeg patients (27.7 vs 57.4%, p<0.001).Mortality was not significantly different between CoVPos and CoVNeg groups (1.5 vs 4% respectively, p=0.67) although there were no direct COVID-19 related deaths in this highly preselected paediatric population.Interpretation: COVID-19 infection may be associated with severe disease in childhood presenting to a specialist hospital, but does not appear significantly different in severity to other causes of similar clinical presentations.In children presenting with pre-existing COVID-19 vulnerable medical conditions at a specialist centre, there does not appear to be significantly increased risk of either contracting COVID-19 or severe complications, apart from those undergoing chemotherapy, who are over-represented.","answer":"{\\"verdict\\": \\"SUPPORT\\", \\"evidence\\": [\\"Background: There is evolving evidence of significant differences in severity and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children compared to adults.\\", \\"We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with suspected COVID-19 at a Specialist Childrens Hospital to determine outcomes based on COVID-19 testing status and underlying health vulnerabilities.\\", \\"Findings: Between 1st March and 15th May 2020, 166 children (<18 years of age) presented to a specialist childrens hospital with clinical features of possible COVID-19 infection.\\", \\"65 patients (39.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus.\\", \\"Interpretation: COVID-19 infection may be associated with severe disease in childhood presenting to a specialist hospital, but does not appear significantly different in severity to other causes of similar clinical presentations.\\", \\"In children presenting with pre-existing COVID-19 vulnerable medical conditions at a specialist centre, there does not appear to be significantly increased risk of either contracting COVID-19 or severe complications, apart from those undergoing chemotherapy, who are over-represented.\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

barium meal follow through was normal , and stool showed 2025 pus cells / hpf .she was treated with intravenous ( iv ) ceftriaxone , metronidazole , nitazoxanide , and fluconazole to which she responded along with calcium supplements .she was treated with iv cefotaxime , amikacin , tmp - smx , and required inotropes in the form of dopamine and dobutamine , and also prednisolone to which she responded .diarrhea in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ) is significantly caused by intestinal parasites .studies in adults have demonstrated that enteritis due to g. intestinalis is a frequent event among the aids patients , especially in the most advanced stage of the disease . in a study of 75 hiv - infected adults in india ,g. intestinalis was the most commonly isolated parasite , and patients with the lower cd4 cell counts presented with significantly more enteric disease and chronic diarrhea .these include tuberculosis , herpes zoster ( shingles ) , cryptococcus neoformans , kaposi 's sarcoma , pneumocystis pneumonia , hepatitis b virus , hepatitis c virus , herpes simplex virus , histoplasma capsulatum , human papillomavirus , and cytomegalovirus .however , the immune reconstitution syndrome ( irs ) has never been documented with a giardiasis or its treatment .our patient was treated empirically with anti - bacterials such as ceftriaxone ; anti - protozoal such as metronidazole and nitazoxanide ; and anti - fungal agents such as fluconazole because the routine stool examination did not detect any particular organism and hiv - infected children are known to have polymicrobial infections . however , the post - art , the preexisting infections which might have been partially treated or may have been subclinical was later unmasked by the patient 's regained capacity to mount an inflammatory response .giardiasis was then diagnosed from the stool sample where it showed up as the causative organism .the patient 's symptoms , this time were more severe , and she went into sepsis for which she was given in inotropic support .a low baseline cd4 + t cell count has also been documented as a major risk factor for the development of iris . in a study conducted at a hospital in mumbai , india , to evaluate incidence and risk factors for iris in 37 hiv - infected children, it was found that the patients with opportunistic infections before the antiretroviral treatment would have increased the incidence of iris . however , there was no correlation between the degree of immunosuppression and development of irs .there may also be a genetic predisposition and certain genes have been associated with an increased susceptibility to the development of iris in the presence of mycobacteria and herpes viruses which might have been the case with our patient who had a prior history of herpes zoster infection .therefore , this case highlights that giardiasis may also be considered as a cause of iris in patients with hiv infection .learning points from the case in family medicine and the primary care :  always screen for iris in patients who present with infection post - artiris may be associated with unusual infections .  always screen for iris in patients who present with infection post - art iris may be associated with unusual infections .","answer":"human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv)-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has been reported in association with tuberculosis , herpes zoster ( shingles ) , cryptococcus neoformans , kaposi 's sarcoma , pneumocystis pneumonia , hepatitis b virus , hepatitis c virus , herpes simplex virus , histoplasma capsulatum , human papillomavirus , and cytomegalovirus . however , it has never been documented with giardiasis .  we present a 7-year - old hiv infected girl who developed diarrhea and shock following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy , and her stool showed the presence of giardiasis ."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

We experiment with pretraining on different domains of text, pretraining on perturbed representations of natural language text (such as shuffled word order), pretraining on text of computer programs (no linguistic properties of natural languages), pretraining on multi-lingual and non-English text, and pretraining with synthetic text (data sampled from synthetic distributions).

Our contributions are: In TableÂ 2, we note that all three non-English pretrained LMs significantly outperformed non-pretrained models, with the best performance being comparable or marginally lower than English versions. In fact, Code-BERT surprisingly surpasses ROC by 5%.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  On the basis of discrete Hilbert transform (DHT) realised by fast Fourier transform (FFT), a new strategy for automatic spike mapping is introduced. The further computation of the EEG time series after DHT results in the time series of the momentary power and the momentary frequency. Both are used for the solution of the main requirements of automatic spike mapping. The spike-mapping concept introduced meets the requirements of efficient automatic spike detection and also has an insensitivity with regard to EMG interference and transient signal components, a frequent cause of false positive detections. Additionally, there are advantages if the momentary power of the spike is mapped instead of the spike potential. The use of momentary power makes a combination of power spectral mapping and spike-mapping strategies possible.Literature Review:","answer":"Sub-band decomposition is easier to implement in frequency domain than in time domain. So, it can be used easily with frequency-domain spike detection methods from EEG signals. Witte et al.

Individual mechanisms of volume changes are unknown but might be connected to the load of risk genes . Genome-wide association studies have uncovered the polygenic architecture of schizophrenia . The secondary analysis presented here aim ed to determine the modulatory role of schizophrenia polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) on volume changes in the total hippocampus and cornu ammonis ( CA ) 1 , CA2/3 , CA4/dentate gyrus ( DG ) and subiculum over time . We studied 20 multi-episode schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy controls who performed aerobic exercise ( endurance training ) combined with cognitive remediation for 3 months and 21 multi-episode schizophrenia patients allocated to a control intervention ( table soccer ) combined with cognitive remediation .  Magnetic resonance imaging-based assessment s were performed at baseline and after 3 months with FreeSurfer . No effects of PRSs were found on total hippocampal volume change . Subfield analyses showed that the volume changes between baseline and 3 months in the left CA4/DG were significantly influenced by PRSs in schizophrenia patients performing aerobic exercise . A larger genetic risk burden was associated with a less pronounced volume increase or a decrease in volume over the course of the exercise intervention . Results of exploratory enrichment analyses reinforced the notion of genetic risk factors modulating biological processes tightly related to synaptic ion channel activity , calcium signaling , glutamate signaling and regulation of cell morphogenesis . We hypothesize that a high polygenic risk may negatively influence neuroplasticity in CA4/DG during aerobic exercise in schizophreniaTitle 2:Analysis of a large fMRI cohort: Statistical and methodological issues for group analysesAbstract 2:The aim of group fMRI studies is to relate contrasts of tasks or stimuli to regional brain activity increases . These studies typically involve 10 to 16 subjects . The average regional activity statistical significance is assessed using the subject to subject variability of the effect ( r and om effects analyses ) . Because of the relatively small number of subjects included , the sensitivity and reliability of these analyses is question able and hard to investigate . In this work , we use a very large number of subject ( more than 80 ) to investigate this issue . We take advantage of this large cohort to study the statistical properties of the inter-subject activity and focus on the notion of reproducibility by bootstrapping . We asked simple but important method ological questions : Is there , from the point of view of reliability , an optimal statistical threshold for activity maps ? How many subjects should be included in group studies ? What method should be preferred for inference ? Our results suggest that i ) optimal thresholds can indeed be found , and are rather lower than usual corrected for multiple comparison thresholds , ii ) 20 subjects or more should be included in functional neuroimaging studies in order to have sufficient reliability , iii ) non-parametric significance assessment should be preferred to parametric methods , iv ) cluster-level thresholding is more reliable than voxel-based thresholding , and v ) mixed effects tests are much more reliable than r and om effects tests . Moreover , our study shows that inter-subject variability plays a prominent role in the relatively low sensitivity and reliability of group studiesTitle 3:Aerobic exercise and yoga improve neurocognitive function in women with early psychosisAbstract 3:Impairments of attention and memory are evident in early psychosis , and are associated with functional disability . In a group of stable , medicated women patients , we aim ed to determine whether participating in aerobic exercise or yoga improved cognitive impairments and clinical symptoms . A total of 140 female patients were recruited , and 124 received the allocated intervention in a r and omized controlled study of 12 weeks of yoga or aerobic exercise compared with a waitlist group . The primary outcomes were cognitive functions including memory and attention . Secondary outcome measures were the severity of psychotic and depressive symptoms , and hippocampal volume . Data from 124 patients were included in the final analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle . Both yoga and aerobic exercise groups demonstrated significant improvements in working memory ( P<0.01 ) with moderate to large effect sizes compared with the waitlist control group . The yoga group showed additional benefits in verbal acquisition ( P<0.01 ) and attention ( P=0.01 ) . Both types of exercise improved overall and depressive symptoms ( all Pâ©½0.01 ) after 12 weeks . Small increases in hippocampal volume were observed in the aerobic exercise group compared with waitlist ( P=0.01 ) . Both types of exercise improved working memory in early psychosis patients , with yoga having a larger effect on verbal acquisition and attention than aerobic exercise . The application of yoga and aerobic exercise as adjunctive treatments for early psychosis merits serious consideration .

For the management of weight gain , exercise is one of the most acknowledged interventions . At the same time , exercise and sports have been recognized for their positive impact on psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia . However , the neurobiological basis for this remains poorly understood . We aim ed to examine the effect of sports participation on weight gain , psychiatric symptoms and brain activation during sports observation in schizophrenia patients . Thirteen schizophrenia patients who participated in a 3-month program , including sports participation and 10 control schizophrenia patients were studied . In both groups , body mass index ( BMI ) , Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , and brain activation during observation of sports-related actions measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging were accessed before and after a 3-month interval . BMI and general psychopathology scale of PANSS were significantly reduced in the program group but not in the control group after a 3-month interval . Compared with baseline , activation of the body-selective extrastriate body area ( EBA ) in the posterior temporal-occipital cortex during observation of sports-related actions was increased in the program group . In this group , increase in EBA activation was associated with improvement in the general psychopathology scale of PANSS . Sports participation had a positive effect not only on weight gain but also on psychiatric symptoms in schizophrenia . EBA might mediate these beneficial effects of sports participation . Our findings merit further investigation of neurobiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of sports for schizophreniaTitle 5:Exercise therapy, cardiorespiratory fitness and their effect on brain volumes: A randomised controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controlsAbstract 5:The objective of this study was to examine exercise effects on global brain volume , hippocampal volume , and cortical thickness in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls . Irrespective of diagnosis and intervention , associations between brain changes and cardiorespiratory fitness improvement were examined . Sixty-three schizophrenia patients and fifty-five healthy controls participated in this r and omised controlled trial .  Global brain volumes , hippocampal volume , and cortical thickness were estimated from 3-Tesla MRI scans . Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed with a cardiopulmonary ergometer test . Subjects were assigned exercise therapy or occupational therapy ( patients ) and exercise therapy or life-as-usual ( healthy controls ) for six months 2h weekly . Exercise therapy effects were analysed for subjects who were compliant at least 50 % of sessions offered . Significantly smaller baseline cerebral ( grey ) matter , and larger third ventricle volumes , and thinner cortex in most areas of the brain were found in patients versus controls . Exercise therapy did not affect global brain and hippocampal volume or cortical thickness in patients and controls . Cardiorespiratory fitness improvement was related to increased cerebral matter volume and lateral and third ventricle volume decrease in patients and to thickening in the left hemisphere in large areas of the frontal , temporal and cingulate cortex irrespective of diagnosis . One to 2h of exercise therapy did not elicit significant brain volume changes in patients or controls . However , cardiorespiratory fitness improvement attenuated brain volume changes in schizophrenia  patients and increased thickness in large areas of the left cortex in both schizophrenia patients and healthy controlsTitle 6:Exercise therapy improves mental and physical health in schizophrenia: a randomised controlled trialAbstract 6:The objective of this multicenter r and omised clinical trial was to examine the effect of  exercise versus occupational therapy on mental and physical health in schizophrenia patientsTitle 7:Effects of endurance training on brain structures in chronic schizophrenia patients and healthy controlsAbstract 7:The objective of this longitudinal magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging study was to examine the effects of endurance training on hippocampal and grey matter volumes in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls . 20 chronic schizophrenia patients and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent 3months of endurance training ( 30min , 3 times per week ) . 19 additionally recruited schizophrenia patients  played table soccer ( \\" foosball \\" in the USA ) over the same period . MR imaging with 3D-volumetric T1-weighted sequences was performed on a 3 T MR scanner at baseline , after 6weeks and after the 3-month intervention and 3 additional training-free months . In addition to voxel-based morphometry ( VBM ) , we performed manual and automatic delineation of the hippocampus and its substructures . Endurance capacity and psychopathological symptoms were measured as secondary endpoints . No significant increases in the volumes of the hippocampus or hippocampal substructures were observed in schizophrenia patients or healthy controls . However , VBM analyses displayed an increased volume of the left superior , middle and inferior anterior temporal gyri compared to baseline in schizophrenia patients after the endurance training , whereas patients playing table soccer showed increased volumes in the motor and anterior cingulate cortices . After the additional training-free period , the differences were no longer present . While endurance capacity improved in exercising patients and healthy controls , psychopathological symptoms did not significantly change . The subtle changes in the left temporal cortex indicate an impact of exercise on brain volumes in schizophrenia . Subsequent studies in larger cohorts are warranted to address the question of response variability of endurance trainingTitle 8:Longitudinal functional connectivity changes correlate with mood improvement after regular exercise in a dose-dependent fashion.Abstract 8:Exercise increases wellbeing and improves mood . It is however unclear how these mood changes relate to brain function . We conducted a r and omized controlled trial investigating resting-state modifications in healthy adults after an extended period of aerobic physical exercise and their relationship with mood improvements . We aim ed to identify novel functional networks whose activity could provide a physiological counterpart to the mood-related benefits of exercise . Thirty-eight healthy sedentary volunteers were r and omised to either the  aerobic exercise group of the study or a  control group . Participants in the exercise group attended aerobic sessions with a physiotherapist twice a week for 16 weeks . Resting-state modifications using magnetic resonance imaging were assessed before and after the programme and related to mood changes . An unbiased approach using graph metrics and network-based statistics was adopted . Exercise reduced mood disturbance and improved emotional wellbeing . It also induced a decrease in local efficiency in the parahippocampal lobe through strengthening of the functional connections from this structure to the supramarginal gyrus , pre central area , superior temporal gyrus and temporal pole . Changes in mood disturbance following exercise were correlated with those in connectivity between parahippocampal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus as well as with the amount of training . No changes were detected in the control group . In conclusion , connectivity from the parahippocampal gyrus to motor , sensory integration and mood regulation areas was strengthened through exercise . These functional changes might be related to the benefits of regular physical activity on moodTitle 9:Hippocampal plasticity in response to exercise in schizophrenia.Abstract 9:CONTEXT Hippocampal volume is lower than expected in patients with schizophrenia ; however , whether this represents a fixed deficit is uncertain . Exercise is a stimulus to hippocampal plasticity . OBJECTIVE To determine whether hippocampal volume would increase with exercise in humans and whether this effect would be related to improved aerobic fitness . DESIGN R and omized controlled study . SETTING Patients attending a day hospital program or an outpatient clinic . PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Male patients with chronic schizophrenia and matched healthy subjects . INTERVENTIONS Aerobic exercise training ( cycling ) and playing table football ( control group ) for a period of 3 months . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Magnetic resonance imaging of the hippocampus . Secondary outcome measures were magnetic resonance spectroscopy , neuropsychological ( Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test , Corsi block-tapping test ) , and clinical ( Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ) features . RESULTS Following exercise training , relative hippocampal volume increased significantly in patients ( 12 % ) and healthy subjects ( 16 % ) , with no change in the nonexercise group of patients ( -1 % ) . Changes in hippocampal volume in the exercise group were correlated with improvements in aerobic fitness measured by change in maximum oxygen consumption ( r = 0.71 ; P = .003 ) . In the schizophrenia exercise group ( but not the controls ) , change in hippocampal volume was associated with a 35 % increase in the N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio in the hippocampus . Finally , improvement in test scores for short-term memory in the combined exercise and nonexercise schizophrenia group was correlated with change in hippocampal volume ( r = 0.51 ; P < .05 ) . CONCLUSION These results indicate that in both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia hippocampal volume is plastic in response to aerobic exercise","answer":"The majority of included studies focused on hippocampal effects , reporting beneficial effects of exercise .In addition , in schizophrenia increased extrastriate body area ( EBA ) activation and increased white matter fiber integrity in tracts relevant to the disorder were found and in healthy individuals decreased connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) indicating greater cognitive efficiency was reported .Comparing individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and healthy individuals within a similar age range , most studies found similar effects on hippocampal volume and white matter tracts for both groups , although the effect in schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be attenuated which is in line with previous literature on brain plasticity .The current review indicates a lack of studies investigating neural correlates other than the hippocampus ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

High protein gluten-free legume flours, rich in fibers, resistant starch and minerals are thus a good alternative for gluten-free pasta production. In this study, gluten-free pasta was produced exclusively from faba, lentil or black-gram flours. The relationship between their structure, their cooking and Rheological properties and their in-vitro starch digestion was analyzed and compared to cereal gluten-free commercial pasta. Trypsin inhibitory activity, phytic acid and Î±-galactosides were determined in flours and in cooked pasta. All legume pasta were rich in protein, resistant starch and fibers. They had a thick but weak protein network, which is built during the pasta cooking step. This particular structure altered pasta springiness and increased cooking losses. Black-gram pasta, which is especially rich in soluble fibers, differed from faba and lentil pasta, with high springiness (0.85 vs. 0.75) and less loss during cooking. In comparison to a commercial cereal gluten-free pasta, all the legume pasta lost less material during cooking but was less cohesive and springy. Interestingly, due to their particular composition and structure, lentil and faba pasta released their starch more slowly than the commercial gluten-free pasta during the in-vitro digestion process. Anti-nutritional factors in legumes, such as trypsin inhibitory activity and Î±-galactosides were reduced by up to 82% and 73%, respectively, by pasta processing and cooking. However, these processing steps had a minor effect on phytic acid. This study demonstrates the advantages of using legumes for the production of gluten-free pasta with a low glycemic index and high nutritional quality.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"inhibitory activity\\", \\"digestion\\", \\"digestion process\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"minerals\\", \\"fibers\\", \\"protein\\", \\"starch\\", \\"Trypsin\\", \\"u03b1-galactosides\\", \\"gluten\\", \\"Protein\\", \\"Structural\\", \\"trypsin\\", \\"phytic acid\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"Culinary\\", \\"Anti-Nutritional\\", \\"Anti-nutritional\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"pasta\\", \\"gluten-free pasta\\", \\"flours\\", \\"black-gram\\", \\"gluten-free pasta with a low glycemic index\\", \\"cereal\\", \\"Black-gram\\", \\"lentil\\", \\"Gluten Free, 100% Legume Pasta\\", \\"faba\\", \\"Wheat\\", \\"legumes\\", \\"legume\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"gluten-free\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"commercial\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"people\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"analyzed\\", \\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"structure\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a materials science research paper.

Sodium titanate nanoflowers (STNFs) were synthesized via hydrothermal reaction between NaOH and a mixture of TTIP and methanol. In a typical synthesis, methanol (50 ml) was added to TTIP (3.0 g) and then heated up to ~67 degC with stirring. The above solution was hydrolyzed using distilled water (0.72 g) and subsequently heated for 30 min. Upon completion of the hydrolysis, NaOH (20 ml, 5 wt%) solution was added to the mixture which was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 80 degC (STNF80C) and 120 degC (STNF120C) for 24 h. Upon completion of the hydrothermal reaction, the precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water until pH ~9-10 was attained. For Na free TiO2, the STNF80C and the STNF120C samples were washed with 0.1 M HCl followed by distilled water until pH ~4 was obtained and subsequently dried at 70 degC for 1 h. The dried sample powder was then calcined at 500 degC for 3 h.","answer":"[{\\"arguments\\": [[\\"Sodium titanate\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"], [\\"methanol\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"], [\\"TTIP\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"], [\\"NaOH\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"synthesized\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"methanol\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"], [\\"TTIP\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"added\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"solution\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"], [\\"water\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"hydrolyzed\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"NaOH\\", \\"Recipe_Precursor\\"], [\\"mixture\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"added\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"precipitate\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"filtered\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"water\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"washed\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"STNF120C\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"], [\\"STNF80C\\", \\"Recipe_Target\\"], [\\"HCl\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"], [\\"water\\", \\"Solvent_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"washed\\"}, {\\"arguments\\": [[\\"powder\\", \\"Participant_Material\\"]], \\"trigger\\": \\"calcined\\"}]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

To evaluate the dual ChE inhibitor, rivastigmine, in more severe dementia.                We retrospectively analysed pooled data from three randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-month trials, involving 2126 AD subjects. Subjects were selected according to baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score to identify subjects with more severe cognitive impairment (10-12 MMSE points). One-hundred-and-seventeen subjects were included who had been treated with rivastigmine 6-12 mg/day or placebo. The AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), the MMSE, a six-item subscore of the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS) and the BEHAVE-AD assessed efficacy. Tolerability was assessed by recording adverse events (AEs) and the relative risk (RR) of discontinuation.                This group of subjects responded well to rivastigmine. After 6 months, the mean ADAS-Cog score declined by 6.3 points in the placebo group and increased by 0.2 points in the rivastigmine group (observed cases; p<0.001). Clinical benefits were also observed with the MMSE, the six-item PDS score and items of the BEHAVE-AD. Rivastigmine showed the same pattern of AEs as in other studies, but the RR of dropping out due to AEs was lower than in subjects with milder AD.                Current treatment guidelines do not recommend treating individuals with severe AD with ChE inhibitors. However, this retrospective analysis suggests that rivastigmine 6-12 mg/day may benefit subjects with more severe disease, as well as subjects with mild to moderate impairment.

Administering and managing medications is one of their many daily tasks. More effective modes of drug administration may benefit patient and caregiver, and may improve compliance. A prospective outcome of the IDEAL (Investigation of TransDermal Exelon in ALzheimer's disease) trial was to evaluate caregiver preference for rivastigmine patches compared with capsules. The 24-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled IDEAL trial investigated once-daily rivastigmine patches vs twice-daily capsules in moderate AD patients. Caregivers rated patch adhesion throughout. The AD Caregiver Preference Questionnaire (ADCPQ) assessed patch vs capsule from caregivers' perspective, based on expectations, preferences, and satisfaction with treatment. A total of 1,059 caregivers completed the ADCPQ while their respective patients were on study drug. More than 70% of caregivers preferred the patch to capsules overall. The patch was preferred to capsules with respect to ease of use (p < 0.0001) and ease of following the schedule (p < 0.0001). Caregivers indicated greater satisfaction overall (p < 0.0001) and less interference with daily life (p < 0.01) with the patch vs capsules. The preference substudy of the IDEAL trial demonstrated that caregivers of AD patients preferred patches to capsules for drug delivery. Preference for the patch may indicate reduced caregiver stress, substantiated by greater satisfaction and less interference with daily life. These benefits may lead to improved compliance.Title 3:Rivastigmine: a placebo controlled trial of twice daily and three times daily regimens in patients with Alzheimer's disease.Abstract 3:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rapidly titrated rivastigmine administered twice (BID) or three times (TID) daily in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD).                This was a 26 week international, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study in which 678 patients with probable AD received placebo or rivastigmine 2-12 mg/day BID or TID. Primary outcome measures included the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and categorical analysis of the Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change incorporating caregiver information (CIBIC-Plus). Secondary outcomes were the CIBIC-Plus change from baseline, Progressive Deterioration Scale, ADAS-cogA, Mini-Mental State Examination and Global Deterioration Scale.                At week 26, mean rivastigmine dose was 9.6 (2.76) mg/day in the TID group and 8.9 (2.93) mg/day in the BID group. Mean ADAS-cog changes from baseline in the TID and BID rivastigmine treated groups were -0.2 (SD 7.3) and 1.2 (SD 7.2) versus 2.8 (SD 7.2) for the placebo group (p<0.05). Differences between rivastigmine TID and placebo on the CIBIC-Plus categorical responder analysis were significant (31% vs 19%; p<0.05, intention to treat). No significant differences were seen between BID and placebo for this outcome measure. Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal, occurring mainly during dose titration. Withdrawal because of adverse events accounted for 17% of BID, 11% of TID and 9% of placebo patients.                Rivastigmine administered as a BID or TID regimen significantly benefited cognitive, function and global performances in AD patients. The TID regimen showed a tendency for superior tolerability and permitted titration to higher doses, an outcome that is significant as the efficacy of rivastigmine is dose related.Title 4:A 12-month study of the efficacy of rivastigmine in patients with advanced moderate Alzheimer's disease.Abstract 4:The efficacy of a centrally active cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine tartrate (ENA 713), in patients with advanced moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) was evaluated in a 12-month placebo-controlled study. We aimed to investigate whether there was any evidence for the benefits of rivastigmine in patients with severe disease. These patients were compared with matched controls. In this study, 24 patients with advanced moderate AD received rivastigmine for 12 months. Another 20 patients received placebo. Mean daily doses of rivastigmine in the higher-dose group at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 6.1 +/- 1.0, 8.3 +/- 1.2, 8.9 +/- 1.3, and 10.7 +/- 1.6 mg/day, respectively. Cognitive abilities were assessed using the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Forty-five percent of placebo-treated patients declined by at least 4 points on the ADAS-cog. Conversely, only 18.3% of patients treated with rivastigmine declined by 4 or more points. Functional disabilities, as assessed using the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale, remained significantly superior in rivastigmine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. Patients benefited from high-dose rivastigmine treatment on all outcome measures, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Progressive Deterioration Scale, as well as the Global Deterioration Scale. Patients receiving rivastigmine for 12 months significantly improved compared with placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). By 52 weeks, patients originally treated with 6-12 mg/day rivastigmine had a significantly better cognitive function than patients originally treated with placebo. Long-term rivastigmine treatment appeared to be well tolerated in patients with advanced moderate AD and significantly benefits the cognitive and functional symptoms of AD.

Randomised double blind (clinician, patient, outcomes assessor) placebo controlled trial.                Care facilities in the north east of England.                93 patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and clinically significant agitation.                Atypical antipsychotic (quetiapine), cholinesterase inhibitor (rivastigmine), or placebo (double dummy).                Agitation (Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory) and cognition (severe impairment battery) at baseline and at six weeks and 26 weeks. The primary outcome was agitation inventory at six weeks.                31 patients were randomised to each group, and 80 (86%) started treatment (25 rivastigmine, 26 quetiapine, 29 placebo), of whom 71 (89%) tolerated the maximum protocol dose (22 rivastigmine, 23 quetiapine, 26 placebo). Compared with placebo, neither group showed significant differences in improvement on the agitation inventory either at six weeks or 26 weeks. Fifty six patients scored > 10 on the severe impairment battery at baseline, 46 (82%) of whom were included in the analysis at six week follow up (14 rivastigmine, 14 quetiapine, 18 placebo). For quetiapine the change in severe impairment battery score from baseline was estimated as an average of -14.6 points (95% confidence interval -25.3 to -4.0) lower (that is, worse) than in the placebo group at six weeks (P = 0.009) and -15.4 points (-27.0 to -3.8) lower at 26 weeks (P = 0.01). The corresponding changes with rivastigmine were -3.5 points (-13.1 to 6.2) lower at six weeks (P = 0.5) and -7.5 points (-21.0 to 6.0) lower at 26 weeks (P = 0.3).                Neither quetiapine nor rivastigmine are effective in the treatment of agitation in people with dementia in institutional care. Compared with placebo, quetiapine is associated with significantly greater cognitive decline.Title 6:Does serotonin augmentation have any effect on cognition and activities of daily living in Alzheimer's dementia? A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Abstract 6:Recent studies suggest that cholinergic dysfunction does not provide a complete account of age-related cognitive deficits, and other neuronal systems like monoaminergic hypofunction are involved. In several studies, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors demonstrated promotion in neurogenesis in the hippocampus and enhanced memory and cognition. The aim of this study is to survey the effect of serotonin augmentation on cognition and activities of daily living in patients with Alzheimer's disease.                The trial was designed as a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. One hundred twenty-two patients aged 55 to 85 years with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's dementia were randomly allocated in 1 of the 3 treatment groups: fluoxetine plus rivastigmine, rivastigmine alone, or placebo group. Efficacy measures comprised assessments of cognition, activities of daily living, and global functioning. Hamilton Depression Scale also was used to assess changes in mood throughout the study.                Fluoxetine plus rivastigmine and rivastigmine groups demonstrated improvement on measures of cognitive and memory without any significant difference; however, the former group did better in their activities of daily living and global functioning. Patients taking placebo had significant deterioration in all the efficacy measures. Patients taking rivastigmine or rivastigmine plus fluoxetine had improvements in Hamilton Depression Scale without significant differences.                Concomitant use of selective serotonin-enhancing agents and acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors can provide greater benefit in activities of daily living and global functioning in patients with cognitive impairment. Because our study is preliminary, larger double-blind studies are needed to confirm the results.","answer":"Rivastigmine appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and severity of dementia with daily doses of 6 to 12 mg. Adverse events were consistent with the cholinergic actions of the drug. A transdermal patch has been tested in one trial, and there is evidence that the lower dose smaller patch is associated with fewer side effects than the capsules or the higher dose larger patch and has comparable efficacy to both.

Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is an uncommon autosomal dominant chronic keratinization disorder, characterized by multiple superficial keratotic lesions surrounded by a slightly raised keratotic border. Thus far, although two loci for DSAP have been identified, the genetic basis and pathogenesis of this disorder have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in three Chinese affected families and localized the gene in an 8.0 cM interval defined by D12S330 and D12S354 on chromosome 12. Upon screening 30 candidate genes, we identified a missense mutation, p.Ser63Asn in SSH1 in one family, a frameshift mutation, p.Ser19CysfsX24 in an alternative variant (isoform f) of SSH1 in another family, and a frameshift mutation, p.Pro27ProfsX54 in the same alternative variant in one non-familial case with DSAP. SSH1 encodes a phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics. Our data suggested that cytoskeleton disorganization in epidermal cells is likely associated with the pathogenesis of DSAP.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"SSH1\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

Randomised placebo-controlled trial.                Fourteen UK hospitals (three teaching).                Pregnancies with at least one previous risk factor, including mid-trimester loss or preterm delivery, uterine abnormality, cervical surgery or cerclage.                Nine hundred pregnancies were screened for fFN at 24 and 27 weeks of gestation. Positive cases were randomised to a week's course of oral metronidazole or placebo.                Primary outcome was delivery before 30 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes included delivery before 37 weeks.                The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) recommended the study be stopped early; 21% of women receiving metronidazole (11/53) delivered before 30 weeks compared with 11% (5/46) taking placebo [risk ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-5.09, P = 0.18]. There were significantly more preterm deliveries (before 37 weeks) in women treated with metronidazole 33/53 (62%) versus placebo 18/46 (39%), risk ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.05-2.4. fFN was a good predictor of early preterm birth in these asymptomatic women; positive and negative predictive values (24 weeks of gestation) for delivery by 30 weeks were 26% and 99%, respectively (positive and negative likelihood ratios 15, 0.35).                Metronidazole does not reduce early preterm birth in high risk pregnant women selected by history and a positive vaginal fFN test. Preterm delivery may be increased by metronidazole therapy.Title 2:Antimicrobial prophylaxis in pregnancy: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with cefetamet-pivoxil in pregnant women with a poor obstetric history.Abstract 2:This study was undertaken to measure the impact of a single oral dose of cefetamet-pivoxil on pregnancy outcome in a population with substantial rates of low birth weight and high prevalence rates of maternal infections.                A total of 320 pregnant women with a poor obstetric history, defined as a history of low birth weight or stillbirth, were randomized to receive a single oral dose of 2 gm of cefetamet-pivoxil or a placebo at a gestational age between 28 and 32 weeks. Patients were assessed at delivery and 1 week post partum for pregnancy outcome, postpartum endometritis, human immunodeficiency virus-1 and gonococcal infections.                A total of 253 (79%) women gave birth at the maternity hospital, of whom 210 (83%) attended the follow-up clinic. Overall, 18.1% of these pregnant women were human immunodeficiency virus-1 seropositive, whereas 9.5% had antibodies against Treponema pallidum. There was a significant difference between cefetamet-pivoxil- and placebo-treated women in infant birth weight (2927 gm vs 2772 gm, p = 0.03) and low birth weight (< 2500 gm) rates (18.7% vs 32.8%, p = 0.01, odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.8). The stillbirth rate was 2.2% in the cefetamet-pivoxil group and 4.2% in the placebo group (not significant). Postpartum endometritis was found in 17.3% in the intervention arm versus 31.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.03, odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 7.6). Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from the cervix in 5 of 103 (4.9%) women in the intervention and in 14 of 101 (13.9%) in the placebo group (p = 0.04, odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 10.5).                A single oral dose of cefetamet-pivoxil administered to pregnant women with a poor obstetric history seemed to improve pregnancy outcome in this population with high rates of maternal infections. Larger studies should be carried out to examine the public health impact, the feasibility, and the overall cost/benefit ratio of this intervention.Title 3:Cervicovaginal microflora and pregnancy outcome: results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of erythromycin treatment.Abstract 3:Available information suggests that some instances of preterm birth or premature rupture of membranes are associated with clinically unrecognized infection and inflammation of the lower uterine segment, decidua, and fetal membranes. Various cervicovaginal microorganisms have been recovered from these sites. Many of these microorganisms produce factors that may lead to weakening of the fetal membranes, release of prostaglandins, or both. This study evaluated the presence of various lower genital tract microflora and bacterial conditions in 229 women enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of short-course erythromycin treatment at 26 to 30 weeks' gestation to prevent preterm birth. Demographic, obstetric, and microbiologic parameters were prospectively evaluated. Premature rupture of membranes occurred less frequently (p less than 0.01) among women who received erythromycin (6%) versus placebo (16%). Preterm premature rupture of membranes also occurred less frequently, although not significantly (p = 0.3) in patients who received erythromycin (2%) versus placebo (5%). Erythromycin treatment significantly decreased the occurrence of premature rupture of membranes among women who were initially positive for Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that C. trachomatis (p = 0.05; odds ratio, 9), vaginal wash phospholipase C (p = 0.08; odds ratio, 6) and prior preterm birth (p = 0.007; odds ratio 17) were associated with increased risk of preterm birth. Bacterial vaginosis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum were not significantly associated with increased risk of preterm birth or preterm rupture of membranes. These findings support a role for selected lower genital tract microflora in preterm birth and premature rupture. Large controlled treatment trials of specific infections or conditions associated with preterm birth and premature rupture of membranes are required to confirm the value of antimicrobial treatments in prevention of microbial-associated preterm birth.Title 4:Reduced incidence of preterm delivery with metronidazole and erythromycin in women with bacterial vaginosis.Abstract 4:Pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may be at increased risk for preterm delivery. We investigated whether treatment with metronidazole and erythromycin during the second trimester would lower the incidence of delivery before 37 weeks' gestation.                In 624 pregnant women at risk for delivering prematurely, vaginal and cervical cultures and other laboratory tests for bacterial vaginosis were performed at a mean of 22.9 weeks' gestation. We then performed a 2:1 double-blind randomization to treatment with metronidazole and erythromycin (433 women) or placebo (191 women). After treatment, the vaginal and cervical tests were repeated and a second course of treatment was given to women who had bacterial vaginosis at that time (a mean of 27.6 weeks' gestation).                A total of 178 women (29 percent) delivered infants at less than 37 weeks' gestation. Eight women were lost to follow-up. In the remaining population, 110 of the 426 women assigned to metronidazole and erythromycin (26 percent) delivered prematurely, as compared with 68 of the 190 assigned to placebo (36 percent, P = 0.01). However, the association between the study treatment and lower rates of prematurity was observed only among the 258 women who had bacterial vaginosis (rate of preterm delivery, 31 percent with treatment vs. 49 percent with placebo; P = 0.006). Of the 358 women who did not have bacterial vaginosis when initially examined, 22 percent of those assigned to metronidazole and erythromycin and 25 percent of those assigned to placebo delivered prematurely (P = 0.55). The lower rate of preterm delivery among the women with bacterial vaginosis who were assigned to the study treatment was observed both in women at risk because of previous preterm delivery (preterm delivery in the treatment group, 39 percent; and in the placebo group, 57 percent; P = 0.02) and in women who weighed less than 50 kg before pregnancy (preterm delivery in the treatment group, 14 percent; and in the placebo group, 33 percent; P = 0.04).                Treatment with metronidazole and erythromycin reduced rates of premature delivery in women with bacterial vaginosis and an increased risk for preterm delivery.Title 5:Mass antimicrobial treatment in pregnancy. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in a population with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases.Abstract 5:Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are highly prevalent in pregnant women in many developing countries and have been associated with poor obstetric outcomes. Case detection and treatment of STDs in women is problematic and expensive, underscoring the need for other strategies. To explore the potential benefits of routine antimicrobial therapy on pregnancy outcome, we carried out a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial in one of the antenatal clinics in Nairobi, Kenya. Four hundred pregnant women between 28 and 32 weeks' gestation were given a single dose of 250 mg ceftriaxone intramuscularly or a placebo. There was a significant difference between ceftriaxone and placebo-treated women in infant birth weight (3,209 versus 3,056 g, P = .01). In addition, there was a trend toward lower rates of birth weight < 2,500 g (4.0% versus 9.2%, P = .08) and postpartum endometritis (3.8% versus 10.4%, P = .05) in the intervention than in the placebo group. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from the cervixes of postpartum women in 1.8% of the intervention group as compared to 4.2% of the control group. These data suggest a beneficial effect of antimicrobial prophylaxis on pregnancy outcome. Larger studies should be carried out to examine the public health impact of this intervention.Title 6:Prophylactic administration of clindamycin 2% vaginal cream to reduce the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth in women with an increased recurrence risk: a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial.Abstract 6:To test the hypothesis that prophylactic administration of clindamycin 2% vaginal cream can reduce the incidence of preterm birth in a high risk population.                A multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.                Twelve city hospitals in The Netherlands.                One hundred and sixty-eight women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of a spontaneous preterm delivery in the preceding pregnancy.                Clindamycin 2% vaginal cream, or placebo cream, administered daily for seven days at 26 and 32 weeks of gestation.                Spontaneous preterm birth at < 37 weeks, admission for threatened preterm labour, neonatal infectious morbidity.                In the intention-to-treat analysis no difference was found in overall preterm birth between clindamycin and placebo (23% vs 18%, respectively). In the subgroup who completed the trial and administered all medication, more women delivered before 34 weeks in the clindamycin group (1.4% in the placebo vs 9.0% in the clindamycin group; P < 0.05). The length of admissions for threatened preterm labour did not differ. More infectious neonatal morbidity was seen in the clindamycin group (5/83 vs 0/85; P < 0.05).                Clindamycin 2% vaginal cream given prophylactically to women with a spontaneous preterm birth in the preceding pregnancy did not prevent preterm delivery or reduce the number of admissions for threatened preterm labour. The neonatal infectious morbidity in the group treated with clindamycin was significantly higher and a major concern.Title 7:Erythromycin treatment of pregnant women to reduce the incidence of low birth weight and preterm deliveries.Abstract 7:nan","answer":"Antibiotic prophylaxis given during the second or third trimester of pregnancy reduces the risk of prelabour rupture of membranes and postpartum endometritis when given routinely to pregnant women. However there was also a possible substantial bias in the review's results because of a high rate of loss to follow up and small numbers of studies for each of our analyses. So we conclude that there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of routine antibiotics during pregnancy to prevent infectious adverse effect on pregnancy outcomes."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  In this paper we investigate the role of reflection in simulation based learning by manipulating two independent factors that each separately lead to significant learning effects, namely whether students worked alone or in pairs, and what type of support students were provided with. Our finding is that in our simulation based learning task, students learned significantly more when they worked in pairs than when they worked alone. Furthermore, dynamic support implemented with tutorial dialogue agents lead to significantly more learning than no support, while static support was not statistically distinguishable from either of the other two conditions. The largest effect size in comparison with the control condition of individuals working alone with no support was Pairs+Dynamic support, with an effect size of 1.24 standard deviations. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to devise educational systems that provide instruction tailored to the needs of individual learners, as many good teachers do. Research in this field has successfully delivered techniques and systems that provide adaptive support for student problem solving in a variety of domains. There are, however, other educational activities that can benefit from individualized computer-based support, such as studying examples, exploring interactive simulations and playing educational games. Providing individualized support for these activities poses unique challenges, because it requires an ITS that can model and adapt to student behaviors, skills and mental states often not as structured and welldefined as those involved in traditional problem solving. This paper presents a variety of projects that illustrate some of these challenges, our proposed solutions, and future opportunities. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Tutorial Dialog Systems that employ Conversational Agents (CAs) to deliver instructional content to learners in one-on-one tutoring settings have been shown to be effective in multiple learning domains by multiple research groups. Our work focuses on extending this successful learning technology to collaborative learning settings involving two or more learners interacting with one or more agents. Experience from extending existing techniques for developing conversational agents into multiple-learner settings highlights two underlying assumptions from the one-learner setting that do not generalize well to the multiuser setting, and thus cause difficulties. These assumptions include what we refer to as the near-even participation assumption and the known addressee assumption. A new software architecture called Basilica that allows us to address and overcome these limitations is a major contribution of this article. The Basilica architecture adopts an object-oriented approach to represent agents as a network composed of what we refer to as behavioral components because they enable the agents to engage in rich conversational behaviors. Additionally, we describe three specific conversational agents built using Basilica in order to illustrate the desirable properties of this new architecture. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  An emerging trend in classrooms is the use of collaborative learning environments that promote lively exchanges between learners in order to facilitate learning. This paper explored the possibility of using discourse features to predict student and group performance during collaborative learning interactions. We investigated the linguistic patterns of group chats, within an online collaborative learning exercise, on five discourse dimensions using an automated linguistic facility, Coh-Metrix. The results indicated that students who engaged in deeper cohesive integration and generated more complicated syntactic structures performed significantly better. The overall group level results indicated collaborative groups who engaged in deeper cohesive and expository style interactions performed significantly better on posttests. Although students do not directly express knowledge construction and cognitive processes, our results indicate that these states can be monitored by analyzing language and discourse. Implications are discussed regarding computer supported collaborative learning and ITS's to facilitate productive communication in collaborative learning environments.Literature Review:","answer":"Current educational research suggests collaborative learning or group-based learning increases the learning performance of a group as well as individual learning outcomes BIB005 BIB001 . In a collaborative learning environment, students learn in groups via interactions with each other by asking questions, explaining and justifying their opinions, explaining their reasoning, and presenting their knowledge  . A number of researchers have pointed out the importance of a group learning environment and how significantly effective it is in term of learning gain  . Recently, there has been a rise in interest in implementing collaborative learning in tutoring systems to show the benefits obtained from interactions among students during problem solving. Kumar and Rose, in 2011, built intelligent interactive tutoring systems CycleTalk and WrenchTalk that support collaborative learning environments in the engineering domain BIB003 . Teams of two or more students work on the same task when solving a problem. They conducted a number of experiments to investigate the effectiveness of collaborative learning and how to engage the students more deeply in instructional conversations with the tutors using teaching techniques such as Attention Grabbing, Ask when Ready and Social Interaction Strategies. It was found that students who worked in pairs learned better than students who worked individually BIB004 BIB002 . Another tutoring system that supports collaborative learning is described in  for teaching mathematical fractions."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

Despite much recent progress, this task is still challenging mainly due to high nonlinearity in the spatial domain. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture, Frequency Domain Transformer Network (FDTN), which is an end-to-end learnable model that estimates and uses the transformations of the signal in the frequency domain. Experimental evaluations show that this approach can outperform some widely used video prediction methods like Video Ladder Network (VLN) and Predictive Gated Pyramids (PGP).Cited Abstract(s):[1]: In this thesis, a recently proposed bilinear model for predicting spatiotemporal data has been implemented and extended. The model was trained in an unsupervised manner and uses spatiotemporal synchrony to encode transformations between inputs of a sequence up to a time t, in order to predict the next input at t + 1. A convolutional version of the model was developed in order to reduce the number of parameters and improve the predictive capabilities. The original and the convolutional models were tested and compared on a dataset containing videos of bouncing balls and both versions are able to predict the motion of the balls. The developed convolutional version halved the 4-step prediction loss while reducing the number of parameters by a factor of 159 compared to the original model. Some important differences between the models are discussed in the thesis and suggestions for further improvements of the convolutional model are identified and presented.[2]: A fundamental operation in many vision tasks, including motion understanding, stereopsis, visual odometry, or invariant recognition, is establishing correspondences between images or between images and data from other modalities. Recently, there has been increasing interest in learning to infer correspondences from data using relational, spatiotemporal, and bilinear variants of deep learning methods. These methods use multiplicative interactions between pixels or between features to represent correlation patterns across multiple images. In this paper, we review the recent work on relational feature learning, and we provide an analysis of the role that multiplicative interactions play in learning to encode relations. We also discuss how square-pooling and complex cell models can be viewed as a way to represent multiplicative interactions and thereby as a way to encode relations.[3]: We propose modeling time series by representing the transformations that take a frame at time t to a frame at time t+1. To this end we show how a bi-linear model of transformations, such as a gated autoencoder, can be turned into a recurrent network, by training it to predict future frames from the current one and the inferred transformation using backprop-through-time. We also show how stacking multiple layers of gating units in a recurrent pyramid makes it possible to represent the \\"syntax\\" of complicated time series, and that it can outperform standard recurrent neural networks in terms of prediction accuracy on a variety of tasks.","answer":"Another well-known model is PGP [3] , which is based on a gated auto-encoder and the bilinear transformation model of RAE [2] . PGP has the assumption that two temporally consecutive frames can be described as a linear transformation of each other. In the PGP model, by using a bi-linear model, the hidden layer of mapping units encodes the transformation. These transformation encodings are then used to predict the next frame. Conv-PGP [1] reduces the number of parameters significantly, by utilizing convolutional layers."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR4,7,8) are widely distributed in the basal ganglia. Injection of group III mGluR agonists into the striatopallidal complex alleviates parkinsonian symptoms in 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats. In vitro rodent studies have suggested that this may be partly due to modulation of synaptic transmission at striatopallidal and corticostriatal synapses through mGluR4 activation. However, the in vivo electrophysiological effects of group III mGluRs activation upon basal ganglia neurons activity in nonhuman primates remain unknown. Thus, in order to examine the anatomical substrates and physiological effects of group III mGluRs activation upon striatal and pallidal neurons in monkeys, we used electron microscopy immunohistochemistry to localize mGluR4, combined with local administration of the group III mGluR agonist L-AP4, or the mGluR4 positive allosteric modulator VU0155041, to assess the effects of group III mGluR activation on the firing rate and pattern of striatal and pallidal neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated parkinsonian monkeys. At the ultrastructural level, striatal mGluR4 immunoreactivity was localized in pre- (60%) and post-synaptic (30%) elements, while in the GPe, mGluR4 was mainly expressed pre-synaptically (90%). In the putamen, terminals expressing mGluR4 were evenly split between putative excitatory and inhibitory terminals, while in the GPe, most labeled terminals displayed the ultrastructural features of striatal-like inhibitory terminals, though putative excitatory boutons were also labeled. No significant difference was found between normal and parkinsonian monkeys. Extracellular recordings in awake MPTP-treated monkeys revealed that local microinjections of small volumes of L-AP4 resulted in increased firing rates in one half of striatal cells and one third of pallidal cells, while a significant number of neurons in both structures showed either opposite effects, or did not display any significant rate changes following L-AP4 application. VU0155041 administration had little effect on firing rates. Both compounds also had subtle effects on bursting and oscillatory properties, acting to increase the irregularity of firing. The occurrence of pauses in firing was reduced in the majority (80%) of GPe neurons after L-AP4 injection. Our findings indicate that glutamate can mediate multifarious physiological effects upon striatal and pallidal neurons through activation of pre-synaptic group III mGluRs at inhibitory and excitatory synapses in parkinsonian monkeys.

IPE within healthcare programs has been associated with improved collaborative behavior , patient care and satisfaction , reduced clinical error , and diminished negative professional stereotypes . An intensive interprofessional gross anatomy dissection course was created in 2009 to facilitate IPE at McMaster University . Data were collected from five cohorts over five years to determine the influence of this IPE format on the attitudes and perceptions of students towards other health professions . Each year , 28 students from the medicine , midwifery , nursing , physician 's assistant , physiotherapy , and occupational therapy programs were r and omly assigned into interprofessional teams for 10 weeks . Sessions involved an anatomy and scopeâofâ practice presentation , a smallâgroup caseâbased session , and a dissection . A before/after design measured changes in attitudes and perceptions , while focus group data elaborated on the student experience with the course . Preâ and postmatched data revealed significant improvements in positive professional identity , competency and autonomy , role clarity and attitudes toward other health professions . Qualitative analysis of intraprofessional focus group interviews revealed meaningful improvements in a number of areas including learning anatomy , role clarity , and attitudes towards other health professions .

Methods Nursing students were r and omly assigned to either the interprofessional simulation-based education or traditional course group .  A before- and -after study of nursing students â attitudes toward the program was conducted using the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale . Responses to an open-ended question were categorized using thematic content analysis . Nursing students â knowledge about operating room nursing was measured . Results Nursing students from the  interprofessional simulation-based education group showed statistically different responses to four of the nineteen questions in the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale , reflecting a more positive attitude toward interprofessional learning . This was also supported by thematic content analysis of the open-ended responses . Furthermore , nursing students in the simulation-based education group had a significant improvement in knowledge about operating room nursing . Conclusions The integrated course with interprofessional education and simulation provided a positive impact on undergraduate nursing students â perceptions toward interprofessional learning and knowledge about operating room nursing . Our study demonstrated that this course may be a valuable elective option for undergraduate nursing students in operating room nursing educationTitle 3:Facilitating Implementation of Interprofessional Collaborative Practices into Primary Care: A Trilogy of Driving ForcesAbstract 3:EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Implementing  interprofessional collaborative practice s in primary care is challenging , and research about its facilitating factors remains scarce . The goal of this participatory action research study was to better underst and the driving forces during the early stage of the implementation process of a communityâdriven and patientâfocused program in primary care titled â TRANSforming InTerprofessional cardiovascular disease prevention in primary care â ( TRANSIT ) . Eight primary care clinics in Quebec , Canada , agreed to participate by creating and implementing an interprofessional facilitation team ( IFT ) .  Sixtyâthree participants volunteered to be part of an IFT , and 759 patients agreed to participate . We r and omized six clinics into a supported facilitation ( â supported â ) group , with an external facilitator ( EF ) and financial incentives for participants . We assigned two clinics to an unsupported facilitation ( â unsupported â ) group , with no EF or financial incentives . After 3 months , we held one interview for the two EFs . After 6 months , we held eight focus groups with IFT members and another interview with each EF . The analyses revealed three key forces : ( 1 ) opportunity for dialogue through the IFT , ( 2 ) active role of the EF , and ( 3 ) change implementation budgets . Decisionmakers design ing implementation plans for interprofessional programs should ensure that these driving forces are activated . Further research should examine how these forces affect interprofessional practice s and patient outcomesTitle 4:Getting a head start: high-fidelity, simulation-based operating room team training of interprofessional students.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND Effective teamwork in the operating room ( OR ) is often undermined by the \\" silo mentality \\" of the differing professions . Such thinking is formed early in one 's professional experience and is fostered by undergraduate medical and nursing curricula lacking interprofessional education . We investigated the immediate impact of conducting interprofessional student OR team training  using high-fidelity simulation ( HFS ) on students ' team-related attitudes and behaviors . STUDY DESIGN  Ten HFS OR interprofessional student team training sessions were conducted involving 2 st and ardized HFS scenarios , each of which was followed by a structured debriefing that targeted team-based competencies . Pre- and post-session mean scores were calculated and analyzed for 15 Likert-type items measuring self-efficacy in teamwork competencies using the t-test . Additionally , mean scores of observer ratings of team performance after each scenario and participant ratings after the second scenario for an 11-item Likert-type teamwork scale were calculated and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and t-test . RESULTS Eighteen nursing students , 20 nurse anesthetist students , and 28 medical students participated in the training . Statistically significant gains from mean pre- to post-training scores occurred on 11 of the 15 self-efficacy items . Statistically significant gains in mean observer performance scores were present on all 3 subscales of the teamwork scale from the first scenario to the second . A statistically significant difference was found in comparisons of mean observer scores with mean participant scores for the team-based behaviors subscale . CONCLUSIONS High-fidelity simulation OR interprofessional student team training improves students '  team-based attitudes and behaviors . Students tend to overestimate their team-based behaviorsTitle 5:Patient safety education: an exploration of student-driven contextual learning.Abstract 5:Medical and nursing students organized a context ual interprofessional learning experience involving observation of surgical safety practice s according to the parameters of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) surgical safety checklist . Students were oriented to patient safety principles , operating room ( OR ) protocol , and the WHO surgical safety checklist . One hundred thirty students participated in interprofessional OR visitations . Selected students participated in focus groups , during which feedback regarding educational value and OR observations was obtained : Students thought that patient safety education was more meaningful in a clinical setting , and the degree of interprofessional collaboration appeared related to individual factors . Focus group data collected provides a foundation on which future research can build . Areas of inquiry may include development of teamwork within the context of interprofessional education , examination of the role of students in developing their own curricula , and r and omized comparisons of clinical -based and classroom-based approaches to surgical safety education","answer":"Findings suggest that more studies with rigorous research design s are needed to compare outcomes for interprofessional interventions and to determine the effectiveness of IPE on patient outcomes"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

.a multitude of diagnostic tests like ultrasound , thyroid nuclear scan , and fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) is available to the clinician for evaluation of thyroid nodule .fnac is considered the gold standard diagnostic test in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule , and other tests like ultrasound and nuclear scan should be used in conjunction with fnac .fnac is simple , cost effective , readily repeated , and quick to perform procedure in the outpatient department with excellent patient compliance .important factor for the satisfactory test includes representative specimen from the nodule and an experienced cytologist to interpret findings .the prevalence of thyroid nodules ranges from 4% to10% in the general adult population and from 0.2% to 1.2% in children .the majority of clinically diagnosed thyroid nodules are nonneoplastic ; only 5%30% are malignant and require surgical intervention .fnac is , however , not without limitations ; accuracy is lower in suspicious cytology and in follicular neoplasms .the main aim of fnac is to identify nodules that require surgery and those benign nodules that can be observed clinically and decrease the overall thyroidectomy rate in patients with benign diseases .the present study was undertaken to correlate the fnac findings with histopathology so that rate of unnecessary thyoidectomies in benign pathologies should be avoided .this is a prospective analysis of seventy five consecutive patients of clinically diagnosed solitary thyroid nodule who presented to the department of surgery , government medical college jammu , and department of ent , smgs hospital , jammu ( india ) between january 2003 and december 2005 .all patients were evaluated by thorough clinical examination followed by routine investigations including haemogram , renal function tests , liver function tests , chest x - ray , lateral neck x - ray , thyroid function tests and , fnac .inclusion criteria included clinically detected solitary thyroid nodule and euthyroid patients with normal thyroid function tests .patients with abnormal thyroid function tests ( hypothyroid / hyperthyroid ) and multiple thyroid nodules were excluded from the study .fnac was performed with 23 gauge needle , smears were fixed with ether-95% alcohol solution , and staining was performed using papanicolau 's staining .after fnac , all the patients were subjected to surgery after preoperative preparation and anaesthesia checkup .specimens were processed in automated tissue processing units and staining was performed with routine haematoxylin and eosin stain .sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value were calculated for neoplastic and carcinomatous lesions .a total of 75 patients with solitary thyroid nodule were identified : 6 ( 8% ) were male and 69 ( 92% ) were females .age of the patients ranged from 22 to 58 years with mean age of 38.7 years .51 ( 68% ) patients were from plain areas and 24 ( 32% ) were residents of hilly areas .duration of complaints ranged from six days to twenty years and mean duration was 1.7 years .fnac results revealed 39 ( 52% ) cases as colloid nodular goitre , 12 ( 16% ) as follicular neoplasm , 9 ( 12% ) as papillary carcinoma , 6 ( 8% ) as hurthle cell lesions , 6 ( 8% ) as benign cystic lesions , and 3 ( 4% ) cases as

Abnormalities of red blood cells and platelets arising from the clonal rearrangement of hematopoietic cells have been considered, although causal relationships between any of these specific abnormalities and thrombosis have not been clearly established. The involvement of neutrophils and macrophages, which participate in thrombosis and hemostasis, has been insufficiently explored in PV and ET. Persistent activation of circulating neutrophils was recently demonstrated in ET and PV patients, in parallel with an increase in plasma concentrations of endothelial damage-derived and prothrombotic substances. Other studies have explored whether the augmentation of adhesion of neutrophils may affect neutrophil/platelet interaction since a significant increase in circulating neutrophil/platelet aggregates is found in ET and PV. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of thrombosis in PV and ET, with emphasis on the role of neutrophils in hemostasis and their possible involvement in the mechanisms of the acquired thrombophilia of these patients. Available data suggest that these hemostatic markers deserve to be included in prospective clinical studies aimed at identifying their predictive role in the vascular complications of patients with ET and PV.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"neutrophils\\", \\"vascular\\", \\"platelet\\", \\"macrophages\\", \\"platelets\\", \\"endothelial\\", \\"red blood cells\\", \\"hematopoietic cells\\", \\"plasma\\", \\"neutrophil\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

boltzmann(eb ) equations in the cpt to our maxwell - einstein - boltzmann(meb ) equations , which describe the perturbation evolution under both the gravity and em interaction . with the inclusion of plasma effectswe derive not only cmb ion - acoustic oscillations but also baryon ion - acoustic oscillations .the paper is organized as follow . in sec .ii , we justify that the plasma conditions apply in the universe during pre - decoupling and post - reionization era . based on this justification ,we generalize the eb equation to the meb equation in sec.iii .the cmb and baryon ion - acoustic wave equations are then derived , respectively , in sec.iv and v. finally , we discuss the significance of plasma effects on cosmological perturbation .by saying \`\` the universe is in plasma state '' , we mean that relevant entities in the universe satisfy plasma conditions and hence the universe can be modelled as a plasma .as is said that a plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective behavior@xcite , two criteria  quasineutrality and collectiveness must be fulfilled for the universe . as a perfectly uniform plasma is charge neutral andhas no net electrostatic potential due to the perfect debye shielding , the inevitable thermal fluctuations of its electron density at finite temperature would , however , induce a non - vanishing residual electrostatic potential of the ion that defies the debye shielding .such a residual electric force exerts an additional pressure on ions ( baryons ) which will be incorperated into the cpt to display the ion - acoustic behavior in the meb equation in the following sections .the quasineutrality now means that the scale of interests ( i.e. the size of the universe ) is much larger than than the debye length : @xmath1 this makes the system is neutral enough so that one can take @xmath2 and not so neutral that all interesting em interactions vanish . in addition ,collective behaviors require enough particles inside the debye sphere : @xmath3    before decoupling ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 with the present photon temperature and number density @xmath7 and @xmath8 and redshift @xmath9 .these information renders @xmath10    after reionization , @xmath11 .as indicated observationally , the redshift of reionization @xmath12 ranges as @xmath13 @xcite and the reionization temperature @xmath14 is at least higher than @xmath15 .similarly , @xmath16    the plasma conditions are apparently satified in both pre - decoupling and post - reionization era and , therefore , our plasma treatment is applicable .before decoupling , the eb equations can be derived systematically@xcite to account for the couplings between cosmological components . the equation displaying the acoustic feature on cmb spectrumis then rendered from these coupled equation . following this systematical way ,our meb equation is deduced by introducing the em force appropriately and combining it with gravity for the boltzmann equation of baryons .the most general form of boltzmann equation is @xmath17 , label{boltzmann} ] ] where @xmath18 is the distribution function and @xmath19  ] characterizes the collision terms . in cpt , the distribution function @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath20 with energy @xmath21 and momentum @xmath22 , moving in direction @xmath23 at @xmath24 . for radiations ( relativistic species ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for matter with mass @xmath27 .since the collective behavior emerges in the eb equation for baryons and photon eb equations remain unchanged , we present only the derivation of modification for baryons . following the convention as in ref . , the lhs of the boltzmann equation is written as @xmath28 in equilibrium , the distribution function depends only on the length of the momentum , i.e. the energy @xmath29 and not on its direction @xmath30 , so its dependence on @xmath30 should emerge from perturbations and be of the order .therefore @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both first oorder terms and the last term in eq.([bol ] ) is negligible in the linear theory .choosing the conformal newtonian gauge , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the scale factor , @xmath35 the newtonian gravity and @xmath36 the space curvature , the constraint @xmath37 renders the four -

Please write a few sentences synthesizing the findings of these reports, which could serve as a conclusion section for a systematic review article. Your response should not include any other text. The RCT reports are below.Title 1:Closure of the subcutaneous dead space and wound disruption after Cesarean delivery.Abstract 1:To determine whether suture closure of subcutaneous dead space decreases wound disruption after Cesarean delivery.                All patients undergoing Cesarean delivery at the New England Medical Center from September 1995 to June 1997 were eligible. One group (162 patients) was randomly assigned to have the subcutaneous fat layer closed with a running 3-0 plain suture. The other group (165 patients) had this layer left unclosed. Both groups had careful hemostasis of this layer with cautery and copious irrigation. All laboring and ruptured patients received prophylactic antibiotics. The patients were followed for 6 weeks after delivery for wound disruption.                No significant differences were noted between the two groups with respect to demographic, obstetric, or surgical characteristics or loss to follow-up. Excluding those lost to follow-up (27 closed vs. 22 unclosed), there was no difference in wound infection (11 (8.1%) closed vs. 13 (9.1%) unclosed, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.14, 2.08). There were decreases in risk of skin separation (three (2.2%) vs. six (4.2%), RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42, 1.93) and seroma or hematoma formation (two (1.5%) vs. seven (4.9%), RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06, 1.43) that were not statistically significant. Decreases that were not statistically significant were also noted for any wound disruption (14 (10.4%) vs. 21 (14.7%), RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37, 1.33) and non-infected wound complication (three (2.2%) vs. eight (5.6%), RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11, 1.47). Increasing gravidity and parity, and Cesarean delivery performed for failure to progress were independent risk factors for any wound complication. Controlling for these factors did not alter the effect of subcutaneous closure.                Closure of the subcutaneous space does not increase and may protect against wound complications in patients undergoing Cesarean delivery.Title 2:Does closure of Camper fascia reduce the incidence of post-cesarean superficial wound disruption?Abstract 2:To determine whether closure of Camper fascia prevents the development of superficial wound disruption after cesarean delivery.                During a 1-year period, 438 women undergoing cesarean delivery were randomized into groups with and without approximation of Camper fascia with absorbable suture during closure of the abdominal incision. All women received routine postoperative care following our departmental guidelines. We reviewed charts after the puerperium to identify women with postoperative superficial wound disruption and to obtain demographic and delivery information for analysis.                We found a significantly higher incidence of wound disruption in the group without the suture than in those in whom the tissue was approximated (P = .03). Four or more vaginal examinations and higher body mass index were also associated with a higher incidence of wound disruption (P = .05 and P = .04, respectively). Logistic regression correction for covariables that might influence the results of our main analysis revealed no effect of maternal age, parity, indications for cesarean delivery, duration of labor, duration of ruptured membranes, duration of surgery, use of internal monitoring, type of incision, use of antibiotic prophylaxis, surgeon's level of training, or maternal diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension.                Approximation of Camper fascia with absorbable suture at closure of the abdominal incision during cesarean delivery appears to protect against postoperative superficial wound disruption and is therefore recommended.Title 3:Blunt-tipped versus sharp-tipped needles: wound morbidity.Abstract 3:Blunt-tipped needles have previously been shown to reduce needle-stick injury but the issue of morbidity had not been addressed. As awareness of the need for universal precautions heightens, concerns have been raised about any possible morbidity brought about by their use. We present the results of a randomised, controlled study which investigated wound morbidity following caesarean section. Of the 204 women randomised to closure with sharp or blunt-tipped needles, none developed anything other than superficial infection and there were no significant differences between the two groups. We conclude that the use of blunt-tipped needles does not cause an increase in wound morbidity.Title 4:Subcutaneous drain vs. suture in obese women undergoing cesarean delivery. A prospective, randomized trial.Abstract 4:To determine if subcutaneous drain or closure of the subcutaneous layer decreases the incidence of wound complications in obese women undergoing cesarean delivery.                Seventy-six obese women undergoing cesarean delivery and with at least 2 cm of subcutaneous fat were randomized to one of three groups: group 1 had suture closure of the subcutaneous tissue, group 2 had placement of a subcutaneous closed suction drain, and group 3 had neither suture closure nor drainage.                Wound separation occurred in 12 (15.8%), seroma in 5 (6.6%) and infection in 3 (4%). There were no reports of wound hematoma. The overall incidence of any wound complication (infection, separation, seroma, hematoma) was higher in obese women who received neither subcutaneous suture nor drain as compared to obese women who received either subcutaneous suture closure or subcutaneous drain. The incidence of major wound complications (infection or separation) was also higher in obese women who received neither subcutaneous suture or drain compared to obese women who received either subcutaneous suture closure or subcutaneous drain.                The use of closed suction drainage in the subcutaneous space may reduce the incidence of postoperative wound complications in obese women who have at least 2 cm of subcutaneous fat and undergo cesarean delivery.Title 5:Subcutaneous stitch closure versus subcutaneous drain to prevent wound disruption after cesarean delivery: a randomized clinical trial.Abstract 5:The purpose of this study was to compare a subcutaneous stitch closure and subcutaneous drain placement for the risk of wound disruption after cesarean delivery.                This was a prospective randomized clinical trial that evaluated subcutaneous stitch closure, placement of a subcutaneous drain, or no closure for subsequent wound disruption risk in women with subcutaneous depth at >or=2 cm.                The maternal demographics and intrapartum risk factors for postoperative wound disruptions were similar among the 964 study subjects, who were divided into 3 groups. Wound disruptions that required opening of the wound, irrigation, debridement, packing, and/or secondary delayed closure occurred in 9.7% of the women with no closure, 10.4% of the women in the stitch closure group, and 10.3% of the women in the closed drain group (P =.834).                There appears to be no difference in the subsequent risk of wound complications when no closure of the subcutaneous tissue layers occurs versus suture closure or a closed drainage system.Title 6:Subcutaneous tissue approximation in relation to wound disruption after cesarean delivery in obese women.Abstract 6:To test the hypothesis that closure of the subcutaneous fat decreases the incidence of wound disruption after cesarean delivery.                Two hundred forty-five women with at least 2 cm of subcutaneous fat were randomized to closure of the Camper fascia or no closure with cesarean delivery.                Complications leading to disruption or opening of the incision were classified as wound seromas in 28 women (11.4%) and as wound infections in 17 (7.0%). The relative risk (RR) of seroma formation in the subcutaneous closure group was 0.3 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.1-0.7 (5.1 versus 17.2%), a statistically significant difference. There was no significant difference in the incidence of wound infections in the two study groups. Overall, there was a significant difference in the incidence of wound disruption from all causes between the two groups: 14.5% in the subcutaneous closure group compared with 26.6% when the subcutaneous tissues were not reapproximated (RR 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9).                Closure of the subcutaneous tissue can significantly reduce the rate of postoperative wound disruption in women with at least 2 cm of subcutaneous adipose tissue.","answer":"Implications for practiceClosure of the subcutaneous fat may reduce wound complications but it is unclear to what extent these differences affect the well-being and satisfaction of the women concerned.Implications for researchFurther trials are justified to investigate whether the apparent increased risk of haematoma or seroma with non-closure of the subcutaneous fat is real. These should use a broader range of short- and long-term outcomes, and ensure that they are adequately powered to detect clinically important differences. Further research comparing blunt and sharp needles is justified, as are trials evaluating suturing materials and suturing techniques for the rectus sheath."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Using cDNAs for the mu and the kappa opioid receptors, we mapped the chromosomal locations of their genes in mouse. Multilocus cross analysis located the mu receptor gene Oprm on Chr 10 and the kappa receptor gene Oprk1 on Chr 1. Both genes are near centromere, with no markers more centromeric. These data indicate that the two opioid receptors are different gene products, ruling out the possibility that they may be differential splicing products from the same gene.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"enkephalins\\", \\"fentanyl\\", \\"morphine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"mu receptor\\", \\"endogenous opioid peptides\\", \\"endorphins\\", \\"Oprm\\", \\"kappa receptor\\", \\"Oprk1\\", \\"mu and kappa opioid receptor\\", \\"Opioid receptors\\", \\"mu and the kappa opioid receptors\\", \\"opioid receptors\\", \\"enkephalins\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

The mechanisms of toxicity of cyclosporine A (CsA) were studied in primary cultures of individually microdissected rabbit and human renal tubules of proximal and distal regions of the nephron. A direct toxic effect of CsA on renal tubule epithelia was demonstrated using nigrosine uptake and LDH release as indicators of cell death. Proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) and proximal straight tubules (PST) were shown to be highly sensitive, while thick ascending limbs of Henle (TAL) were much less sensitive and cortical collecting tubules (CCT) relatively resistant. The effects of CsA were time and dose dependent over the range 50 ng/ml to 100 micrograms/ml. Protection against CsA-induced PST cell death was afforded by reduction in extracellular calcium levels in the media or addition of the calcium entry antagonists : verapamil , nifedipine or diltiazem . In addition, treatment with the cysteine protease inhibitor, E64, attenuated CsA-induced cell damage. A role for the lysosomal cysteine proteases (cathepsins), however, was ruled out on the basis of identical activity levels in all cell types; no beneficial effects of lysosomal enzyme depletion and no evidence of lysosomal rupture prior to death. By contrast, a role for the cytoplasmic, calcium-dependent cysteine protease calpain was suggested since activity levels were significantly higher in PST than CCT cultures and were inducible by CsA.sentence: Protection against CsA-induced PST cell death was afforded by reduction in extracellular calcium levels in the media or addition of the calcium entry antagonists : verapamil , nifedipine or diltiazem .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

OBJECTIVE: Many studies have suggested that there is a possible hormonal dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and an increased cortisol clearance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Therefore in this study, we have examined the role of glucocorticoid receptor / s (GR) characteristics in the developing of these abnormalities in patients with PCOS. METHOD: For this purpose, the number and affinity of GR in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) of 10 patients with PCOS and 10 healthy women (controls) were determined. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the number (6500 + /-1001 sites / cell and 6352 + /-1697 sites / cell, respectively; P > 0. 05) and affinity (3. 93 + /-0. 89 nM and 4. 49 + /-0. 71 nM, respectively; P > 0. 05) of GR between the PCOS patients and the controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the alterations in the HPA axis and in the cortisol metabolism observed in PCOS are not related to GR deficiency.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"mononuclear leukocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"GR\\", \\"glucocorticoid receptor / s\\", \\"Glucocorticoid receptors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the responses of cultured oviduct mucosal cells to exogenous estradiol treatment in regulating the mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors. METHODS: The mucosal layer of the ampullary regions of the human oviduct was isolated and cultured with (study groups) or without (control group) the addition of exogenous estradiol in five different concentrations. Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed on the oviduct mucosal cells before and after the 6-day culture. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptors, both KDR and flt-1, between the five study groups and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptors is not altered by exogenous estradiol treatment in cultured oviduct. This helps to explain the mechanism of temporal regulation of VEGF in human oviduct, which reaches the peak level in the peri-ovulatory stage when both the serum estradiol and gonadotropins concentrations are high.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"vascular endothelial growth factor\\", \\"flt-1\\", \\"KDR\\", \\"VEGF\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A kappa B-site was identified in the promoter of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene, which is involved in regulation of ICAM-1 expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and glucocorticoids. We now report on the transcription factors which bind and transactivate this enhancer sequence. In vitro, the ICAM-1 kappa B site appeared to bind RelA and c-Rel homodimers as well as heterodimers with NF-kappa B1, but weakly NF-kappa B1 homodimers. In addition, both RelA and c-Rel, but not NF-kappa B1, were shown to transactivate an ICAM-1 kappa B-reporter construct. In monocytic THP-1 cells TNF-alpha induced two nuclear complexes which in vitro bound to the ICAM-1 kappa B site. Using antibodies in an electrophoretic mobility supershift assay, one of these complexes was shown to contain NF-kappa B1 and RelA, and to bind with higher affinity to the consensus kappa B site in the HIV long terminal repeat. The second complex contained RelA, and exhibited higher affinity towards the ICAM-1 kappa B than to the HIV kappa B site. The glucocorticoid receptor was shown to repress activity of both the RelA homodimer and the NF-kappa B1 / RelA heterodimer. We argue that in vivo RelA homodimers are likely to play a dominant role in TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 transcription in monocytic cells.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"monocytic THP - 1 cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"monocytic cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"ICAM - 1 kappa B\\", \\"ICAM - 1 kappa B site\\", \\"consensus kappa B site\\", \\"ICAM - 1 promoter\\", \\"ICAM - 1 kappa B - reporter construct\\", \\"kappa B - site\\", \\"HIV long terminal repeat\\", \\"enhancer sequence\\", \\"HIV kappa B site\\", \\"intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 (ICAM - 1) gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"RelA\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor alpha\\", \\"/ RelA\\", \\"ICAM - 1\\", \\"RelA homodimers\\", \\"NF - kappa B1 homodimers\\", \\"c - Rel homodimers\\", \\"RelA homodimer\\", \\"c - Rel\\", \\"glucocorticoid receptor\\", \\"TNF - alpha\\", \\"intercellular adhesion molecule - 1\\", \\"nuclear complexes\\", \\"NF - kappa B / Rel family members\\", \\"NF - kappa B1\\", \\"NF - kappa B1 / RelA heterodimer\\", \\"transcription factors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

One of the most prominent pre-trained language models is BERT (Bi-directional Encoders for Transformers), which was released as an English as well as a multilingual version. Although multilingual BERT performs well on many tasks, recent studies showed that BERT models trained on a single language significantly outperform the multilingual results. Training a Dutch BERT model thus has a lot of potential for a wide range of Dutch NLP tasks. While previous approaches have used earlier implementations of BERT to train their Dutch BERT, we used RoBERTa, a robustly optimized BERT approach, to train a Dutch language model called RobBERT. We show that RobBERT improves state of the art results in Dutch-specific language tasks, and also outperforms other existing Dutch BERT-based models in sentiment analysis. These results indicate that RobBERT is a powerful pre-trained model for fine-tuning for a large variety of Dutch language tasks. We publicly release this pre-trained model in hope of supporting further downstream Dutch NLP applications.Related WorkTransformer models have been successfully used for a wide range of language tasks. Initially, transformers were introduced for use in machine translation, where they vastly improved state-of-the-art results for English to German in an efficient manner BIBREF0. This transformer model architecture resulted in a new paradigm in NLP with the migration from sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks to transformer-based models by removing the recurrent component and only keeping attention. This cornerstone was used for BERT, a transformer model that obtained state-of-the-art results for eleven natural language processing tasks, such as question answering and natural language inference BIBREF4. BERT is pre-trained with large corpora of text using two unsupervised tasks. The first task is word masking (also called the Cloze task BIBREF9 or masked language model (MLM)), where the model has to guess which word is masked in certain position in the text. The second task is next sentence prediction. This is done by predicting if two sentences are subsequent in the corpus, or if they are randomly sampled from the corpus. These tasks allowed the model to create internal representations about a language, which could thereafter be reused for different language tasks. This architecture has been shown to be a general language model that could be fine-tuned with little data in a relatively efficient way for a very distinct range of tasks and still outperform previous architectures BIBREF4.Transformer models are also capable of generating contextualized word embeddings. These contextualized embeddings were presented by BIBREF3 and addressed the well known issue with a word's meaning being defined by its context (e.g. âa stickâ versus âlet's stick toâ). This lack of context is something that traditional word embeddings like word2vec BIBREF10 or GloVe BIBREF11 lack, whereas BERT automatically incorporates the context a word occurs in.Another advantage of transformer models is that attention allows them to better resolve coreferences between words BIBREF12. A typical example for the importance of coreference resolution is âThe trophy doesnât fit in the brown suitcase because itâs too big.â, where the word âitâ would refer to the the suitcase instead of the trophy if the last word was changed to âsmallâ BIBREF13. Being able to resolve these coreferences is for example important for translating to languages with gender, as suitcase and trophy have different genders in French.Although BERT has been shown to be a useful language model, it has also received some scrutiny on the training and pre-processing of the language model. As mentioned before, BERT uses next sentence prediction (NSP) as one of its two training tasks. In NSP, the model has to predict whether two sentences follow each other in the training text, or are just randomly selected from the corpora. The authors of RoBERTa BIBREF5 showed that while this task made the model achieve a better performance, it was not due to its intended reason, as it might merely predict relatedness rather than subsequent sentences. That BIBREF4 trained a better model when using NSP than without NSP is likely due to the model learning long-range dependencies in text from its inputs, which are longer than just the single sentence on itself. As such, the RoBERTa model uses only the MLM task, and uses multiple full sentences in every input. Other research improved the NSP task by instead making the model predict the correct order of two sentences, where the model thus has to predict whether the sentences occur in the given order in the corpus, or occur in flipped order BIBREF14.BIBREF4 also presented a multilingual model (mBERT) with the same architecture as BERT, but trained on Wikipedia corpora in 104 languages. Unfortunately, the quality of these multilingual embeddings is often considered worse than their monolingual counterparts. BIBREF15 illustrated this difference in quality for German and English models in a generative setting. The monolingual French CamemBERT model BIBREF7 also compared their model to mBERT, which performed poorer on all tasks. More recently, BIBREF8 also showed similar results for Dutch using their BERTje model, outperforming multilingual BERT in a wide range of tasks, such as sentiment analysis and part-of-speech tagging. Since this work is concurrent with ours, we compare our results with BERTje in this paper.Pre-training RobBERTThis section describes the data and training regime we used to train our Dutch RoBERTa-based language model called RobBERT.Pre-training RobBERT ::: DataWe pre-trained our model on the Dutch section of the OSCAR corpus, a large multilingual corpus which was obtained by language classification in the Common Crawl corpus BIBREF16. This Dutch corpus has 6.6 billion words, totalling 39 GB of text. It contains 126,064,722 lines of text, where each line can contain multiple sentences. Subsequent lines are however not related to each other, due to the shuffled nature of the OSCAR data set. For comparison, the French RoBERTa-based language model CamemBERT BIBREF7 has been trained on the French portion of OSCAR, which consists of 138 GB of scraped text.Our data differs in several ways from the data used to train BERTje, a BERT-based Dutch language model BIBREF8. Firstly, they trained the model on an assembly of multiple Dutch corpora totalling only 12 GB. Secondly, they used WordPiece as subword embeddings, since this is what the original BERT architecture uses. RobBERT on the other hand uses Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which is also used by GPT-2 BIBREF2 and RoBERTa BIBREF5.EvaluationWe evaluated RobBERT in several different settings on multiple downstream tasks. First, we compare its performance with other BERT-models and state-of-the-art systems in sentiment analysis, to show its performance for classification tasks. Second, we compare its performance in a recent Dutch language task, namely the disambiguation of demonstrative pronouns, which allows us to additionally compare the zero-shot performance of our and other BERT models, i.e. using only the pre-trained model without any fine-tuning.Evaluation ::: Sentiment AnalysisWe replicated the high-level sentiment analysis task used to evaluate BERTje BIBREF8 to be able to compare our methods. This task uses a dataset called Dutch Book Reviews Dataset (DBRD), in which book reviews scraped from hebban.nl are labeled as positive or negative BIBREF19. Although the dataset contains 118,516 reviews, only 22,252 of these reviews are actually labeled as positive or negative. The DBRD dataset is already split in a balanced 10% test and 90% train split, allowing us to easily compare to other models trained for solving this task. This dataset was released in a paper analysing the performance of an ULMFiT model (Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification model) BIBREF19.We fine-tuned RobBERT on the first 10,000 training examples as well as on the full data set. While the ULMFiT model is first fine-tuned using the unlabeled reviews before training the classifier BIBREF19, it is unclear whether BERTje also first fine-tuned on the unlabeled reviews or only used the labeled data for fine-tuning the pretrained model. It is also unclear how it dealt with reviews being longer than the maximum number of tokens allowed as input in BERT models, as the average book review length is 547 tokens, with 40% of the documents being longer than our RobBERT model can handle. For a safe comparison, we thus decided to discard the unlabeled data and only use the labeled data for training and test purposes (20,028 and 2,224 examples respectively), and compare approaches for dealing with too long input sequences. We trained our model for 2000 iterations with a batch size of 128 and a warm-up of 500 iterations, reaching a learning rate of 10^{-5}. We found that our model performed better when trained on the last part of the book reviews than on the first part. This is likely due to this part containing concluding remarks summarizing the overall sentiment. While BERTje was slightly outperformed by ULMFiT BIBREF8, BIBREF19, we can see that RobBERT achieves better performance than both on the test set, although the performance difference is not statistically significantly better than the ULMFiT model, as can be seen in Table TABREF4.Evaluation ::: Die/Dat DisambiguationAside from classic natural language processing tasks in previous subsections, we also evaluated its performance on a task that is specific to Dutch, namely disambiguating âdieâ and âdatâ (= âthatâ in English). In Dutch, depending on the sentence, both terms can be either demonstrative or relative pronouns; in addition they can also be used in a subordinating conjunction, i.e. to introduce a clause. The use of either of these words depends on the gender of the word it refers to. Distinguishing these words is a task introduced by BIBREF20, who presented multiple models trained on the Europarl BIBREF21 and SoNaR corpora BIBREF22. The results ranged from an accuracy of 75.03% on Europarl to 84.56% on SoNaR.For this task, we use the Dutch version of the Europarl corpus BIBREF21, which we split in 1.3M utterances for training, 319k for validation, and 399k for testing. We then process every sentence by checking if it contains âdieâ or âdatâ, and if so, add a training example for every occurrence of this word in the sentence, where a single occurrence is masked. For the test set for example, this resulted in about 289k masked sentences. We then test two different approaches for solving this task on this dataset. The first approach is making the BERT models use their MLM task and guess which word should be filled in this spot, and check if it has more confidence in either âdieâ or âdatâ (by checking the first 2,048 guesses at most, as this seemed sufficiently large). This allows us to compare the zero-shot BERT models, i.e. without any fine-tuning after pre-training, for which the results can be seen in Table TABREF7. The second approach uses the same data, but creates two sentences by filling in the mask with both âdieâ and âdatâ, appending both with the [SEP] token and making the model predict which of the two sentences is correct. The fine-tuning was performed using 4 Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPUs and evaluated against the same test set of 399k utterances. As before, we fine-tuned the model twice: once with the full training set and once with a subset of 10k utterances from the training set for illustrating the benefits of pre-training on low-resource tasks.RobBERT outperforms previous models as well as other BERT models both with as well as without fine-tuning (see Table TABREF4 and Table TABREF7). It is also able to reach similar performance using less data. The fact that zero-shot RobBERT outperforms other zero-shot BERT models is also an indication that the base model has internalised more knowledge about Dutch than the other two have. The reason RobBERT and other BERT models outperform the previous RNN-based approach is likely the transformers ability to deal better with coreference resolution BIBREF12, and by extension better in deciding which word the âdieâ or âdatâ belongs to.ConclusionWe introduced a new language model for Dutch based on RoBERTa, called RobBERT, and showed that it outperforms earlier approaches for Dutch language tasks, as well as other BERT-based language models. We thus hope this model can serve as a base for fine-tuning on other tasks, and thus help foster new models that might advance results for Dutch language tasks.AcknowledgementsPieter Delobelle was supported by the Research Foundation - Flanders under EOS No. 30992574 and received funding from the Flemish Government under the âOnderzoeksprogramma ArtificiÃ«le Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderenâ programme.

For MobileNets the depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1times 1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. The depthwise separable convolution splits this into two layers, a separate layer for filtering and a separate layer for combining. This factorization has the effect of drastically reducing computation and model size. Figure 2 shows how a standard convolution 2(a) is factorized into a depthwise convolution 2(b) and a 1times 1 pointwise convolution 2(c).Question: Describe how mobile net use depthwise separable convolution to reduce computation and the model size","answer":"MobileNets use depthwise convolution with one filter per input channel.

At normal pH (7.4) and temperature (37 degrees C), the uptake of 1 microM cefadroxil was reduced by 83% in PEPT2(-/-) mice as compared with PEPT2(+/+) mice (p < 0.001). A further reduction was achieved in null animals by reducing the temperature to 4 degrees C, or by adding saturating concentrations of unlabeled cefadroxil or p-aminohippurate (p < 0.05). Glycylsarcosine coadministration could inhibit the uptake of cefadroxil in PEPT2(+/+) mice (p < 0.01) but not PEPT2(-/-) mice. Although a proton-stimulated uptake of cefadroxil was demonstrated in PEPT2(+/+) mice (pH 6.5 versus pH 7.4; p < 0.01), no pH dependence was observed in PEPT2(-/-) mice. Kinetic parameters for cefadroxil (without p-aminohippurate) in wild-type mice were: V(max) = 5.4 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 34 microM, and K(d) = 0.0069 microl/mg/min; in the presence of p-aminohippurate, the parameters were: V(max) = 4.1 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 27 microM, and K(d) = 0.0064 microl/mg/min. In null animals, the kinetic parameters of cefadroxil (without p-aminohippurate) were: V(max) = 2.7 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 110 microM, and K(d) = 0.0084 microl/mg/min; in the presence of p-aminohippurate, only a K(d) = 0.010 microl/mg/min was observed. Based on kinetic and inhibitor analyses, it was determined that (under linear conditions), 80 to 85% of cefadroxil's uptake in choroid plexus is mediated by PEPT2, 10 to 15% by organic anion transporter(s), and 5% by nonspecific mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that PEPT2 is the primary transporter responsible for cefadroxil uptake in the choroid plexus. Moreover, the data suggest a role for PEPT2 in the clearance of peptidomimetics from cerebrospinal fluid.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"cefadroxil\\", \\"[(3)H]cefadroxil\\", \\"Glycylsarcosine\\", \\"p-aminohippurate\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"peptide transporter 2\\", \\"PEPT2\\", \\"organic anion transporter(s)\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Different technologies have revealed a variety of genes and pathways underlying addiction; however, each individual technology can be biased and incomplete. We integrated 2, 343 items of evidence from peer-reviewed publications between 1976 and 2006 linking genes and chromosome regions to addiction by single-gene strategies, microrray, proteomics, or genetic studies. We identified 1, 500 human addiction-related genes and developed KARG( http://karg. cbi. pku. edu. cn), the first molecular database for addiction-related genes with extensive annotations and a friendly Web interface. We then performed a meta-analysis of 396 genes that were supported by two or more independent items of evidence to identify 18 molecular pathways that were statistically significantly enriched, covering both upstream signaling events and downstream effects. Five molecular pathways significantly enriched for all four different types of addictive drugs were identified as common pathways which may underlie shared rewarding and addictive actions, including two new ones, GnRH signaling pathway and gap junction. We connected the common pathways into a hypothetical common molecular network for addiction. We observed that fast and slow positive feedback loops were interlinked through CAMKII, which may provide clues to explain some of the irreversible features of addiction.Introduction:Drug addiction, defined as âthe loss of control over drug use, or the compulsive seeking and taking of drugs despite adverse consequences, â has become one of the most serious problems in the world[1]. It has been estimated that genetic factors contribute to 40%â60% of the vulnerability to drug addiction, and environmental factors provide the remainder[2]. What are the genes and pathways underlying addiction? Is there a common molecular network underlying addiction to different abusive substances? Is there any network property that may explain the long-lived and often irreversible molecular and structural changes after addiction? These are all important questions that need to be answered in order to understand and control drug addiction. Knowing the genes and vulnerable chromosome regions that are related to addiction is an important first step. Over the past three decades, a number of technologies have been used to generate such candidate genes or vulnerable chromosome regions. For example, in hypothesis-driven studies, genes in different brain regions were selectively expressed, downregulated, or knocked out in animal models of addiction[3]. Recent high-throughput expression-profiling technologies such as microarray and proteomics analyses identified candidate genes and proteins whose expression level changed significantly among different states in addiction[4, 5]. Finally, genetic studies such as animal Quantitative Trait Locus( QTL) studies, genetic linkage studies, and population association studies identified chromosomal regions that may contribute to vulnerability to addiction[6â8]. However, as addiction involves a wide range of genes and complicated mechanisms, any individual technology platform or study may be limited or biased[3, 9â14]. There is a need to combine data across technology platforms and studies that may complement one another[3, 15, 16]. The resultant gene list, preferably in a database form with additional functional information, would be a valuable resource for the community. Systematic and statistical analysis of the genes and the underlying pathways may provide a more complete picture of the molecular mechanism underlying drug addiction. Although different addictive drugs have disparate pharmacological effects, there are also similarities after acute and chronic exposure such as acute rewarding and negative emotional symptoms upon drug withdrawal[17]. Recently it was asked âIs there a common molecular pathway for addiction? â because elucidation of common molecular pathways underlying shared rewarding and addictive actions may help the development of effective treatments for a wide range of addictive disorders[17]. Several individual pathways have been proposed as common pathways[17]; however, they have not been studied systematically and statistically. Key behavioral abnormalities associated with addiction are long-lived with stable and irreversible molecular and structural changes in the brain, implying a âmolecular and structural switchâ from controlled drug intake to compulsive drug abuse[18]. It was proposed that the progress of addiction may involve positive feedback loops that were known to make continuous processes discontinuous and reversible processes irreversible[19]. Once a common molecular network for addiction is constructed, we can look for the existence of positive feedback loops in the network and study the coupling between the loops. It may provide clues to explain the network behaviour and the addiction process.Discussion:The addiction-related genes,( common) pathways, and networks were traditionally studied experimentally. The explosion of genomic and proteomic data in recent years both enabled and necessitated bioinformatic studies of addiction. Integration of data from multiple sources could remove biases of any single technology platform, and statistical and network analysis of the integrated data could uncover high-level patterns not detectable in any individual study. For instance, our analysis revealed not only many pathways already implicated in addiction[34â38], but also new ones such as GnRH signaling pathway and gap junction, as well as the coupled positive feedback loops through CAMKII. They could serve as interesting hypotheses for further experimental testing. The collection of addiction-related genes and pathways in KARG, the first bioinformatic database for addiction, is the most comprehensive to date. However, as new technologies continue to be developed and used, more and more genes will be linked to addiction. In 2004, a paper asked why proteomics technology was not introduced to the field of drug addiction[5]; since then eleven studies have identified about 100 differentially expressed proteins in drug addiction. Tilling-array technology, another new strategy for whole-genome identification of transcription factors binding sites, has been used to identify targets of CREB, an important transcription factor implicated in drug addiction[39]. In addition, as 100 K and 500 K SNP arrays have been introduced recently, whole genome association studies will also identify more closely packed and unbiased hypothesis-free vulnerable positions[40]. We will continue to integrate new data and update the gene list and molecular pathways toward a better understanding of drug addiction.","answer":"Drug addiction has become one of the most serious problems in the world .

The cDNA encoding the catalytic polypeptide of human DNA polymerase epsilon was cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals that the catalytic polypeptide is 2257 amino acids in length and its calculated molecular mass is 258 kDa. A single RNA message of 7.5 kilobases was recognized by isolated cDNA clones. The identity of the cDNA was verified by direct amino acid sequencing of tryptic fragments derived from the catalytic polypeptide of the HeLa DNA polymerase epsilon. The primary structure comparison with multiple DNA polymerases indicates that human DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic polypeptide is a homolog of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase II catalytic polypeptide. The proteins are 39% identical. In the region containing known DNA polymerase consensus motifs, the identity is 63%. The expression of the mRNA encoding DNA polymerase epsilon is strongly dependent on cell proliferation.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"DNA polymerase II\\", \\"DNA polymerases\\", \\"catalytic polypeptide of human DNA polymerase epsilon\\", \\"DNA polymerase\\", \\"catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase epsilon\\", \\"DNA polymerase epsilon\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2017 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Inother words, we would like to know if adversarial training of the feature extractor together with the generator is a requirement for training effective generators. Towardsanswering this question, we propose Generative Feature Matching Networks (GFMN), a new feature matching-based approach to train generative models that uses features from pretrained neural networks, breaking away from the problematic min/max game completely. Some interestingproperties of the proposed method include: (1) the loss function is directly correlated to the generated image quality; (2) mode collapsing is not an issue; (3) the same pretrained feature extractor can be used across different datasets; and (4) both supervised (classifiers) and unsupervised (autoencoder) models can be used as feature extractors.We perform an extensive number of experiments with different challenging datasets, including ILSVRC2012 (henceforth Imagenet) BID37 . We demonstrate that, due to the expressiveness of the features from pretrained Imagenet classifiers, even by just matching first order statistics, our approach can achieve state-of-the-art results for challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR10 and STL10. Moreover, we showthat the same feature extractor is effective across different datasets. The main contributionsof this work can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a new effective feature matching-based approach to train generative models that does not use adversarial learning, have stable training and achieves state-of-the-art results; (2) We propose an ADAM-based moving average method that allows effective training with small minibatches; (3) Our extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that pretrained autoencoders and deep convolutional net (DCNN) classifiers can be effectively used as feature extractors for the purpose of learning generative models.This work is driven towards answering the question of whether one can train effective generative models by performing feature matching on features extracted from pretrained neural networks.The goal is to avoid adversarial training, breaking away from the problematic min/max game completely.According to our experimental results, the answer to our research question is yes.We achieve successful non-adversarial training of generative feature matching networks by introducing different key ingredients: (1) a more robust way to compute the moving average of the mean features by using ADAM optimizer, which allows us to use small minibatches; (2) the use of features from all layers of pretrained neural networks; (3) the use of features from multiple neural networks at the same time (VGG19 + Resnet18); and (4) the initialization of the generator network.Our quantitative results in Tab.3 show that GFMN achieves better or similar results compared to the state-of-the-art Spectral GAN (SN-GAN) BID30 for both CIFAR10 and STL10.This is an impressive result for a non-adversarial feature matching-based approach that uses pretrained cross-domain feature extractors and has stable training.When compared to other MMD approaches BID23 3.47Â±.03GMMN+AE BID23 3.94Â±.04VAE BID27 (Berthelot et al., 2017) 5.62 MMD GAN BID23 6.17Â±.07MMD dist GAN BID2 6.39Â±.04 40.2 / -WGAN BID30 6.41Â±.11 42.6 / -7.57Â±.10 64.2 MMDrq GAN BID2 6.51Â±.03 39.9 / -WGAN-GP BID30 6.68Â±.06 40.2 / -8.42Â±.13 55.1 / -McGAN 6.97Â±.10SN-GANs BID30 7.58Â±.12 25.5 / -8.79Â±.14 43.2 / -MoLM-1024 BID36 7.55Â±.08 25.0 / 20.3 MoLM-1536 BID36 7.90Â±.10 23.3 / 18.9 BID9 BID23 BID2 BID36 , GFMN presents important distinctions (some of them already listed in Sec. 3) which make it an attractive alternative.Compared to GMMN and GMMN+AE , we can see in TAB2 that GFMN achieves far better results.In Appendix A.10, we also show a qualitative comparison between GFMN and GMMN results.The main reason why GFMN results are significantly better than GMMN is because GFMN uses a strong, robust kernel function (a pretrained DCNN), which, together with our AMA trick, allows the training with small minibatches.On the other hand, the Gaussian kernel used in GMMN requires a very large minibatch size in order to work well, which is impractical due to memory limitations and computational cost.Compared to recent adversarial MMD methods (MMD GAN) BID23 BID2 ) GFMN also presents significantly better results while avoiding the problematic min/max game.GFMN achieves similar results to the Method of Learned Moments (MoLM) BID36 , while using a much smaller number of features to perform matching.The best performing model from BID36 , MoLM-1536, uses around 42 million moments to train the CIFAR10 generator, while our best GFMN model uses around 850 thousand moments/features only, almost 50x less.In other words, MoLM-1536 can be used in large-scale environments only, while GFMN can be used in single GPU environments.One may argue that the best results from GFMN are obtained with feature extractors that were trained in a supervised manner (classifiers).However, there are two important points to note: (1) we use a cross domain feature extractor and do not use labels from the target datasets (CIFAR10, STL10, MNIST, CelebA); (2) since the accuracy of the classifier does not seem to be the most important factor for generating good features (VGG19 classifier produces better features although it is less accurate than Resnet18, see Appendix A.3); we are confident that GFMN will also achieve state-of-the-art results when trained with features from classifiers trained using unsupervised methods such as the one recently proposed by BID4 .In this work, we introduced GFMN, an effective non-adversarial approach to train generative models.GFMNs are demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art results while avoiding the challenge of defining and training an adversarial discriminator.Our feature extractors can be easily obtained and provide for a robust and stable training of our generators.Some interesting open questions include: what type of feature extractors other than classifiers and auto-encoders are good for GFMN?What architecture designs are better suited for the purpose of feature extraction in GFMN?AAPPENDIX","answer":"A new non-adversarial feature matching-based approach to train generative models that achieves state-of-the-art results."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

This is not true since the main outcome of this four-year quasi-experimental study involving more than 1500 subjects was a statistically significant 6.2 % reduction in the prevalence of functional decline ( p<0.05 ) and a 13.7 % decrease in the incidence of functional decline ( p<0.01 ) in the experimental groups as compared to the comparison groups [ 3 ] . Functional decline in this study was defined as a five-point or more decrease on the disability scale , institutionalization or death . This indicator has been used previously in other studies [ 4 , 5 ] . Moreover , participants with unmet needs , i.e. presenting disabilities not addressed by adequate re sources or services , were 31.4 % lower in the experimental groups in the fourth year of the study ( p<0.001 ) . These results are very conclusive since it was a population -based study design ed to measure effectiveness not efficacy . The subjects were r and omly selected from people 75 years and older at risk of functional decline , who did not necessarily benefit from the tested integrated care model during the study period . In fact , only 18 % of the subjects were assessed and cared for by a case manager in the experimental groups during the study periodTitle 2:Reliability of the revised functional autonomy measurement system (SMAF) for epidemiological research.Abstract 2:The Functional Autonomy Measurement System ( SMAF ) is an instrument design ed to assess disabilities related to 29 functions with a four-point scale ( from 0 : independent to -3 : dependent ) . For epidemiological studies , a total score and five sub-scores can be obtained . A revised version was developed adding a -0.5 level to many items to indicate an activity accomplished independently but with difficulty . The objective of the study was to verify the test-retest and inter-rater reliability of the total score and sub-scores of the SMAF . Ninety subjects were r and omly recruited in nine different residential setting s ranging from home to long-term-care hospitals . Half of the subjects were assessed by the same nurse within a 2-week interval ( test-retest ) and the other half were assessed twice by two different nurses within the same interval ( inter-rater ) . Results show intra-class correlation coefficients ( ICC ) of 0.95 and 0.96 for the total scores on test-retest and inter-rater reliability , respectively . The ICC were over 0.74 for all sub-scores for both types of reliability . A small systematic bias was present for two SMAF subscores on the inter-rater reliability . The addition of a new level did not modify the reliability of the scaleTitle 3:Impact of PRISMA, a coordination-type integrated service delivery system for frail older people in Quebec (Canada): A quasi-experimental study.Abstract 3:OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of a coordination-type integrated service delivery ( ISD ) model on health , satisfaction , empowerment , and services utilization of frail older people . METHODS Program of Research to Integrate Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy ( PRISMA ) is a population -based , quasi-experimental study with three experimental and three comparison areas . From a r and om selection of people 75 years or older , 1,501 persons identified at risk of functional decline were recruited ( 728 experimental and 773 comparison ) . Participants were measured over 4 years for disabilities ( Functional Autonomy Measurement System ) , unmet needs , satisfaction with services , and empowerment . Information on utilization of health and social services was collected by bimonthly telephone question naires . RESULTS Over the last 2 years ( when the implementation rate was over 70 % ) , there were 62 fewer cases of functional decline per 1,000 individuals in the experimental group . In the fourth year of the study , the annual incidence of functional decline was lower by 137 cases per 1,000 in the experimental group , whereas the prevalence of unmet needs in the comparison region was nearly double the prevalence observed in the experimental region . Satisfaction and empowerment were significantly higher in the experimental group . For health services utilization , a lower number of visits to emergency rooms and hospitalizations than expected was observed in the experimental cohort . CONCLUSION The PRISMA model improves the efficacy of the health care system for frail older people","answer":"Literature analysis revealed the structures , processes and outcomes which underpinned the implementation .The research also demonstrated benefits to the health system , including a more appropriate use of emergency rooms , and decreased consultations with medical specialists .PRISMA provides evidence of the benefits that can arise from integrating care for older persons , particularly in terms of increased feelings of personal empowerment , and improved client satisfaction with the care provided .Taken alongside other integrated care experiments , PRISMA provides further evidentiary support to policy-makers pursuing integrated care programs ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

However, failure to detect components of the contractile apparatus in capillary pericytes, most notably Î±-smooth muscle actin( Î±-SMA), has questioned these findings. Using strategies that allow rapid filamentous-actin( F-actin) fixation( i. e. snap freeze fixation with methanol at â20Â°C) or prevent F-actin depolymerization( i. e. with F-actin stabilizing agents), we demonstrate that pericytes on mouse retinal capillaries, including those in intermediate and deeper plexus, express Î±-SMA. Junctional pericytes were more frequently Î±-SMA-positive relative to pericytes on linear capillary segments. Intravitreal administration of short interfering RNA( Î±-SMA-siRNA) suppressed Î±-SMA expression preferentially in high order branch capillary pericytes, confirming the existence of a smaller pool of Î±-SMA in distal capillary pericytes that is quickly lost by depolymerization. We conclude that capillary pericytes do express Î±-SMA, which rapidly depolymerizes during tissue fixation thus evading detection by immunolabeling.Introduction:When Rouget first discovered pericytes in 1873, he observed that these cells might serve as contractile entities to regulate microcirculatory blood flow because of their structure and position on microvessels( Rouget, 1873). However, this idea was later challenged based on findings that microcirculatory blood flow is largely regulated by upstream arterioles rich in Î±-smooth muscle actin( Î±-SMA), the contractile protein present in vascular smooth muscle cells. A number of studies in the past three decades reported that most capillary pericytes in the central nervous system contained little or no Î±-SMA, whereas Î±-SMA was detected in pericytes located on pre-capillary arterioles and post-capillary venules( Bandopadhyay et al., 2001; Nehls and Drenckhahn, 1991; Kur et al., 2012; Kornfield and Newman, 2014; Armulik et al., 2011). In contrast, recent in vitro and in vivo functional studies have demonstrated that a subgroup of capillary pericytes are contractile in the brain and retina, and have the capacity to regulate the microcirculation by contracting and relaxing in response to physiological( i. e. neurovascular coupling) as well as pharmacological stimuli( Kornfield and Newman, 2014; Hall et al., 2014; Peppiatt et al., 2006; FernÃ¡ndez-Klett et al., 2010). Importantly, Hall et al. showed that capillaries covered by pericytes dilate before arte-rioles in response to neuronal stimulus in situ( Hall et al., 2014). Recently, an increase inÂ astrocytic calcium was shown to mediate brain capillary changes in response to metabolic demand( Mishra et al., 2016). Similarly, Biesecker et al. showed that calcium signaling in MÃ¼ller cell endfeet was sufficient to evoke capillary dilation in the retina( Biesecker et al., 2016). Kisler et al. reported that transgenic mice with a decreased number of pericytes had deficient neurovascular coupling and reduced oxygen delivery to the brain( Kisler et al., 2017), providing additional evidence for the importance of pericytes in blood flow regulation. Collectively, these experiments strongly suggest the presence of a bona fide contractile machinery in capillary pericytes. However, a recent paper dismisses the idea of pericytes being contractile by redefining Î±-SMA-expressing pericytes as smooth muscle cells( Hill et al., 2015). To address this paradox between functional and histological findings, we hypothesized that small amounts of Î±-SMA in capillary pericytes may be rapidly depolymerized during transcardial perfusion and fixation thus evading detection by immunolabeling. Consistent with this idea, Î±-SMA in pericytes has been detected by electron microscopy in which small amounts of Î±-SMA can be identified( Toribatake et al., 1997; Le Beux and Willemot, 1978; Ho, 1985; Nakano et al., 2000) or by in vitro studies in which fixation is more rapidly achieved( Herman and D'Amore, 1985). Here, we show that when filamentous-actin( F-actin) depolymerization was prevented by F-actin stabilizing agents or by snap fixation, we detected Î±-SMA in a much larger fraction of microvascular pericytes, including capillary pericytes placed on the intermediate and deeper retinal vascular beds.Discussion:In this report, we demonstrate that about 50% of NG2-positive pericytes on high order retinal capillaries( i. e. >5th) located in the intermediate and deeper retinal vascular plexus express Î±-SMA( Figure 3D). Previous reports relied on Î±-SMA immunohistochemistry involving the slow transcardial infusion of formaldehyde or PFA fixatives( Thavarajah et al., 2012), thus lack of or weak Î±-SMA detection was likely due to rapid F-actin depolymerization( Huber et al., 2013) leading to the disruption of the antibody-binding sites( Dudnakova et al., 2010). Although antigen retrieval on PFA-fixed retinas revealed some Î±-SMA labeling in retinal microvessels, this signal was modest and only found in a few capillaries. Here, we show that faster tissue fixation with cold methanol strikingly increased the detection of Î±-SMA-positive pericytes. It is possible that the detection of the minute pool of Î±-SMA in small soma and processes of pericytes does not only depend on the fixation method, but might also be difficult to visualize in transgenic mice due to dispersion of the limited amount of membrane-bound reporter protein over the relatively large surface area of the pericyte membrane. Moreover, incomplete( mosaic-like) fluorescent protein expression after tamoxifen injection in inducible transgenic mice, in which Cre recombinase expression is driven by the Î±-SMA promoter, can also account for the failure to visualize low levels of Î±-SMA labeling at capillary pericytes( Hill et al., 2015; Hartmann et al., 2015). Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of Î±-SMA depolymerization in the intact eye using phalloidin or jasplakinolide, two F-actin stabilizing reagents with different pharmacological effects on F-actin, substantially increased visualization of Î±-SMA in retinal capillary pericytes, particularly those in the deeper retinal plexus. The ratio of Î±-SMA-positive pericytes was relatively lower to that found in upstream microvessels, consistent with previous reports showing less net O2 delivery from distal capillaries relative to proximal ones( SakadÅ¾iÄ et al., 2014). Interestingly, knocking down Î±-SMA expression led to the disappearance of Î±-SMA immunostaining mainly in distal capillary pericytes, suggesting that the small pool of Î±-SMA in capillary pericytes is less stable than in vascular smooth muscle cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that a large population of pericytes, notably those at branching points of retinal microvessels, have the capacity to express Î±-SMA, which likely mediates their contraction. It has been suggested that Î³-actin might contribute to pericyte contractility in cortical microvessels( Grant et al., 2017). However, our results do not support this hypothesis since we did not detect Î³-actin-positive capillary pericytes on distal order branches after preventing F-actin depolymerization. The latter finding also indicates that the increase in Î±-SMA-positivity after phalloidin or jasplakinolide was not caused by cross-reactivity between the antibodies against Î³- and Î±-isoforms or by accumulation of an excess amount of F-actin that might increase the immunostaining of all isoforms. Unlike peripheral tissues where the blood flow changes homogeneously, the density of pericytes is high in the CNS and retina, where the blood flow demand varies considerably between neighboring cell layers or groups( Kornfield and Newman, 2014; Armulik et al., 2011; Schallek et al., 2011). In vitro studies and recent in vivo brain studies have provided a growing body of evidence that capillary pericytes contract or dilate in response to vasoactive mediators( Peppiatt et al., 2006; FernÃ¡ndez-Klett et al., 2010; Puro, 2007). This blood flow regulation with fine spatial resolution may be essential for tissues with high functional specialization such as the brain and retina. The retinal capillary dilation in response to light stimulus is reportedly layer-specific( Kornfield and Newman, 2014). In line with our findings showing clear Î±-SMA expression in capillary pericytes of the intermediate plexus, the latter study reported robust capillary dilation in this region, but failed to detect Î±-SMA expression most likely due to the use of PFA-based fixation( Kornfield and Newman, 2014). A recent study using transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins driven by the NG2 or Î±-SMA promoters also confirmed the contractile capacity of microvascular pericytes in the cortex in vivo, however, it proposed a radical redefinition by classifying the NG2- and Î±-SMA-expressing( contractile) cells as smooth muscle cells, rather than pericytes, as they would have conventionally been named under the original Zimmermann definition used since 1923( Hill et al., 2015). The existence of at least three sub-classes of pericytes and transitional forms from smooth muscle cells( Zimmermann, 1923) has been a matter of confusion, emphasizing the need for an unambiguous definition of pericyte sub-classes and their corresponding specialized functions. In conclusion, we identify key components of the contractile machinery in a large population of pericytes in the healthy retina. The identification of Î±-SMA in capillary pericytes may contribute to clarify the current paradox between functional and histological studies, and expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating blood flow at the single-capillary level in neurodegenerative conditions including stroke, retinal ischemia, diabetic retinopathy and Alzheimerâs disease.","answer":"Blood vessels in animalsâ bodies are highly organized . The large blood vessels from the heart branch to smaller vessels that are spread throughout the tissues . The smallest vessels , the capillaries , allow oxygen and nutrients to pass from the blood to nearby cells in tissues . Some capillaries , including those at the back of the eye ( in the retina ) and those in the brain , change their diameter in response to activity in the nervous system . This allows more or less oxygen and nutrients to be delivered to match these tissuesâ demands . However , unlike for larger blood vessels , how capillaries constrict or dilate is debated . While large vessels are encircled by smooth muscle cells , capillaries are instead surrounded by muscle-like cells called pericytes , and some scientists have suggested that it is these cells that contract to narrow the diameter of a capillary or relax to widen it . However , other researchers have questioned this explanation . This is mostly because several laboratories could not detect the proteins that would be needed for contraction within these pericytes â the most notable of which is a protein called Î±-smooth muscle actin ( or Î±-SMA for short ) . Alarcon-Martinez , Yilmaz-Ozcan et al . hypothesized that the way samples are usually prepared for analysis was causing the Î±-SMA to be degraded before it could be detected . To test this hypothesis , they used different methods to fix and preserve capillaries and pericytes in samples taken from the retinas of mice . When the tissue samples were immediately frozen with ice-cold methanol instead of a more standard formaldehyde solution , Î±-SMA could be detected at much higher levels in the capillary pericytes . Treating samples with a toxin called phalloidin , which stabilizes filaments of actin , also made Î±-SMA more readily visible . When Î±-SMA was experimentally depleted from the mouse retinas , the capillary pericytes were more affected than the larger blood vessels . This finding supports the idea that the pericytes contain , and rely upon , only a small amount of Î±-SMA . Finding Î±-SMA in capillary pericytes may explain how these small blood vessels can change their diameter . Future experiments will clarify how these pericytes regulate blood flow at the level of individual capillaries , and may give insights into conditions such as stroke , which is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

In our study on the biosynthetic gene cluster for the cyclic octapeptides surugamides A-E (inhibitors of cathepsin B), we found a putative gene cluster consisting of four successive non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes, surA, surB, surC, and surD. Prediction of amino acid sequence based on the NRPSs and gene inactivation revealed that surugamides A-E are produced by two NRPS genes, surA and surD, which were separated by two NRPS genes, surB and surC. The latter genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of an unrelated peptide, surugamide F. The pattern of intercalation observed in the sur genes is unprecedented. The structure of surugamide F, a linear decapeptide containing one 3-amino-2-methylpropionic acid (AMPA) residue, was determined by spectroscopic methods and was confirmed by solid-phase peptide synthesis.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"NRPSs\\", \\"gene cluster\\", \\"non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes\\", \\"surD\\", \\"surC\\", \\"genes\\", \\"sur genes\\", \\"Genome\\", \\"surA\\", \\"Gene Cluster\\", \\"NRPS genes\\", \\"surB\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"biosynthesis\\", \\"intercalation\\", \\"gene inactivation\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"secondary metabolites\\", \\"Surugamide A\\", \\"inhibitors\\", \\"AMPA\\", \\"cathepsin B\\", \\"surugamides A-E\\", \\"surugamide F\\", \\"peptide\\", \\"Decapeptide\\", \\"Surugamide F\\", \\"decapeptide\\", \\"cyclic octapeptides\\", \\"3-amino-2-methylpropionic acid\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"biosynthetic\\", \\"Biosynthetic\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"spectroscopic methods\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"study\\", \\"mining\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"structure\\", \\"amino acid sequence\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

known , cancer control in many countries is woefully inadequate , and morbidity and mortality rates due to cancer are higher than they need be [ 3 , 6 , 1725 ] . in the past , cancer control in central and eastern europe was inadequate , particularly when compared to many wealthier western european countries .however , in recent years , many countries in this region have made a concerted effort to improve cancer control and care . as a result, the health care systems in these countries have undergone several major reforms since the early 1990s to address their numerous shortcomings [ 2629 ] . in the present article ,we analyse interregional differences in europe to the approach to comprehensive cancer care , with a focus on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) .the case of poland is used as a representative example for central and eastern europe , where gross national income ( gni ) is significantly lower than in western and northern europe .historically , cancer care outcomes in central and eastern european countries have been below those reported in western and northern european countries [ 1 , 4 , 6 , 23 , 24 , 3032 ] . in 2003 , for example , cancer survival rates in poland were only 30 vs. 45  % in western and northern europe [ 3336 ] .similarly , the eurocare-3 study , which compared 19 european countries to assess associations between national income , investment in health care , and survival in patients diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 1994 ( and followed to 1999 ) , found that all - cancer survival in poland was lower than countries of similar wealth , in part due to relatively low spending on health care as a percentage of gross domestic product .the eurocare-4 , which assessed patients from 22 european countries diagnosed with cancer between 1995 and 1999 and followed to december 2003 , reported that the mean european survival for hnscc cancers was 48.9  % , with survival significantly lower in two countries : the united kingdom ( uk)-northern ireland ( 36.9  % ) and poland ( 37.9  % ) .this compares to higher survival rates found in finland ( 59.7  % ) , sweden ( 56.2  % ) and germany ( 61.2  % ) .similarly , that same study found that survival for most solid cancers ( whose prognosis depends on diagnostic stage ) , was lowest in the czech republic , poland , and slovenia .publication of the eurocare results has encouraged many countries , among them the uk , denmark , and poland , to develop a national cancer plan to improve outcomes .head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a significant component of the global burden of cancer . worldwide, more than 600,000 patients are diagnosed each year with hnscc , accounting for 6  % of all cancer cases .studies have shown that heavy intake of alcoholic beverages is associated with nutrient deficiency , which appears to contribute independently to oral carcinogenesis . in the last two decades , a slight decrease has been noted in the overall incidence of head and neck cancer , laryngeal cancer in particular .in contrast , however , a significant increase in cancers of the oropharynx and oral cavity has been detected [ 23 , 38 ] .oral cancer is particularly high among men , and more common in developing than developed countries .sharp increases in the incidence rates of oropharyngeal cancers have been noted for several countries and regions , including denmark , france , germany , scotland , and central and eastern europe . according to the central statistical office in poland ,5,645 head and neck cancer deaths were registered in poland in 2010 ( 4,430 men , 1,215 women ) , constituting an increase of 11  % compared to 1999 . in poland , h&n cancer accounts for 8.5  % of cancer deaths in men and 3  % in women .patients age 55 + accounted for most of those cancer - related deaths ( 80 and 85  % , respectively , in men and women ) .the male to female incidence ratio of 1.8 shows that the relative risk of developing h&n cancer is generally higher in men , as is the relative risk of death ( m / f  =  3.8 ) , particularly in the 5559 age group in which the m / f ratio rises to 5.8 . in most categories , the morbidity / mortality ( mm ) ratio is higher than 1 , with the exceptions of men over age 80 and women over age 85 .of particular note is the 3034 age group , in which the mm ratio for women is almost 20 higher than for men [ 35 , 3941 ] .researchers have identified the human papilloma virus ( hpv ) as the causative factor for a subset of hnscc tumours [ 4244 ] , particularly hpv-16 , which is especially common in otopharyngeal tumours . fortunately , hpv - associated tumours have better clinical outcomes . as in many other cancers ,prevention of hiv infection will also reduce the incidence of hiv / aids - related cancers such as kaposi s sarcoma and lymphoma . in 2007 ,the world health assembly passed a resolution ( the who global oral health programme ; wha60 a16 ) urging member states to ensure that prevention be included as a major component of cancer control programmes , along with the involvement of oral health professionals or primary health care staff with relevant training in oral health , in detection , early diagnosis , and treatment .head and neck cancers are difficult to treat due to their heterogeneity , location near sensitive organs , and the fact that treatment is nearly always multidisciplinary [ 16 , 38 , 41 , 4547 ] . depending onthe site and stage of the cancer , treatment may consist of surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy or a combination thereof , accompanied by rehabilitation and social support [ 2 , 45 ] .for advanced cases , there has been a shift from surgical treatment towards chemoradiotherapy protocols ( especially concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy ) .systemic therapies ( chemotherapy and targeted molecular agents ) have been successfully integrated into potentially curative treatment of locally advanced hnscc [ 15 , 39 , 48 , 49 ] .major improvements have been achieved in radiotherapy delivery [ 11 , 29 , 5052 ] , and in poland a recent study found that investments in more modern radiotherapy equipment had a measurable and positive impact on treatment outcomes [ 27 , 53 , 54 ] . in deciding which treatment strategy would be suitable for an individual patient ,important considerations include expected functional outcomes , ability to tolerate treatment , and comorbid illnesses .collaboration amongst many specialties is the key for optimal assessment and decision - making in the management of hnscc [ 38 , 46 ] .in poland , the largest and most populous country in the region , a major cancer control initiative was undertaken in 2005 with the implementation of the national program against cancer diseases ( npacd ) .the main aim of the npacd was to combat the alarming and increasing incidence of cancer . to that end ,the government allocated approximately  700 million ( pln 250 million / year ) in funding for the years 20052015 .in addition to the aforementioned goal of preventing cancer , the npacd also sought to bring polish cancer care up to european standards for early cancer diagnosis and treatment , to accelerate the transfer of the latest research findings from lab to bed , and to monitor the efficacy of cancer control activities in poland . the current medical care system in poland is an obligatory public health insurance system .all individuals covered by general health insurance receive free health services by private or public health care providers .contracts are awarded on a regional basis directly by one of the 16 branches of the national health fund ( nhf ) and are signed for 5  years while reimbursement is negotiated annually .patients also have the right to choose their health care provider , which can be public ( mainly hospitals ) or private ( individual or group medical practices or regular commercial entities ) .poland joined the eu more than 10  years ago , and the consequent increase in cross - border patient and staff mobility has increased expectations in poland , not only for improved treatment results and greater comfort in the hospital setting . since 2009 , due to insufficient funds , the nhf has had difficulties fully reimbursing hospitals . at present ,however , some have questioned this rule because even though both private and public hospitals provide health services to patients at no cost to the patient ( i.e. , reimbursed by the nhf ) , private hospitals are also allowed to treat and charge private patients outside the nhf .public hospitals , in contrast , are not allowed to have private patients , with only a few exceptions ( e.g. , procedures not covered by the nhf ) .this is a major handicap to public providers when the nhf contract is fulfilled before the end of the year : private providers have the option to close or limit service while public ones are forced to continue treating patients , even though they will not receive any additional funds for doing so , thus worsening their financial condition . in recent years, the npacd has provided substantial funds for investment in new equipment , to develop screening and prevention programmes ( including genetic screening ) , to improve cancer registries , and to carry out epidemiological studies .other sources of funds include the national science centre and national centre for research and development , both of which support research projects through grants , plus local sources of funding that can be used for investment and prevention / screening .the existing cancer network consists of comprehensive cancer centres located in each of the 16 provinces in poland .universities also provide cancer care at their teaching hospitals through small clinics within these hospitals .such clinics are legally part of a large multidisciplinary teaching hospital , and thus have no financial autonomy . in the authors opinion ,some changes in the law are needed to enable existing cancer centres to become more involved in academics , either by granting them status as research institutes or by allowing them to enter the university as stand - alone centres . at the very least, it would be important to avoid forcing such centres to be  diluted  as part of general medicine hospitals .an important issue in poland  and several other eastern and central european countries  is a shortage of physicians in the field of oncology [ 27 , 56 ] . as in many other countries ,the discipline of oncology in poland is subdivided into several different specialities , including oncological surgery ( although general surgeons can also operate on cancer patients ) , radiation oncology , and medical oncology .in contrast , in some countries , notably the scandinavian countries and the united kingdom , the specialties of medical and radiation oncology are combined . at present, there is much debate about the appropriate competencies of these various specialities , particularly with regards to prescribing oral anticancer drugs [ 7 , 57 ] .one of the drivers of the shortage of specialists in radiation oncology , in poland and other countries , is that , compared to other specialities , fewer students choose this field for the simple reason that it is introduced towards the latter part of medical studies , when many students have already chosen their preferred specialities [ 53 , 57 ] .since 2009 , the npacd has required that all universities in poland provide at least 15 contact hours of basic oncology in the 3rd year curriculum of the degree in medicine , and 60 contact hours of oncology in the 6th year .finally , another challenge relates to awareness and training of university students who are studying fields ( other than medicine ) in which an understanding of oncology is  or should be  important .such fields include medical physics , physiotherapy , nursing , public health , pharmacy , biotechnology , and many others .the process of incorporating oncology into the curriculum , both as an undergraduate course for future physicians and for other medical disciplines , is ongoing [ 27 , 57 , 58 ] .as we have seen in the case of poland , eastern and central european countries have undertaken comprehensive changes and increased spending to improve their cancer control and treatment efforts in recent decades .the result is a much improved health care system with comprehensive cancer control efforts and improved technology and training .however , unlike poland , not all countries in the european union have the funds to invest in more modern equipment and facilities , particularly in central and eastern europe .research by the who and other international bodies has shown that the most cost - effective way to improve outcomes and to reduce the burden of cancer is through coordinated prevention and early detection efforts .this approach offers countries a low cost but effective way to control cancer , and it has been successfully implemented in poland . at the same time , however , prevention and detection also require well - run national and regional cancer registries to keep track of changes , and so it is imperative that countries seeking to improve cancer control implement a coordinated approach to preventing and treating cancer .","answer":"the increasing worldwide burden of cancer makes it imperative that every country develop a comprehensive cancer control programme . in the past ,  cancer control in central and eastern europe was inadequate , particularly when compared to many wealthier western european countries .  we analyse interregional differences in europe to the approach to comprehensive cancer care , with a focus on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using the case of poland as a representative example . due to national plans  major improvements have been achieved in the field of prevention and in radiotherapy delivery having a measurable and positive impact on treatment outcomes . in head and  neck cancers a notable move towards multidisciplinary approach has been made , combining surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy accompanied by rehabilitation and social support . in poland and several other eastern and central european countries a shortage of physicians in the field of oncology  was noted .  the main conclusion is that the special plans are needed in central and eastern europe or those existing must be extended for another decade to fulfil the eu requirement of providing all european citizens with equal access to quality cancer care ."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

For three publicly available egocentric datasets, we uncover inconsistencies in ground truth temporal bounds within and across annotators and datasets. We systematically assess the robustness of state-of-the-art approaches to changes in labeled temporal bounds, for object interaction recognition. As boundaries are trespassed, a drop of up to 10 is observed for both Improved Dense Trajectories and Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network. We demonstrate that such disagreement stems from a limited understanding of the distinct phases of an action, and propose annotating based on the Rubicon Boundaries, inspired by a similarly named cognitive model, for consistent temporal bounds of object interactions. Evaluated on a public dataset, we report a 4 increase in overall accuracy, and an increase in accuracy for 55 of classes when Rubicon Boundaries are used for temporal annotations.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We present SEMBED, an approach for embedding an egocentric object interaction video in a semantic-visual graph to estimate the probability distribution over its potential semantic labels. When object interactions are annotated using unbounded choice of verbs, we embrace the wealth and ambiguity of these labels by capturing the semantic relationships as well as the visual similarities over motion and appearance features. We show how SEMBED can interpret a challenging dataset of 1225 freely annotated egocentric videos, outperforming SVM classification by more than 5 .[2]: Given a video of an activity, can we predict what will happen next? In this paper we explore two simple tasks related to temporal prediction in egocentric videos of everyday activities. We provide both human experiments to understand how well people can perform on these tasks and computational models for prediction. Experiments indicate that humans and computers can do well on temporal prediction and that personalization to a particular individual or environment provides significantly increased performance. Developing methods for temporal prediction could have far reaching benefits for robots or intelligent agents to anticipate what a person will do, before they do it.[3]: [4]: We present a fully unsupervised approach for the discovery of i) task relevant objects and ii) how these objects have been used. A Task Relevant Object (TRO) is an object, or part of an object, with which a person interacts during task performance. Given egocentric video from multiple operators, the approach can discover objects with which the users interact, both static objects such as a coffee machine as well as movable ones such as a cup. Importantly, we also introduce the term Mode of Interaction (MOI) to refer to the different ways in which TROs are used. Say, a cup can be lifted, washed, or poured into. When harvesting interactions with the same object from multiple operators, common MOIs can be found. Setup and Dataset: Using a wearable camera and gaze tracker (Mobile Eye-XG from ASL), egocentric video is collected of users performing tasks, along with their gaze in pixel coordinates. Six locations were chosen: kitchen, workspace, laser printer, corridor with a locked door, cardiac gym and weight-lifting machine. The Bristol Egocentric Object Interactions Dataset is publically available .[5]: We bring together ideas from recent work on feature design for egocentric action recognition under one framework by exploring the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Recent work has shown that features such as hand appearance, object attributes, local hand motion and camera ego-motion are important for characterizing first-person actions. To integrate these ideas under one framework, we propose a twin stream network architecture, where one stream analyzes appearance information and the other stream analyzes motion information. Our appearance stream encodes prior knowledge of the egocentric paradigm by explicitly training the network to segment hands and localize objects. By visualizing certain neuron activation of our network, we show that our proposed architecture naturally learns features that capture object attributes and hand-object configurations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark egocentric action datasets show that our deep architecture enables recognition rates that significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques -- an average @math increase in accuracy over all datasets. Furthermore, by learning to recognize objects, actions and activities jointly, the performance of individual recognition tasks also increase by @math (actions) and @math (objects). We also include the results of extensive ablative analysis to highlight the importance of network design decisions..","answer":"Previously, three works noted the challenge and difficulty in defining temporal bounds for egocentric videos [5] [4] [2] . [5] , Spriggs discussed the level of granularity in action labels (e.g. break egg' vs beat egg in a bowl') for the CMU dataset [3] . They also noted the presence of temporally overlapping object interactions (e.g. pour' while stirring'). [1] , multiple annotators were asked to provide temporal bounds for the same object interaction. The authors showed variability in annotations, yet did not detail what instructions were given to annotators when labeling these temporal bounds. [2] , the human ability to order pairwise egocentric segments was evaluated as the snippet length varied. The work showed that human perception improves as the size of the segment increases to 60 frames, then levels off."},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

We report vibrational and electronic spectra of the hydroxyl-methyl-peroxy radical (HOCH2OO, or HMP), the primary product of the reaction of the hydroperoxy radical, HO2, and formaldehyde, HCHO. The Î½1 vibrational (OH stretch) spectrum and the Ã-X electronic spectrum of HMP were detected by Infrared Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (IR-CRDS), and assignments were verified with density functional calculations. The HMP radical was generated in reactions of HCHO with HO2. Free radical reactions were initiated by pulsed laser photolysis (PLP) of Cl2 in the presence of HCHO and O2 in a flow reactor at 300-330 Torr and 295 K. IR-CRDS spectra were measured in mid-IR and near-IR regions over the ranges 3525-3700 cm (-1) (Î½1) and 7250-7800 cm (-1) (Ã-X) (respectively, at a delay time 100 Âµs after photolysis. The Î½1 spectrum had an origin at 3622 cm (-1) and exhibited partially resolved P- and R-branch contours and a small Q branch. At these short delay times, spectral interference from HOOH and HCOOH was minimal, and could be subtracted. From B3LYP/6-31G+ (d, p) calculations, we found that the anharmonic vibrational frequency and band contour predicted for the lowest energy conformer, HMP-A, The calculated anharmonic vibrational frequency and band contour computed using B3LYP/63-1G (d, p) level were in good agreement with the observed spectrum. In the near-IR, we observed four well spaced vibronic bands, each with partially resolved rotational contours. We assigned the apparent origin of the electronic spectrum of HMP at 7392 cm (-1) and two bands to the blue to a progression in Î½15 ', the lowest torsional mode of the state (Î½15'= 171 cm (-1)). The band furthest to the red was assigned as a hot band in Î½15 \\", leading to a ground state torsional frequency of (Î½15\\"= 122 cm (-1)). We simulated the spectrum using second order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) with B3LYP/6-31+G (d, p) calculations at the minimum energy geometries of the HMP-A conformer on the X Ì and A Ì states. The predictions of the electronic origin frequency, torsional frequencies, anharmonicities and rotational band contours matched the observed spectrum. We investigated the torsional modes more explicitly by computing potential energy surfaces of HMP as a function of the two dihedral angles ÏOCOH and ÏOOCO. Wave functions and energy levels were calculated based on this potential surface; these results were used to calculate the Franck-Condon factors, which reproduced the vibronic band intensities in the observed electronic spectrum. The transitions that we observed all involved states with wave functions localized on the minimum energy conformer, HMP-A. Our calculations indicated that the observed near-IR spectrum was that of the minimum energy conformer HMP-A, but that this conformer is not the lowest energy conformer in the state, which remains unobserved. We estimated that the energy of this lowest conformer (HMP-B) of the Ã state to be T0 (Ã) â 7200 cm (-1), based on the energy difference E0 (HMP-B) -E0 (HMP-A) on the Ã state computed at the B3LYP/6-31+G (d, p) level.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

The same scale was given to parents of children ages 5 to 18 years. The sample consisted of 91 children and their parents being seen in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic for concerns unrelated to overweight. Weight and height of the children were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The children's BMI percentiles were categorized as underweight (<15th), normal (15th-85th), overweight (85th-95th), and obese (95th and above). The attending physician independently completed the body image and description scale and indicated the figure that most accurately represented the patient without reference to BMI standards. Accuracy of the patients', parents', and doctors' estimates were statistically compared.(RESULTS) The sample population consisted of 6.4% underweight, 70.5% normal weight, 7.7% overweight, and 15.4% obese. Forty-four percent of parents underestimated children's body size using word descriptions and 47% underestimated using figures. Forty percent of the children underestimated their own body size using descriptions and 43% underestimated using figures. The physicians in this study had a higher percentage of correct estimates; however, they underestimated 33% of the patients using both word descriptions and figures. Some obese children were not recognized, and several average children were perceived as underweight.Question:Body perception: do parents, their children, and their children's physicians perceive body image differently?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

This \\"torquoselectivity\\" is controlled by the electronic nature of the C-3 substituent: donors (X = CH3, OR, halides) rotate outward, while strong acceptors (CHO, NO, SiR3, B(OR)2) rotate inward.2 No violations of this fundamental stereochemical principle of electrocyclic reactions are known.</p><p></p><p>However, one of our groups recently observed an unexpected inward rotation of donors in the ring-opening reactions of triester-substituted Cyclobutenes, 1a*âb* (Scheme 1).3 The 3-phenyl Cyclobutenes exhibit normal outward rotation of the phenyl group; no previous examples of inward rotation of phenyl groups were known.4 Because cyclobutene 1c* opens in the expected outward fashion to give 3c*, it became clear that the geminal esters play a role in determining the final diene ratio. We now report a computational study that provides an explanation for the unexpected torquoselectivities of Cyclobutenes la*âb*.5 All ethyl esters were modeled computationally by methyl esters; the experimental structures are designated by asterisks (\\"*\\").</p><p>In contrast to the experimental results in Scheme 1, all calculated activation enthalpies for inward (TS1) and outward (TS2) opening of Cyclobutenes 1aâc show a high selectivity for outward rotation of R2 (Table 1). Thus the rules of torquoselectivity are predicted to be preserved. TS1b and TS2b are shown in Figure 1.</p><p>This disagreement between theory and experiment is reconcilable if there is thermodynamic control of the experimental results. We explored the possibility that the terminal ester groups (R1) may facilitate isomerization of \\"out\\" dienes 3*/3â²* to the thermodynamically more stable \\"in\\" dienes 2*/2â²* (Table 2). However, these isomerization barriers were calculated to be high (28â36 kcal/mol, entries 1â4). The lower barrier for 3bâ² (entry 4) is presumably due to stabilizing C=Oâ¢â¢â¢H interactions that are more pronounced compared to the other isomerization transition structures. (See Supporting Information). Diene 3c, which does not bear the geminal esters, isomerizes to the \\"in\\" diene with a similar barrier (entries 5â6). These calculations were also performed with UB3LYP6 and afforded the same results.</p><p>During the investigation of the isomerization of 3â²aâb to 2â²aâb, we located a low-energy (2H)-pyran intermediate 4 (Scheme 2). A similar cyclization was previously observed in the electrocyclic ring opening of 3-formyl-3-carboxymethyl-cyclobutene;7 the resulting diene 5 cyclizes to (2H)-pyran 6, which was observable by 1H-NMR but could not be isolated in pure form. Its structure was verified by Diels-Alder cycloaddition with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) to yield 7.</p><p>The activation enthalpies for closing \\"out\\" diene 3â² to pyran 4 (TS4) was calculated to be only 12â13 kcal/mol (Table 3). The facile ring closure of 2,4-pentadienals has been attributed to the close proximity of the nucleophilic oxygen lone pairs with the C-5 terminus.8 Pyran 4 re-opens to \\"in\\" diene 2â² (TS5) with higher barriers of 14â17 kcal/mol. The preferential outward rotation of donor R2 (TS4 vs. TS5) is consistent with the torquoselectivities of previously investigated 6Ï electrocyclic reactions.9 The structures of TS4b, 4b, and TS5b are given in Figure 2.</p><p>Based on these results, the overall free energy profile for the ring-opening reactions of 1a and 1b is shown in Figure 3. The normal rules of outward torquoselectivity are followed, but cyclization of dienyl esters 3â²aâb to pyrans leads to isomerization and thermodynamic control of stereoselectivity. 1H-NMR studies support this mechanism. When either cyclobutene 1a* or a 4.5:1 mixture of dienes 2a*:3a* is heated in d6-DMSO at 80 Â°C, a ratio of approximately 3:1 is established after 12 h.</p><p>Finally, because pyran 4 was not observed by 1H-NMR, we attempted to trap pyran intermediate 4a via a Diels-Alder cycloaddition with TCNE. The product was not observable even at 140 Â°C, which was not surprising considering the steric and electronic nature of 4. Calculations predict that the reaction of 4a with TCNE is highly unfavored, with ÎGâ¡ = 23.0 kcal/mol (TS6) and ÎGrxn = 13.5 kcal/mol. In agreement with experimental results, the activation free energy for cycloaddition of simple pyran 6 with TCNE was calculated to be feasible, with ÎGâ¡ = 20.9 kcal/mol (TS7) and ÎGrxn = â6.2 kcal/mol.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that electronic control of the kinetic torquoselectivity in thermal ring-opening reactions of cyclobutenes consistently holds, even in highly substituted cases, but extended conjugation at C-3 allows for isomerization of products and thermodynamic control of the diene in:out ratio.</p><p>Ring-opening transition structures of 1,3,3-trimethoxycarbonyl-4-phenyl-cyclobutene (1b)</p><p>Ring closure of 3bâ² and ring opening of pyran 4b.</p><p>Overall pathway (relative free energies).</p><p>1a*: R1 = CO2Et, R2 = Me (80 Â°C, 36h): 2a*/2aâ²*:3a*/3aâ²* = 4.5:1</p><p>1b*: R1 = CO2Et, R2 = Ph (rt, < 5 min): 2b*/2bâ²* only</p><p>1c*: R1 = H, R2 = Ph (80 Â°C, 24h): 3c*/3câ²* only</p><p>Cyclization of dienes 3â² and 5 to (2H)-pyrans 4 and 6</p><p>Calculated ring-opening activation enthalpies of 1aâca</p><p>Activation enthalpies for isomerization of 3/3â² to 2/2â²</p><p>Relative enthalpies for cyclization of 3â²</p><p>with respect to 3aâ².</p><p>with respect to 3bâ².</p>","answer":"The thermal ring-opening reactions of 4-phenyl-1,3,3-triethoxycarbonylcyclobutene and 4-methyl-1,3,3-triethoxycarbonylcyclobutene yield dienes that result from an unexpected selectivity for xe2x80x9cinwardxe2x80x9d rotation of the phenyl and methyl groups.

Due to the fact that the production of the fruit is seasonal, the fruit juice manufacturing allows us to consume them during the whole year. The most commonly consumed one is orange juice [1]. Its production accounts for nearly 85% of total citrus juice consumption [2].</p><p>Food quality assessment is increasingly important in the food industry. There are many types of fruit juice adulterations. The main one is dilution with water, which reduces the content of soluble solids, such as sugars or organic acids [3] or fragrance extracts and colourants [4]. Moreover, very popular type of fruit juice sophistication is the addition of cheaper fruit juices [3]. Orange juices are most often adulterated with the addition of mandarin [5, 6], tangerine [7], lemon [8], or grapefruit [9] juices.</p><p>In recent years, the interest in the healthy and balanced diet is growing. The consumption of orange juice allows not only to supply nutrients, but it can also have a positive effect on the human organism. Wabner et al. proved that orange juice improved blood lipid profiles in subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia [10]. Furthermore, orange juice intake with the high-fat, high-carbohydrate meal prevented meal-induced oxidative and inflammatory stress, and moreover, it prevents the expression of plasma endotoxin and Toll-like receptors [11]. The consumption of this type of fruit juice is beneficial in the control of calcareous and uric acid nephrolithiasis [12].</p><p>One of the healthiest juices is raw, and naturally, cloudy Not From Concentrate (NFC) juice, due to their composition, is most similar to the composition of fruits from which they are obtained. According to the European Fruit Juice Association, over the past 5Â years, the demand for NFC juices has increased. Across Europe, the increase was of about 14.0%. Moreover, in Poland, consumption of NFC juices increased nearly tenfold [13]. Such an intense increase in the demand for juices can cause a decrease in the product quality. According to experts, orange juice in Poland can be diluted by the addition of apple juice, which is cheaper and more easily accessible.</p><p>There are many reference methods to assess the quality of juices. Among them, chemical, physical, and microbiological methods can be mentioned. Orange juice is a widespread subject of research regarding the analysis of the aroma profile and monitoring of processes occurring in fruit juices [14, 15]. Samples of these juices are also classified into NFC, From Concentrate (FC), and pasteurized juices using chromatographic techniques [16â18] and e-nose devices [19, 20]. For detecting adulterations of orange juices, the most effective are methods in which spectrometry and chromatographic techniques are involved [21, 22]. However, these procedures are time-consuming, labour-intensive, or expensive. For this reason, new solutions that allow for a rapid assessment of the quality of fruit juices are sought. Devices enable rapid analysis are called electronic noses [23, 24]. The electronic nose is a device which makes possible to detect and distinguish complex mixtures of fragrances. The advantage of this equipment guarantees low time consumption and low costs of single analysis, the omission of sample preparation step and the possibility of in situ measurement. The applications of e-nose to analyze aroma of food products are shown in a number of reports [25â30]. An electronic nose is a useful tool for classification fruit juice samples [31â33].</p><p>There is a lack of literature reports about the research of adulteration of orange juice by apple juice addition. This also includes electronic nose investigations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a methodology for rapid evaluation of the authenticity of orange juices. For this purpose, the aroma profiles of orange juice, apple juice, and mixtures of both juices were compared by the use of e-nose based on ultra-fast gas chromatography. Moreover, e-nose analyses were combined with chemometric methods. Provided investigations can be supplementary to other control methods used for fruit-juice quality assessment.</p>Results and discussion<p>During the process of food quality control, from several dozens to several hundred samples need to be analyzed. For this reason, much less time-consuming methods are sought. In this work, the ultra-fast gas chromatography technique was used. Duration of the measurement was less than 2Â min. Regarding that fact, chromatographic separation may be insufficient. This is particularly problematic when samples with a very complex matrix composition are subjected to testing. In the research, a holistic approach was used. This approach uses the fingerprint method, i.e., the entire chromatograms of the samples are compared using statistical data analysis.</p><p>Chromatographic fingerprints for 100% orange juice (0.0) and a mixture of 50.0% orange juice and 50.0% apple juice (50.0)</p>Results and discussion<p>After chromatographic measurements, chemometric analyses were performed. The chromatographic peak areas corresponding to detected chemical compounds were used as an input data. All tested samples were compared based on the similarities and differences in the composition of the volatile fraction. During data processing with a large number of variables, there is a high probability of \\"voodoo correlation\\" [34]. As a general rule, to avoid this type of accidental correlation, the number of measurements should be fivefold greater than the number of variables. In the presented studies, over 120 chemical compounds (variables) were detected during each analysis. However, carrying out over 600 analyses is not easy to realize. Therefore, instead of increasing the number of measurements, it was decided to reduce the number of variables to 10.</p><p>Selected compounds identified as potential orange juice quality markers</p>Results and discussion<p>During the research, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) was used as a chemometric model. HCA is a method that allows sorting data and binding them into natural groups based on their similarity [39]. At the beginning of the agglomeration procedure, each analyzed object is located in a separate cluster. Next, the number of clusters decreases in every step until the moment when all input data will belong to one cluster [40]. To group objects into clusters, it is necessary to define the numerical value of the similarity between objects. Usually, the Euclidean distance is used for this purpose [41]. However, in the presented research, the Ward method was used. This method is characterized by the fact that analysis of variance ANOVA is used to assess the distance between clusters [40, 42]. The application of this method allows obtaining the best results if the clusters are of equal size [41].</p><p>Classification of orange juices according to the percentage of apple juice content using HCA method</p><p>Histograms depicting the mean values with a standard deviation of chromatographic peak areas for selected chemical compounds (numbers correspond to TableÂ 1) belonging to the six clusters, as illustrated in Fig.Â 2</p><p>Cross validation of supervised algorithms used for classification of data from the analysis of fruit juice samples</p><p>RF random forrest classification, NB naÃ¯ve bayes, NN neutral network, CT classification tree, AUC area under curve, CA accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity)</p>Results and discussion<p>The most reliable results were obtained for the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm.

These results provide 100% effectiveness in predicting the Random Forest algorithm.</p><p>Random Forest is a kind of forecasting tools. This algorithm is a combination of decision trees [44]. Using this method, a very precise classification of the tested samples can be obtained. In addition, they are characterized by high accuracy, resistance to noise, simplicity, and speed of action [45]. These properties make Random Forest a useful tool for classifying objects even with a huge number of features. Based on the information obtained, it was decided to use this algorithm for further research.</p><p>Confusion matrices of fruit juice samples classification using RF; scores are given as a proportion of predicted</p>Conclusion<p>The use of e-nose based on ultra-fast gas chromatography equipped with unsupervised and supervised chemometric methods is an effective tool for authentication fruit juice samples. This technique allows to omit sample preparation step and provides a low time-consuming single analysis. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that using HCA methods allowed to classify orange juice samples for unadulterated and adulterated with apple juice. Unfortunately, samples of orange juice containing 1.0% of apple juice were assigned to the group of unadulterated samples. More reliable results were achieved through the use of supervised statistical methods. The combination of e-nose measurements with Random Forest classifier made it possible to distinguish between particular orange juice samples based on the added volume of apple juice. The obtained results are the basis for further investigations. In the near future, the focus should be placed on the developed methodology, in which samples of fruit nectars and juices from concentrate will be considered. They are one of the most falsified ones.</p>Sample preparation<p>Fruit juices were obtained at local distribution centres in Gdansk. Samples were NFC juices, i.e., orange juice, apple juice, and mixtures of orange and apple juice (1/3/5/10/30/50% v/v addition of apple juice). The juice mixtures were prepared immediately after their purchase. A sample of 5.0âÂ±â0.1 g of each fruit juice was poured into 20Â cm3 glass vials that were then sealed with a cap with a siliconeâPTFE membrane. Samples were stored for 24Â h at 4Â Â°C. For each type of samples, the analyses were performed in ten replicates.</p>Instrumentation<p>The measurements were performed using an ultra-fast gas chromatograph Heracles II (Alpha MOS, Toulouse, France) equipped with a split/splitless injector and two flame ionization detectors (Î¼FIDs). The two parallel linked capillary chromatographic columns used for separation were non-polar MXT-5 (diphenyl dimethylpolysiloxane, 10Â mâÃâ0.18Â mmâÃâ0.40Â Î¼m) and medium-polar MXT-1701 (cyanopropylphenyl polysiloxane, 10Â mâÃâ0.18Â mmâÃâ0.40Â Î¼m). Before the headspace analysis, samples have been incubated in 40Â Â°C by 120Â s and with agitation speed 500Â rpm. The samples were injected by the HS 100 autosampler (Gerstel, MÃ¼lheim, Germany) with a 5.0Â cm3 syringe and the injection volume was 2.5Â cm3. The temperature of the injector and the detector were, respectively, at 200 and 270Â Â°C. Hydrogen was used as carrier gas and its flow was kept constant at 250Â mm3/s. The column temperature programming started at 40Â Â°C, held for 5Â s, and raised at a rate of 4Â Â°C/s to 270Â Â°C, maintained for the 30Â s. The AlphaSoft 12.4 software was used to process the data. The aroma descriptors were obtained through the use of data collected from the AroChemBase.</p>Data processing<p>Data from the e-nose measurements were exported and further processed using statistical methods. The chemometric analysis was performed using the Orange Canvas Data Mining v. 3.3.9 software (Bioinformatics Lab, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia). To normalise the features, they were centred by mean and scaled by the standard deviation. Ten chemical compounds were then selected based on one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The chromatographic peak areas corresponding to the selected chemical compounds were used as input data for hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Ward's linkage method was applied. Clusters were created after cutting the dendrogram at a value corresponding to 3.0% of the maximum distance. In this way, six clusters were formed. The supervised statistical methods Random Forest (RF), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), and Classification Tree (CT) were also used. RF method was chosen as a classifier based on the results of stratified tenfold cross validation. All the classifiers were taken with their optimal settings.</p>","answer":"AbstractThe food authenticity assessment is an increasingly important issue in food quality and safety. The application of an electronic nose based on ultra-fast gas chromatography technique enables rapid analysis of the volatile compounds from food samples. Due to the fact that this technique provides chemical profiling of natural products, it can be a powerful tool for authentication in combination with chemometrics. In this article, a methodology for classification of Not From Concentrate (NFC) juices was presented. During research samples of 100% orange juice, 100% apple juice, as well as mixtures of these juices with known percentage of base juices were tested. Classification of juice samples was carried out using unsupervised and supervised statistical methods.

A field experimental study was designed with the QAC plus daily hypochlorite cleaning as the experimental group and hypochlorite cleaning alone as the control group.The method of swabbing on moistened surfaces was used for sampling.It was found that 83% and 77% of the bedside surfaces of MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients respectively were contaminated with staphylococci at 08:00 hours, and that the staphylococcal concentrations increased by 80% at 1200 h over a 4-hour period with routine ward and clinical activities.Irrespective of the MRSA status of the patients, high-touch surfaces around the bed-units within the studied medical ward were heavily contaminated (ranged 1 to 276 cfu/cm(2) amongst the sites with positive culture) with staphylococcal bacteria including MRSA, despite the implementation of daily hypochlorite wiping.However, the contamination rate dropped significantly from 78% to 11% after the application of the QAC polymer.In the experimental group, the mean staphylococcal concentration of bedside surfaces was significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced from 4.4 Â± 8.7 cfu/cm(2) at 08:00 hours to 0.07 Â± 0.26 cfu/cm(2) at 12:00 hours by the QAC polymer.The results of this study support the view that, in addition to hypochlorite wiping, the tested QAC surfactant is a potential environmental decontamination strategy for preventing the transmission of clinically important pathogens in medical wards.","answer":"{\\"verdict\\": \\"NEI\\", \\"evidence\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

The target-based resistance spectrum for GE is unusually small, reflecting the fact that the GE binding site on RNAP includes residues of the RNAP active center that cannot be substituted without loss of RNAP activity. The GE binding site on RNAP is different from the rifamycin binding site. Accordingly, GE and rifamycins do not exhibit cross-resistance, and GE and a rifamycin can bind simultaneously to RNAP. The GE binding site on RNAP is immediately adjacent to the rifamycin binding site. Accordingly, covalent linkage of GE to a rifamycin provides a bipartite inhibitor having very high potency and very low susceptibility to target-based resistance.Introduction:GE23077( GE) is a cyclic-peptide antibiotic produced by the soil bacterium Actinomadura sp. DSMZ 13491( Figure 1A; Ciciliato et al., 2004). GE exhibits antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens in culture, including Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes( Supplementary file 1A; Ciciliato et al., 2004). GE inhibits both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial RNA polymerase( RNAP) in vitro, but does not inhibit human RNAP I, II, or III in vitro( Supplementary file 1B; Ciciliato et al., 2004). Analysis of the kinetics of inhibition suggests that GE inhibits RNAP at a stage subsequent to the formation of the RNAP-template complex( Sarubbi et al., 2004). 10. 7554/eLife. 02450. 003Figure 1. Mechanism of transcription inhibition by GE: inhibition of first nucleotide addition in transcription initiation.( A) Structure of GE. dmaDap, NÎ²-( Z-2, 3-dimethylacryloyl)-Î±, Î²-diaminopropionic acid; dhGln, Î², Î³-dihydroxy-glutamine; Ama, aminomalonic acid; aThr, allothreonine; iSer, isoserine.

GE does not inhibit nucleotide addition in transcription elongation( reconstituted transcription elongation complexes). DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02450. 005 GE is a non-ribosomally-synthesized cyclic heptapeptide( Figure 1A; Marazzi et al., 2005). The stereochemistry at four chiral centers of GE has been defined based on acid hydrolysis and gas chromatography, but the stereochemistry at five other chiral centers has not been defined( Figure 1A; Marazzi et al., 2005). Analogs of GE having modifications of the dmaDap, dhGln, and Ama residues, have been prepared by semi-synthetic derivatization of GE( Mariani et al., 2005). Here we report the target and mechanism of transcription inhibition by GE. In addition, we report a series of crystal structuresâincluding the first crystal structure of a substrate complex for de novo transcription initiation by a multisubunit RNAPâthat define the structural relationships between GE and RNAP, GE and promoter DNA, GE and NTPs, and GE and rifamycins. Our results show that GE inhibits RNAP through a novel binding site and novel mechanism. GE inhibits RNAP by binding to a siteâthe âGE targetââthat overlaps the RNAP active-center âiâ and âi+1â sites and that includes coordinating ligands of the RNAP active-center catalytic Mg2+ ion, Mg2+( I). Binding of GE sterically precludes binding of initiating NTPs to the i site, i+1 site, and Mg2+( I), and thereby blocks transcription initiation. GE is the first identified example of a non-nucleoside RNAP inhibitor that functions through direct interaction with the core catalytic components of the RNAP active-center: the i site, i+1 site, and Mg2+( I). Our results further show that the GE target has three features that make it an unusually attractive targetâa âprivileged targetââfor antibacterial drug discovery involving RNAP. First, the GE target includes functionally critical residues of the RNAP active center that cannot be substituted without loss of RNAP activity, and, therefore, that cannot be substituted to yield resistant mutants. Accordingly, the target-based resistance spectrum for GE is unusually small. Second, the GE target does not overlap the rifamycin target( the target of the most important RNAP inhibitors in current clinical use in antibacterial therapy; Ho et al., 2009). Accordingly, GE exhibits no or negligible cross-resistance with rifamycins. Third, the GE target is immediately adjacent to the rifamycin target. Accordingly, it is possible to link GE to a rifamycin to construct a bipartite inhibitor that binds simultaneously to the GE target and the rifamycin target and, therefore, that is exceptionally potent and exceptionally refractory to target-based resistance.Discussion:Our results establish GE inhibits RNAP through a novel mechanism and a novel target. Our results show that GE inhibits the first nucleotide-addition step in transcription initiation( Figure 1), show that GE functions through a binding site that overlaps the RNAP active-center i and i+1 sites( Figure 2), define the structural basis of RNAP-GE interaction and RPo-GE interaction( Figures 3, 4), and show that GE prevents binding of initiating NTPs to the RNAP i and i+1 sites( Figure 5). Our results further establish that the binding site on RNAP for GE is adjacent to, but does not substantially overlap, the binding site on RNAP for the rifamycin antibacterial drugs( Figure 2DâF), show that GE and a rifamycin can bind simultaneously to their adjacent binding sites in RNAP( Figure 6), and show that GE and a rifamycin can be covalently linked, through the GE dmaDap sidechain and the rifamycin C3-O4 region, to yield a bipartite RNAP inhibitor that binds to both the GE target and the rifamycin target( Figure 7). Three features of the GE target, identified in this work, indicate that the GE target is an unusually attractive targetâa âprivileged targetââfor antibacterial drug discovery involving RNAP. First, since most residues of the GE binding site are functionally critical residues of the RNAP active center that cannot be substituted without loss of RNAP activity, the target-based resistance spectra of an antibacterial compound that functions through the GE binding site will be small( â¼1/10 the size of the target-based resistance spectrum of Rif; â¼1/10 to â¼1/5 the size of the target-based resistance spectra of RNAP inhibitors; Figure 2D; Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). Second, since the GE binding site is different from the rifamycin binding site, an antibacterial compound that functions through the GE binding site will not exhibit target-based cross-resistance with rifamycins( Figure 2E, F; Supplementary file 2D, E). Third, since the GE binding site is adjacent to, but does not substantially overlap, the rifamycin binding site( Figures 2D and 6), an antibacterial compound that functions through the GE binding site can be linked to a rifamycin or a sorangicin to construct a bipartite, bivalent inhibitor that binds to both the GE target and the rifamycin target and, therefore, that is exceptionally potent and exceptionally refractory to target-based resistance( Figure 7).","answer":"As increasing numbers of bacteria become resistant to antibiotics , new drugs are needed to fight bacterial infections .

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Of the 2 genes (MAT1A, MAT2A) encoding methionine adenosyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes S-adenosylmethionine, MAT1A, is expressed in liver, whereas MAT2A is expressed in extrahepatic tissues. In liver, MAT2A expression associates with growth, dedifferentiation, and cancer. Here, we identified the beta subunit as a regulator of proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines. The beta subunit has been cloned and shown to lower the K (m) of methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 (the MAT2A product) for methionine and to render the enzyme more susceptible to S-adenosylmethionine inhibition. METHODS: Methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit expression was analyzed in human and rat liver and hepatoma cell lines and their interaction studied in HuH7 cells. beta Subunit expression was up- and down-regulated in human hepatoma cell lines and the effect on DNA synthesis determined. RESULTS: We found that beta subunit is expressed in rat extrahepatic tissues but not in normal liver. In human liver, beta subunit expression associates with cirrhosis and hepatoma. beta Subunit is expressed in most (HepG2, PLC, and Hep3B) but not all (HuH7) hepatoma cell lines. Transfection of beta subunit reduced S-adenosylmethionine content and stimulated DNA synthesis in HuH7 cells, whereas down-regulation of beta subunit expression diminished DNA synthesis in HepG2. The interaction between methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit was demonstrated in HuH7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that beta subunit associates with cirrhosis and cancer providing a proliferative advantage in hepatoma cells through its interaction with methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and down-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine levels.","answer":"[[\\"S-adenosylmethionine\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"MAT2A\\"], [\\"S-adenosylmethionine\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"MAT2A\\"], [\\"methionine\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2\\"], [\\"S-adenosylmethionine\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2\\"], [\\"S-adenosylmethionine\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"MAT1A\\"], [\\"S-adenosylmethionine\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"methionine adenosyltransferase\\"], [\\"methionine\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"MAT2A\\"]]"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

In addition, complicated procedures and intensive energy input (e.g., heat and sonication) are generally required.14 Most importantly, additional steps are needed to incorporate biological moieties for specific molecular recognition, making the entire process time-and labor-consuming.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate a novel one-step method for hydrophobic nanocrystal surface engineering to produce different types of water soluble nanocrystals with tunable molecular recognition, using chimeric DNA molecules containing both hydrophobic (diacyllipid) and hydrophilic (oligonucleotide) parts. Through hydrophobic interactions, whereby relatively apolar molecules aggregate in aqueous solutions,15 these chimeric DNA molecules spontaneously intercalate in the surfactant layer of hydrophobic nanocrystals using their hydrophobic parts, encapsulating an individual nanocrystal inside the diacyllipid core and leaving an oligonucleotide corona outside (Scheme 1). The resulting water-soluble nanocrystals have a relatively narrow hydrodynamic size distribution and long-term stability in various biological media. In addition, since DNA can specifically recognize their targets by either Watson-Crick base pairing or by folding into distinct tertiary structures, these functionalized nanocrystals possess excellent selectivity to a variety of biomolecular targets, varying from nucleic acids to cancer cells.</p><p>The chimeric DNA molecules are synthesized by efficiently incorporating a diacyllipid at the 5â² end of oligonucleotides through solid phase DNA synthesis on a fully automated DNA/RNA synthesizer, according to our previously reported procedure.16,17 To test the feasibility of this facile surface engineering method, oleylaminecoated Fe-Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticles (CSNPs) (13 nm) are first used. The as-prepared Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs were spherical and fairly monodisperse, as shown in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 1a). For functionalization, Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs in tetrahydrofuran, a water-miscible organic solvent, were mixed with chimeric DNA molecules in water. The reaction was conducted under ambient atmosphere while shaking. After washing to remove excess chimeric DNA molecules, the resulting Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs were readily dispersed in water (Figure 1c) with negligible aggregation (Figure 1b). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zetapotential measurements indicated that the as-prepared Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs in hexane had a diameter of 16.2 nm and a zeta-potential of 6.06 mV (Figure S1 in Supporting Information), respectively. While the modified Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs in water had a diameter of 27.2 nm and a zetapotential of -30.17 mV (Figure S1 and Table S2 in Supporting Information), respectively. These results suggested that hydrophobic Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs were stabilized by chimeric DNA molecules in water and formed uniformly distributed nanoparticles. The maximal concentration that functionalized Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs can reach in aqueous solution is more than 5 mg/mL, which is sufficient for most of their biomedical applications. In addition, the engineered Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs preserved the magnetic properties of the original nanocrystals (Figure 1d). Both UV-visible and FT-IR spectroscopies verified the presence of chimeric DNA molecules on the surfaces of functionalized Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs (Figure S2 and S3 in Supporting Information): the characteristic UV absorption peak around 260 nm and vibrational band between 750 and 1750 cmâ1 belonging to DNA were easily identified.</p><p>The surface density of chimeric DNA molecules on the modified Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs was estimated by fluorescence measurements (See Supporting Information for detailed procedures). With the newly developed surface engineering method, the number of chimeric DNA molecule per functionalized nanoparticle increased with ligand concentration and reached a plateau at the saturation concentration (Figure S4 in Supporting Information). Using fluorescently labeled lipid-T20, the saturation concentration for 0.5 mg/mL Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs was 25 Î¼M. On average, there were 48 chimeric DNA molecules per modified nanoparticle at that concentration. In order to obtain functionalized nanoparticles with desired solubility in aqueous environments, enough chimeric DNA molecules were needed â Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs modified with adequate chimeric DNA molecules (â¥ 10 Î¼M) are soluble upon adding water, whereas these ones engineered with insufficient ligands (â¤ 5 Î¼M) need vigorous votex or even sonication (Figure S5 in Supporting Information). In addition, chimeric DNA molecules with varying lengths (from 5 to 60 nt) and distinct sequence information were all found to generate functionalized nanoparticles with excellent water dispersity (Figure S6 in Supporting Information). Moreover, the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta-potential of modified nanoparticles increased with the length of chimeric DNA molecules (Table S2 in Supporting Information).</p><p>Since this novel surface engineering approach does not rely on the properties of the nanocrystal core or the reactivity of the nanocrystal surface, it could be generalized for many hydrophobic nanocrystals with variable size, composition, and morphology. To verify this point, chimeric DNA molecules were used to engineer Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) with two different sizes (7 and 15 nm diameter). Water-soluble Fe3O4 NPs with minimal aggregation were obtained under both circumstances (Figure 2a-b). In addition, this method worked equally well for nanocrystals with other compositions (CdS/ZnS QDs and Au NPs) and morphologies (Fe-Pt nanorods (NRs) and Au-Fe3O4 dimer nanoparticles (DNPs)) (Figure 2c-f). Detailed synthesis procedure for these hydrophobic nanocrystals can be found in Supporting Information. Therefore, the surface engineering method demonstrated here is independent of nanocrystal size, composition, and morphology. In addition, it is highly efficient with only a few empty micelles remaining (Figure S7 in Supporting Information).</p><p>In order to determine their utility in biomedical applications, the stability of engineered nanocrystals was evaluated in various solution environments. No obvious aggregation was observed in water, phosphate buffered saline, or cell culture medium, even after more than 6 months.</p><p>After confirming the stability of functionalized nanocrystals in biological systems, we systematically investigated their ability to recognize desired molecular targets. First of all, the hybridization between modified nanocrystals and their complementary DNA (cDNA) was studied (Figure 3a). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled lipid-20 and FITC-labeled lipid-T20 were used as target and control chimeric DNA molecules, respectively. The cDNA here wsa perfectly complementary to lipid-20. The cDNA-conjugated silica microspheres (cDNA-SiMSs) were prepared by immobilizing biotinylated cDNA onto strepavidin-coated SiMSs (SA-SiMSs), and then incubating with engineered Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs under ambient atmosphere in hybridization buffer (20 mM Tri-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) while shaking for 4 hours. For cDNA-SiMSs treated with lipid-20-functionalized Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs, a strong green fluorescence signal was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), indicating a high degree of hybridization, while no fluorescence was seen for cDNA-SiMSs mixed with lipid-T20-modified Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs, suggesting no hybridization (Figure 3b). In addition, coating of lipid-20-functionalized Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs (instead of lipid-T20-modified Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs) onto cDNA-SiMSs was viewed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 3c), further showing the selective binding of engineered Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs to their nucleic acid target. In addition, SEM images also illustrated that the hybridization event did not disrupt the structure integrity of engineered Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs.</p><p>Next, we tested the binding between modified nanocrystals and their target cancer cells, which is of great significance to their use in early cancer diagnosis and efficient cancer therapy. To accomplish this, Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs were functionalized with a FITC-labeled chimeric aptamer. Aptamers, generated from a process known as SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment), are single-stranded oligonucleotides which can bind to their targets with high affinity and excellent selectivity by folding into distinct secondary or tertiary structures.18 Sgc8 aptamer,19 previously developed to specifically bind to CEM cells (T cell line, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia) using Ramos cells (B cell line, human Burkitt';s lymphoma) as control, was chosen for the study (Figure 4a). According to flow cytometry histograms, an obvious shift (binding) was observed for CEM (target) cells, but only negligible shift was noticed for Ramos (control) cells (Figure 4b). More importantly, even though much fewer engineered Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs (5 nM, 28 aptamers per functionalized nanoparticle) were used compared to free aptamers (200 nM), a much larger shift was achieved using modified Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs due to the multivalent effect. The affinity of a ligand to its receptor is highly dependent on its valency (the number of sites available for receptor attachment). Therefore, the presence of multiple aptamers on the surface of functionalized Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs resulted in greater cooperation, thereby enhancing the binding affinity to target cancer cells. With FITC-labeled chimeric aptamer, the modified Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs can be used as specific fluorescence imaging agents with excellent sensitivity.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the best noninvasive imaging modalities because of its ability to provide a large amount of spatial and temporal information using various contrast agents, especially iron oxide nanocrystals.20-23 Therefore, we also tested the potential of using engineered Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs as T2 (transverse relaxation time) contrast agents. Based on a self-amplifying proximity assay,24 when multiple modified Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs bind to the receptors on their target cancer cells, they act cooperatively to form micrometer-scale clusters, thereby enhancing the net transverse relaxation of neighboring protons and leading to a darker image. T2-weighted MRI was taken for both CEM cells and Ramos cells treated with functionalized Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs (Figure 4c). Similar darkness was observed for engineered Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs incubated with buffer only and Ramos cells. However, a significantly darker spot was obtained for modified Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs mixed with CEM cells, as a result of their highly specific interaction, demonstrating that functionalized Fe-Fe3O4 CSNPs can also serve as selective contrast agents with high performance.</p><p>Compared to traditional polymer systems used to produce biocompatible nanocrystals from hydrophobic ones, like polyethylene glycol (PEG), the new method demonstrated here provides a more time- and labor-efficient single-step surface engineering approach: the DNA corona not only renders the functionalized nano-particles with excellent water solubility, but also furnishes them with tunable specific targeting. However, multiple steps are needed to accomplish the phase transfer of hydrophobic nanocrystals using traditional polymer systems, and additional procedures are further required for conjugating targeting ligands. In addition, without the necessity of complicated organic synthesis, all these chimeric DNA molecules can be synthesized on a fully automated DNA/RNA synthesizer. If desired, different modifiers, including commericially-available organic dyes, functional groups, therapeutic agents, or even short polymers (e.g., PEG) can be introduced at any location of the sequence during synthesis.</p><p>To summarize, we have developed a one-step facile surface engineering approach for hydrophobic nanocrystals using chimeric DNA molecules. This method is simple, efficient, and can be readily adapted to a broad range of nanocrystals with different size, composition and morphology. Engineered nanocrystals possess excellent dispersity in biological fluids with minimal aggregation and long-term stability. In particular, this novel surface engineering approach equips modified nanocrystals with designer molecular recognition to various molecular addresses, varying from nucleic acids to cancer cells. Based on all these superior features, we believe that this newly developed surface engineering approach will greatly facilitate the use of nanocrystals in many biomedical applications.</p>","answer":"High quality nanocrystals have demonstrated substantial potential for biomedical applications. However, being generally hydrophobic, their use has been greatly limited by complicated and inefficient surface engineering that often fails to yield biocompatible nanocrystals with minimal aggregation in biological fluids and active targeting toward specific biomolecules.

The procedure is simple and versatile, generating individual nanocrystals with multiple ligands. In addition, the resulting nanocrystals can actively and specifically target various molecular addresses, varying from nucleic acids to cancer cells. Together, the strategy developed here holds great promise in generating critical technologies needed for biomedical applications of nanocrystals."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases  have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance (Hammond et al., 2015; McKendry et al., 2016; Akbarshahi et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells (Becker, 2006; McKendry et al., 2016) . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNÎ²) and III (IFNÎ») interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium (Contoli et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2019; Wark, 2019) . Due to the viral components remaining in the airway, antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation (Wood et al., 2011; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018) . These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) . With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection. On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway (Guibas et al., 2018) . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections (Vasileiou et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation. Another mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Sajjan et al., 2008; Kast et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018) . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Another recent area of interest is the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome. The development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases is usually linked to specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment (Diver et al., 2019) . In the event of a viral infection such as RV infection, the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present (Molyneaux et al., 2013; Kloepfer et al., 2014; Kloepfer et al., 2017; Jubinville et al., 2018; van Rijn et al., 2019) . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation (Marks et al., 2013; Chao et al., 2014) . Moreover, a viral infection may also alter the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth (Siegel et al., 2014; Mallia et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the destabilization is further compounded by impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a Wang et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2019) . All these may gradually lead to more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles (Teo et al., 2018) . These changes may in turn result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between virus and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Wark et al., 2013; Singanayagam et al., 2018) . To counteract these effects, microbiome-based therapies are in their infancy but have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome (Bakken et al., 2011) . Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection. Viral infections can cause the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier. Ciliary proteins FIGURE 2 | Changes in the upper airway epithelium contributing to viral exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. The upper airway epithelium is the primary contact/infection site of most respiratory viruses. Therefore, its infection by respiratory viruses may have far reaching consequences in augmenting and synergizing current and future acute exacerbations. The destruction of epithelial barrier, mucociliary function and cell death of the epithelial cells serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. The opening of tight junction increasing the leakiness further augments the inflammation and exacerbations. In addition, viral infections are usually accompanied with oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. Finally, the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promotes growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome. Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection. Viral specific trait contributing to exacerbation mechanism (with literature evidence) Oxidative stress ROS production (RV, RSV, IFV, HSV)As RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation (see text for abbreviations). that aid in the proper function of the motile cilia in the airways are aberrantly expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells which are the major target for RV infection (Griggs et al., 2017) . Such form of secondary cilia dyskinesia appears to be present with chronic inflammations in the airway, but the exact mechanisms are still unknown (Peng et al., , 2019 Qiu et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, it was found that in viral infection such as IFV, there can be a change in the metabolism of the cells as well as alteration in the ciliary gene expression, mostly in the form of down-regulation of the genes such as dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) and multiciliate differentiation And DNA synthesis associated cell cycle protein (MCIDAS) (Tan et al., 2018b . The recently emerged Wuhan CoV was also found to reduce ciliary beating in infected airway epithelial cell model (Zhu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, viral infections such as RSV was shown to directly destroy the cilia of the ciliated cells and almost all respiratory viruses infect the ciliated cells (Jumat et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) . In addition, mucus overproduction may also disrupt the equilibrium of the mucociliary function following viral infection, resulting in symptoms of acute exacerbation (Zhu et al., 2009) . Hence, the disruption of the ciliary movement during viral infection may cause more foreign material and allergen to enter the airway, aggravating the symptoms of acute exacerbation and making it more difficult to manage. The mechanism of the occurrence of secondary cilia dyskinesia can also therefore be explored as a means to limit the effects of viral induced acute exacerbation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional modulation of biological processes, and implicated in a number of diseases (Tan et al., 2014) . miRNAs are found to be induced by viral infections and may play a role in the modulation of antiviral responses and inflammation (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018) . In the case of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, circulating miRNA changes were found to be linked to exacerbation of the diseases (Wardzynska et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is likely that such miRNA changes originated from the infected epithelium and responding immune cells, which may serve to further dysregulate airway inflammation leading to exacerbations. Both IFV and RSV infections has been shown to increase miR-21 and augmented inflammation in experimental murine asthma models, which is reversed with a combination treatment of anti-miR-21 and corticosteroids (Kim et al., 2017) .Question: Who has impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance ?","answer":"Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

We discuss realistic instances where observational overfitting may occur and its difference from other confounding factors, and design a parametric theoretical framework to induce observational overfitting that can be applied to any underlying MDP.2. We study observational overfitting with linear quadratic regulators (LQR) in a synthetic environment and neural networks such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutions in classic Gym environments.A primary novel result we demonstrate for all cases is that implicit regularization occurs in this setting in RL.We further test the implicit regularization hypothesis on the benchmark CoinRun from using MLPs, even when the underlying MDP dynamics are changing per level.3. In the Appendix, we expand upon previous experiments by including full training curve and hyperparamters.We also provide an extensive analysis of the convex one-step LQR case under the observational overfitting regime, showing that under Gaussian initialization of the policy and using gradient descent on the training cost, a generalization gap must necessarily exist.The structure of this paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 discusses the motivation behind this work and the synthetic construction to abstract certain observation effects.Section 3 demonstrates numerous experiments using this synthetic construction that suggest implicit regularization is at work.Finally, Section 3.4 tests the implicit regularization hypothesis on CoinRun, as well as ablates various ImageNet architectures and margin metrics in the Appendix.We have identified and isolated a key component of overfitting in RL as the particular case of \\"observational overfitting\\", which is particularly attractive for studying architectural implicit regularizations.We have analyzed this setting extensively, by examining 3 main components:1. The analytical case of LQR and linear policies under exact gradient descent, which lays the foundation for understanding theoretical properties of networks in RL generalization.2. The empirical but principled Projected-Gym case for both MLP and convolutional networks which demonstrates the effects of neural network policies under nonlinear environments.3. The large scale case for CoinRun, which can be interpreted as a case where relevant features are moving across the input, where empirically, MLP overparametrization also improves generalization.We noted that current network policy bounds using ideas from SL are unable to explain overparametrization effects in RL, which is an important further direction.In some sense, this area of RL generalization is an extension of static SL classification from adding extra RL components.For instance, adding a nontrivial \\"combination function\\" between f and g Î¸ that is dependent on time (to simulate how object pixels move in a real game) is both an RL generalization issue and potentially video classification issue, and extending results to the memory-based RNN case will also be highly beneficial.Furthermore, it is unclear whether such overparametrization effects would occur in off-policy methods such as Q-learning and also ES-based methods.In terms of architectural design, recent works (Jacot et al., 2018; Garriga-Alonso et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019) have shed light on the properties of asymptotically overparametrized neural networks in the infinite width and depth cases and their performance in SL.Potentially such architectures (and a corresponding training algorithm) may be used in the RL setting which can possibly provide benefits, one of which is generalization as shown in this paper.We believe that this work provides an important initial step towards solving these future problems.We further verify that explicit regularization (norm based penalties) also reduces generalization gaps.However, explicit regularization may be explained due to the bias of the synthetic tasks, since the first layer's matrix may be regularized to only \\"view\\" the output of f , especially as regularizing the first layer's weights substantially improves generalization.Figure A2 : Explicit Regularization on layer norms.We provide another deconvolution memorization test, using an LQR as the underlying MDP.While fg-Gym-Deconv shows that memorization performance is dampened, this test shows that there can exist specific hard limits to memorization.Specifically, NatureCNN can memorize 30 levels, but not 50; IMPALA can memorize 2 levels but not 5; IMPALA-LARGE cannot memorize 2 levels at all.Training, Test Rewards (f = NULL) IMPALA_2_levels IMPALA_5_levels IMPALA_30_levels IMPALA_LARGE_2_levels NatureCNN_30_levels NatureCNN_50_levels Figure A3 : Deconvolution memorization test using LQR as underlying MDP.","answer":"We isolate one factor of RL generalization by analyzing the case when the agent only overfits to the observations.

The demand for intensive care unit capacity in particular has increased significantly, and hospitals in most affected regions have struggled to cope. The focus of health care activity has shifted to the pandemic, with a negative impact on the management of other conditions. Neurosurgery, like most specialties, has been drastically affected but, arguably, warrants special considerations because many of the treatments required are time-critical. Lack or delay of appropriate intervention may lead, for an individual patient, to permanent neurologic injury and a significant decline in function and quality of life, or even death. In this report, we consider the challenges that neurosurgeons currently face in relation to the pandemic and are likely to face in the foreseeable future. The challenges are multifaceted with practical, ethical, legal, and other implications. These include re-deployment of staff to areas outside neurosurgery, treatment priority setting, ethical decision-making and risk of moral injury, as well as medicolegal risks, financial uncertainties and implications for training, research, and global health work. As well as patients, these challenges will affect neurosurgeons as doctors and as humans. The international neurosurgical community has a moral duty to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 crisis, but also to retain a duty to care for individual patients.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Multicenter randomized clinical trial. One eye of each participant was assigned to treatment, and the contralateral eye was assigned to observation.                A total of 1052 participants who had > or =10 large (>125 microm) drusen and VA> or =20/40 in each eye enrolled through 22 clinical centers.                The initial laser treatment protocol specified 60 barely visible burns applied in a grid pattern within an annulus between 1500 and 2500 mum from the foveal center. At 12 months, eyes assigned to treatment that had sufficient drusen remaining were retreated with 30 burns by targeting drusen within an annulus between 1000 and 2000 mum from the foveal center.                Proportion of eyes at 5 years with loss of > or =3 lines of VA from baseline. Secondary outcome measures included the development of choroidal neovascularization or geographic atrophy (GA), change in contrast threshold, change in critical print size, and incidence of ocular adverse events.                At 5 years, 188 (20.5%) treated eyes and 188 (20.5%) observed eyes had VA scores > or = 3 lines worse than at the initial visit (P = 1.00). Cumulative 5-year incidence rates for treated and observed eyes were 13.3% and 13.3% (P = 0.95) for choroidal neovascularization and 7.4% and 7.8% (P = 0.64) for GA, respectively. The contrast threshold doubled in 23.9% of treated eyes and in 20.5% of observed eyes (P = 0.40). The critical print size doubled in 29.6% of treated eyes and in 28.4% of observed eyes (P = 0.70). Seven treated eyes and 14 observed eyes had an adverse event of a > or =6-line loss in VA in the absence of late age-related macular degeneration or cataract.                As applied in the Complications of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial, low-intensity laser treatment did not demonstrate a clinically significant benefit for vision in eyes of people with bilateral large drusen.Title 2:Prophylactic laser treatment in early age related maculopathy reduced the incidence of exudative complications.Abstract 2:To investigate the effect of prophylactic laser treatment on drusen area and incidence of exudative lesions in patients with soft drusen maculopathy.                In a prospective study, patients with early age related maculopathy (ARM) and good visual acuity were randomized to laser treatment or to a control group. Each group consisted of two subgroups: a fellow eye group and a bilateral drusen group. At 3 years, 36 of 38 enrolled patients remained in the study. Photocoagulation was performed with an argon green laser, approximately 100 mild laser burns being placed on and between the drusen in a perifoveal temporal horseshoe-shaped area. Both cases and controls were subjected to fundus colour photographs and fluorescein angiograms at regular intervals, and the drusen area was calculated in both photographs and angiograms. At baseline, there were no significant differences (p > 0.3-0.8) in drusen area between the groups.                In the treatment group, mean drusen area decreased significantly in the fundus photographs as well as in the angiograms (p < 0.001). Visual acuity and colour contrast sensitivity (CCS) did not change significantly. All these results are valid also for the subgroups. In the control group, however, mean drusen area increased significantly (p < 0.001). Mean visual acuity decreased significantly (p < 0.01) as did the colour contrast sensitivity along the tritan axis (p = 0.02). For the fellow eye control group (n = 7), the increase in drusen area in fundus photographs and the decrease in CCS along the tritan axis were not statistically significant (p = 0.57 and p = 0.37, respectively). Furthermore, at 3 years, five patients in the control group showed exudative lesions (1/7 in the fellow eye group and 4/12 in the bilateral drusen group), whereas no such complications occurred in the treatment group. One patient developed a small atrophy, however. Thus, there is now a significant difference (p = 0.047), however with a large 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.46, regarding exudative complications between the treated group and the control group in our small patient material.                Perifoveal mild laser treatment causes a reduction in drusen area in patients with soft drusen maculopathy and may lower the incidence of exudative lesions.Title 3:Therapeutic benefits of infrared (810-nm) diode laser macular grid photocoagulation in prophylactic treatment of nonexudative age-related macular degeneration: two-year results of a randomized pilot study.Abstract 3:This pilot study collected preliminary information on the effectiveness and safety of infrared (810-nm) diode laser macular grid photocoagulation in patients with nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Results from this pilot study were used in designing a larger, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.                A multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.                A total of 229 eyes of 152 patients with AMD were enrolled in the pilot study. Seventy-five patients with 1 eye eligible (75 eyes) were enrolled in the unilateral arm of the study; 77 patients with both eyes eligible (154 eyes) were enrolled in the bilateral arm of the study. In the unilateral study arm, 32 eyes were randomized to the observation group, 27 eyes were treated with visible endpoint burns, and 16 eyes were treated with invisible endpoint (subthreshold) lesions. In the bilateral study arm, 77 eyes were in the observation group, 36 eyes were treated with visible burns, and 41 eyes were treated with subthreshold (invisible) lesions.                Eyes were treated with infrared (810-nm) diode laser macular grid photocoagulation using either visible burns or subthreshold (invisible) lesions and compared to eyes receiving no treatment.                Reduction of drusen, change in visual acuity, and rate of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) membrane formation.                At 12 months after treatment, 62% of eyes treated with visible burns had a clinically significant reduction in drusen, whereas this proportion (65%) was reached in 18 months for eyes treated with subthreshold lesions. At 24 months' follow-up, treated eyes had a significant reduction in drusen compared to observation eyes (P < 0.0001). Visual acuity was significantly improved in treated eyes at 12, 18, and 24 months compared to observation eyes (P < 0.001). Choroidal neovascularization formation was similar in treated and observation eyes through 24 months' follow-up. Complications included CNV associated with six eyes treated with visible burns and a juxtafoveal laser scar in one eye treated with visible burns.                Infrared (810-nm) diode laser macular grid photocoagulation in patients with nonexudative AMD significantly reduces drusen levels (P < 0.0001) and significantly improves visual acuity (P < 0.001) when either visible endpoint burns or subthreshold endpoint lesions are used. Complications were fewer using subthreshold endpoint lesions. A larger, multicenter, prospective clinical trial with longer follow-up is needed to determine the efficacy of treatment in reducing the rate of CNV formation. Data from this clinical pilot study have been used to design the Prophylactic Treatment of AMD Trial (PTAMD), a multicenter, randomized, prospective clinical trial currently in progress comparing subthreshold (invisible) treatment to observation in eyes with nonexudative AMD.Title 4:Prophylactic treatment of age-related macular degeneration report number 1: 810-nanometer laser to eyes with drusen. Unilaterally eligible patients.Abstract 4:To determine the effects of subthreshold 810-nm-diode laser treatment on the rate of development of choroidal neovascularization (primary end point) and the effect on visual acuity (VA) in participants with multiple large drusen in one eye and a preexisting neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) lesion in the other.                Multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial.                Two hundred forty-four patients > or =50 years of age and with a neovascular or advanced AMD lesion in one eye and, in the fellow \\"study\\" eye, (1) at least 5 drusen > or = 63 mum in diameter, (2) Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study best-corrected VA (BCVA) of 20/63 or better, and (3) no evidence of neovascularization at baseline.                Patients were randomized to treatment or observation of their study eye at each of 22 centers. At each visit, the protocol specified that BCVA, a complete retinal examination, and fluorescein angiography be documented. Treated eyes had a grid of 48 extrafoveal, subthreshold diode (810 nm) laser spots, 125 mum in diameter, placed in an annulus outside of the foveola. Patients were seen at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after randomization. No retreatments were allowed.                Development of choroidal neovascularization (as confirmed by fluorescein angiography) and change in BCVA.                Throughout follow-up, the rate of choroidal neovascularization events in treated eyes consistently exceeded that in observed eyes. At 1 year, the difference was 15.8% versus 1.4% (P = 0.05). Most of the intergroup differences in choroidal neovascularization events occurred during the first 2 years of follow-up. Treated eyes showed a higher rate of VA loss (> or =3 lines) at 3- and 6-month follow-ups relative to observed eyes (8.3% vs. 1% and 11.4% vs. 4%, respectively; Ps = 0.02, 0.07). After 6 months, no significant differences were observed in VA loss between groups.                Prophylactic subthreshold 810-nm-diode laser treatment to an eye with multiple large drusen in a patient whose fellow eye has already suffered a neovascular event places the treated eye at higher risk of developing choroidal neovascularization. We advise against using prophylactic subthreshold diode laser treatment in these eyes.Title 5:A pilot randomized controlled study on the effect of laser photocoagulation of confluent soft macular drusen.Abstract 5:The authors determined the effect of photocoagulation of drusen on visual acuity and progression to subretinal neovascular membranes (SRNV).                One of paired eyes was randomized to photocoagulation with other eye to control in 27 patients having symmetrical maculopathy and visual acuities, aged 46 to 81 years (mean, 69.7 years); follow-up 1 to 6 years (mean, 3.2 years).                Final visual acuity was improved in treated eye or decreased in control eye in 12 patients, equal in 13 patients, and decreased in treated eye in 2 patients (P < 0.006). Progression to SRNV was less with treatment.                Laser photocoagulation of confluent soft macular drusen may improve long-term visual prognosis.Title 6:Laser photocoagulation for macular soft drusen. Updated results.Abstract 6:To update the results of a study on the disappearance of macular soft drusen after laser treatment in the natural evolution of age-related macular degeneration.                A total of 46 patients with confluent soft drusen and pigmentary changes were studied prospectively. Group 1 was composed of 30 patients with bilateral drusen; the authors randomly assigned one eye of each patient for treatment and the fellow eye for the control. In 16 patients a choroidal neovascular membrane was present in one eye, and treatment was applied to the fellow eye (group 2). Argon green laser treatment was applied directly to the soft drusen in the temporal macula.                All treated drusen disappeared in a mean of 3.5 months after treatment, and untreated drusen disappeared in all but three patients in an average of 8.5 months. After an average period of 3 years, only one control eye and none of the treated eyes in group 1 developed a choroidal neovascular membrane (P = 0.500). In group 2, neovascularization occurred in 18% of the patients. The initial improvement in Snellen acuity after subfoveal drusen disappearance diminished as a consequence of cataract progression.                Although no definitive conclusions should be made because of the small number of patients studied, results seem to show that this treatment does not reduce the risk of choroidal neovascularization in the treated eye of patients with a history of exudative disease in the fellow eye. It may be effective in patients with high-risk bilateral soft drusen, that is, in less advanced stages of the disease.","answer":"The trials included in this review confirm the clinical observation that laser photocoagulation of drusen leads to their disappearance. However, there is no evidence that this subsequently results in a reduction in the risk of developing CNV, geographic atrophy or visual acuity loss."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Ondansetron is widely believed to prevent postoperative vomiting more effectively than nausea . We analysed data from 5161 patients undergoing general anaesthesia who were randomly stratified to receive a combination of six interventions , one of which was 4 mg ondansetron vs placebo . For the purpose of this study a 20 % difference in the relative risks for the two outcomes was considered clinically relevant . Nausea was reduced from 38 % ( 969/2585 ) in the control to 28 % ( 715/2576 ) in the ondansetron group , corresponding to a relative risk of 0.74 , or a relative risk reduction of 26 % .

The alpha2beta1 integrin, a collagen receptor on platelets and megakaryocytes, is required for normal platelet function. Transcriptional regulation of the alpha2 integrin gene in cells undergoing megakaryocytic differentiation requires a core promoter between bp-30 and-92, a silencer between bp-92 and-351, and megakaryocytic enhancers in the distal 5'flank. We have now identified a 229-bp region of the distal 5' flank of the alpha2 integrin gene required for high-level enhancer activity in cells with megakaryocytic features. Two tandem AP1 binding sites with dyad symmetry are required for enhancer activity and for DNA-protein complex formation with members of the c-fos / c-jun family. The requirement for AP1 activation suggested a role for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in regulating alpha2 integrin gene expression. Inhibition of the MAP kinase cascade with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1, prevented the expression of the alpha2 integrin subunit in cells induced to become megakaryocytic. We provide a model of megakaryocytic differentiation in which expression of the alpha2 integrin gene requires signaling via the MAP kinase pathway to activate two tandem AP1 binding sites in the alpha2 integrin enhancer.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"platelets\\", \\"high - level enhancer activity in cells\\", \\"megakaryocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"distal 5 u0027 flank\\", \\"distal 5u0027 flank\\", \\"AP1 sites\\", \\"alpha2 integrin enhancer\\", \\"megakaryocytic enhancers\\", \\"silencer\\", \\"229 - bp region\\", \\"Megakaryocyte / Platelet - specific enhancer\\", \\"core promoter\\", \\"AP1 binding sites\\", \\"alpha2beta1 integrin gene\\", \\"alpha2 integrin gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"MAPK kinase 1\\", \\"AP1\\", \\"MAP kinase\\", \\"DNA - protein complex\\", \\"c - fos / c - jun family\\", \\"alpha2 integrin subunit\\", \\"mitogen - activated protein kinase\\", \\"MAPK\\", \\"alpha2beta1 integrin\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The role of prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) in modulation of vascular endothelial function is unknown. We investigated effects of PGA2 on pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) permeability and inflammatory activation and identified a receptor mediating these effects. PGA2 enhanced the EC barrier and protected against barrier dysfunction caused by vasoactive peptide thrombin and proinflammatory bacterial wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Receptor screening using pharmacological and molecular inhibitory approaches identified EP4 as a novel PGA2 receptor. EP4 mediated barrier-protective effects of PGA2 by activating Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and protein kinase A targets at cell adhesions and cytoskeleton: VE-cadherin, p120-catenin, ZO-1, cortactin, and VASP. PGA2 also suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory signaling by inhibiting the NFÎºB pathway and expression of EC adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1. These effects were abolished by pharmacological or molecular inhibition of EP4. In vivo, PGA2 was protective in two distinct models of acute lung injury (ALI): LPS-induced inflammatory injury and two-hit ALI caused by suboptimal mechanical ventilation and injection of thrombin receptor-activating peptide. These protective effects were abolished in mice with endothelial-specific EP4 knockout. The results suggest a novel role for the PGA2-EP4 axis in vascular EC protection that is critical for improvement of pathological states associated with increased vascular leakage and inflammation.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"PGA2 receptor\\", \\"NFu03baB\\", \\"VCAM1\\", \\"EP4\\", \\"VASP\\", \\"ICAM1\\", \\"protein kinase A\\", \\"EP4 receptor\\", \\"p120-catenin\\", \\"VE-cadherin\\", \\"ZO-1\\", \\"EC adhesion molecules\\", \\"Rap1/Rac1 GTPase\\", \\"cortactin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Optimal activation of T cells requires at least two signals. One signal can be delivered by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor, and the second signal is provided by the costimulatory molecule (s) delivered by the antigen-presenting cell. CD28 is a T-cell surface molecule and stimulation through this protein plays an important role in delivering the second activation signal. In this report, we show that in human peripheral blood T cells, CD28-mediated signal transduction involves the rel family proteins-- c-Rel, p50, and p65. Treatment of peripheral blood T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) results in augmentation of nuclear c-Rel, p50, and p65, and this augmentation can occur in the presence of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. It is also shown in this report that, in response to PMA / anti-CD28 mAb or anti-CD3 / anti-CD28 mAb, c-Rel, p50, and p65 are associated with CD28-responsive element present in the promoter of the human interleukin 2 gene. The functional significance of c-Rel involvement in the CD28-responsive complex is demonstrated by transient transfection analysis, where cotransfection of c-Rel augments the level of expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene linked to the CD28-responsive element.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"antigen - presenting cell\\", \\"human peripheral blood T cells\\", \\"peripheral blood T cells\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"promoter\\", \\"reporter gene\\", \\"CD28 - responsive element\\", \\"chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene\\", \\"human interleukin 2 gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"interleukin 2 CD28 - responsive complex\\", \\"CD28\\", \\"p50\\", \\"anti - CD28 monoclonal antibody\\", \\"NF kappa B family\\", \\"PMA / anti - CD28 mAb\\", \\"T - cell surface molecule\\", \\"c - Rel\\", \\"this protein\\", \\"p65\\", \\"CD28 - responsive complex\\", \\"antigen - specific T - cell receptor\\", \\"anti - CD3 / anti - CD28 mAb\\", \\"mAb\\", \\"rel family proteins\\", \\"chloramphenicol acetyltransferase\\", \\"nuclear c - Rel\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

We did a pilot clinical investigation, including a nonrandomized( 57 patients with large HCC) and a randomized controlled( 20 patients with large HCC) study. The patients were treated with transarterial chemoembolization( TACE) with or without bicarbonate local infusion into tumor. In the nonrandomized controlled study, geometric mean of viable tumor residues( VTR) in TACE with bicarbonate was 6. 4-fold lower than that in TACE without bicarbonate( 7. 1%[95% CI: 4. 6%â10. 9%] vs 45. 6%[28. 9%â72. 0%]; p<0. 0001). This difference was recapitulated by a subsequent randomized controlled study. TACE combined with bicarbonate yielded a 100% objective response rate( ORR), whereas the ORR treated with TACE alone was 44. 4%( nonrandomized) and 63. 6%( randomized). The survival data suggested that bicarbonate may bring survival benefit. Bicarbonate markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE. Funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China. ChiCTR-IOR-14005319.Introduction:We recently found that Lactic acidosis could effectively protect cancer cells against glucose starvation or deprivaiton( Wu et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2014). First, lactic acidosis dramatically reduces glycolysis rate with little wasting glucose to lactate, as such, a limited amount of glucose could support cancer cells for a relatively long time otherwise would be exhausted quickly. Second, when glucose was deprived, lactic acidosis transformed cancer cells to a âdormantâ state, via arresting cells at G0/G1 phase, initiating autophagy, inhibiting apoptosis, etc. The protective function relies on co-presence of lactate and proton, depriving either of which would abolish the function( Wu et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2014). When converting lactic acidosis to lactosis by a base, the protective function is gone; similarly, removing lactate, acidosis conferred cancer cells with little resistance to glucose deprivation. The significance of intratumoral lactic acidosis in tumor biology has been extensively revealed by many other investigators. Clinical studies showed that high level of lactate was a strong prognostic indicator of increased metastasis and poor overall survival( Gatenby and Gillies, 2004; Brizel et al., 2001; Walenta et al., 2000; Schwickert et al., 1995; Walenta et al., 1997; Yokota et al., 2007; Paschen et al., 1987). The work of Gillies and Gatenby group demonstrated that systematic and tumor pHe alkalization could inhibit carcinogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis, and they also provided integrated models that can predict the safety and efficacy of buffer therapy to raise tumour pHe( Silva et al., 2009; Robey et al., 2009; Ibrahim-Hashim et al., 2012) and related theoretical work( Martin et al., 2012, Martin et al., 2011). Furthermore, many studies reported that lactic acidosis played multifaceted roles in skewing macrophages( Colegio et al., 2014) and inhibiting the function of cytotoxic T cells( Haas et al., 2015), altering cancer cell metabolism( Chen et al., 2008; Sonveaux et al., 2008), inducing chromosomal instability( Dai et al., 2013), and promoting tumor angiogenesis( Gatenby and Gillies, 2004; VÃ©gran et al., 2011). According to the guideline of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer( BCLC) staging and treatment strategy, HCC larger than 3 cm in diameter is not suitable for curative therapy( surgical resection, liver transplantation, and ablation) and the recommended treatment is TACE( Forner et al., 2012; El-Serag, 2011; Knox et al., 2015). But sadly, it is recognized that TACE is not effective to treat large tumors( Sieghart et al., 2015). This leaves the patients with large HCC without choice of effective therapy, as also pointed out by Sieghart et al, âmaximal restriction of patients selection for TACE would otherwise only improve the results of the treatment modality per se but again would leave those more advanced patients within the intermediate stage without treatment options. â( Sieghart et al., 2015) TACE is for local control of the targeted tumor. TEXÂ equation checkTACE kills HCC via 2 mechanisms, delivering concentrated anticancer drugs locally into tumor and occluding tumor feeding arteries to deprive nutrients to starve cancer cells. We would focus on the second mechanism. Occluding tumor feeding arteries effectively deprive nutrients including glucose. The problem is that embolization-created hypoxia condition would stimulate cancer cells to emit strong signals to initiate angiogenesis( Knox et al., 2015) to reestablish tumor vasculature to bypass the occluded tumor feeding arteries. If the tumor cells cannot be rapidly eliminated, tumor vasculature would be re-established, and a certain amount of tumor( ranging from a few percent of the original tumor to even a larger tumor known as progressive disease) would survive and thrive. The lactate concentrations in HCC biopsies were around 20âmM( unpublished data), suggesting a lactic acidosis condition. After TACE, lactic acidosis would be trapped in embolized tumor and it would potentially attenuate the therapeutic efficacy of TACE. If it were true, locally infusion of bicarbonate to neutralize it would result in a severer necrosis in the embolized area.Discussion:In this clinical investigation, we carried out 2 studies sequentially, the first one is a nonrandomized controlled study, which demonstrated a remarkable therapeutic improvement of TILA-TACE, based on which, a randomized controlled study was designed and carried out, and again it demonstrated a superior anticancer activity of TILA-TACE. The most striking point is that the numbers reflecting the therapeutic improvements by TILA-TACE from the 2 studies were nearly identical( 81. 1% and 80. 1%). This confirms the consistency of anticancer activities of cTACE as well as TILA-TACE with respect to local control of large HCC. We compared the ORR in our cTACE practice with those reported globally. The averageÂ objective tumor response to TACE is 35%( range, 16%â61%), as systematically reviewed by LIovet and Bruix for the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer Group in 2002( Llovet and Bruix, 2003). In 2012, Forner, LIovet, and Bruix summarized that more than 50% of patients had an objective response to TACE( Forner et al., 2012), suggesting that the objective tumor response to TACE in the 10-year period( 2002â2012) had been increased for about 15%. The complete tumor response to TACE is rare( 0-4. 8%)( Jansen et al., 2005). Obviously, the results obtained from our cTACE practice were similar to those reported globally. TACE is for local control of the targeted tumor. Many previous studies have confirmed that better local control was an independent prognostic indicator for patient survival( Kim et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Shim et al., 2012; Riaz et al., 2011; Gillmore et al., 2011; Riaz et al., 2010). Kim et al and Shim et al( Kim et al., 2015; Shim et al., 2012) further demonstrated a clear prognostic difference between CR, PR, stable disease and progressive disease. The current study demonstrated that TILA-TACE achieved a remarkable improvement of local tumor control and suggested an early sign of improved survival for patients with large HCCs( Figure 5A). It is noted that, during follow up, 16 patients in the TILA-TACE arm( Figure 5A), eventually exhibited progressive disease, including 11 patients with new foci in the liver, 1 with new liver foci and lung metastasis, and 3 with lung metastasis, and 1 with bone metastasis, all of which may account for the death( Supplementary file 2). These observations suggest that fast CR and timely control of recurrent tumors in the liver would likely improve the survival of patients, especially those with large tumor burden and low liver reserve. Nevertheless, the work is limited by the study design. The randomized controlled study designed in this investigation was for local tumor control, not for survival. Although the small sample size allowed us to evaluate the local tumor control, we did not expect that such small sample size would yield statistically significant data for cumulative survival. Evaluation of survival is a matter much more complicated than evaluation of local control. There are many more factors affecting the survival of patients than those affecting the local tumor control, e. g., tumor characteristics, liver function reserve, tumor staging, disease complications, vascular invasion, metastasis, etc., all of which must be well controlled. While we acknowledged these limitations of the present small RCT, the preliminary survival data allowed us to rationally calculate the sample size for a subsequent large RCT for evaluating the survival difference between cTACE and TILA-TACE. We are planning a large-scale RCT to further confirm the therapeutic advantage of TILA-TACE with respect to overall and progression-free survival of patients with large HCCs. There was no significant difference of adverse effect between TILA-TACE and cTACE( Tables 3 and 4), i. e., TILA-TACE was as tolerable as cATCE. It was within our expectation, as locally administration of bicarbonate into tumor is safe. Taken together, this pilot study demonstrated that bicarbonate infusion locally into HCC can markedly enhance anticancer activity of TACE, supporting the notion that neutralizing intratumoral lactic acidosis combined with glucose deprivation may deliver an effective approach to control tumor.","answer":"Surgery is the main treatment for liver cancer , but the most common liver cancer â called hepatocellular carcinoma â can sometimes become too large to remove safely . An alternative option to kill the tumor is to block its blood supply via a process called embolization . This procedure deprives the tumor cells of oxygen and nutrients such as glucose . However , embolization also prevents a chemical called lactic acid â which is commonly found around tumors â from being removed . Lactic acid actually helps to protect cancer cells and also aids the growth of new blood vessels , and so the âtrappedâ lactic acid may reduce the anticancer activity of embolization . Previous works suggested that neutralizing the acidic environment in a tumor while depriving it of glucose via embolization could become a new treatment option for cancer patients . Chao et al . now report a small clinical trial that tested this idea and involved patients with large hepatocellular carcinomas . First , a group of thirty patients received the embolization treatment together with an injection of bicarbonate â a basic compound used to neutralize the lactic acid â that was delivered directly to the tumor . The neutralization killed these large tumors more effectively than what is typically seen in patients who just undergo embolization Chao et al . then recruited another twenty patients and randomly assigned them to receive either just the embolization or the embolization with bicarbonate treatment . This randomized trial showed that the tumors died more and patients survived for longer if they received the bicarbonate together with the embolization treatment compared to those patients that were only embolized . In fact , four patients initially assigned to , and treated in , the embolization-only group subsequently asked to cross over to , and indeed received , the bicarbonate treatment as well . These data indicate that this bicarbonate therapy may indeed be effective for patients with large tumors that are not amenable to surgery .

Response to epidemics in complex humanitarian crisessuch as the recent cholera epidemic in Yemen and the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congois a global health challenge of increasing scale [2] . The thousands of Yemeni and Congolese who have died in these years-long epidemics demonstrate the difficulty of combatting even well-known pathogens in humanitarian settings. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may represent a still greater threat to those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems to mount a comprehensive response. Poor governance, public distrust, and political violence may further undermine interventions in these settings. Populations affected by humanitarian crises are expected to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) tools, and stigmatization. Disease outbreaks further reduce access to limited healthcare, which is increasingly disrupted by attacks on health facilities and the persistent overburdening of health systems. These situations escalate both the necessity and the difficulty of delivering accurate and actionable information to potentially affected populations [3] . As the international community responds to SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. These standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. For example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on crisesaffected populations, governments and agencies will implement the familiar, global evidence-based approaches for combatting respiratory viruses. Respiratory hygiene i s a highly effective public health intervention, supported by evidence demonstrating that the spread of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be prevented by hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing [4] . Hand hygiene is a readily implemented behavior: the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30% [5] . Furthermore, hand hygiene is an avenue of agency for protecting one's own health, consistent with the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. Widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs is also possible in many resource-limited settings, with published protocols for local production [6] . The Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance [7] . However, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian WASH standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines [5, 8] . And yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence [9] . Gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission. Evidence-based guidelines alone in complex humanitarian crises may not suffice during the emergence of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Without the adaptation of existing standards, mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response. Crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning, in order to maximize the real-world effectiveness of efficacious interventions. Transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms are increasingly essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations [10] . Diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors is a necessary component of effective health governance in complex crisis settings [2] . Interventions tailored to the needs of crisis-affected populations, delivered with transparent information, in the context of inclusive governance practices, are urgently needed in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Question: What is an effective public health hygiene?","answer":"Respiratory hygiene i"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to learn the connections between branches in the network.Instead of being chosen a priori by the human designer, the multi-branch connectivity is learned simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing a single loss function defined with respect to the end task.We demonstrate our approach on the problem of multi-class image classification using four different datasets where it yields consistently higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art \`\`ResNeXt'' multi-branch network given the same learning capacity.Deep neural networks have emerged as one of the most prominent models for problems that require the learning of complex functions and that involve large amounts of training data.While deep learning has recently enabled dramatic performance improvements in many application domains, the design of deep architectures is still a challenging and time-consuming endeavor.The difficulty lies in the many architecture choices that impact-often significantly-the performance of the system.In the specific domain of image categorization, which is the focus of this paper, significant research effort has been invested in the empirical study of how depth, filter sizes, number of feature maps, and choice of nonlinearities affect performance BID8 BID17 BID24 BID19 Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; .Recently, several authors have proposed to simplify the architecture design by defining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in terms of combinations of basic building blocks.This strategy was arguably first popularized by the VGG networks BID25 which were built by stacking a series of convolutional layers having identical filter size (3 Ã 3).The idea of modularized CNN design was made even more explicit in residual networks (ResNets) BID13 , which are constructed by combining residual blocks of fixed topology.While in ResNets residual blocks are stacked one on top of each other to form very deep networks, the recently introduced ResNeXt models BID31 have shown that it is also beneficial to arrange these building blocks in parallel to build multi-branch convolutional networks.The modular component of ResNeXt then consists of C parallel branches, corresponding to residual blocks with identical topology but distinct parameters.Network built by stacking these multi-branch components have been shown to lead to better results than single-thread ResNets of the same capacity.While the principle of modularized design has greatly simplified the challenge of building effective architectures for image analysis, the choice of how to combine and aggregate the computations of these building blocks still rests on the shoulders of the human designer.In order to avoid a combinatorial explosion of options, prior work has relied on simple, uniform rules of aggregation (1) DISPLAYFORM0 Submitted to 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017).Do not distribute.In this paper we introduced an algorithm to learn the connectivity of deep multi-branch networks.The problem is formulated as a single joint optimization over the weights and the branch connections of the model.We tested our approach on challenging image categorization benchmarks where it led to significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art ResNeXt model.An added benefit of our approach is that it can automatically identify superfluous blocks, which can be pruned without impact on accuracy for more efficient testing and for reducing the number of parameters to store.While our experiments were focused on a particular multi-branch architecture (ResNeXt) and a specific form of building block (residual block), we expect the benefits of our approach to extend to other modules and network structures.For example, it could be applied to learn the connectivity of skip-connections in DenseNets BID14 , which are currently based on predefined connectivity rules.In this paper, our masks perform non-parametric additive aggregation of the branch outputs.It would be interesting to experiment with learnable (parametric) aggregations of the outputs from the individual branches.Our approach is limited to learning connectivity within a given, fixed architecture.Future work will explore the use of learnable masks for architecture discovery.Normalize the real-valued mask to sum up to 1:m DISPLAYFORM0 Set active binary mask based on drawn samples: DISPLAYFORM1 j of the mask, given branch activations y DISPLAYFORM2 and y DISPLAYFORM3 The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of color images of size 32x32.The training set contains 50,000 images, the testing set 10,000 images.Each image in CIFAR-10 is categorized into one of 10 possible classes.In Table 3 , we report the performance of different models trained on CIFAR-10.From these results we can observe that our models using learned connectivity achieve consistently better performance over the equivalent models trained with the fixed connectivity BID31 .Table 3 : CIFAR-10 accuracies (single crop) achieved by different multi-branch architectures trained using the predefined connectivity of ResNeXt (Fixed-Full) versus the connectivity learned by our algorithm (Learned).Each model was trained 4 times, using different random initializations.For each model we report the best test performance as well as the mean test performance computed from the 4 runs.","answer":"In this paper we introduced an algorithm to learn the connectivity of deep multi-branch networks.

As exemplified in Figure 1, this ring motif is a key structural feature in a family of furanoeremophilane natural products;1 some of which display a range of unique biological activities. For instance, atractylon reportedly exhibited apoptotic and antiviral activities.2 Despite the remarkably close structural resemblance, tubipofuran is known as an ichthyotoxin toward the killifish Oryzias latipes.1b Other examples can be found in cafestol and isolinderalactone. Isolated from coffee beans, cafestol is a tetrahydrobenzofuran-containing diterpenoid that has been described to play a role in cholesterol homeostasis, along with other pharmacological effects.3 In the case of isolinderalactone, recent pharmacology studies on this natural product revealed its antiproliferation and antimetastatic activities against several cancer cell lines.4</p><p>The relevance of tetrahydrobenzofuran in bioactive natural products has consequently rendered this heterocycle a valuable target for new synthetic reaction developments. A particularly effective platform to construct tetrahydrobenzofuran can be realized in a bimolecular manner via the [4+2] cycloaddition methodology, which enables the 6-membered ring formation.5 There are three possible retrosynthetic disconnections in this approach; each would require dienes in their respective form of vinyl furan, along with electron-deficient dienophiles as reaction partners. As exemplified in Scheme 1, Yamazaki reported type 1 [4+2] strategy that proceeded upon coupling of vinyl furan 1a and ethenetricarboxylate 1b, followed by in situ cyclization of intermediate 1c, thereby incorporating the C4-C5 segment in tetrahydrobenzofuran 1d.5a Melchiorre reported type 2 cyclization, in which nucleophilic activation of 2-furyl-acrolein substrate 1e with an amine catalyst produced highly conjugated diene 1f.5b This intermediate then underwent [4+2] cycloaddition with dienophile 1g to install the C5-C6 segment in tetrahydrobenzofuran 1h. A complementary type 3 synthesis, which readily introduced the C6-C7 segment was reported by Chen.5c In this instance, amine activation of ketone 1i generated furan conjugated diene 1j. The ensuing [4+2] cyclization with dienophile 1k furnished tetrahydrobenzofuran motif 1l.</p><p>The utility of cycloaddition methodology in addressing the need for concise synthesis of tetrahydrobenzofuran inspired us to develop a novel reaction to target this heterocycle. As a complement to the previous strategy that focused on the 6-membered ring, our work would approach the assembly of the furan core,6 highlighted by cascade [3+2] ring forming processes via silyloxyallyl cation chemistries (Scheme 2). To be precise, we envisioned the use of six-membered unsymmetrical silyloxyallyl cations 2b that would be readily generated from Î±-hydroxy silylenolate 2a in the presence of catalytic BrÃ¸nsted acid.7 The ensuing capture of this species with silylenolate 3 at the less substituted Î±-carbon should produce monosilylenol ether 2c.8 The cascade reaction would ensue with BrÃ¸nsted acid-catalyzed protodesilylation to unmask 1,4-diketone 2d, followed by Paal-Knorr cyclization to furnish tetrahydrobenzofuran core 2e.9 The novelty of our method also lies in its modularity that would expediently incorporate different substituents at the C2 and C3 positions. This synthetically non-trivial undertaking would be possible by simply varying the substituents of silylenolate 3.</p><p>Table 1 depicts our preliminary studies. Using Î±-hydroxy silylenolate 4 and acetophenone-derived silylenolate 5 as model systems, our optimization began with an investigation on ionization conditions that employed 0.2 equiv of Pyâ¢TfOH in MeCN at room temperature to enable Î±,Î±-coupling of the two silylenolates. This was then followed by warming the mixture to reflux to allow for the intended protodesilylation and Paal-Knorr cyclization to occur. Interestingly, such pilot conditions did not produce tetrahydrobenzofuran 6 despite the prolonged reaction time, yielding only the 1,4-diketone construct, viz.2d. This result indicated that while Pyâ¢TfOH readily promoted the key carbon-carbon bond forming step and protodesilylation of the monosilylenolate adduct, viz.2c, the furan cyclization appeared to require stronger acidic conditions. To address this issue, we introduced a second BrÃ¸nsted acid as an additive immediately after the completion of the Î±,Î±-coupling step, commencing with CSA. These conditions indeed furnished tetrahydrobenzofuran 6 albeit in small quantities. A significant improvement in product yields was observed when the reaction was warmed to reflux and performed in more concentrated solutions. We also examined other BrÃ¸nsted acid additives and found that the use of TsOHâ¢H2O afforded tetrahydrobenzofuran 6 in 79% yield. We noted the decreasing amount of TsOHâ¢H2O led to the decreasing product yield. Basing upon screening results, our optimized reaction protocol was developed as follows: Î±-hydroxy silylenolate 4 and silylenolate 5 were treated with 0.2 equiv of Pyâ¢TfOH at room temperature in acetonitrile at 0.5 M concentration. Upon completion of the Î±,Î±-coupling step, 1.2 equiv of TsOHâ¢H2O was added, and the mixture reaction was subsequently warmed to reflux to produce the desired tetrahydrobenzofuran 6. These conditions were applicable to scale up synthesis while maintaining its efficacy.</p><p>As shown in Table 2, we investigated the scope of this reaction, commencing with various silylenol ethers 7 that would introduce different substituents the C2 and C3 positions. For instance, a series of acetophenone-derived silylenol ethers bearing electronically diverse substituents, such as electron-rich and poor groups as well as halogen furnished products 8a-8c were isolated in acceptable yields. We then examined cyclic silylenol ethers derived from cycloheptanone, 4-phenylcyclo-hexanone, and Î±-tetralone, which afforded their respective polycyclic adducts 8d-8f in 51â70% yields. The utility of fully aliphatic silylenolate derived from 3-pentanone was evaluated. This nucleophile readily introduced alkyl substituents at C2 and C3 in tetrahydrobenzofuran 8g. A similar strategy could be applied to selectively incorporate two aromatic substituents at these positions, i.e. product 8h. We also attempted to subject silyldienolate. While the reaction indeed generated the target product 8i, it was isolated in a low yield due to decomposition that readily occurred during the cyclization sequence.</p><p>We then explored substituent effects at the Î±-carbon using Î±-hydroxy silylenolate 9 (Scheme 3). The presence of Î±-substituent was necessary, without which decomposition was noted instead of tetrahydrobenzofuran 10a. Substrates bearing aliphatic group motifs produced the corresponding adduct 10b-10d in 66â79%, but the furan cyclization in these products was performed with 1.2 equiv of CSA instead of TsOHâ¢H2O due to the presence of minor unidentifiable byproducts that could not be separated by column chromatography. The effect of various aromatic groups at the Î±-carbon was also examined. These included a phenyl group along with the para-methyl and para-chloro variants, as well as naphthalene, to afford tetrahydrobenzofuran 10e-10h in good yields.</p><p>During reaction optimization (Table 1), the generation of tetrahydrobenzofuran 6 was found to be more effective in the presence of stoichiometric amount of TsOHâ¢H2O. Interestingly, Bharatam and co-workers have hypothesized that water, in particular hydronium ion, plays a significant role in enhancing the Paal-Knorr cyclization.10 More specifically, hydronium ion is believed to readily form a hydrogen bond network in facilitating two key steps: the hydration of 1,4-diketone, leading to 5-membered cyclization, viz.11a, and dehydrative elimination of hemiacetal to furnish the furan core, viz.11b (Scheme 4).</p><p>Inspired by this report,10 we probed the role of water by qualitatively comparing the kinetic profile between our typical reaction conditions, i.e. TsOHâ¢H2O, and the anhydrous protocols (Scheme 5). In these experiments, the corresponding additives were introduced upon completion of Î±,Î±-coupling between silylenolates 4 and 5, followed by mixing the reaction at room temperature for 15 min to allow protodesilylation prior to furan cyclization at reflux. Aliquots of the mixtures were subjected to GC-MS every 15 minutes to determine the relative composition of monosilylenolate 12, 1,4-diketone 13, and tetrahydrobenzo-furan 6. There are several notable results: 1) A remarkable rate difference in the furan formation was indeed noted, in which TsOHâ¢H2O led a faster rate of reaction, thereby supporting the computational studies by Baratham.10 2) While undetectable by TLC, the reaction mixture contained residual 1,4-diketone 13 that persistently remained uncyclized under equilibrium. 3) The rapid disappearance of monosilylenolate 12 with both additives suggested that water had negligible effects in affecting the rate of protodesilylation of 12 within the time scale of our reaction.</p><p>Gratifyingly, the tetrahydrobenzofuran motifs produced via our method proved to be highly valuable as they could serve as a convenient substrate for a rapid assembly of polycyclic architecture. As demonstrated in Scheme 6, compound 6 could be readily subjected to [4+3] cycloaddition upon ionization of Î±-tosyl cyclohexanone with Et3N to furnish complex product 14 in 44% yield.11 The relative stereochemistry of this polycyclic compound was confirmed by X-ray.12</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a novel protocol for the concise synthesis of highly substituted tetrahydrobenzofuran via cascade reactions that are facilitated by silyloxyallyl cations and Paal-Knorr cyclization. The significance of water in affecting the rate of furan cyclization and the synthetic utility of the tetrahydrobenzofuran adduct toward a rapid construction of polycyclic molecular architectures were also demonstrated.</p>","answer":"An expedient synthesis of highly substituted tetrahydrobenzofuran via unsymmetrical silyloxyallyl cation is reported.

We investigated the in vitro antifungal activity of amphotericin B, alone and in combination with rifabutin, an inhibitor of bacterial RNA polymerase, against 26 clinical isolates of Aspergillus and 25 clinical isolates of Fusarium. Synergy or additivism between these drugs was demonstrated against all isolates tested. Amphotericin B MICs were reduced upon combination with rifabutin from a mean of 0.65 microg/ml to a mean of 0.16 microg/ml against Aspergillus , and from a mean of 0.97 microg/ml to a mean of 0.39 microLg/ml against Fusarium ( P < 0.000001 for both ) . Similarly, the MICs of rifabutin were reduced upon combination with amphotericin B from a mean of >32 microg/ml to a mean of 1.1 microg/ml against both fungi (P < 0.000001 for both). These positive interactions were corroborated by a colony count study with two Fusarium isolates, for which treatment with the combination of subinhibitory concentrations of amphotericin B (at concentrations 2- and 4-fold less than the MIC) and rifabutin (at concentrations ranging from 4- to 64-fold less than the MIC) resulted in 3.2-log reductions in colony counts compared to those after treatment with either drug alone. Inhibition of RNA synthesis was shown to be the mechanism of antifungal activity. These results suggest that inhibition of fungal RNA synthesis might be a potential target for antifungal therapy.sentence: Amphotericin B MICs were reduced upon combination with rifabutin from a mean of 0.65 microg/ml to a mean of 0.16 microg/ml against Aspergillus , and from a mean of 0.97 microg/ml to a mean of 0.39 microLg/ml against Fusarium ( P < 0.000001 for both ) .","answer":"[[\\"Amphotericin\\", \\"rifabutin\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

Hypoxia has been suspected to trigger transdifferentiation of renal tubular cells into myofibroblasts in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. To determine the functional networks potentially altered by hypoxia, rat renal tubule suspensions were incubated under three conditions of oxygenation ranging from normoxia (lactate uptake) to severe hypoxia (lactate production). Transcriptome changes after 4 h were analyzed on a high scale by restriction fragment differential display. Among 1,533 transcripts found, 42% were maximally expressed under severe hypoxia and 8% under mild hypoxia (Po (2) = 48 mmHg), suggesting two different levels of oxygen sensing. Normoxia was required for full expression of the proximal tubule-specific transcripts 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-hydroxylase (Cyp27b1) and l-pyruvate kinase (Pklr), transcripts involved in tissue cohesion such as fibronectin (Fn1) and N-cadherin (Cdh2), and non-muscle-type myosin transcripts. Mild hypoxia increased myogenin transcript level. Conversely, severe hypoxia increased transcripts involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, those of muscle-type myosins, and others involved in creatine phosphate synthesis and lactate transport (Slc16a7). Accordingly, microscopy showed loss of tubule aggregation under hypoxia, without tubular disruption. Hypoxia also increased the levels of kidney-specific transcripts normally restricted to the less oxygenated medullary zone and others specific for the distal part of the nephron. We conclude that extensive oxygen supply to the kidney tubule favors expression of its differentiated functions specifically in the proximal tubule, whose embryonic origin is mesenchymal. The phenotype changes could potentially permit transient adaptation to hypoxia but also favor pathological processes such as tissue invasion.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

The host response is an important determinant of disease progression. In order to delineate host molecular responses that differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic Influenza A infection, we inoculated 17 healthy adults with live influenza( H3N2/Wisconsin) and examined changes in host peripheral blood gene expression at 16 timepoints over 132 hours. Here we present distinct transcriptional dynamics of host responses unique to asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. We show that symptomatic hosts invoke, simultaneously, multiple pattern recognition receptors-mediated antiviral and inflammatory responses that may relate to virus-induced oxidative stress. In contrast, asymptomatic subjects tightly regulate these responses and exhibit elevated expression of genes that function in antioxidant responses and cell-mediated responses. We reveal an ab initio molecular signature that strongly correlates to symptomatic clinical disease and biomarkers whose expression patterns best discriminate early from late phases of infection. Our results establish a temporal pattern of host molecular responses that differentiates symptomatic from asymptomatic infections and reveals an asymptomatic host-unique non-passive response signature, suggesting novel putative molecular targets for both prognostic assessment and ameliorative therapeutic intervention in seasonal and pandemic influenza.Introduction:Influenza viruses are highly infectious and can cause acute respiratory illness in human hosts. Infected hosts present a variety of clinical symptoms including fever, runny nose, sore throat, myalgias, and malaise with potentially more serious complications such as viral pneumonia[1]. Many hosts also withstand comparable level of viral insult with little or no overt symptoms, exhibiting a higher degree of tolerance[2],[3]. Clearly, these asymptomatic infected hosts are able to control and eradicate viral threats more effectively than those who become symptomatic. Given the dynamic nature of viral infection, it is now recognized that interactions between hosts and viruses play a crucial role in determining the presence and absence of symptoms[4]. This leads to an interesting question â what are the principal factors associated with such divergent disease outcome? In recent years, seminal studies on the sensing of pathogens by pattern-recognition receptors( PRRs) and their related signaling cascades have advanced our understanding of innate immunity[5]â[10]. Many elegant experimental analyses have further elucidated the mechanistic activation and modulation of host response to invading pathogens[11]â[16]. By design, however, host responses in these experimental conditions are often characterized for individual cells via cell culture; or they represent a snapshot of the immune response pertaining to a limited number of time points. The components of the host immune system are diverse and they interact in a complicated manner. Owing to both technical and ethical difficulties, it has not been practical to experimentally determine the full course of immune responses leading to severe symptoms in otherwise healthy human hosts. Thus the time sequence and orchestration of host response events remain to be fully understood. The peripheral blood contains key elements of the immune system and the circulating immune cells recruited by the host in response to viral infection and virus-induced tissue damage provides a global view of the host immune response. Thus, we hypothesized that it can be used to monitor the temporal dynamics of host-virus interactions. Analyzing whole-genome gene expression profiles from healthy human subjects challenged with influenza H3N2/Wisconsin, we studied the full temporal spectrum of virus-mediated disease dynamics. Going beyond the peak symptom time analysis reported in Zaas et al.[17], this report offers an hour-by-hour detailed view of host immune response as a continuum, spanning the time from exposure to peak symptom manifestation. Utilizing biological and mathematical models, we highlight key immune response events representing potential factors that determine the pathogenicity of influenza viral infection. We further present a statistical risk-stratification model for estimating current disease state with potential forward risk assessment capability. These results are concordant with findings reported by Zaas et al. that was limited to peak symptom time analysis.Discussion:We showed that the viral sensing and inflammation in Sx hosts clearly correlate to clinical symptom development over time. As mounting evidence has established the role of various PRRs in sensing viral components of influenza viruses, our results confirm the concurrent activation of all known classes of PRRs and their signaling cascades by influenza viruses in human challenge models. In contrast, Asx hosts showed not only an absence of such activation, but also negative regulation of related inflammatory signals, especially in the case of NLRP3 and NOD2. This corresponds to their lack of clinical apparent symptoms. It has long been postulated that multiple PRRs represent a functional redundancy of host defense and that there exists signaling crosstalk among them, stimulating similar cytokine profiles that are both pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant[36]. Here we found simultaneous and continued activation of all known PRRs in Sx hosts with particular emphasis on NLR family genes. Of important relevance, two recent studies showed that H1N1 1918 pandemic virus induced upregulation of inflammasome components in a macaque model while avian H5N1 virus Vietnam/1203/04 caused increasing expression of NLR family genes in mice[50],[51]. In both cases, the early and sustained upregulation of inflammasome component genes was directly associated with lethal or detrimental host responses. Abnormal expression of NOD2 has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease[52],[53]. Conversely, it was shown in a study on chronic arthritis that Nod2 gene-deficiency resulted in reduced joint inflammation and increased protection against early cartilage damage in mice[54]. Our results provide new evidence for a much broader role played by NLR-family genes during influenza viral infection that is likely to be shared by multiple viral strains and influenced by specific cellular context. Their contrasting expression dynamics in Sx versus Asx points to potential benefit in controlling inflammation by regulating NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation or other inflammatory responses[55]. The inflammasome and pro-inflammatory cytokines have been linked to increased level of oxidative stress during viral infection[56]â[58]. A recent report showed in mouse model that Nlrp3 inflammasome activation depends on reactive oxygen species( ROS) and inhibition of ROS induction abolished IL1B production during influenza infection[59]. It is intriguing that our data shows a temporal Asx-specific upregulation versus Sx-specific suppression of SOD1 and SOK1. This coincides with the observed negative correlation between these genes and NLRP3. Since SOD1 and SOK1 are capable of reducing ROS and of suppressing oxidative stress[37], their increased expression in Asx hosts may play a role in negatively regulating NLRP3 expression and inflammasome signaling. In support of this hypothesis is a study on the efficacy of antioxidant therapy found that pyran polymer-conjugated SOD1 protected mice against potentially lethal influenza virus infections[38]. Together, our results provide evidence for a protective role of antioxidants SOD1 and SOK1. Their increased mRNA expression may constitute an effective antiviral mechanism by which aberrant immune responses are avoided in Asx hosts. It is estimated that Asx infections account for 30â50% of seasonal flu cases[2], which is consistent with the attack rate in our study. Since both Asx and Sx subjects were challenged under the same protocol and displayed inoculation dosage-independent viral shedding, this raises a critical question concerning the nature of the observed Asx phenotype. We have strong evidence that the observed Asx molecular signatures are a consequence of rapid innate response rather than being due to failed inoculation. Firstly, 50% of Asx subjects had evident viral shedding. This is on par with that of âsubclinicalâ or âsecondaryâ infections reported in the literature. In addition, serum neutralizing antibody( nAb) titre were nearly identical in Asx and Sx subjects on day 0 and day 7 with pre-inoculation nAb independent of disease severity. Critically, the nAb titre increased over time in both Asx and Sx individuals( Figure S12). This indicates a boosting effect of immunity, and suggests that even if viral replication was inhibited, enough viruses were detected by the Asx host immune system to cause expansion of Ab producing cells. Secondly, there was no apparent dosage effect â subjects who received relatively lower amount of inoculation do not necessarily become more ill than individuals who received higher dose of virus. We found no statistically significant dependence between disease outcome and inoculation dosage( Figure S13A). Furthermore, the amount of viral shedding from the site of infection did not appear to differ among groups who received varying inoculation doses( Figure S13B). Thirdly, Asx subjects presented dramatic transcriptional responses towards inoculation. When their expression profiles were studied alone, more than 3, 000 genes showed significant post-infection expression changes. These changes do not correlate with the amount of virus detected. Two subjects( #3 and #17) who never yielded detectable virus( <1. 25 TCID50/mL) in their nasal wash appeared to have the most significant temporal suppression of gene NLRP3( Table S2; Figure S14; Figure S15). Additionally, the responses of two seroconverted Asx subjects( #2 and #3), according to haemagglutination inhibition( HAI) assay, are not different from those of other Asx individuals( Table S2; Figure S14; Figure S15). With all presented evidence supporting the activation of a robust Asx immune response, our findings point to an important host factor that may lead to such Asx subclinical infections. Shutting down protein synthesis helps control infection by inducing apoptosis of infected cells[60]â[62]. Consistent with this, we observed marked downregulation of protein biosynthesis and apoptosis related genes in Sx hosts at mid-to-late stages( Figures S4, S5, S6). A similar lowering expression of ribosomal proteins has been reported in measles-infected dendritic cells[63]. What is surprising is the sustained upregulation of as many as 35 ribosomal proteins in only Asx subjects( Figure 6C, Figure S4). The increased ribosomal gene expression has been associated with peripheral blood lymphocytes[49] and our data also showed significant increase of white blood cells in Asx subjects( Figure S17). Lacking strong PRRs activation, and hence an absence of adaptive immune response, these Asx hosts appeared to be capable of mounting a more potent cell-mediated innate immune response than the symptomatic subjects. As our study mainly focuses on gene expression in whole peripheral blood, it is possible that the changes observed in gene expression levels are at least partially due to changes in cell population. However, this is unlikely for two reasons. First, the maximum observed change in cell populations for both Asx and Sx hosts was no more than 80% from baseline( Figure S17). Second, the distribution of leukocyte subpopulations is not correlated with phenotype at baseline or throughout the time course of the study( Table S6). Thus, the dramatic changes in gene expression described here cannot be attributed greatly to cell population changes. Another uncontrolled factor is that certain subjects may have come into the study with related preconditions. While we cannot completely dismiss the possibility of previous exposure to other respiratory viruses, all subjects were healthy and tested negative for H3N2 influenza antibody at pre-inoculation time. None of the volunteers had been vaccinated for any influenza virus in the previous 3 years. Finally, while we did not observe subject demographics such as age, gender, or ethnicity to be influential of final disease outcome( Table S1b), we cannot rule out the possibility of small sample bias. We have been careful to provide statistical safeguards against model overfitting by reporting significance measures( p-values and q-values with qualifying confidence intervals) that are associated with our findings. To our knowledge, this multi-institutional collaborative study presents the first systematic analysis of the full temporal spectrum of pathogen-elicited host responses during influenza viral infection. This work represents by far the most extensive in vivo human challenge study on influenza viruses. Combined with key clinical parameters, our results offer an opportunity to look beyond individual signaling events and into their collective effects on symptomatic disease pathogenicity. The detailed timing of various immune response events in vivo will advance our understanding of their biological and clinical relevance to influenza virus-mediated disease progression.","answer":"The transcriptional responses of human hosts towards influenza viral pathogens are important for understanding virus-mediated immunopathology .

The resultant inflammatory cytokine profiles were shown to contribute to the pathogenesis because their significant increase preceded disease manifestation by 36 hours . In subclinical asymptomatic hosts , we discovered strong transcriptional regulation of genes involved in inflammasome activation , genes encoding virus interacting proteins , and evidence of active anti-oxidant and cell-mediated innate immune response . Taken together , our findings offer insights into influenza virus-induced pathogenesis and provide a valuable tool for disease monitoring and management in natural environments ."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Due to the virus novelty, healthcare systems are challenged by a high rate of patients and the shortage of medical products. To address an increased need for essential medical products, national authorities, worldwide, made various legislative concessions. This has led to essential medical products being produced by automotive, textile and other companies from various industries and approved under the emergency use authorizations or legal concessions of national regulatory bodies. This paper presents a narrative commentary of the available documentation on emergency use authorizations and legal concessions for medical products during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: The basis for narrative commentary includes scientific articles published in Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Embase databases, official publications of international organizations: Food and Drug Agency (FDA), World Health Organisation (WHO), World Bank and United Nations (UN), and national regulatory agency reports in native languages (English, German, Bosnian, and Croatian) published from November 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. This paper focuses on three types of essential medical products: mechanical ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and diagnostic tests. Evidence-informed commentary of available data and potential identified risks of emergency use authorizations and legal concessions is presented. DISCUSSION: It is recognized that now more than ever, raising global awareness and knowledge about the importance of respecting the essential requirements is needed to guarantee the appropriate quality, performance and safety of medical products, especially during outbreak situation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency use authorizations for production, import and approval of medical products should be strictly specified and clearly targeted from case to case and should not be general or universal for all medical products, because all of them are associated with different risk level. CONCLUSION: Presented considerations and experiences should be taken as a guide for all possible future outbreak situations to prevent improvised reactions of national regulatory bodies.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

PURPOSE Different international target volume delineation guidelines exist and different treatment techniques are available for salvage radiation therapy ( RT ) for recurrent prostate cancer , but less is known regarding their respective applicability in clinical practice . METHODS AND MATERIALS A randomized phase III trial testing 64 Gy vs 70 Gy salvage RT was accompanied by an intense quality assurance program including a site-specific and study-specific questionnaire and a dummy run ( DR ) . Target volume delineation was performed according to the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines , and a DR-based treatment plan was established for 70 Gy . Major and minor protocol deviations were noted , interobserver agreement of delineated target contours was assessed , and dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) parameters of different treatment techniques were compared . RESULTS Thirty European centers participated , 43 % of which were using 3-dimensional conformal RT ( 3D-CRT ) , with the remaining centers using intensity modulated RT ( IMRT ) or volumetric modulated arc technique ( VMAT ) . The first submitted version of the DR contained major deviations in 21 of 30 ( 70 % ) centers , mostly caused by inappropriately defined or lack of prostate bed ( PB ) . All but 5 centers completed the DR successfully with their second submitted version . The interobserver agreement of the PB was moderate and was improved by the DR review , as indicated by an increased Îº value ( 0.59 vs 0.55 ) , mean sensitivity ( 0.64 vs 0.58 ) , volume of total agreement ( 3.9 vs 3.3 cm ( 3 ) ) , and decrease in the union volume ( 79.3 vs 84.2 cm ( 3 ) ) . Rectal and bladder wall DVH parameters of IMRT and VMAT vs 3D-CRT plans were not significantly different . CONCLUSIONS The interobserver agreement of PB delineation was moderate but was improved by the DR. Major deviations could be identified for the majority of centers . The DR has improved the acquaintance of the participating centers with the trial protocol .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"volumetric modulated arc technique ( VMAT )\\", \\"64 Gy vs 70 Gy salvage RT\\", \\"intensity modulated RT ( IMRT )\\", \\"3-dimensional conformal RT ( 3D-CRT )\\", \\"dummy run ( DR )\\", \\"intense quality assurance program\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [], \\"Participant\\": [\\"Thirty\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Notwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] . Childhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia  [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course. Chest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization's (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \\"end-point consolidation\\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \\"Other infiltrate\\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \\"Primary end-point pneumonia\\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \\"other\\" infiltrate). Widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] . The WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \\"presumed bacterial pneumonia\\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia. Empyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] . Several national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] . In addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] . A systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] . More recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] . Another etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] . Similarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas. Childhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries. Markers of undernutrition are strong risk factors for pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries only, with highly significant odds ratios for underweight for age (4.5), stunting (2.6) and wasting (2.8) . Household crowding has uniform risk, with odds ratios between 1.9 and 2.3 in both low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Indoor air pollution from use of solid or biomass fuels increases odds of pneumonia by 1.6 times; lack of measles vaccination by the end of the first year of age increases odds of pneumonia by 1.8 times [51] .Question: How can childhood pneumonia affect the subsequent health of a person?","answer":"Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] .

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling via TrkB crucially regulates synaptic plasticity in the brain. Although BDNF is abundant at hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses, which critically contribute to hippocampus dependent memory, its role in MF synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP) remained largely unclear. Using field potential recordings in CA3 of adult heterozygous BDNF knockout (ko, BDNF+/-) mice we observed impaired (â¼50%) NMDAR-independent MF-LTP. In contrast to MF synapses, LTP at neighboring associative/commissural (A/C) fiber synapses remained unaffected. To exclude that impaired MF-LTP in BDNF+/- mice was due to developmental changes in response to chronically reduced BDNF levels, and to prove the importance of acute availability of BDNF in MF-LTP, we also tested effects of acute interference with BDNF/TrkB signaling. Inhibition of TrkB tyrosine kinase signaling with k252a, or with the selective BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc, both inhibited MF-LTP to the same extent as observed in BDNF+/- mice. Basal synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity, and synaptic fatigue during LTP induction were not significantly altered by treatment with k252a or TrkB-Fc, or by chronic BDNF reduction in BDNF+/- mice. Since the acute interference with BDNF-signaling did not completely block MF-LTP, our results provide evidence that an additional mechanism besides BDNF induced TrkB signaling contributes to this type of LTP. Our results prove for the first time a mechanistic action of acute BDNF/TrkB signaling in presynaptic expression of MF-LTP in adult hippocampus.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug-induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents. Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain. From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. In rats, detection of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug-induced hypothermia. In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage. Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. By contrast, apomorphine-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box. Dopamine turnover ratios (DOPAC:DA and HVA:DA) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts.

We report cytogenetic and molecular studies of a de novo, apparently balanced t(1;3)(q32.1;q25.1) identified in a 12-year-old female (designated DGAP128) with cerebral atrophy, macrocephaly seizures, and developmental delay. A combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis demonstrated disruption of a synaptotagmin gene (SYT14) at the 1q32 breakpoint. Expression of SYT14 in human brain was confirmed using Northern analysis. Because members of the synaptotagmin family of proteins function as sensors that link changes in calcium levels with a variety of biological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone-responsiveness, SYT14 is an intriguing candidate gene for the abnormal development in this child. This is the first known constitutional rearrangement of SYT14, and further systematic genetic analysis and clinical studies of DGAP128 may offer unique insights into the role of SYT14 in neurodevelopment.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"synaptotagmin\\", \\"SYT14\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

We detail the evaluation scheme, tasks, metrics and how to collect and annotate the data for training, developing and test. The evaluation includes two tasks, namely user intent classification and online testing of task-oriented dialogue. To consider the different sources of the data for training and developing, the first task can also be divided into two sub tasks. Both the two tasks are coming from the real problems when using the applications developed by industry. The evaluation data is provided by the iFLYTEK Corporation. Meanwhile, in this paper, we publish the evaluation results to present the current performance of the participants in the two tasks of Chinese human-computer dialogue technology. Moreover, we analyze the existing problems of human-computer dialogue as well as the evaluation scheme itself.IntroductionRecently, human-computer dialogue has been emerged as a hot topic, which has attracted the attention of both academia and industry. In research, the natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue management (DM) and natural language generation (NLG) have been promoted by the technologies of big data and deep learning BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 . Following the development of machine reading comprehension BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , the NLU technology has made great progress. The development of DM technology is from rule-based approach and supervised learning based approach to reinforcement learning based approach BIBREF15 . The NLG technology is through pattern-based approach, sentence planning approach and end-to-end deep learning approach BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . In application, there are massive products that are based on the technology of human-computer dialogue, such as Apple Siri, Amazon Echo, Microsoft Cortana, Facebook Messenger and Google Allo etc.Although the blooming of human-computer dialogue technology in both academia and industry, how to evaluate a dialogue system, especially an open domain chit-chat system, is still an open question. Figure FIGREF6 presents a brief comparison of the open domain chit-chat system and the task-oriented dialogue system.From Figure FIGREF6 , we can see that it is quite different between the open domain chit-chat system and the task-oriented dialogue system. For the open domain chit-chat system, as it has no exact goal in a conversation, given an input message, the responses can be various. For example, for the input message âHow is it going today?â, the responses can be âI'm fine!â, âNot bad.â, âI feel so depressed!â, âWhat a bad day!â, etc. There may be infinite number of responses for an open domain messages. Hence, it is difficult to construct a gold standard (usually a reference set) to evaluate a response which is generated by an open domain chit-chat system. For the task-oriented system, although there are some objective evaluation metrics, such as the number of turns in a dialogue, the ratio of task completion, etc., there is no gold standard for automatically evaluating two (or more) dialogue systems when considering the satisfaction of the human and the fluency of the generated dialogue.To promote the development of the evaluation technology for dialogue systems, especially considering the language characteristics of Chinese, we organize the first evaluation of Chinese human-computer dialogue technology. In this paper, we will present the evaluation scheme and the released corpus in detail.The rest of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we will briefly introduce the first evaluation of Chinese human-computer dialogue technology, which includes the descriptions and the evaluation metrics of the two tasks. We then present the evaluation data and final results in Section 3 and 4 respectively, following the conclusion and acknowledgements in the last two sections.The First Evaluation of Chinese Human-Computer Dialogue TechnologyThe First Evaluation of Chinese Human-Computer Dialogue Technology includes two tasks, namely user intent classification and online testing of task-oriented dialogue.Task 1: User Intent ClassificationIn using of human-computer dialogue based applications, human may have various intent, for example, chit-chatting, asking questions, booking air tickets, inquiring weather, etc. Therefore, after receiving an input message (text or ASR result) from a user, the first step is to classify the user intent into a specific domain for further processing. Table TABREF7 shows an example of user intent with category information.In task 1, there are two top categories, namely, chit-chat and task-oriented dialogue. The task-oriented dialogue also includes 30 sub categories. In this evaluation, we only consider to classify the user intent in single utterance.It is worth noting that besides the released data for training and developing, we also allow to collect external data for training and developing. To considering that, the task 1 is indeed includes two sub tasks. One is a closed evaluation, in which only the released data can be used for training and developing. The other is an open evaluation that allow to collect external data for training and developing. For task 1, we use F1-score as evaluation metric.Task 2: Online Testing of Task-oriented DialogueFor the task-oriented dialogue systems, the best way for evaluation is to use the online human-computer dialogue. After finishing an online human-computer dialogue with a dialogue system, the human then manually evaluate the system by using the metrics of user satisfaction degree, dialogue fluency, etc. Therefore, in the task 2, we use an online testing of task-oriented dialogue for dialogue systems. For a human tester, we will give a complete intent with an initial sentence, which is used to start the online human-computer dialogue. Table TABREF12 shows an example of the task-oriented human-computer dialogue. Here âUâ and âRâ denote user and robot respectively. The complete intent is as following:âÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨Â¯Â¢Ã¦ÂÂÃ¥Â¤Â©Ã¤Â»ÂÃ¥ÂÂÃ¥Â°ÂÃ¦Â»Â¨Ã¥ÂÂ°Ã¥ÂÂÃ¤ÂºÂ¬Ã§ÂÂÃ¦ÂÂÃ©ÂÂ´Ã¨Â½Â¯Ã¥ÂÂ§Ã§ÂÂ«Ã¨Â½Â¦Ã§Â¥Â¨Ã¯Â¼ÂÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ©ÂÂºÃ¥ÂÂÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã£ÂÂInquire the soft berth ticket at tomorrow evening, from Harbin to Beijing, either upper or lower berth is okay.âIn task 2, there are three categories. They are âair ticketsâ, âtrain ticketsâ and âhotelâ. Correspondingly, there are three type of tasks. All the tasks are in the scope of the three categories. However, a complete user intent may include more than one task. For example, a user may first inquiring the air tickets. However, due to the high price, the user decide to buy a train tickets. Furthermore, the user may also need to book a hotel room at the destination.We use manual evaluation for task 2. For each system and each complete user intent, the initial sentence, which is used to start the dialogue, is the same. The tester then begin to converse to each system. A dialogue is finished if the system successfully returns the information which the user inquires or the number of dialogue turns is larger than 30 for a single task. For building the dialogue systems of participants, we release an example set of complete user intent and three data files of flight, train and hotel in JSON format. There are five evaluation metrics for task 2 as following.Task completion ratio: The number of completed tasks divided by the number of total tasks.User satisfaction degree: There are five scores -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, which denote very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied and very satisfied, respectively.Response fluency: There are three scores -1, 0, 1, which indicate nonfluency, neutral, fluency.Number of dialogue turns: The number of utterances in a task-completed dialogue.Guidance ability for out of scope input: There are two scores 0, 1, which represent able to guide or unable to guide.For the number of dialogue turns, we have a penalty rule that for a dialogue task, if the system cannot return the result (or accomplish the task) in 30 turns, the dialogue task is end by force. Meanwhile, if a system cannot accomplish a task in less than 30 dialogue turns, the number of dialogue turns is set to 30.Evaluation DataIn the evaluation, all the data for training, developing and test is provided by the iFLYTEK Corporation.For task 1, as the descriptions in Section SECREF10 , the two top categories are chit-chat (chat in Table TABREF13 ) and task-oriented dialogue. Meanwhile, the task-oriented dialogue also includes 30 sub categories. Actually, the task 1 is a 31 categories classification task. In task 1, besides the data we released for training and developing, we also allow the participants to extend the training and developing corpus. Hence, there are two sub tasks for the task 1. One is closed test, which means the participants can only use the released data for training and developing. The other is open test, which allows the participants to explore external corpus for training and developing. Note that there is a same test set for both the closed test and the open test.For task 2, we release 11 examples of the complete user intent and 3 data file, which includes about one month of flight, hotel and train information, for participants to build their dialogue systems. The current date for online test is set to April 18, 2017. If the tester says âtodayâ, the systems developed by the participants should understand that he/she indicates the date of April 18, 2017.Evaluation ResultsThere are 74 participants who are signing up the evaluation. The final number of participants is 28 and the number of submitted systems is 43. Table TABREF14 and TABREF15 show the evaluation results of the closed test and open test of the task 1 respectively. Due to the space limitation, we only present the top 5 results of task 1. We will add the complete lists of the evaluation results in the version of full paper.Note that for task 2, there are 7 submitted systems. However, only 4 systems can provide correct results or be connected in a right way at the test phase. Therefore, Table TABREF16 shows the complete results of the task 2.ConclusionIn this paper, we introduce the first evaluation of Chinese human-computer dialogue technology. In detail, we first present the two tasks of the evaluation as well as the evaluation metrics. We then describe the released data for evaluation. Finally, we also show the evaluation results of the two tasks. As the evaluation data is provided by the iFLYTEK Corporation from their real online applications, we believe that the released data will further promote the research of human-computer dialogue and fill the blank of the data on the two tasks.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the Social Media Processing (SMP) committee of Chinese Information Processing Society of China.

Understanding how wild animals, especially those already experiencing physiological extremes (e.g. fasting), regulate stress responses is critical for evaluating the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on physiology and fitness, key challenges for conservation. However, studies of stress in wildlife are often limited to baseline endocrine measurements and few have investigated stress effects in fasting -adapted species. We examined downstream molecular consequences of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation by exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in blubber of northern elephant seals due to the ease of blubber sampling and its key role in metabolic regulation in marine mammals. We report the first phocid blubber transcriptome produced by RNAseq, containing over 140,000 annotated transcripts, including metabolic and adipocytokine genes of interest.

Lipopolysaccharide is one of the most potent trigger substances for monocytes and macrophages causing secretion of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1. The nature of the nuclear factors involved in regulation of these cytokine genes is still unknown. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B; heterodimer of p50 and p65) proteins have been suggested to play an important role in gene transcription of inflammatory mediators when monocytes are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as salicylates have been used to treat symptoms of inflammation, and a new mechanism of drug action was suggested recently. Salicylates have been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced gene transcription via inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of NF-kappa B inhibitor \\" I kappa B \\", blocking the translocation of NF-kappa B into the nuclear compartment. However, the nature of the subunit involved in this mechanism has not been defined. To examine the mechanisms by which salicylates affect cytokine gene transcription, the amount of active and inactive NF-kappa B and NF-kappa B mRNA, in Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells was assessed. High doses of sodium salicylate suppressed NF-kappa B p65 mRNA accumulation, resulting in suppression of total NF-kappa B, p50 on tissue oligonucleotide had no effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappa B activation. The data demonstrate that the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B is inhibited by salicylate treatment and highlight the role of salicylate in the control of gene expression of inflammatory mediators.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"lipopolysaccharide - stimulated human monocytic cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"monocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"cytokine genes\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"p50\\", \\"Nuclear factor kappa B\\", \\"interleukin - 1\\", \\"inflammatory mediators\\", \\"NF - kappa B inhibitor\\", \\"cytokine\\", \\"p65\\", \\"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF - kappa B ; heterodimer of p50 and p65) proteins\\", \\"nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65\\", \\"NF - kappa B\\", \\"nuclear factor kappa B\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor\\", \\"I kappa B\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 mRNA\\", \\"p65 mRNA\\", \\"NF - kappa B mRNA\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Six patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) took single doses of digoxin, verapamil and diltiazem, alone and in combination. Three hours after dosing, resting and post-exercise heart rate, exercise tolerance and resting and post-exercise cardiac output were measured. Post-exercise heart rates ranged from 167 bpm (after placebo) to 122 bpm (after digoxin plus diltiazem) (P less than 0.05). However, the lower ventricular rates seen after treatment with the calcium antagonists were not associated with improved exercise tolerance, which did not differ significantly between the various treatments. Reduction of the ventricular rate was associated with a small increase in stroke volume but the benefits of this were offset by a rate related reduction in cardiac output. Further reduction of the rapid ventricular rates seen in digitalized patients with AF does not appear to be of benefit in terms of improving either exercise tolerance or cardiac output.sentence: Relationships between heart rate , exercise tolerance and cardiac output in atrial fibrillation : the effects of treatment with digoxin , verapamil and diltiazem .","answer":"[[\\"digoxin\\", \\"verapamil\\", \\"diltiazem\\", \\"COMB\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn, classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board, the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited. Movement restriction greatly reduced the number of infections from 5 February onwards. Text: An outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has occurred on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess [1] . The primary case remains unknown, but the index case, defined as the first identified case, is a passenger who started coughing from 19 January 2020 on board, disembarking the ship in Hong Kong on 25 January. As the case was diagnosed on 1 February, the ship was requested to remain in the ocean near Yokohama from 3 February onwards. Subsequently, the movement of all passengers was restricted on board from 5 February, for a matter of 14 days of quarantine. Out of a total of 3711 persons (consisting of 2666 passengers and 1045 crew members), 199 symptomatic cases have been diagnosed on board as of 24 February, and additional asymptomatic infections and symptomatic cases after disembarkation have also been reported. One of the critical issues in infectious disease epidemiology is that the time of infection event is seldom directly observable. For this reason, the time of infection needs to be statistically estimated, employing a backcalculation method [2] . Using a sophisticated statistical model with doubly intervalcensored likelihood and right truncation with an exponential growth of cases, the mean incubation period has been estimated to be about 5.0 days  [3] . To understand the time-dependent risk of infection throughout the course of outbreak and estimate the effectiveness of the quarantine measure from 5 to 19 February 2020, I aimed to estimate the incidence of infection with COVID-19 and also predict the likely number of infections prevented by the quarantine measure. I analyzed the epidemic curve, ct, on day t, illustrated by the number of confirmed cases by the date of illness onset. The confirmatory diagnosis was made, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The date of illness onset was defined as the first date of fever. In addition to the date of illness onset, cases were classified by contact history inside the cabin and also by the type of membership, i.e., crew or passenger. Close contact was defined as having at least one cabinmate who was confirmed by RT-PCR. We estimate the number of cases by time of infection, it. Using the probability mass function of the incubation period of length s, fs, the incidence of infection is known to satisfywhere E(.) represents the expected value. As for fs, it is known that the mean and standard deviation are 5.0 and 3.0 days, respectively, best fitted by lognormal distribution [3] . Employing a step function, the incidence of infection was statistically estimated via a maximum likelihood method. The estimation was implemented independently by the history of contact and type of membership. Regarding the real-time forecasting, we employed the so-called Richards model, an analogue to the generalized logistic model [4, 5] :where is the cumulative incidence on day t, Z is the cumulative incidence at the end of the outbreak, s is the parameter that governs the flexibility of the logistic curve, a is the early growth rate of cases and ti is the inflection point of the cumulative incidence curve. Assuming that the cumulative incidence is Gaussian distributed, four unknown parameters were estimated. The Richards model was fitted to two different datasets, i.e., (i) the dataset of the entire course of the epidemic and (ii) the dataset by 4 February 2020. The latter dataset corresponds to the time period without any impact of movement restriction that was in place from 5 February onwards. Figure 1 shows the epidemic curve by contact history and type of membership. The highest incidence of illness onset was observed on 7 February. The epidemic curve in a latter half period was dominated by crew members whose movement was not strictly controlled due to the need to continue service on the ship. The second dominating group was passengers with close contact history. The last illness onset date on board of a passenger without close contact was on 14 February. Estimating the incidence of infection, the peak incidence was identified for the period from 2 to 4 February among passengers both with and without close contact (Figure 2 ). The incidence of infection abruptly dropped after 5 February, the date of movement restriction. Among passengers without close contact, the incidence was estimated to be zero, except for 8-10 February 2020, during which 0.98 persons (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0, 7.74) per day were estimated to have been infected. The epidemic peak among crew members was seen for the period from 8 to 10 February 2020. Figure 3 compares the cumulative incidence with and without movement restriction policy from 5 February. In the presence of intervention, the cumulative incidence among passengers with and without close contact and crew members were 102, 47 and 48 cases, respectively, as of 24 February 2020. These were well realized by the Richards model. Without intervention from 5 February onwards, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively. A large outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on a cruise ship. Estimating the incidence, the peak time of infection was shown to have been from 2 to 4 February, and the incidence abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February, on which the movement restriction policy was imposed, and at most there was, on average, one case of infection per day from 8 to 10 February. Other than continued exposure among crew members, the estimated incidence in this study indicates that the movement restriction policy from 5 February 2020 was highly successful in greatly reducing the number of secondary transmissions on board. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board (and before the disembarkation of a large number of passengers), the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited Among disembarked passengers, symptomatic cases have started to be reported on the ground in and outside of Japan. In particular, cases arising from passengers without close contact indicate a possible pathway of infection via mechanisms that were not covered by the abovementioned analysis that relied on symptomatic cases. Although the transmission via direct human-to-human contact was prevented by movement restrictions, the role of other modes of transmission, e.g., environmental and asymptomatic transmissions, should be further explored. The author declares no conflict of interest.Question: What is the estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship?","answer":"about 5.0 days"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Direct conjugate additions of amines with a,b-unsaturated electrophiles have been shown to proceed at high temperatures and pressures; 3 however the reversibility of the initial attack by the amine eventually leads to racemic products (Fig. 1A). 4 Stoichiometric homochiral lithium amides can be successfully deployed under kinetic control, achieving high yield and selectivity. However, these sensitive, strongly basic reagents are further limited by the need to remove the chiral a-methylbenzyl moiety to carry the products forward to useful targets. 5 To circumvent these issues, current catalytic methods have relied upon the use of non-basic nitrogen nucleophiles as amine surrogates to avoid catalyst poisoning (Fig. 1B), 6 which is common when basic amines are used as reagents in the presence of chiral Lewis or BrÃ¸nsted acidic catalysts. 7 Therefore, numerous examples of non-basic nitrogen nucleophiles including azides, 8 hydroxylamines, 9 Ofunctionalized carbamates, 10 1,2,4-triazoles, 11 indoles, 12 and anilines 13 have been strategically deployed to avoid Lewis acid complexation, 14 BrÃ¸nsted acid neutralization, or unselective iminium activation. 10a However, in all of these cases, a protected nitrogen atom is installed which requires multiple steps to elaborate further. Thus, a more convergent approach would be enabled by the direct asymmetric amination of basic primary and secondary amines without the use of protecting groups. Apparently, there are only three examples of catalytic asymmetric amino-conjugate additions that have successfully employed alkyl amines. 15 In 2003, Togni brieîy explored asymmetric amino-conjugate additions to activated oleîns as the initial step in a catalytic asymmetric hydroamination reaction catalysed by a novel chiral Ni(II) phosphine complex. 15b Morpholine and piperidine produced modestly enantioenriched products when reacted with methacrylonitrile (69% and 20% ee, respectively), which represents the îrst signiîcant example of an effective, enantioselective intermolecular hydroamination reaction employing alkyl amines. Despite this promising proof-of-concept study, general asymmetric aminoconjugate additions with unfunctionalized/masked amines remain unrealized, which underscores the fundamental challenge associated with the use of highly basic and sterically unencumbered reagents in conjunction with Lewis acidic metal catalysts. In 2015, Huang and co-workers reported an efficient, highly enantioselective conjugate addition of primary alkyl amines to activated b-aryl b-triîuoromethyl nitrooleîns. 15c Unlike most catalytic examples, their strategy uses chiral BrÃ¸nsted base catalysis. 16 However, a major limitation of this method is the lack of secondary amines as nucleophiles. Additionally, strongly basic and cryogenic conditions are required, which potentially limit the generality of this transformation. 15c Therefore, we sought mild catalytic conditions capable of providing enantioenriched amino-conjugate addition products from a general set of readily available alkyl amines with maleimides, which were chosen as an ideal substrate for catalyst identiîcation and optimization due to their ready availability and excellent conjugate acceptor properties (Fig. 1C). Additionally, enantioenriched aminosuccinimide products serve as an easily functionalized scaffold to generate aminolactams and aminopyrrolidines. 17 Aminosuccinimides and their derivatives are also a common motif in bioactive small molecules, pharmaceuticals, and natural products (Fig. 1D). 18 Access to these products from achiral starting materials can facilitate the rapid generation of diverse small molecule libraries aimed at probing new chemical spaces.</p><p>We began our studies with a reaction between equimolar quantities of N-benzylmaleimide and p-tolylamine. Our primary focus was to enhance the enantioselectivity of the title reaction (Table 1). An initial exhaustive screen of various asymmetric catalyst families including hydrogen bond donors (HBD), metal-TADDOL complexes, metal BINOL-complexes, and chiral phosphoric acids (CPA), identiîed that CPA A-H possessing 1napthyl substitution at the 3,3 0 -positions has the capability to produce the title compound in modest yield and selectivity (entry 1). Subsequently, we investigated the role of water in the reaction and observed that the addition of 4 Ã MS had a moderate but reproducible impact on selectivity (entry 2). We then investigated a wide range of desiccants 9b and found that calcium oxide had a greater than anticipated positive effect on the selectivity of the reaction (entry 3). 19 Additionally, we observed a moderate increase in e.r. over time to 80 : 20 e.r. (entry 4). We therefore hypothesized that the reaction of calcium oxide with A-H led to the formation of a more enantioselective calcium phosphate catalyst. Our hypothesis was enlightened by combining the prior elegant work of Ishihara, Antilla, and Rueping who demonstrated the role of catalytic chiral alkali metal and alkaline earth metal-phosphate salts in various reactions. 20 Thus, we investigated two pre-formed calcium phosphate complexes (entries 5 & 6) and observed that the calcium CPA complex possessing 9-phenanthracenyl substitution on the phosphate 3,3 0 -positions, Ca[B] 2 (Table 1), facilitated the title reaction in 76% yield and 95 : 5 e.r. (entry 6). Strikingly, removal of the 4 Ã MS diminished both yield and selectivity (entry 7). Aîer investigating selectivity as a function of temperature (entries 8 & 9), we looked at other CPA salts (entries 10-12) and determined that Ca[B] 2 was indeed optimal. We then compared calcium and magnesium phosphate complexes, and demonstrated again that Ca[B] 2 was optimal (entry 13). Furthermore, increasing its concentration to 0.05 M and lowering the catalyst loading to 5 mol% increased the yield to 95% with 94 : 6 e.r. (entries 14 & 15).</p><p>With the optimized conditions in hand, we next investigated the scope of the reaction with a range of aliphatic amines and maleimides (Table 2). Para-substituted primary benzylamines with a range of electron donating and withdrawing groups afforded the conjugate addition products (6-11) in 93 : 7-94 : 6 e.r. and 77-91% yield. Meta-and ortho-substituted benzyl amines afforded 12 and 13 in similar yields and selectivities. The products derived from less sterically bulky amines and linear amines were obtained with lower enantioselectivity (14-17) and moderate yields. In contrast, bulkier amines gave products 18 and 19 in high yield and selectivity. Notably,  secondary cyclic amines provided conjugated products 20-24 in 93 : 7-97 : 3 e.r. These substrates would be difficult to access via other methodologies or from an enantiopure amino acid derived starting material. 21 The enantioselectivity for the arylpiperidine-derived 24 uniquely improved at Ã40 C which was not general for the other substrates.</p><p>Acyclic secondary amines showed the lowest selectivity among the nucleophiles (25). Also, substitutions on the benzyl maleimide were tolerated (26-28). The cross-reaction between piperidine and a substituted benzyl maleimide generated product 29 in good yield and selectivity. N-Phenyl maleimide was a poor substrate with regard to selectivity (74 : 26 e.r.); however, the desired 1,4-addition product 30 was synthesized in 93% yield with no observed 1,2-addition product (a common side-reaction with N-aryl maleimides). 22 Maleimide substrates with smaller appendages were observed to react with lower selectivities (31). The unsubstituted maleimide product 32 was not observed, presumably due to a lack of solubility.</p><p>The title reaction was successfully scaled up by 1000-fold from the initial screening conditions (Scheme 1). Taking into account the observed dependence of enantioselectivity on concentration, the amine nucleophile was added slowly to the other reaction components via a cannula. These conditions afforded 7.15 g of the product (93% yield) in 94 : 6 e.r. The product was successfully recrystallized to >99 : 1 e.r. Additionally, >95% of the catalyst Ca[B] 2 was recovered via column puriîcation. The recovered Ca [B] 2 was subsequently able to reproduce the title reaction without loss of yield or selectivity. The ability to directly recover and reuse Ca[B] 2 from each reaction at >95% efficiency gives this methodology more utility, especially given the high molecular weight of the catalyst.</p><p>In an effort to rationalize the observed enantioselectivity, we obtained X-ray crystal structure and 31 P NMR spectroscopy data for the pre-formed calcium phosphate complex used in our optimization and scope studies (Fig. 2B). 23 Surprisingly, the observed structure shows a 4 : 2 ratio of B to Ca 2+ , not a Ca[B] 2 complex. Additionally, both calcium atoms are coordinatively saturated, with each cation bound to îve molecules of water, which creates a hydrogen-bonding network. Although it is possible that the observed ORTEP structure is the actual catalytic species, we hypothesize that it is more likely a precatalyst is activated in the presence of molecular sieves. This observation is supported by the signiîcant change in the 31 P NMR spectrum in the presence of 4 Ã MS (Fig. 2B). The yield and selectivity of the reaction also diminished in the absence of the 4 Ã MS (Table 1, entry 7), which supports that dehydration of the Ca 2 [B] 4 (H 2 O) 10 complex is necessary. Interestingly, when all the reaction components are present, the 31 P NMR data is reminiscent of the precatalyst (Fig. 2B). This data indicates that  the presence of the amine re-establishes the hydrogen-bonding network that is lost upon dehydration of the Ca 2 [B] 4 (H 2 O) 10 complex. Understanding this Lewis base/Lewis acid interaction between the active catalyst and a coordinated maleimide substrate will require further investigation.</p><p>Based on the obtained spectroscopic data, we hypothesize that the Ca 2 [B] 4 (H 2 O) 10 complex is activated via dehydration in the presence of 4 Ã MS, inducing it to reorganize to form Ca[B] 2 complex 33 (observed by HRMS, see ESI â¡). The extent of dehydration of Ca 2 [B] 4 (H 2 O) 10 required to form the active catalyst cannot be quantiîed by these experiments; however, it is reasonable to postulate that the loss of some coordinating water ligands from the Ca 2 [B] 4 (H 2 O) 10 complex should open up Lewis acidic sites on the calcium atom, which are then able to coordinate the amine nucleophile. Based on structure 33, we propose a model for enantioselectivity, where the si-face of maleimide 5 is blocked, which allows the re-face attack of the amine nucleophile (Fig. 2C).</p><p>Aîer exploring the scope of our conjugate addition with a variety of amines and maleimides, we also applied our methodology to the synthesis of 35, a potent novel 5-HT 2A agonist developed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals (Scheme 2). 18c Since the binding affinity of 35 was measured as a racemic mixture, we envisioned that our methodology could readily determine the more active enantiomer. Starting from recrystallized 6, lithium aluminium hydride reduction cleanly produced 34 in 95% yield and >99 : 1 e.r. (Scheme 2). Selective acylation of 34 with 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid produced 35 in 43% yield and >99 : 1 e.r. To further demonstrate the utility of this methodology, we selectively removed the benzylic group on the amine (36) as well as selectively deoxygenate the position adjacent to the amine (37).</p>Conclusions<p>In summary, we have discovered an efficient and scalable catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition of unmasked and unfunctionalized amines to maleimides. This process accommodates both primary and secondary amines, which underscores the unusual compatibility of these Lewis basic nucleophiles with the Lewis acidic Ca 2+ complex. Crystallographic studies indicate an initial Ca 2 [B] 4 species is formed through the reaction of a chiral phosphoric acid and calcium(II) methoxide. Further spectroscopic studies indicate that a dynamic process is involved, where molecular sieves are required for the observed reactivity and selectivity, which are thought to play a role in the activation of the catalyst. The addition of amine nucleophiles can re-establish a hydrogenbonding network similar to that found in the hydrated Ca 2 [B] 4 (H 2 O) 10 complex. Furthermore, although the calcium phosphate catalyst Ca[B] 2 has a relatively high molecular weight, it can be effectively recovered in >95% yield. Future investigations involve continued analysis of the calciumphosphate dynamics and applications of this reaction in the synthesis of bioactive compounds.</p>","answer":"The direct enantioselective chiral calcium(II)phosphate complex (Ca[CPA] 2 )-catalyzed conjugate addition of unprotected alkyl amines to maleimides was developed. This mild catalytic system represents a significant advance towards the general convergent asymmetric amination of a,b-unsaturated electrophiles, providing medicinally relevant chiral aminosuccinimide products in high yields and enantioselectivities. Furthermore, the catalyst can be reused directly from a previously chromatographed reaction and still maintain both high yield and selectivity."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Among all the investigated L. plantarum strains, L. plantarum C88 showed the strongest AFB1 binding capacity in vitro, and was orally administered to mice with liver oxidative damage induced by AFB1. In the therapy groups, the mice that received L. plantarum C88, especially heat-killed L. plantarum C88, after a single dose of AFB1 exposure, showed an increase in unabsorbed AFB1 in the feces. Moreover, the effects of L. plantarum C88 on the enzymes and non - enzymes antioxidant abilities in serum and liver, histological alterations of liver were assayed. The results indicated that compared to the control group, L. plantarum C88 alone administration induced significant increase of antioxidant capacity, but did not induce any significant changes in the histological picture. Compared to the mice that received AFB1 only, L. plantarum C88 treatment could weaken oxidative stress by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and elevating the expression of Glutathione S-transferase (GST) A3 through Nuclear factor erythroid (derived factor 2) related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Furthermore, cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) 1A2 and CYP 3A4 expression was inhibited by L. plantarum C88, and urinary aflatoxin B1-N7-guanine (AFB-N7-guanine), a AFB1 metabolite formed by CYP 1A2 and CYP 3A4, was significantly reduced by the presence of viable L. plantarum C88. Meanwhile, the significant improvements were showed in histological pictures of the liver tissues in mice orally administered with viable L. plantarum C88. Collectively, L. plantarum C88 may alleviate AFB1 toxicity by increasing fecal AFB1 excretion, reversing deficits in antioxidant defense systems and regulating the metabolism of AFB1.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"liver tissues\\", \\"liver\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"Probiotic Strain\\", \\"Lactobacillus plantarum C88\\", \\"Lactobacillus plantarum\\", \\"L. plantarum\\", \\"L. plantarum C88\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"liver oxidative damage\\", \\"expression\\", \\"defense systems\\", \\"oxidative stress\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"feces\\", \\"serum\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"enzymes\\", \\"Aflatoxin B1\\", \\"Nuclear factor erythroid (derived factor 2) related factor 2\\", \\"AFB1\\", \\"CYP 1A2\\", \\"aflatoxin B1\\", \\"CYP 3A4\\", \\"Nrf2\\", \\"cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) 1A2\\", \\"AFB-N7-guanine\\", \\"aflatoxin B1-N7-guanine\\", \\"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) A3\\", \\"antioxidant\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"mice\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"non\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"Fermented Food\\", \\"fermented foods\\", \\"Tofu\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"detoxification\\", \\"administration\\", \\"orally administered\\", \\"treatment\\", \\"Reduction\\", \\"therapy groups\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"Toxicity\\", \\"toxicity\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"Chinese\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic normative system to enable the reasoning of the changes of norms under different circumstances, which cannot be done in the existing static normative systems. We study two important problems (norm synthesis and norm recognition) related to the autonomy of the entire system and the agents, and characterise the computational complexities of solving these problems.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The overarching vision of social machines is to facilitate social processes by having computers provide administrative support. We conceive of a social machine as a sociotechnical system (STS): a software-supported system in which autonomous principals such as humans and organizations interact to exchange information and services. Existing approaches for social machines emphasize the technical aspects and inadequately support the meanings of social processes, leaving them informally realized in human interactions. We posit that a fundamental rethinking is needed to incorporate accountability, essential for addressing the openness of the Web and the autonomy of its principals. We introduce Interaction-Oriented Software Engineering (IOSE) as a paradigm expressly suited to capturing the social basis of STSs. Motivated by promoting openness and autonomy, IOSE focuses not on implementation but on social protocols, specifying how social relationships, characterizing the accountability of the concerned parties, progress as they interact. Motivated by providing computational support, IOSE adopts the accountability representation to capture the meaning of a social machine's states and transitions. We demonstrate IOSE via examples drawn from healthcare. We reinterpret the classical software engineering (SE) principles for the STS setting and show how IOSE is better suited than traditional software engineering for supporting social processes. The contribution of this paper is a new paradigm for STSs, evaluated via conceptual analysis.","answer":"Application of social norms Social norms are to regulate the behaviour of the stakeholders in a system, including sociotechnical system [1] which has both humans and computers.

The disease has caused a pandemic and is threatening global health. Similar to SARS-CoV, this new virus can potentially infect lower respiratory tract cells and can go on to cause severe acute respiratory tract syndrome, followed by pneumonia and even death in many nations. The molecular mechanism of the disease has not yet been evaluated until now. We analyzed the GSE1739 microarray dataset including 10 SARS-positive PBMC and four normal PBMC. Co-expression network analysis by WGCNA suggested that highly preserved 833 turquoise module with genes were significantly related to SARS-CoV infection. ELANE, ORM2, RETN, BPI, ARG1, DEFA4, CXCL1, and CAMP were the most important genes involved in this disease according to GEO2R analysis as well. The GO analysis demonstrated that neutrophil activation and neutrophil degranulation are the most activated biological processes in the SARS infection as well as the neutrophilia, basophilia, and lymphopenia predicted by deconvolution analysis of samples. Thus, using Serpins and Arginase inhibitors during SARS-CoV infection may be beneficial for increasing the survival of SARS-positive patients. Regarding the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV, the use of such inhibitors might be beneficial for COVID-19 patients.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\", \\"Mechanism\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The structural requirements of this recognition were investigated. Factor Xa or catalytically inactive 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) Glu-Gly-Arg-(DEGR)-chloromethylketone-factor Xa bound indistinguishably to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants, and inhibited equally well the binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells. Similarly, factor Xa active site inhibitors TAP or NAP5 did not reduce ligand binding to EPR-1. A factor X peptide duplicating the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Phe84-Thr85-Arg86-Lys87-Leu88- (Gly) inhibited factor V/Va-independent prothrombin activation by HUVEC and blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 20-40 microM). In contrast, none of the other factor X peptides tested or a control peptide with the inter-EGF sequence in scrambled order was effective. A recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the factor X sequence Leu83-Leu88 within a factor IX backbone inhibited binding of 125I-factor Xa to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant factor IX or plasma IXa had no effect. An antibody generated against the factor X peptide 83-88, and designated JC15, inhibited 125I-factor Xa binding to HUVEC. The JC15 antibody bound to factor Xa and the recombinant IX/X83-88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with factors X or IXa was observed. Furthermore, binding of 125I-factor Xa to immobilized JC15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa, but not by comparable concentrations of factors X or IXa. These findings identify the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa as a novel recognition site for EPR-1, and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope. This interacting motif may help elucidate the contribution of factor Xa to cellular assembly of coagulation and vascular injury.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) Glu-Gly-Arg-(DEGR)-chloromethylketone\\", \\"125I\\", \\"Gly\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"effector cell protease receptor-1\\", \\"IXa\\", \\"Leu83-Leu88\\", \\"Factor Xa\\", \\"factor X\\", \\"factors X or IXa\\", \\"Leu83-Phe84-Thr85-Arg86-Lys87-Leu88- (Gly)\\", \\"factor V/Va\\", \\"EPR-1\\", \\"prothrombin\\", \\"inter-EGF sequence\\", \\"factor IX\\", \\"factor Xa\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

It will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). However, the kit developed by the BGI have passed emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of China [40] . Of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-nCoV, SARS CoV or MERS-CoV vaccines screened, only four were eventually included in the review. Most studies on SARS and MERS vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models ( Figure 1 ). The four studies included in this review were Phase I clinical trials on SARS or MERS vaccines (Table 4 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] . There were no studies of any population type (cell, animal, human) on the 2019-nCoV at the point of screening. The published clinical trials were mostly done in United States except for one on the SARS vaccine done in China [44] . All vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS were reported to be safe, well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants. In addition, we highlight six ongoing Phase I clinical trials identified in the ClinicalTrials.gov register ( [48, 49] ); Table  S4 ) [50] [51] [52] . These trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective MERS-CoV vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet. The trials are projected to complete in December 2020 (two studies in Russia [50, 51] ) and December 2021 (in Germany [52] ). Existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-nCoV trials at the time of writing. Among 23 trials found from the systematic review (Table 5) , there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) for 2019-nCoV therapeutics [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . Of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol, mesenchymal stem cells, traditional Chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment. The remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals, interferon atomization, darunavir and cobicistat, arbidol, and remdesivir usage for 2019-nCoV patients (Table 5) . Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 86% and 94% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively, and was maintained in 79% participants up to study end at week 60. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 50% participants at one or more time points during the study, but only 3% maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. T-cell responses were detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively.  There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60. [47] Molecules developed by the university scientists inhibit two coronavirus enzymes and prevent its replication. The discovered drug targets are said to be more than 95% similar to enzyme targets found on the SARS virus. Researchers note that identified drugs may not be available to address the ongoing outbreak but they hope to make it accessible for future outbreaks. [85] Besides the six completed randomized controlled trials (RCT) selected from the systematic review (Table 6) , there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at SARS therapeutics [92] . The studies found from ClinicalTrials.gov have not been updated since 2013. While many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin only, there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage. Three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the SARS epidemic-3 in China, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Hong Kong [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . The studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants, combination of western and Chinese treatment vs. Chinese treatment in 123 participants, integrative Chinese and Western treatment in 49 patients, usage of a specific Chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants. Another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir usage in 152 participants [98] . One randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and Chinese treatment during the SARS epidemic was excluded as it was a Chinese article [94] . There is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at MERS therapeutics [99] . It investigates the usage of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon Beta 1B. Likewise, many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir/ribavirin, interferon, and convalescent plasma usage. To date, only one trial has been completed. One phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin (SAB-301) was found in available literature [46] . The trial conducted in the United States in 2017 demonstrated SAB-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses. Another trial on MERS therapeutics was found on ClinicalTrials.gov-a phase 2/3 trial in the United States evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity on coadministered MERS-CoV antibodies REGN3048 & REGN3051 [100]. Rapid diagnostics plays an important role in disease and outbreak management. The fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures. Local transmission and clusters can be prevented or delayed by isolation of laboratory-confirmed cases and their close contacts quarantined and monitored at home. Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] . Laboratory diagnosis can be performed by: (a) detecting the genetic material of the virus, (b) detecting the antibodies that neutralize the viral particles of interest, (c) detecting the viral epitopes of interest with antibodies (serological testing), or (d) culture and isolation of viable virus particles. The key limitations of genetic material detection are the lack of knowledge of the presence of viable virus, the potential cross-reactivity with non-specific genetic regions and the short timeframe for accurate detection during the acute infection phase. The key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses. The limitation of virus culture and isolation is the long duration and the highly specialized skills required of the technicians to process the samples. All patients recovered. Significantly shorted time from the disease onset to the symptom improvement in treatment (5.10 Â± 2.83 days) compared to control group (7.62 Â± 2.27 days) (p < 0.05) No significant difference in blood routine improvement, pulmonary chest shadow in chest film improvement and corticosteroid usgae between the 2 groups. However, particularly in the respect of improving clinical symptoms, elevating quality of life, promoting immune function recovery, promoting absorption of pulmonary inflammation, reducing the dosage of cortisteroid and shortening the therapeutic course, treatment with integrative chinese and western medicine treatment had obvious superiority compared with using control treatment alone. Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants. [46] Where the biological samples are taken from also play a role in the sensitivity of these tests. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract such as sputum and tracheal aspirates have higher and more prolonged levels of viral RNA because of the tropism of the virus. MERS-CoV viral loads are also higher for severe cases and have longer viral shedding compared to mild cases. Although upper respiratory tract specimens such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs can be used, they have potentially lower viral loads and may have higher risk of false-negatives among the mild MERS and SARS cases [102, 103] , and likely among the 2019-nCoV cases. The existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include (a) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), (b) real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), (c) reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and (d) real-time RT-LAMP [104] . Nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are usually preferred as in the case of MERS-CoV diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection [102] . Chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-nCoV in the GenBank and in GISAID portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus [11] . Several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, as highlighted in WHO's interim guidance on nCoV laboratory testing of suspected cases. These include protocols from other countries such as Thailand, Japan and China [105] . The first validated diagnostic test was designed in Germany. Corman et al. had initially designed a candidate diagnostic RT-PCR assay based on the SARS or SARS-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was SARS-like. Upon the release of the sequence, assays were selected based on the match against 2019-nCoV upon inspection of the sequence alignment. Two assays were used for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and E gene where E gene assay acts as the first-line screening tool and RdRp gene assay as the confirmatory testing. All assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses [11] . The Hong Kong University used two monoplex assays which were reactive with coronaviruses under the subgenus Sarbecovirus (consisting of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-like coronavirus). Viral RNA extracted from SARS-CoV can be used as the positive control for the suggested protocol assuming that SARS has been eradicated. It is proposed that the N gene RT-PCR can be used as a screening assay while the Orf1b assay acts as a confirmatory test. However, this protocol has only been evaluated with a panel of controls with the only positive control SARS-CoV RNA. Synthetic oligonucleotide positive control or 2019-nCoV have yet to be tested [106] . The US CDC shared the protocol on the real time RT-PCR assay for the detection of the 2019-nCoV with the primers and probes designed for the universal detection of SARS-like coronavirus and the specific detection of 2019-nCoV. However, the protocol has not been validated on other platforms or chemistries apart from the protocol described. There are some limitations for the assay. Analysts engaged have to be trained and familiar with the testing procedure and result interpretation. False negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection, transportation or handling. Also, RNA viruses may show substantial genetic variability. This could result in mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence which can diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results [107] . Point-of-care test kit can potentially minimize these limitations, which should be highly prioritized for research and development in the next few months. Serological testing such as ELISA, IIFT and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection, including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate. Compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods, serological testing detects antibodies and antigens. There would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset [108] . Furthermore, studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load. Hence, serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are not available or accessible [102] . Vaccines can prevent and protect against infection and disease occurrence when exposed to the specific pathogen of interest, especially in vulnerable populations who are more prone to severe outcomes. In the context of the current 2019-nCoV outbreak, vaccines will help control and reduce disease transmission by creating herd immunity in addition to protecting healthy individuals from infection. This decreases the effective R0 value of the disease. Nonetheless, there are social, clinical and economic hurdles for vaccine and vaccination programmes, including (a) the willingness of the public to undergo vaccination with a novel vaccine, (b) the side effects and severe adverse reactions of vaccination, (c) the potential difference and/or low efficacy of the vaccine in populations different from the clinical trials' populations and (d) the accessibility of the vaccines to a given population (including the cost and availability of the vaccine). Vaccines against the 2019-nCoV are currently in development and none are in testing (at the time of writing). On 23 January 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced that they will fund vaccine development programmes with Inovio, The University of Queensland and Moderna, Inc respectively, with the aim to test the experimental vaccines clinically in 16 weeks (By June 2020). The vaccine candidates will be developed by the DNA, recombinant and mRNA vaccine platforms from these organizations [109] . Based on the most recent MERS-CoV outbreak, there are already a number of vaccine candidates being developed but most are still in the preclinical testing stage.Question: What were  the T-cell responses?","answer":"detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

This clinical trial included 86 patients with premature rupture of the membranes between weeks 27 and 35 of gestation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive amnioinfusion via a two-way catheter or to the control group. Clinical management was otherwise the same in both groups.                Amnioinfusion decreased the frequency of variable decelerations in fetal heart rate (27.9% versus 53.5%, p<0.05) and the rate of obstetric interventions motivated by nonreassuring fetal status (13.6% versus 52.4%, p<0.05). At delivery, pH values were significantly higher in the treatment group than in the conventionally managed control group (median 7.29 versus 7.27).                Intrapartum transcervical amnioinfusion for preterm premature rupture of the membranes reduced the number of interventions needed because of nonreassuring fetal status, and improved neonatal gasometric values without increasing maternal or fetal morbidity.Title 2:Transabdominal amnioinfusion in preterm premature rupture of membranes: a randomised controlled trial.Abstract 2:To evaluate the role of transabdominal amnioinfusion in improving the perinatal outcomes of pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM).                A randomised controlled trial.                A teaching hospital in Italy, obstetric unit. Population Women with singleton pregnancies complicated by pPROM, between 24 + 0 and 32 + 6 weeks of gestation.                Patients were randomised 24 hours after admission to our referral hospital, to expectant management with transabdominal amnioinfusion or expectant management only.                The effects of transabdominal amnioinfusion on pPROM-delivery interval and on perinatal outcomes.                Of the 65 women with pPROM 34 met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen women were assigned to amnioinfusion (the amnioinfusion group) and the other 17 to expectant management. Compared with the control group (median: 8 days; range: 3-14), the pPROM-delivery period was significantly longer in women who underwent amnioinfusion (median: 21 days; range: 15-29) (P < 0.05). Women with amnioinfusion were less likely to deliver within seven days since pPROM (RR: 0.18; range: 0.04-0.69 95% CI) or within two weeks (RR: 0.46; range: 0.21-1.02 95% CI). In the amnioinfusion group the neonatal survival was significantly higher at each gestational age (P < 0.01, Yates's correction for Log Rank Test) with a reduction in pulmonary hypoplasia.                We demonstrated that compared with standard expectant management the treatment with transabdominal amnioinfusion after pPROM resulted in significant prolongation of pregnancy and better neonatal outcomes.Title 3:Prophylactic intrapartum amnioinfusion in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes.Abstract 3:Patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes are at increased risk to develop intrapartum variable decelerations and fetal distress. Short-term saline solution amnioinfusion may be of benefit in the treatment of variable or prolonged decelerations once they appear. In an effort to assess the benefit of prophylactic amnioinfusion, patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes were studied during a 1-year period in a prospective randomized manner. Patients receiving prophylactic amnioinfusion had significantly decreased incidence and severity of variable decelerations in the first stage of labor (p less than 0.005). In the second stage of labor, the incidence of severe (p less than 0.005) and total (p less than 0.001) decelerations was also decreased in the treatment group. The umbilical arterial pH at delivery was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) as was the umbilical venous pH (p less than 0.005) in the newborn infants of control patients compared with those of patients receiving amnioinfusion. This suggests that prophylactic intrapartum amnioinfusion is of significant benefit in reducing the incidence of variable decelerations and improving the metabolic state in newborn infants born to women with preterm premature rupture of the membranes.","answer":"These results are encouraging but are limited by the sparse data and unclear methodological robustness, therefore further evidence is required before amnioinfusion for PPROM can be recommended for routine clinical practice."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

We exploited this link to explore the role of the secreted growth factor termed liver fluke granulin( Ov-GRN-1) in pre-malignant lesions by undertaking programmed CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the Ov-GRN-1 gene from the liver fluke genome. Deep sequencing of amplicon libraries from genomic DNA of gene-edited parasites revealed Cas9-catalyzed mutations within Ov-GRN-1. Gene editing resulted in rapid depletion of Ov-GRN-1 transcripts and the encoded Ov-GRN-1 protein. Gene-edited parasites colonized the biliary tract of hamsters and developed into adult flukes, but the infection resulted in reduced pathology as evidenced by attenuated biliary hyperplasia and fibrosis. Not only does this report pioneer programmed gene-editing in parasitic flatworms, but also the striking, clinically-relevant pathophysiological phenotype confirms the role for Ov-GRN-1 in virulence morbidity during opisthorchiasis.Introduction:Liver fluke infection caused by species of Opisthorchis and Clonorchis remains a major public health problem in East Asia and Eastern Europe. O. viverrini is endemic in Thailand and Laos, whereÂ ~10 million people are infected with the parasite( Sripa et al., 2011). In liver fluke endemic regions, this infection causes hepatobiliary morbidity including cholangitis, choledocholithiasis( gall stones), and periductal fibrosis, and is the principal risk factor for bile duct cancer, cholangiocarcinoma( CCA)( Sripa et al., 2011; Sripa et al., 2007; Mairiang et al., 2012; Tyson and El-Serag, 2011; Shin et al., 2010a). Indeed, there is no stronger link between a human malignancy and a parasitic infection than that between CCA and infection with O. viverrini( Pagano et al., 2004). Northeastern Thailand suffers the highest incidence of CCA in the world, often exceeding 80 cases per 100, 000 population and for which up to 20, 000 people annually are admitted for surgery. The prognosis for liver fluke infection-induced cancer remains poor( Sripa et al., 2011; Khuntikeo et al., 2015; Khuntikeo et al., 2016; Luvira et al., 2016). How and why opisthorchiasis induces cholangiocarcinogenesis is likely multi-factorial, including mechanical irritation of the biliary tract during migration and feeding of the liver fluke, secretion by the parasite of inflammatory molecules, and nitrosamines in fermented foods that are a dietary staple in northeastern provinces of Thailand( Songserm et al., 2012). To survive in the hostile host environment, parasitic helminths produce an assortment of excretory/secretory( ES) products including proteins with diverse roles at the hostâparasite interface. This interaction has long been thought, but not fully understood, to modify cellular homeostasis and contribute to malignant transformation during chronic opisthorchiasis( Brindley and Loukas, 2017). Feeding activity of the liver fluke inflicts wounds in the biliary tree, resulting in lesions that undergo protracted cycles of repair and re-injury during chronic infection. The liver fluke secretes mediators that accelerate wound resolution in monolayers of cultured cholangiocytes, an outcome that is compromised following silencing of expression of the liver fluke secreted growth factor Ov-GRN-1 using RNA interference( Papatpremsiri et al., 2015; Smout et al., 2015). We hypothesize that proliferation of biliary epithelial cells induced by Ov-GRN-1 is a pivotal factor in maintenance and progression of a tumorigenic microenvironment in the liver during chronic opisthorchiasis. Progress with development of genetic tools for functional genomic studies with platyhelminth parasites has been limited to date( Hoffmann et al., 2014). The use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats( CRISPR) associated with Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, has revolutionized genome editing in biomedicine, agriculture and biology( Hsu et al., 2014; Sander and Joung, 2014). Progress with CRISPR/Cas9 in numerous eukaryotes including the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans, Strongyloides stercoralis and Strongyloides ratti has been described( Sander and Joung, 2014; Waaijers and Boxem, 2014; Lok et al., 2017; Gang et al., 2017), but this form of gene editing has not been reported for flatworm parasites. Here, we deployed a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach, aiming to knockout( mutate) the Ov-GRN-1 gene and assess the virulence of gene-edited flukes in vitro and in vivo in a hamster model of opisthorchiasis.Discussion:This report, and the accompanying article on schistosomes( Ittiprasert et al., 2019), pioneer programmed gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 of trematodes and indeed genome editing for species of the phylum Platyhelminthes. The findings revealed that somatic tissue gene editing disrupted the expression of liver fluke granulin, resulting in a clinically noteworthy phenotype of attenuated hepatobiliary tract morbidity. Scrutiny of the nucleotide sequence reads indicated that the chromosomal break took place as programmed and was repaired subsequently by NHEJ following Cas9-catalyzed mutation( Albadri et al., 2017). Accordingly, the findings confirmed that the bacterial Type II Cas9 system is active in O. viverrini, and we suggest that Cas9-mediated programmed gene editing and repair by homology directed repair and NHEJ will be active in other genes of the liver fluke, and in other trematodes and parasitic platyhelminths generally. Although the findings demonstrated programmed gene editing of the Ov-GRN-1 locus, the somatic mutation rate in the adult developmental stage was generallyÂ <5% of the genomes recovered from these multicellular parasites. This low mutation rate contrasted with both the marked reduction in Ov-GRN-1 message detected in vitro and the pathophysiological outcomes and reduced virulence of infection of hamsters with gene-edited flukes. The anomaly might be explained by the tissue expression of secreted Ov-GRN-1. Although it exhibits generalized expression throughout tissues of the adult liver fluke, predominant expression of Ov-GRN-1 has been immunolocalized to the tegumental surface, tegumental cytons and gut( Smout et al., 2009). Given that the flukes were transfected in vitro with the gene editing plasmid by square wave electroporation, gene knockout of the target Ov-GRN-1 locus in nuclei of cells in the tegument and gut may have occurred more frequently than in cells deeper within the fluke. If so, this may explain the marked reduction of expression and secretion of Ov-GRN-1 in tandem with a limited rate of mutation estimated in genomic DNA pooled from the gene-edited flukes. The activity in vitro of liver fluke granulin in cell proliferation, wound repair and angiogenesis has been established( Papatpremsiri et al., 2015; Smout et al., 2015; Smout et al., 2009), which has prompted the development of therapeutic peptides based on the Ov-GRN-1 scaffold for treatment of non-healing wounds( Bansal et al., 2017; Dastpeyman et al., 2018). The novel findings reported here corroborate earlier in vitro reports and extend the findings in a rodent model of human opisthorchiasis. Programmed gene editing confirmed that secreted parasite granulin induces hyperplasia of the biliary epithelium and fibrosis during chronic infection, and that liver fluke granulin directly contributes to morbidity of the hepatobiliary tract during both acute and chronic opisthorchiasis. The impact of Ov-GRN-1 might emulate the action of interleukin ILâ33, an epithelial mitogen for cholangiocytes, in the development of CCA. IL-33 primes type two innate lymphoid cells to induce proliferation of neighboring cholangiocytes by the release of IL-13( Brindley and Loukas, 2017; Li et al., 2014). The pathophysiological bioactivity of granulin warrants deeper investigation of its role in fibrosis, including the influence on hepatic stellate cells, during liver fluke infection and cholangiocarcinogenesis( Guido et al., 1997; Yin et al., 2013; Gouveia et al., 2017; Rockey et al., 2015). The rigor of future gene editing investigations might be enhanced with the inclusion of additional controls including parasites transfected with an otherwise functional vector that lacks target-specific gRNA and/or a gRNA with a scaffold but without seed sequence and/or containing a seed sequence without homology in the genome of O. viverrini. These additional controls would address non-target-specific effects of expression of Cas9 including on the genetic fitness of the genome-edited parasites( Cox et al., 2015; Kosicki et al., 2018; Ihry et al., 2018). Likewise, in addition to estimation of gene-editing performance and efficiency of somatic cell gene-editing in this multicellular helminth parasite using NGS-based( Shah et al., 2015; Canver et al., 2018; Albadri et al., 2017) and quantitative PCR-based approaches( Shah et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2014), droplet digital PCR( ddPCR)-based analysis should provide more sensitive detection and quantification of gene-editing manipulations. The ddPCR approach can provide simultaneous assessment of both homology directed repair and NHEJ, the repair pathways that resolve Cas9 catalyzed double-stranded breaks, and also investigate multiple, simultaneous editing conditions at the target locus( Miyaoka et al., 2018). With respect to Ov-GRN1 and its tissue site of expression, the anomaly between the marked knockdown of transcript levels and the minority of genomes mutated by the programmed gene editing among the total number of cells in this liver fluke, is amenable to deeper inquiry. Characterizing by immunolocalization the site of expression in the parasite from hamsters infected with gene-edited NEJ and/or the location of the gene editing plasmid after transfection of the liver fluke should be instructive. The causative agent for many cancers remains obscure including non-liver fluke infection-associated CCA. By contrast, the principal risk factor in liver fluke-endemic regions is well established: infection with O. viverrini and related parasites( IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, 2012; Fedorova et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2010b). CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing and the hamster model of human opisthorchiasis utilized here( Sripa et al., 2007), including genetic manipulation of the larval infective stage of the parasite, provide a facile, functional genomics system to interrogate this host-parasite relationship and pathophysiology( Hoffmann et al., 2014). In a related model, periductal fibrosis induced by the liver fluke infection combined with ingestion of dimethylnitrosamine or similar nitric oxide carcinogen results in epithelial hyperplasia, cholangiocyte proliferation and DNA damage, which culminates in CCA( Thamavit et al., 1987; Maksimova et al., 2017). Investigation utilizing genome edited liver flukes, mutated at loci encoding granulin or other parasite products can now proceed, including interaction of liver fluke granulin with cholangiocyte signaling pathways that are frequently mutated during liver fluke infection-induced CCA( Jusakul et al., 2017).","answer":"In the rural regions alongside the Mekong River in South East Asia , traditional cuisines often use uncooked or under cooked fish , many of which carry a worm known as Opisthorchis viverrini .

Out of the 10 million people affected by O . viverrini , thousands will also develop a type of liver cancer that is triggered by the presence of the worm . In particular , the parasite secretes a protein known as granulin that may encourage certain liver cells to multiply , potentially raising the risk for cancer . A gene editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9 allows scientist to precisely target and then deactivate the genetic information a cell needs to produce a given protein . While the tool has been used in other species before , it was unknown if it could be applied to O . viverrini . Here , Arunsan et al . harnessed CRISPR/Cas9 to deactivate the gene that codes for granulin and create parasites that can only produce very little of the protein . Hamsters infected with the gene-edited worms had fewer symptoms of liver fluke infection compared to those carrying normal O . viverrini . The animals with parasites that cannot produce granulin also had fewer changes to the liver that are associated with cancer . These findings confirm that granulin has a role in promoting liver fluke infection and liver cancer . Alongside this work , Ittiprasert et al . used CRISPR/Cas9 to inactivate a gene in a species of worm that causes a human disease called schistosomiasis . Together , these findings demonstrate for the first time that the gene editing method can be adapted for use in parasitic worms , which are a major public health problem in tropical climates .

Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction. We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (DNR)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR-containing regimen. Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies. The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography. Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit (40 pg/ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography. On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR, even at more than 700 mg/m(2). The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure. These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"DNR\\", \\"anthracycline\\", \\"daunorubicin\\", \\"Anthracyclines\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"heart failure\\", \\"acute leukemia\\", \\"cardiac dysfunction\\", \\"cardiotoxicity\\", \\"congestive heart failure\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Recent work has explored the idea of using subgraphs rather than subtrees around a node in GNNs, with positive experimental results (Zhang & Li, 2021; Wijesinghe & Wang, 2022), as well as being strictly more powerful than the 1-WL test (Zhang & Li, 2021). We follow the same setup as is done in Zhang & Li (2021), and adapt our GNN extractor to utilize the entire k-hop subgraph.The k-subgraph GNN extractor aggregates the updated node representations of all nodes within the k-hop neighborhood using a pooling function such as summation. Formally, if we denote by {mathcal{N}}_{k}(u) the k-hop neighborhood of node u including itself, the representation of a node u is:varphi(u,G)=sum_{vin{mathcal{N}}_{k}(u)}text{GNN}^{(k)}_{G}(v).(8)Question: How the author extract the subgraph of each node?","answer":"Author extract entire k-hop subgraphs for each node."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Follicular development and subsequent ovulation is dictated in part by the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and their affects on gene expression. A critical component of the intracellular activity of these two hormones is relayed by the second messenger cAMP (1). Numerous genes expressed in the ovary are regulated by cAMP as a consequence of gonadotropin signaling (2). The expression of cAMP-responsive genes is mediated by a large family of transcription factors of which CREM has been well characterized (3,4). CREM is unique among the other CRE binding transcription factors in that an internal promoter exists and codes for an isoform that acts to regulate its expression (5). This induced isoform, ICER (Inducible cAMP Early Repressor), serves as a dominant negative regulator of CREM expression. ICER is one of the smallest transcription factors to date, and represses the transcription of cAMP responsive genes by binding as a homodimer or heterodimer with other CRE-binding family members. The ICER protein possesses DNA-binding and dimerization domains while lacking the kinase-inducible and transactivation domains. ICER is characterized by a greater affinity to CRE-sequences than other transcription factors and thus makes ICER a powerful repressor. We and others have implicated ICER's role in regulating normal ovarian function (6) through its repression of inhibin alpha, aromatase Cyp19a1, and cyclin D2 (7â10). An unbiased range of targets for ICER has yet to be explored. Since ICER negatively regulates the transcription of cAMP responsive genes by binding to a CRE, we performed a global analysis mapping the binding distribution of ICER along the entire mouse genome using a modification of the ChIP assay. This assay allowed us to clone and directly identify candidate genes that ICER could potentially regulate by physically binding to CREs present within their sequences. This analysis will lead to the identification of pathways involved in ovulation, potentially regulated by ICER pathways or by the cAMP pathway in general. In these report we identified a number of novel binding sites and our results support the role of ICER as an integral player in the signaling machinery responsible for normal ovarian function.</p>Reagents<p>AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase with Buffer II and MgCl2 solution for general PCR reactions were purchased from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA.

Except Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone, UT. Insulin-Transferrin-Sodium Selenite media supplement was purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, MO.</p>Immortalized Mouse Granulosa Cell Line (GRMO2)<p>GRMO2 cells (11) (N.V. Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) were cultured in DMEM-F12, supplemented with Insulin-Transferrin-Sodium Selenite media supplement and 2% FBS in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. GRMO2 were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).</p>Antibodies<p>The anti-ICER polyclonal antibody was raised against bacterially purified ICER-IIÎ³ and previously characterized (5,12). This antibody has been shown to cross react with other CREM isoforms and ubiquitinated forms of ICER and does not cross react with CREB (5,12).</p>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and Cloning<p>The ChIP assay for the purpose of cloning immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were performed as described recently using modification described elsewhere (13,14). Briefly, GRMO2 cells were cultured to a confluency of 1Ã107 cells in 500cm2 dish and subjected to 8 hr 0.5mM 8-Br cAMP treatment. The cell pellets were resuspended in 2.0ml lysis buffer Incubate on ice for 10 minutes. Cells were lysed (10 strokes) using an ice-cold dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted using a microfuge at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 40Â°C. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 2ml nuclei lysis buffer plus the same protease inhibitors as the cell lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were processed a described in the ChIP assay. After elution from protein A-beads, samples were diluted using IP dilution buffer and subjected to another round of immunoprecipitation followed by washing and elution. After the second elution, the elutants were reverse cross-linked and the chromatin sample was purified using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), according to manufacture's protocol.</p><p>The Chromatin fragments were blunt-end repair and dephosphorylated using the TOPO Shotgun Subcloning Kit according to the manufacture's instructions. The DNA was subjected to ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR), chromatin amplicon were generated by 20 cycles of PCR using the reported conditions (14), each reaction was purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit. The PCR protocol was repeated (1x, 2x or 3x) until enough amplicon was made. The resulting PCR products were cloned into PCR 2.1 TOPO vector. DNA plasmids from the recombinant colonies were screened by EcoRI digestion. EcoRI sites flank the PCR product insertion sites for excision of inserts. Colonies with inserts greater then 200 bps were sequenced using T7 primers. Obtained sequences were blasted against the mouse genome. Sequences were also subjected to a transcription factor binding site search (15,16).</p>ChIP analysis of genes potentially regulated by CREM/ICER<p>ICER has shown to be strongly induced in ovaries by exogenous gonadotropins in immature rats and is transiently expressed in the ovaries immediately after the preovulatory LH surge in adult cycling rats. (7) Our lab and others have suggested a role for ICER in ovarian function based on the observation that many FSH-responsive genes are transcriptionally repressed after the LH surge. We sought to perform a global analysis to map the binding distribution of CREM/ICER along the entire mouse genome.</p><p>We opted to use a modification on the ChIP assay to clone DNA associated with CREM/ICER as a means to directly identify candidate genes CREM/ICER could potentially regulate in the ovaries. This approach has been successfully utilized previously to clone novel E2F promoter targets (13). Using a similar approach, we cloned and sequenced the immunoprecipitated CREM/ICER-associated DNAs from GRMO2 cells.</p>ChIP, target validation and amplification<p>The ChIP assay was performed with some modification as described (13). Chromatin was extracted from GRMO2 cells (1Ã107 cells) treated with 8-Br cAMP for 8 hr. After the chromatin was fixed and sheared, the samples were divided and either immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing ICER or subjected to pre-immune rabbit IgG as a negative control. To minimize the occurrence of non-specific DNA carry-over, the immunoprecipated chromatin was eluted from the protein A beads and subjected to another round of immunoprecipitation. The assay was validated by PCR using primers flanking the four CREs within the Crem internal promoter (5), as a positive control for ICER binding (Figure 1A). Since the PCR on the chromatin immunoprecipitated against ICER resulted, as expected, in the amplification of the targeted promoter regions, we next blunt-end repaired the sheared chromatin and added to its ends unidirectional double stranded oligonucleotide linkers. Chromatin amplicons were generated by 20 cycles of PCR and each reaction was purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit. The PCR protocol was repeated (1x, 2x and 3x) until enough amplicon was made, producing a smear between 400bp to 3kb (Figure 1B).</p>Sequencing and identity determination of immunoprecipitated DNA<p>The resulting amplified chromatin was subcloned into a pCR II - Topo vector. DNA extracted from the recombinant colonies were screened by EcoRI digestion and plasmids with inserts greater then 200bp were sequenced using T7 primers (Figure 2A). The different DNA sequences obtained were screened against the mouse genome using the NCBI-BLAST program for mouse sequences (Figure 2B). The DNA sequences were also subjected to a transcription factor binding site search using transcription factor search programs: TFSEARCH (15), TESS (16) and the CREB Target Gene Database (17).</p><p>We next examined the positions of the CREM/ICER binding fragments relative to annotated exons and introns. As summarized from the multiple categories shown in Figure 3, 6% of the immunoprecipitated regions (4 fragments) lay within 20 kb of the 5' end of the gene, and 31% (22 fragments) of the CREM/ICER binding regions lay within an intron. The 6% CREM/ICER binding fragments (4 fragments) intersected an annotated exon/intron region. Figure 2B reports a representative list of the 70 sequenced clones. Only 16% of the CREM/ICER binding regions lay within a promoter relatively adjacent to a TATA sequence. Our data is consistent with those previously published, demonstrating that only a modest percentage of CREB sites were found near or within genes along human chromosome 22 (18).</p><p>The use of ChIP has served as a valuable tool in identifying in vivo binding of trans-acting factors binding to cis-elements on chromatin. Recently, researchers have begun using ChIP as an unbiased approach to globally identify a target gene. For example, modification of the ChIP assay has led to the discovery of novel E2F binding sites by cloning of immunoprecipitated fragments (13). We employed this technique in our studies to globally identify CREM/ICER binding sites throughout the mouse genome. Our data supports previous findings demonstrating that CREB binds to multiple loci on human chromosome 22 (18). However in that report, the immunoprecipitated chromatin was hybridized to a genomic DNA microarray containing all of the nonrepetitive DNA sequences of human chromosome 22. Their data demonstrated that only a small fraction of CREB binding sites lay near the well-defined 5' ends of genes. Instead, the majority of sites were found within introns and unannotated regions. Similar results were obtained in our studies where we directly cloned and sequenced CREM/ICER targets. Their data also demonstrated that few CREB targets were found near full-length cyclic AMP response element sites, the majority of the CREB targets contained shorter versions or close matches to this sequence. Although the expression of CREB and CREM is believed to be ubiquitous, the dogma of constitutive occupancy of a CRE has been challenged. Several studies have demonstrated that CREB binding is highly tissue-specific and such binding were apparent at genes that were transcriptionally active but not on promoters of genes that were not expressed (19).</p><p>This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

COVID-19 CG provides significant time, labor, and cost-saving utility to projects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution, diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and intervention tracking. Here, we describe case studies in which users can interrogate( 1) SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain( RBD) across different geographical regions to inform the design and testing of therapeutics,( 2) SNVs that may impact the sensitivity of commonly used diagnostic primers, and( 3) the emergence of a dominant lineage harboring an S477N RBD mutation in Australia in 2020. To accelerate COVID-19 efforts, COVID-19 CG will be upgraded with new features for users to rapidly pinpoint mutations as the virus evolves throughout the pandemic and in response to therapeutic and public health interventions.Introduction:Since the beginning of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 genomic data has been accumulating at an unprecedented rate( 400, 000+ virus genomes as of February 2020 on the GISAID database)( Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017). Numerous countries have mobilized to sequence thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes upon the occurrence of local outbreaks, collectively and consistently contributing more than 20, 000 genomes per month( Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A, B). It is important to note that, despite the slow accumulation of potentially functional( nonsynonymous) mutations, there has been a steady increase in the number of variants with more than six nonsynonymous mutations compared to the WIV04 reference, an early genome of SARS-CoV-2 that was sampled in Wuhan in December 2019( Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). To evaluate the outcomes of anti-COVID-19 measures and detect keystone events of virus evolution, it is important to track changes in SARS-CoV-2 mutation and population dynamics in a location and date-specific manner. Indeed, several countries and the National Institutes of Health( NIH) have recognized how critical it is to collect SARS-CoV-2 genomic data to support contact tracing efforts and to inform public health decisions â these are paramount to the re-opening of countries and inter-regional travel( Collins, 2020; Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Oude Munnink et al., 2020; Virological, 2020; Rockett et al., 2020). Yet, the quantity and complexity of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data( and metadata) make it challenging and costly for the majority of scientists to stay abreast of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in a way that is meaningful to their specific research goals. Currently, each group or organization has to independently expend labor, computing costs, and, most importantly, time to curate and analyze the genomic data from GISAID before they can generate specific hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 lineages and mutations in their population( s) of interest.Discussion:COVID-19 CG is one of a growing number of COVID-19 public browsers that analyze and visualize the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the GISAID database, serving different and complementary user objectives. NextStrain( Hadfield et al., 2018) visualizes real-time tracking of SARS-CoV-2 evolution on a global and continental level, using phylogenetic trees, geographical maps, and entropy and frequency plots; CoV-GLUE( Singer et al., 2020) is a browsable database of amino acid replacements and indels; the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser is an extension of their widely used browser that enables layering of annotation tracks and new features such as conservation with similar viruses, immune epitopes, primers, and CRISPR guides( Fernandes et al., 2020); the COVID-19 Viral Genome Analysis Pipeline( Korber et al., 2020) allows for exploring mutations geographically and over time with a focus on the spike protein; COVIDep( Ahmed et al., 2020) is a browser for real-time reporting of vaccine target recommendations; Genomic Signature Analysis of Virus Causing COVID-19( Bauer et al., 2020) visualizes the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 genomes in 2D space; SARS-CoV-2 Alignment Screen( van Dorp et al., 2020a; van Dorp et al., 2020b) is a visualization tool providing the distribution of SNPs and homoplasies; the WashU Virus Genome Browser( Flynn et al., 2020) provides different tools such as a phylogenetic tree and a genomic-coordinate track-based view of viral sequencing data. There are also websites aimed at helping users to check COVID-19 diagnostic primers and probes, forÂ example, the SARS-CoV-2 target regions browser from the European Commission and the Status of SARS-CoV-2 detection systems( RT-PCR) browser from the University of Turin. GISAID also monitors and reports RBD mutations and assigns clades and lineages as well as genome quality. The current GISAID reports describe the geographical distribution of new mutations, total occurrence by country, mutations in commonly used diagnostics, and 3D structural maps of mutations in the four largest clades( gisaid. org/spike). GISAID additionally provides CoVsurver( gisaid. org/covsurver) for users to screen for potential phenotypic changes based on curated literature annotations; BLAST searches and large-scale phylogenetic trees and alignments; and a new functionality for tracking emerging variants( gisaid. org/variants). COVID-19 CG provides additional complementary functionalities to those that are available on the GISAID platform, as well as these other diverse COVID-19 public browsers. COVID-19 CG( https://covidcg. org) was built to help scientists and professionals worldwide, with varying levels of bioinformatics expertise, in their real-time analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic data. Mainly, COVID-19 CG enables users to track in realÂ time, without sub-sampling, lineages, clades, and SNVs( nucleotide or amino acid) across the SARS-CoV-2 genome( or any genomic region of choice) while rapidly filtering on a user-friendly interface by geographical regions, date range, and other criteria of interest to the user. In this work, we explored several case studies that serve to highlight what users can quickly achieve using COVID-19 CG. As more detailed metadata is generated by COVID-19 studies and initiatives, we will update the application to enable filtering according to patient traits such as host species( e. g., human or mink), gender, age, ethnicity, and medical condition( e. g., symptoms, hospitalization). In addition, over the next year, as more mutations accumulate across the tens of millions of COVID cases worldwide, we plan to implement a server-client model for COVID-19 CG, where genomic data is filtered and processed on the server before being sent to the client for visualization. This change should significantly reduce the computational burden of COVID-19 CG on userâs computers, and allow our application to scale to a much larger number of genomes. Our team and colleagues continue to actively use the COVID-19 CG site to quickly generate hypotheses about COVID-19 before performing a deep analysis using the data on GISAID. We anticipate that novel questions will arise over the next year and intentionally designed COVID-19 CG( https://covidcg. org) to be modular in order to continually integrate different types of COVID-19 data and build in new features. Some of these functionalities exist on other platforms, and we recommend that scientists try each browser to find the one that best meets their needs. SARS-CoV-2 public browsers such as COVID-19 CG and others we have highlighted here help scientists around the world to parse through large quantities of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and metadata for the purposes of informing vaccine, therapeutics, and policy development. We advocate for decision makers around the world to sustain or accelerate their sequencing of virus genomes in their geographical area. Collecting virus genomic data is particularly relevant to regions that are experiencing increases in COVID-19 cases. If only sparse genomic data are sampled, we risk the late detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants that exhibit enhanced transmissibility, virulence or resistance against therapeutics or vaccination programs in these pandemic hotspots. Furthermore, the widespread implementation of vaccines and antibody therapies could stimulate the emergence and selection of new escape variants( Baum et al., 2020). To compound these risks, SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to minks( and in some cases back into humans) has already been detected at farms across at least 10 countries and one wild mink in the United States( OIE- World Organisation for Animal Health, 2020). This process of species crossing, if left unchecked, can risk the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into wild animal populations and the emergence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants. Coordinated sequencing and contact tracing efforts( e. g., in the UnitedÂ Kingdom, Singapore, the Netherlands, Italy, California, and Australia) emphasize the urgency of establishing open access platforms to evaluate trends in virus introduction into each country or region in real time. Local policymakers, public health researchers, and scientists can use global SARS-CoV-2 genetic data, in complementation with contact tracing data, to better understand which lineages were imported into their region( from which potential international locations), whether these were introduced multiple times, and if particular lineages are dying out or persisting. Labs in numerous countries are already making incredible efforts to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in their local populations( Figure 6). When each country actively contributes to the database of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, this protects against sampling biases that can impact the ability to perform phylogenetic analysis and interpret global SARS-CoV-2 data. Toward this goal that affects all of humanity, we advocate for the increased sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from patients( and infected animals) around the world, and for these data to be shared in as timely a manner as possible.","answer":"The discovery of faster spreading variants of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) has raised alarm .

But, to our knowledge, its usage is limited in training CNNs. While there exist many ways to limit gradients, one of the common strategies is to clip individual gradients to the predefined range[-theta,theta]. With clipping, gradients are in a certain range. With stochastic gradient descent commonly used for training, learning rate is multiplied to adjust the step size. If high learning rate is used, it is likely that theta is tuned to be small to avoid exploding gradients in a high learning rate regime. But as learning rate is annealed to get smaller, the effective gradient (gradient multiplied by learning rate) approaches zero and training can take exponentially many iterations to converge if learning rate is decreased geometrically.Question: What is gradient clipping?","answer":"Gradient clipping is a technique often used in training RNNs that alters hyperparameters such that the gradients are always within a certain range."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a materials science research paper.

A pretreatment with 20kPa CO2 + 20 kPa O2 + 60 kPa N2 for 3 days proved effective in maintaining the fruit quality and controlling decay in table grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Cardinal) stored at 0 degrees C. In the present work, we analyzed whether total anthocyanin content, the molecular mechanism implicated in their biosynthesis and antioxidant activity is related to the beneficial effect of this gaseous treatment. We isolated partial cDNAs that codified for enzymes implicated in the anthocyanin biosynthesis such as l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS), and an antioxidant enzyme such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Low temperatures induced an accumulation of total anthocyanin content in the skin of both treated and non-treated grapes, although levels were lower in CO2-treated fruit. By contrast, antioxidant activity decreased during storage at 0 degrees C in non-treated grapes but did not change in CO2-treated grapes. The up-regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis gene expression and VcAPX mRNA observed in non-treated grape is not enhanced in CO2-treated grapes, which presented low total decay. These results point out the ability of CO2-treated grapes to prevent the generation of reactive oxygen species rather than their inactivation by means of induction of studied defense systems.","answer":"[[\\"anthocyanin\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"APX\\"], [\\"anthocyanin\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"PAL\\"], [\\"anthocyanin\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"CHS\\"], [\\"anthocyanin\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"chalcone synthase\\"], [\\"anthocyanin\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase\\"], [\\"anthocyanin\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"ascorbate peroxidase\\"]]"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the number of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lung is increased. One described mechanism leading to the impaired clearance of these cells from the lung is the delay in their programmed cell death (apoptosis). Selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are under development for the treatment of lung diseases because of their anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator activity. The aim of the present study was to establish whether inhibitors of PDE3, PDE4 and PDE5 modulate human eosinophil or neutrophil apoptosis or beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist- or cytokine-afforded survival. We also evaluated whether a PDE4 inhibitor could modulate the effect of a corticosteroid on eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured by using the relative DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V binding. Inhibitors of PDE4 (rolipram; 0.1-10 microM) and PDE3 (cilostazol; 0.1-10 microM) delayed spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 25% and 15%, respectively. A combination of a PDE4 or PDE3 inhibitor (10 microM) with salbutamol (100 nM) further delayed eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 42-49%. In neutrophils, rolipram (10 microM) also decreased apoptosis with a maximal inhibition of 13%. The combination of rolipram (10 microM) and salbutamol (100 nM) produced a 27% inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. Inhibitor of cGMP-specific PDE5 (zaprinast; 0.1-10 microM) did not affect eosinophil apoptosis and only slightly increased spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. The effect of budesonide on apoptosis was not significantly modulated by a PDE4 inhibitor in eosinophils or neutrophils. The present results show that selective inhibitors of cAMP-hydrolyzing PDEs (PDE3 and PDE4) delay eosinophil apoptosis and, thus, increase their survival in vitro. Furthermore, beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors, suggesting that such drug combinations may prolong eosinophil and neutrophil longevity in the lung.","answer":"[[\\"cilostazol\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"PDE3\\"], [\\"zaprinast\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"cGMP-specific PDE5\\"], [\\"rolipram\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"PDE4\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

This requires the animal to derive allocentric spatial information from egocentric sensory and motor experience. The neural mechanisms underlying this transformation are mostly unknown. We addressed this problem in electric fish, which can precisely navigate in complete darkness and whose brain circuitry is relatively simple. We conducted the first neural recordings in the preglomerular complex, the thalamic region exclusively connecting the optic tectum with the spatial learning circuits in the dorsolateral pallium. While tectal topographic information was mostly eliminated in preglomerular neurons, the time-intervals between object encounters were precisely encoded. We show that this reliable temporal information, combined with a speed signal, can permit accurate estimation of the distance between encounters, a necessary component of path-integration that enables computing allocentric spatial relations. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates.Introduction:Learning to navigate within the spatial organization of different habitats is essential for animalsâ survival( Geva-Sagiv et al., 2015). Electric fish, for example, occupied a lucrative ecological niche by evolving the ability to navigate and localize food sources in complete darkness using short-range electrosensation( Jun et al., 2016). The spatial acuity that they exhibit, along with their reliance on learned landmark positions, strongly suggest that they memorize the relative arrangement of the landmarks and the environmental borders. The information animals use to generate such allocentric knowledge include sensory experiences collected during object encounters( Jun et al., 2016; Petreanu et al., 2012; Save et al., 1998) and motor actions( heading changes and distance traveled) executed between such encounters; utilization of these motor variables in spatial learning and navigation is termed path integration( Collett and Graham, 2004; Etienne and Jeffery, 2004). This acquired information, however, is always egocentric in nature. Fittingly, the primary brain regions dedicated to sensory and motor processing, such as the optic tectum( OT) of all vertebrates and many cortical regions in mammals are topographically organized along an egocentric coordinate system( Knudsen, 1982; Sparks and Nelson, 1987; Stein, 1992). Unravelling the neural operations underlying the transformation of egocentric sensory and motor information streams into an allocentric representation of the environment has been a central theme in studies of spatial learning and navigation. Recent studies in the mouse( Peyrache et al., 2017) have suggested that the key computations include vestibular input that defines the animalâs head direction( head direction cells, egocentric) and external sensory input that signals the presence of stable environmental features( i. e., landmarks). Linking the head directions that orient the animal to different environmental features are then hypothesized to generate an allocentric representation of those features. The neural circuits that have been hypothesized to implement these computations are, however, exceedingly complicated and include thalamic( head direction) and cortical( external sensory) input to the hippocampal formation. The proposed wiring diagrams are highly speculative and very far from providing a well-defined mechanistic model of how spatial maps are created. Equivalent computations appear to be carried out in Drosophila( Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015). Visual orientation to landmarks and body direction via path integration are combined in the ellipsoid body with dynamics suggestive of a ring attractor. While these studies in the simpler nervous system of the fly are now closer to providing a mechanistic explanation of how egocentric and external( visual) inputs are combined, it is not clear if the fly has a full representation of the allocentric relations of different environmental features. It is also not at all clear that the dynamics of the ellipsoid body can be mapped onto the cortical and hippocampal circuitry of mammals. Teleost fish offer an attractive model for studying this question, as their related brain circuitry is relatively tractable: lesion studies point to the dorsolateral pallium( DL) as the key telencephalic region required for allocentric spatial learning( Broglio et al., 2010; DurÃ¡n et al., 2010; RodrÃ­guez et al., 2002), similarly to the medial cortex in reptiles and the hippocampus in mammals( see Discussion). DL has strong excitatory recurrent connectivity( Elliott et al., 2017; Giassi et al., 2012b). Importantly, DL receives sensory and motor information related to electrosensory and visual object motion from OT( Bastian, 1982) via a single structure â the diencephalic preglomerular complex( PG, Giassi et al., 2012b, Figure 1A). The tectal recipient portion of PG projects solely to DL( Giassi et al., 2012a) in agreement with the lesion studies. Importantly, PG receives very little feedback from areas associated with DL( Giassi et al., 2012b) and therefore functions as an exclusive feed-forward bottleneck between OT and the pallium. DL in turn projects to the central pallium( DC, Giassi et al., 2012b); DL also has reciprocal connections with the dorsal pallium( DD) and DD itself has strong recurrent connectivity. DC is the only route by which DL can control motor activity and it does so solely via its projections to the OT( Giassi et al., 2012b). We hypothesize that egocentric object-related information( OT) conveyed by PG to DL, is converted to a learned allocentric spatial map by the recurrent circuitry of DL, DD and DC; DC, in turn, then controls the fishâs spatial behavior via its projections to OT.Discussion:Our results suggest the following space-to-time transformation scheme: PG derives a sequence of discrete novelty events( encounters) from OT activity. The remarkable history-independent adaptation process provides an accessible, accurate and unbiased representation of the time intervals between encounters. We have found visually-responsive PG cells displaying similar adaptation features( Figure 5âfigure supplement 2), suggesting that this mechanism is implemented across multiple sensory modalities. The elimination of egocentric topographic information in PG â both in the response itself and in its adaptation â ensures that the encoding of time is invariant to the specific body part encountering the object. This temporal information is then transmitted to DL, which can use it to integrate the fishâs swim velocity to obtain distance-traveled, a key allocentric variable. For fish, the necessary velocity information may be provided by the lateral-line system( Chagnaud et al., 2007; Oteiza et al., 2017); several lateral-line responsive PG units were encountered in our recordings( Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). Finally, DL can combine the distance information with instantaneous heading-direction( vestibular system, Straka and Baker, 2013; Yoder and Taube, 2014) to yield the animalâs allocentric spatial position( Etienne and Jeffery, 2004). A recent study in zebrafish suggests that DL neurons can indeed process temporal information on the long time-scales discussed here( Cheng et al., 2014). Our computational analysis demonstrates that the PG temporal information is sufficient to account for the spatial acuity displayed in behavioral studies of gymnotiform fish utilizing electrosensory information alone( Figure 8). This space-to-time mechanism may shed light on the primitive basis of egocentric-to-allocentric transformations. Short-range sensing, used by ancestor species living in low-visibility environments, necessitated the perception of space through temporal sequences of object encounters. With the evolution of long-range sensory systems such as diurnal vision( MacIver et al., 2017), simultaneous apprehension of the spatial relations of environmental features became possible. The neural mechanisms implementing sequential( space-to-time) spatial inference and simultaneous spatial inference presumably both exist in mammals, forÂ example, we can acquire a map of relative object locations by looking at a scene from afar, or by walking and sequentially encountering landmarks with our eyes closed. Whether the sequential or the simultaneous spatial-inference is more dominant may depend on the species( e. g., nocturnal or diurnal) and on context( e. g., open field or underground burrows). However, it is not clear whether sequentially versus simultaneously-acquired spatial knowledge is processed in a common circuit. Indeed, clinical case studies on the regaining of eyesight in blind humans indicate that sequential and simultaneous spatial perceptions are fundamentally different, and may therefore involve two distinct computations and neuronal pathways( Sacks, 1995). The population of thalamic neurons that we discovered may provide an essential component underlying one of these two major computations â the encoding of sequential temporal information â and we hypothesize that such neurons underlie sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates. There is substantial evidence indicating that the pathway studied here indeed has parallels in other vertebrates, and specifically in mammals. PGâs homology to posterior thalamic nuclei is supported by previously published anatomical and developmental findings( Giassi et al., 2012a; Ishikawa et al., 2007; Mueller, 2012), as well as by physiological( Figure 1B, C) and molecular( Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) results presented here. The thalamic pulvinar nucleus is particularly similar to PG in that it receives direct tectal input( Berman and Wurtz, 2011). Its involvement in visual attention and saliency in primates( Robinson and Petersen, 1992) corresponds to PGâs involvement in novelty detection( Figure 2). Moreover, pulvinar lesions are associated with saccadic abnormalities and deficits in the perception of complex visual scenes( Arend et al., 2008), suggesting a link to the sequential mode of spatial learning. Komura et al.( 2001) demonstrated that posterior thalamic regions( including the rodent equivalent of the pulvinar) can implement interval timing computations over long time-scales( >>1 s); however, the mechanistic basis for these computations has not been identified( Simen et al., 2011) and potential contributions to path integration have not been explicated. A recent paper( Paton and Buonomano, 2018) reviewed models of temporal encoding based on recurrent neural networks. Further studies will be required to determine whether the novel adaptation encoding mechanism in PG engages the downstream recurrent networks of DD and DL to produce refined estimates of the time interval between salient sensory and/or motor events. Finally, a recent study in rodents demonstrated spatially non-specific adaptation in VPM( Jubran et al., 2016), a posterior thalamic nucleus responding to vibrissal object encounters( Yu et al., 2006). Taken together, we hypothesize that thalamic space-to-time mechanisms akin to those presented here play an important role in mammalian sequential spatial learning, especially in nocturnal animals relying on sparse sensory cues( Save et al., 1998). The telencephalic target of PG, DL, resembles the mammalian hippocampus not only in function, as revealed in lesion studies( RodrÃ­guez et al., 2002), but also in development, gross circuitry and gene expression( Elliott et al., 2017). The role of the hippocampus in spatial learning and navigation is well established, and hippocampal neural correlates of allocentric spatial variables have been exquisitely described( Barry and Burgess, 2014; BuzsÃ¡ki and Moser, 2013). There is also evidence for the importance of time coding in the mammalian hippocampus: âTime cellsâ responsive to elapsed time have been reported and, in some cases, these cells also respond at specific spatial loci( Eichenbaum, 2014). Furthermore, a recent study on the representation of goals in the hippocampus found cells encoding the length/duration of the traveled path( Sarel et al., 2017). The mechanism we have found may therefore contribute to creating temporal coding in the hippocampus, not just in the context of egocentric-to-allocentric transformations but rather whenever expectations associated with specific time intervals need to be generated. It should be noted, however, that unlike DLâs direct thalamic input via the PG bottleneck, the hippocampus receives sensory and motor information primarily via the cortex. Furthermore, multiple bi-directional pathways connect the mammalian sensory and motor cortical regions with the hippocampal network. Pinpointing the exact loci where egocentric-to-allocentric transformations may take place in the mammalian brain is therefore extremely challenging. We propose that this transformation is initiated in the mammalian thalamus where history-independent adaptation also encodes time between encounter events. Finally, we propose that this thalamic output contributes to the generation of an allocentric spatial representation in the mammalian hippocampus. In this contribution, we propose a hypothesis about how gymnotiform fish, and perhaps vertebrates in general, generate their representation of position relative to the environment. Future experiments could test the predictions entailed by this hypothesis. Behaviorally, our model implies that the fish's sense of position is critically dependent on its last encounter with an object. Further behavioral studies of spatial learning could elucidate this relationship, forÂ example, by manipulating the objects' arrangement relative to the navigation target. Combining these studies with chronic recordings of PG and its pallial targets in freely navigating fish will permit testing of our proposed space-to-time neural transformation scheme.","answer":"Finding their way around is an essential part of survival for many animals and helps them to locate food , mates and shelter .

Text: response to the Ebola outbreak [1] . Reformation of WHO to ready it to lead responses to future health emergencies is one area of active debate. Chan will step down from WHO on June 30, 2017  after more than a decade in the post. The process for choosing WHO's next leader has begun, promising to be protracted and rigorous as befits the importance of the role. Factoring in the many influential stakeholders in the process of appointing Chan's successor, however, transparency of the selection process may be one area unlikely to attract plaudits. Although too soon to speculate about the identity of WHO's next Director-General, it is worth reflecting on what qualities an incoming leader should bring to WHO and how that person might need to conceive changes in the structure and behavior of the organization against a landscape of important and evolving threats to the health of the fastgrowing global population. Instead of electing a new Director-General, Lorenz Von Seidlein of Mahidol University, Thailand, argued that \\"the problems. . .are now so deeply ingrained that replacing the WHO with new, more appropriate organizations is the logical solution. . .at a fraction of current cost, free of cumbersome, archaic obligations and entitlements and [with] an ability to respond to new problems.\\" This viewpoint is indicative of the strength of feeling that WHO's deficiencies have come to evoke in some of those committed to the cause of improving the health of people in low-income and middle-income countries. But this perception acknowledges that an accountable global body will always be needed to promote, set standards in, and evaluate progress toward better health for people in all countries. The next Director-General will need to heed critics of the organization and craft a process of streamlining and restructuring to produce a new WHO that is demonstrably effective in leading responses to threats to health, and efficient in doing so. As Gostin commented to PLOS Medicine, \\"WHO urgently needs a bold reform agenda to fix long-standing problems recognized by every independent group that has evaluated the Organization.\\" Political machinations and the enemy within, bureaucracy, are likely to impede reform. For example, WHO's regional and country offices are seen by some as unaccountable, yet the agency of the future will need to be connected and responsive to the resources and needs of all constituent countries. As Gostin also noted, \\"[WHO] has failed to include civil society in its governance, unlike. . .newer organizations.\\" WHO's next Director-General should be a proven leader and advocate, perhaps from a lowincome or middle-income country. The new recruit will be greeted by a full in-tray, and featuring prominently are likely to be the constraints imposed by WHO's current funding mechanisms. A substantial proportion of WHO's existing budget is earmarked for specific projects, leaving the organization with little financial flexibility to respond to unanticipated demands. However, any improved funding mechanism is likely to follow, and be dependent on, organizational reform. According to Kruk, \\"WHO is both essential and hamstrung. . .the election of the Director-General should be a moment for member countries and other funders to reflect on whether they want an implementation agency for their favored health agenda, or an independent institution with the intelligence, agility, and operational capacity to tackle the coming global health challenges.\\" Above all, the incoming leader of WHO will need to be open-minded and creative. More than one of the experts we contacted emphasized the fluid nature of the threats to human health to which WHO should shape the world's response. WHO must be able to lead responses in some areas of global health, but, in other areas, working together with more nimble and focused organizations will be pragmatic. Large-scale infectious disease outbreaks are continuing, and noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, dementia, and mental illnesses, are growing in prevalence and increasing demand for treatment and care. The resources and ingenuity of researchers and clinicians will need to be harnessed, and interventions adapted to new settings, with much greater dynamism. The secular issues of population ageing, conflict, climate change, migration, and others will produce health problems that only an organization with a global reach, responsible to all, can hope to meet.

Your response should include the abstract and no additional text.Paper text:all radio - loud agn , whatever their radio luminosity and eventual morphology , are expected to go through an initial phase of supersonic expansion before coming into pressure balance ( see , for example , @xcite ) .the length of this phase , the amount of energy injected into the external medium during this phase , and the location of the energy injection depend on the jet power and density of the environment . in a poor environment, the radio source will remain overpressured for longer , so that the shock heating phase will be longer lived .it therefore seems likely that the two places where shock heating will be easiest to detect are in the poorest environments , and in the environments of the most powerful agn .indeed , the first ( and until recently only ) direct detection of radio - galaxy shock heating was in the galaxy halo of the nearest radio galaxy centaurus a @xcite , which has a low radio luminosity and fri morphology , but whose inner lobes are still in the supersonic expansion phase ( see section  [ cenas ] ) .more recently weak shocks have been detected in the cluster environments of several more powerful radio galaxies , e.g. m87 @xcite , and the frii sources cygnus a @xcite and hydra a @xcite ; however , there remains no convincing case of a strong shock associated with an frii radio galaxy .in addition , frii radio galaxies for which measurements exist of both the internal pressure ( via lobe inverse compton emission ) and the external pressure appear to be close to pressure balance rather than strongly overpressured @xcite , so that lobe expansion is not likely to be highly supersonic .while it is not possible to rule out an important role for strong shocks produced by powerful radio galaxies , the observational evidence suggests that it is in the early stages of radio - source evolution , for both fri and frii sources , that shock heating is most important .although the main emphasis of most work on radio - source impact has been on the group and cluster scale effects of radio galaxies , the impact of shock heating on the ism of agn host galaxies is likely to be dramatic , as we demonstrate below .    inthe following sections we review the first detection of radio - source shock heating in centaurus a before presenting a new example of strongly shocked gas shells in the ism of 801 that share some characteristics with but also show some important differences .finally , based on the nuclear properties and host galaxy characteristics of systems with detected strong shock heating , we discuss the links between shock heating and agn fuelling and possible implications for the role of shock heating in feedback models .kraft et al . ( 2003 ) @xcite detected a bright shell of hot gas surrounding the south - west inner lobe of the nearest radio galaxy centaurus a. fig .[ cena ] shows more recent _ chandra _ data @xcite illustrating the sharp x - ray shell .the shell has a temperature ten times higher than that of the surrounding interstellar medium , and the total thermal energy of the shell is a significant fraction of the energy of the ism .centaurus a has an fri morphology , so would traditionally have been expected to have subsonically expanding lobes ; the detection of strongly shocked gas in this system has highlighted the fact that energy input via shocks is likely to be important in the early stages of expansion for all types of radio galaxies .052 is another nearby galaxy where it has been suggested that the small radio source could be shocking and heating its hot ism @xcite .a recent , deep _observation reveals in detail the radio - related x - ray structure hinted at by the earlier snapshot observation , but does not show clear evidence for shocked shells , suggesting that the radio - source / environment interaction in this system may be considerably more complex than the shock heating seen in .our recent _ chandra _ observations of 801 @xcite revealed a second definite example of strong shocks produced by a small fri source on galaxy scales .fig  [ 3801 ] shows the _ chandra_-detected emission from 801 , which traces well the outer edges of the radio lobes .we can rule out a non - thermal model for the x - ray emission based on its spectrum , and find best - fitting _ mekal _ temperatures of 1.0 kev and 0.7 kev for the west and east lobes , respectively .the undisturbed interstellar medium has a temperature of 0.23 kev .we find that the observed density contrast is consistent with the value of 4 expected for a strong shock , using the mean properties of the shell and the ism density halfway along the lobe .the shells are overpressured by a factor of 13 - 20 and the shell pressure is @xmath0 times the synchrotron minimum internal lobe pressure ( consistent with the general finding that fri minimum pressures are typically an order of magnitude lower than external pressure @xcite ) .we estimated the shock mach number using two methods , as descibed in more detail in @xcite : applying the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions using the observed temperature jump gives @xmath1 ; alternatively , ram pressure balance gives @xmath2 .the discrepancy between the two methods is probably due to the expected temperature and density structure of the shell and the interstellar medium ( in both cases the data are too poor to constrain these ) .nevertheless this is a clear detection of strongly shocked gas with @xmath3 , which implies a lobe expansion speed of @xmath4 km s@xmath5 .the total thermal energy stored in the hot gas shells is @xmath6 ergs , and for @xmath7 , the total kinetic energy of the shells is @xmath8 ergs .the total energy of the shells , @xmath9 ergs is comparable to @xmath10 , the approximate total energy available from the radio source as work ; however , it is @xmath11 times the minimum work required to inflate the lobe cavities ( @xmath12 ergs ) , so that a simple calculation of the radio - source energy input from the cavity size would be a significant underestimate .the total energy is also equivalent to the thermal energy of the ism within 11 kpc ( or 25 percent of the thermal energy within 30 kpc ) .shock heating is therefore the dominant energy transfer mechanism during this phase of radio - source activity , and will have dramatic long term effects : part or all of the ism may be expelled from the galaxy , and the entropy of the gas will be permanently increased .the internal energy of the radio source ( @xmath13 ergs ) must also eventually be transferred to the environment .the age of the radio source in 801 is estimated to be @xmath14 y from radio spectral ageing and dynamical arguments , which implies an energy injection rate of @xmath15 ergs s@xmath5 .this should correspond to a considerable fraction of the jet power , which is consistent with a rough estimate of its jet power based on scaling that of 3c31 @xcite by the ratio of radio luminosities of 801 and 3c31 .the rate of mechanical energy extracted is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the accretion - related x - ray luminosity , so that the agn is more efficiently converting energy into jet production than radiation .we also find that the bondi accretion rate from hot gas would be sufficient to power this radio outburst , for @xmath16 .both  and 801 are disturbed ellipticals with evidence for fairly recent mergers .another property that the two sources have in common is that their nuclear x - ray spectra show a component of emission with heavy intrinsic absorption ( n@xmath17 @xmath18 in both cases ) as seen in high - excitation frii radio - galaxy x - ray spectra @xcite .this is in constrast to the vast majority of fri radio galaxies , which possess no direct evidence for accretion - related x - ray emission or a torus @xcite .it is therefore interesting to speculate that these systems represent a particular class of fri radio outburst fuelled by cold gas that may be driven into the centre during gas - rich mergers , a mechanism that is unlikely to operate in rich group or cluster - centre fri radio sources. if this is true , then the shock heating process is not self - regulating , as most of the agn energy goes into the hot phase of the ism , so that the accretion rate of cold material is not directly affected .  and801 may represent a class of systems at the massive end of the galaxy luminosity function that experience extreme heating effects .we have recently found a second example of strong shocks associated with the radio lobes of a nearby galaxy @xcite , with a total energy in the shock - heated shells @xmath11 times the minimum that would have been required to inflate the cavities subsonically : shock heating is therefore the dominant energy transfer mechanism for this source .young radio galaxies should all go through an early stage of supersonic expansion , and the examples of  and 801 show that this stage can have dramatic effects on the host galaxy ism . asthis stage is comparatively short - lived , and outbursts of the luminosity of 801 and  are currently only detectable to @xmath19 in the radio , further examples of this process may be difficult to find with current generation instruments ; however , they are expected to be orders of magnitude more common than cygnus a type radio outbursts .the nuclear and host galaxy properties of 801 and  suggest that the shock heating in these galaxies may be directly related to their merger history ; we suggest that merger - triggered radio outbursts could be an important galaxy feedback mechanism .","answer":"shock heating by radio jets is potentially an important process in a range of environments as it will increase the entropy of the heated gas .  although this process is expected to occur in the most powerful radio - loud agn , strong shocks have so far only been detected in nearby low - power radio galaxies .  here we discuss x - ray detections of strong shocks in nearby galaxies , including a new detection of shocked gas around both lobes of the nearby radio galaxy ngc3801 with inferred mach numbers of 3  6 and a total injected energy comparable to the thermal energy of the ism within 11 kpc . we discuss possible links between shock heating , agn fuelling and galaxy mergers and the role of this type of system in feedback models ."},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

For example, program synthesis tools based on enumeration and deduction BID24 BID19 BID8 BID7 are successful at generating programs that satisfy some (usually incomplete) formal specification but are often obviously wrong on manual inspection, as they cannot distinguish unlikely from likely, \\"natural\\" programs. On the otherhand, learned code models have succeeded in generating realistic-looking programs BID17 BID5 BID18 BID20 Yin & Neubig, 2017) . However, theseprograms often fail to be semantically relevant, for example because variables are not used consistently.In this work, we try to overcome these challenges for generative code models and present a general method for generative models that can incorporate structured information that is deterministically available at generation time. We focus our attentionon generating source code and follow the ideas of program graphs BID1 ) that have been shown to learn semantically meaningful representations of (pre-existing) programs. To achieve this, we liftgrammar-based tree decoder models into the graph setting, where the diverse relationships between various elements of the generated code can be modeled. For this, the syntax treeunder generation is augmented with additional edges denoting known relationships (e.g., last use of variables). We then interleave the stepsof the generative procedure with neural message passing BID9 to compute more precise representations of the intermediate states of the program generation. This is fundamentally differentfrom sequential generative models of graphs BID14 BID23 , which aim to generate all edges and nodes, whereas our graphs are deterministic augmentations of generated trees.To summarize, we present a) a general graph-based generativeprocedure for highly structured objects, incorporating rich structural information; b) ExprGen, a new code generation taskfocused on (a, u) â insertChild(a, )We presented a generative code model that leverages known semantics of partially generated programs to direct the generative procedure.The key idea is to augment partial programs to obtain a graph, and then use graph neural networks to compute a precise representation for the partial program.This representation then helps to better guide the remainder of the generative procedure.We have shown that this approach can be used to generate small but semantically interesting expressions from very imprecise context information.The presented model could be useful in program repair scenarios (where repair proposals need to be scored, based on their context) or in the code review setting (where it could highlight very unlikely expressions).We also believe that similar models could have applications in related domains, such as semantic parsing, neural program synthesis and text generation.","answer":"Representing programs as graphs including semantics helps when generating programs"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

We describe a case of transient neurological deficit that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1% hyperbaric bupivacaine slowly injected through a 25-gauge pencil-point spinal needle. The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful, but 3 days after surgery, the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3-L4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on (loss of pinprick sensation) without reduction in muscular strength. Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks. Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow-up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect. However, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution (if pencil-point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient neurological deficit.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"bupivacaine\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"loss of pinprick sensation\\", \\"neurological deficit\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Nanoparticles coated with polysorbates have previously been shown to enable the transport of several drugs across the blood-brain barrier, which under normal circumstances is impermeable to these compounds. Apolipoprotein E was suggested to mediate this drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, apolipoprotein E was coupled by chemical methods to nanoparticles made of human serum albumin (HSA-NP). Loperamide, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier but exerts antinociceptive effects after direct injection into the brain, was used as model drug. Apolipoprotein E was chemically bound via linkers to loperamide-loaded HSA-NP. This preparation induced antinociceptive effects in the tail-flick test in ICR mice after i.v. injection. In contrast, nanoparticles linked to apolipoprotein E variants that do not recognize lipoprotein receptors failed to induce these effects. These results indicate that apolipoprotein E attached to the surface of nanoparticles facilitates transport of drugs across the blood-brain barrier, probably after interaction with lipoprotein receptors on the brain capillary endothelial cell membranes.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Loperamide\\", \\"polysorbates\\", \\"loperamide\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"albumin\\", \\"Apolipoprotein E\\", \\"apolipoprotein e\\", \\"lipoprotein receptors\\", \\"apolipoprotein E\\", \\"HSA\\", \\"human serum albumin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The chromosomal region 12q24 has been previously implicated by linkage studies of both bipolar disorder and unipolar mood disorder and we have reported two pedigrees segregating both bipolar disorder and Darier's disease that show linkage across this region. The gene P2RX7 is located in this chromosomal region and has been recently reported as a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. The non-synonymous SNP rs2230912 (resulting in amino-acid polymorphism Q460R) showed the strongest association and has been postulated to be pathogenically relevant. We have investigated this gene in a large UK case-control sample (bipolar I disorder N = 687, unipolar recurrent major depression N = 1,036, controls N = 1,204). Neither rs2230912 nor any of 8 other SNPs genotyped across P2RX7 was found to be associated with mood disorder in general, nor specifically with bipolar or unipolar disorder. Further, sequencing of our two chromosome 12-linked bipolar-Darier families showed no evidence of rare variants at P2RX7 that could explain the linkage. Our data do not provide support for rs2230912 or the other polymorphisms studied within the P2RX7 locus, being involved in susceptibility to mood disorders.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"unipolar disorder candidate susceptibility gene\\", \\"P2RX7\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: In this report, we use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model  to attempt to infer the impactof these interventions across 11 European countries. Our methods assume that changes in thereproductive numberâ a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventionsbeing implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates thesechanges by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission thatoccurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. One of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on thereproduction number across countries and over time. This allows us to leverage a greater amount ofdata across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that our results are driven strongly by thedata from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain. We find that the slowing growth in daily reported deaths in Italy is consistent with a significant impactof interventions implemented several weeks earlier. In Italy, we estimate that the effectivereproduction number, Rt, dropped to close to 1 around the time of Iockdown (11th March), althoughwith a high level of uncertainty. Overall, we estimate that countries have managed to reduce their reproduction number. Ourestimates have wide credible intervals and contain 1 for countries that have implemented a||interventions considered in our analysis. This means that the reproduction number may be above orbelow this value. With current interventions remaining in place to at least the end of March, weestimate that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to 31 March[95% credible interval 21,000-120,000]. Many more deaths will be averted through ensuring thatinterventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels. We estimate that, across all 11countries between 7 and 43 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-Z up to 28th March,representing between 1.88% and 11.43% ofthe population. The proportion of the population infectedto date â the attack rate - is estimated to be highest in Spain followed by Italy and lowest in Germanyand Norway, reflecting the relative stages of the epidemics. Given the lag of 2-3 weeks between when transmission changes occur and when their impact can beobserved in trends in mortality, for most of the countries considered here it remains too early to becertain that recent interventions have been effective. If interventions in countries at earlier stages oftheir epidemic, such as Germany or the UK, are more or less effective than they were in the countrieswith advanced epidemics, on which our estimates are largely based, or if interventions have improvedor worsened over time, then our estimates of the reproduction number and deaths averted wouldchange accordingly. It is therefore critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends incases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance thattransmission of SARS-Cov-Z is slowing. SUGGESTED CITATIONSeth Flaxman, Swapnil Mishra, Axel Gandy et 0/. Estimating the number of infections and the impact of nonâpharmaceutical interventions on COVIDâ19 in 11 European countries. Imperial College London (2020), doi:https://doi.org/10.25561/777311 IntroductionFollowing the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-Z) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 andits global spread, large epidemics of the disease, caused by the virus designated COVID-19, haveemerged in Europe. In response to the rising numbers of cases and deaths, and to maintain thecapacity of health systems to treat as many severe cases as possible, European countries, like those inother continents, have implemented or are in the process of implementing measures to control theirepidemics. These large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions vary between countries but includesocial distancing (such as banning large gatherings and advising individuals not to socialize outsidetheir households), border closures, school closures, measures to isolate symptomatic individuals andtheir contacts, and large-scale lockdowns of populations with all but essential internal travel banned. Understanding firstly, whether these interventions are having the desired impact of controlling theepidemic and secondly, which interventions are necessary to maintain control, is critical given theirlarge economic and social costs. The key aim ofthese interventions is to reduce the effective reproduction number, Rt, ofthe infection,a fundamental epidemiological quantity representing the average number of infections, at time t, perinfected case over the course of their infection. Ith is maintained at less than 1, the incidence of newinfections decreases, ultimately resulting in control of the epidemic. If Rt is greater than 1, theninfections will increase (dependent on how much greater than 1 the reproduction number is) until theepidemic peaks and eventually declines due to acquisition of herd immunity. In China, strict movement restrictions and other measures including case isolation and quarantinebegan to be introduced from 23rd January, which achieved a downward trend in the number ofconfirmed new cases during February, resulting in zero new confirmed indigenous cases in Wuhan byMarch 19th. Studies have estimated how Rt changed during this time in different areas ofChina fromaround 2-4 during the uncontrolled epidemic down to below 1, with an estimated 7-9 fold decreasein the number of daily contacts per person.1'2 Control measures such as social distancing, intensivetesting, and contact tracing in other countries such as Singapore and South Korea have successfullyreduced case incidence in recent weeks, although there is a riskthe virus will spread again once controlmeasures are relaxed.3'4The epidemic began slightly laterin Europe, from January or later in different regions.5 Countries haveimplemented different combinations of control measures and the level of adherence to governmentrecommendations on social distancing is likely to vary between countries, in part due to differentlevels of enforcement. Estimating reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-Z presents challenges due to the high proportion ofinfections not detected by health systemsâ7 and regular changes in testing policies, resulting indifferent proportions of infections being detected over time and between countries. Most countriesso far only have the capacity to test a small proportion of suspected cases and tests are reserved forseverely ill patients or for high-risk groups (e.g. contacts of cases). Looking at case data, therefore,gives a systematically biased view of trends. An alternative way to estimate the course of the epidemic is to back-calculate infections fromobserved deaths. Reported deaths are likely to be more reliable, although the early focus of mostsurveillance systems on cases with reported travel histories to China may mean that some early deathswill have been missed. Whilst the recent trends in deaths will therefore be informative, there is a timelag in observing the effect of interventions on deaths since there is a 2-3-week period betweeninfection, onset of symptoms and outcome. In this report, we fit a novel Bayesian mechanistic model of the infection cycle to observed deaths in11 European countries, inferring plausible upper and lower bounds (Bayesian credible intervals) of thetotal populations infected (attack rates), case detection probabilities, and the reproduction numberover time (Rt). We fit the model jointly to COVID-19 data from all these countries to assess whetherthere is evidence that interventions have so far been successful at reducing Rt below 1, with the strongassumption that particular interventions are achieving a similar impact in different countries and thatthe efficacy of those interventions remains constant over time. The model is informed more stronglyby countries with larger numbers of deaths and which implemented interventions earlier, thereforeestimates of recent Rt in countries with more recent interventions are contingent on similarintervention impacts. Data in the coming weeks will enable estimation of country-specific Rt withgreater precision. Model and data details are presented in the appendix, validation and sensitivity are also presented inthe appendix, and general limitations presented below in the conclusions. 2 ResultsThe timing of interventions should be taken in the context of when an individual countryâs epidemicstarted to grow along with the speed with which control measures were implemented. Italy was thefirst to begin intervention measures, and other countries followed soon afterwards (Figure 1). Mostinterventions began around 12th-14th March. We analyzed data on deaths up to 28th March, giving a2-3-week window over which to estimate the effect of interventions. Currently, most countries in ourstudy have implemented all major non-pharmaceutical interventions. For each country, we model the number of infections, the number of deaths, and Rt, the effectivereproduction number over time, with Rt changing only when an intervention is introduced (Figure 2-12). Rt is the average number of secondary infections per infected individual, assuming that theinterventions that are in place at time t stay in place throughout their entire infectious period. Everycountry has its own individual starting reproduction number Rt before interventions take place. Specific interventions are assumed to have the same relative impact on Rt in each country when theywere introduced there and are informed by mortality data across all countries. Figure l: Intervention timings for the 11 European countries included in the analysis. For furtherdetails see Appendix 8.6. 2.1 Estimated true numbers of infections and current attack ratesIn all countries, we estimate there are orders of magnitude fewer infections detected (Figure 2) thantrue infections, mostly likely due to mild and asymptomatic infections as well as limited testingcapacity. In Italy, our results suggest that, cumulatively, 5.9 [1.9-15.2] million people have beeninfected as of March 28th, giving an attack rate of 9.8% [3.2%-25%] of the population (Table 1). Spainhas recently seen a large increase in the number of deaths, and given its smaller population, our modelestimates that a higher proportion of the population, 15.0% (7.0 [18-19] million people) have beeninfected to date. Germany is estimated to have one of the lowest attack rates at 0.7% with 600,000[240,000-1,500,000] people infected.

A shorter assumed serial interval results inlower starting reproduction numbers (Appendix 8.4.2, Appendix 8.4.6). The initial reproductionnumbers are also uncertain due to (a) importation being the dominant source of new infections earlyin the epidemic, rather than local transmission (b) possible under-ascertainment in deaths particularlybefore testing became widespread. We estimate large changes in Rt in response to the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions. Ourresults, which are driven largely by countries with advanced epidemics and larger numbers of deaths(e.g. Italy, Spain), suggest that these interventions have together had a substantial impact ontransmission, as measured by changes in the estimated reproduction number Rt. Across all countrieswe find current estimates of Rt to range from a posterior mean of 0.97 [0.14-2.14] for Norway to aposterior mean of2.64 [1.40-4.18] for Sweden, with an average of 1.43 across the 11 country posteriormeans, a 64% reduction compared to the pre-intervention values. We note that these estimates arecontingent on intervention impact being the same in different countries and at different times. In allcountries but Sweden, under the same assumptions, we estimate that the current reproductionnumber includes 1 in the uncertainty range. The estimated reproduction number for Sweden is higher,not because the mortality trends are significantly different from any other country, but as an artefactof our model, which assumes a smaller reduction in Rt because no full lockdown has been ordered sofar. Overall, we cannot yet conclude whether current interventions are sufficient to drive Rt below 1(posterior probability of being less than 1.0 is 44% on average across the countries). We are alsounable to conclude whether interventions may be different between countries or over time. There remains a high level of uncertainty in these estimates. It is too early to detect substantialintervention impact in many countries at earlier stages of their epidemic (e.g. Germany, UK, Norway). Many interventions have occurred only recently, and their effects have not yet been fully observeddue to the time lag between infection and death. This uncertainty will reduce as more data becomeavailable. For all countries, our model fits observed deaths data well (Bayesian goodness of fit tests). We also found that our model can reliably forecast daily deaths 3 days into the future, by withholdingthe latest 3 days of data and comparing model predictions to observed deaths (Appendix 8.3). The close spacing of interventions in time made it statistically impossible to determine which had thegreatest effect (Figure 1, Figure 4). However, when doing a sensitivity analysis (Appendix 8.4.3) withuninformative prior distributions (where interventions can increase deaths) we find similar impact ofImperial College COVID-19 Response Teaminterventions, which shows that our choice of prior distribution is not driving the effects we see in themain analysis.

Accordingly , the aim of this study was to examine measured and perceived environmental associations with physical activity of older adults residing across different neighborhood types . Methods One-hundred and forty-eight older individuals , mean age 64.3 Â± 8.4 , were r and omly recruited from one of four neighborhoods that were pre-determined as either having high- or low walkable characteristics . Individual residences were geocoded and 200 m network buffers established . Both objective environment audit , and self-perceived environmental measures  were collected , in conjunction with accelerometer derived physical activity behavior . Using both perceived and objective environment data , analysis consisted of a macro-level comparison of physical activity levels across neighborhood , and a micro-level analysis of individual environmental predictors of physical activity levels . Results Individuals residing in high-walkable neighborhoods on average engaged in 11 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day more than individuals residing in low-walkable neighborhoods . Both measured access to non-residential destinations ( b = .11 , p < .001 ) and self-perceived access to non-residential uses ( b = 2.89 , p = .031 ) were significant predictors of time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity . Other environmental variables significantly predicting components of physical activity behavior included presence of measured neighborhood crime signage ( b = .4785 , p = .031 ) , measured street safety ( b = 26.8 , p = .006 ) , and perceived neighborhood satisfaction ( b = .5.8 , p = .003 ) . Conclusions Older adult residents who live in high-walkable neighborhoods , who have easy and close access to nonresidential destinations , have lower social dysfunction pertinent to crime , and generally perceive the neighborhood to a higher overall satisfaction are likely to engage in higher levels of physical activity behavior . Efforts aim ed at promoting more walkable neighborhoods could influence activity levels in older adultsTitle 2:Public Parks and Physical Activity Among Adolescent GirlsAbstract 2:OBJECTIVES . Physical activity may be constrained or facilitated by local environments . The availability of neighborhood facilities for physical activity may be particularly relevant for youth , who are unable to drive and whose activity is often limited to the immediate distance they are able to walk or bicycle . Several studies have shown that proximity to recreational facilities and parks is one of the most important predictors of physical activity . Because the United States already has an extensive infrastructure of parks , with 70 % of adults indicating that they live within walking distance of a park or playground , parks may be a potential venue for increasing physical activity . This might be particularly important for adolescent girls , whose physical activity levels decline substantially as they go through puberty . The goal of this study was to examine the association between park proximity , park type , and park features and physical activity in adolescent girls . PATIENTS AND METHODS . This was a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls . It included 1556 grade 6 girls who were r and omly selected from 6 middle schools in each of the following 6 field site areas : Washington , DC , and Baltimore , Maryl and ; Columbia , South Carolina ; Minneapolis , Minnesota ; New Orleans , Louisiana ; Tucson , Arizona ; and San Diego , California . Girls wore accelerometers for 6 days to measure metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity , a measure accounting for the volume and intensity of activity . Metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was calculated for the hours outside of school time using 2 different cutpoints , activity levels â¥3.0 metabolic equivalents and â¥4.6 metabolic equivalents , the latter indicating activity at the intensity of a brisk walk or higher . We mapped all of the parks within 1 mile of each girl 's home . Trained staff used a checklist to document the presence of facilities and amenities at each park , including passive amenities , such as drinking fountains , restrooms , and areas with shade , as well as active amenities like basketball courts , multi purpose fields , playgrounds , and tennis courts . RESULTS . Mean nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity , using the 4.6 metabolic equivalent cutoff , was 611.1 minutes ( range : 49.7â4718.6 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days ) and 1704.8 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days ( range : 276.2â5792.6 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days ) when using the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutpoint . Many girls had multiple parks within a 1-mile radius of their homes : 57 % had â¥1 type of park , the majority being neighborhood or community parks ; 42 % had between 1 and 3 parks , 37 % had â¥4 parks , and 14 % had â¥8 parks . The type , number , and specific parks features were associated with girls ' nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity . At the 4.6 metabolic equivalent cutpoint , higher levels of nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity  were associated with both neighborhood and community parks ( 22 metabolic equivalent minutes ) and miniparks ( 40 metabolic equivalent minutes ) . Each park , regardless of type , in the half-mile around each girl 's home was associated with an increase in nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity by 2.8 % or 17.2 nonschool minutes of metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity per 6 days . Beyond a half-mile , each park increased nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity by 1.1 % or 6.7 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days . For the average girl with 3.5 parks within a 1-mile radius of home , the presence of parks accounted for 36.5 extra nonschool metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days , â¼6 % of total nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity . Using the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutpoint , this sums to an additional 68 metabolic equivalent minutes of nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity over 6 days , or 4 % of the total . The most common amenities in the parks were playgrounds , multi purpose fields , and picnic areas . Slightly more than one third of girls lived within a half-mile of a park with a basketball court , and > 20 % had access to walking paths and tennis courts in their local park . Higher levels of nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity per 6 days were associated with walking paths ( 13 metabolic equivalent minutes ) , running tracks ( 82 metabolic equivalent minutes ) , playgrounds ( 28 metabolic equivalent minutes ) , and basketball courts ( 30 metabolic equivalent minutes ) . Parks with streetlights and floodlights were also associated with an increase of 18 and 22 minutes of nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity , respectively . With the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutoff for metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity , additional nonschool metabolic equivalent minutes more than doubled when girls had miniparks ( 92 metabolic equivalent minutes ) , natural re source areas ( 36 metabolic equivalent minutes ) , walking paths ( 59 metabolic equivalent minutes ) , and running tracks ( 208 metabolic equivalent minutes ) within a half-mile of their homes . Skateboard areas and special-use parks were negatively associated with nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity in adolescent girls . CONCLUSIONS . Adolescent girls who live near more parks , particularly near those with amenities that are conducive to walking and with active features , engage in more nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity than those with fewer parks . Whether this is because of actual use of the parks or neighborhood choice could not be determined . Although the magnitude of the association between parks and additional minutes of metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity was small for an individual , amounting to an average of 4%â6 % of a girl 's total nonschool metabolic equivalent â weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity , it is likely to have a large population -level association . Because of the potential population level impact , the use of parks to promote physical activity should be further studiedTitle 3:Objective measures of neighborhood environment and physical activity in older women.Abstract 3:BACKGROUND Regular physical activity is known to help prevent chronic disease and promote healthy aging . Yet , most older women are not regularly active . This study attempts to identify objective ly measured attributes of the neighborhood environment that may be associated with physical activity levels in older women . METHODS Sociodemographics and  physical activity level , as measured by pedometer , were assessed in 158 overweight Caucasian and African-American postmenopausal women from southwestern Pennsylvania at the baseline evaluation of a r and omized clinical trial in 2002 - 2003 .  Geographic information systems technology was used to obtain neighborhood-level data , including  neighborhood socioeconomic status  ( SES ) indicators , the median year that homes were built ( as a proxy measure for urban form ) , and proximity to businesses and facilities . Multiple linear regression was used to test associations between individuals ' physical activity level and neighborhood characteristics . RESULTS After controlling for individual age , race/ethnicity , education , smoking status , and body mass index , indicators of low neighborhood SES , living in a neighborhood with homes built between 1950 and 1969 ( representing an urban form that is more pedestrian-friendly than after 1969 ) , and living within walking distance ( 1500 m ) of specific types of businesses and facilities were positively associated with individuals ' physical activity level measured by pedometer ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that certain aspects of the neighborhood environment may have an important influence on the physical activity levels of postmenopausal women . Results warrant future research to clarify the role of these environmental attributes in other populationTitle 4:Out and about: association of the built environment with physical activity behaviors of adolescent females.Abstract 4:Locational data , logged on portable GPS units and matched with accelerometer data , was used to examine associations of the built environment with physical activity and  sedentary behaviors of adolescent females . In a sample of 293 adolescent females aged 15 to 18 years old in Minneapolis and San Diego , the built environment around each GPS point and its corresponding sedentary , light , and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was examined using r and om intercept multinomial logistic regression models . The odds of higher physical activity intensity ( 3-level outcome : sedentary , light , MVPA ) were higher in places with parks , schools , and high population density , during weekdays , and lower in places with more roads and food outlets . Underst and ing the places where physical activity and sedentary behaviors occur appears to be a promising strategy to clarify relationships and inform policy aim ed at increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviorsTitle 5:Predictors of adoption and maintenance of vigorous physical activity in men and women.Abstract 5:BACKGROUND This study examined predictors of adoption and maintenance of vigorous physical activity over time in a sample of 1,719 r and omly selected women and men . METHODS Based on reported frequency of vigorous exercise in a mail survey at baseline , subjects were classified as sedentary ( zero sessions per week ) , intermediate ( one to two sessions per week ) , or active ( three or more sessions per week ) . RESULTS On the same survey subjects reported on 25 potential determinants of physical activity based on a comprehensive learning model . Twenty-four months later , 85 % of subjects were resurveyed , and their physical activity levels were classified . Within each baseline category and gender subgroup , predictors of follow-up physical activity were identified . In multivariate analyses , adoption of  vigorous exercise by sedentary men was predicted by self-efficacy , age ( inverse ) , and neighborhood environment ( inverse ) . Adoption by sedentary women was predicted by education , self-efficacy , and friend and family support for exercise . Maintenance of vigorous physical activity  was predicted by self-efficacy and age ( inverse ) for initially active men and by education for initially active women . CONCLUSION These results suggest that factors influencing adoption are different for men and women , and there may be different factors influencing adoption versus maintenance of vigorous physical activity","answer":"Our review found that even among studies with objective ly measured physical activity , the association between access to parks and physical activity varied between studies , possibly due to heterogeneity of exposure measurement .Self-reported ( vs. independently-measured ) neighborhood park environment characteristics and smaller ( vs. larger ) buffer sizes were more predictive of physical activity ."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Differences in small molecule binding have been assessed for curated pairs of human to rat orthologs and also for recently diverged human paralogs. Our analysis shows that in general, small molecule binding is conserved for pairs of human to rat orthologs. Using statistical tests, we identified a small number of cases where small molecule binding is different between human and rat, some of which had previously been reported in the literature. Knowledge of species specific pharmacology can be advantageous for drug discovery, where rats are frequently used as a model system. For human paralogs, we demonstrate a global correlation between sequence identity and the binding of small molecules with equivalent affinity. Our findings provide an initial general model relating small molecule binding and sequence divergence, containing the foundations for a general model to anticipate and predict within-target-family selectivity.Introduction:The development of medicinal chemistry lead structures into clinical candidates requires iterative testing in a variety of assays systems and frequently across different mammalian species[1]. In drug discovery, early screens are often performed with recombinant proteins, or human cell-lines heterologously expressing the desired target; later, candidate compounds are typically evaluated in vivo in rats and other species for efficacy and safety pharmacology. Entrance into the clinical stages of drug development then requires a switch to tests in human patients. Understanding the behavior when switching animal model species, for both the desired target mechanism, selectivity, and also for ADMET factors is crucially important. Clearly a more successful drug discovery program will have translatable pharmacology across mammalian taxa- we call this property pharmacological robustness. Pharmacological robustness between different species is limited by differences in the target protein sequence, absorption, drug metabolism and the mode of drug action, which may not be conserved between species or result in different endpoints at a phenotypic[2] level. The underlying process of molecular evolution adds stochastic noise to this transferability of function- neutral drift between orthologs and selective pressures in the evolution of functionally differentiated paralogs[3] create an ensemble of differing binding sites between and within organisms. Within organisms, the selectivity of a compound is determined by its preferential binding to one member of a protein family over other paralogs in that family. Since the process of drug discovery is often organized conceptually around pharmacologically successful gene families( such as nuclear receptors, rhodopsin-like GPCRs, various ion-channel families, and most recently, protein kinases)[4],[5], leveraging known data to develop novel selective chemotypes is of fundamental importance. Hence, understanding small molecule binding in the context of orthologous and paralogous relationships is an essential component for the systematic categorizations of both the ligand and target binding space- this field is typically now known by the term chemogenomics[6]. Chemogenomic studies have previously established a classification of human G-protein-coupled receptors( GPCRs) based on the chemical similarity of their ligands[7]â[9]. The specificity of kinase inhibitors has been evaluated within and across families of protein kinases[10]â[13] and case studies exist that examine the interplay of evolutionary relationship and binding affinity e. g. for cytochrome P450[14] or the highly promiscuous kinase inhibitor staurosporine[15]. This compound owes its large spectrum of susceptible kinases to its interaction with the fundamentally invariant peptide bond backbone of the active site rather than individual residues therein. The amount of publicly available small molecule bioactivity data is increasing and semantically useful annotations of these data are improving[16],[17]. For the first time it is possible to attempt the use of data integration techniques[18]â[20] for the study of ligand binding at a global level among various protein families and across species. The global perspective is challenging, the data available for this type of analysis is heterogeneous and biased for certain target classes, most prominently GPCRs and kinases. Here we report on the integration of literature inhibition and related data( Ki, IC50, EC50) measured against more than one hundred and fifty different human proteins and their rat orthologs, obtained from the ChEMBL data base. Differences in bioactivity were examined in relation to different types of evolutionary relationship( orthology and paralogy) and by comparing protein sequences on three distinct levels, sequence, known/presumed ligand-binding domain and binding site( where known). This comparison is of special importance for cases where selectivity within a gene family is required, and where selectivity needs to be preserved across model organisms( specifically rat-to-human).Discussion:Our analysis shows that differences in ligand binding are significantly larger and more frequent between pairs of paralogs compared to pairs of orthologs. These findings are complementary to a study by Peterson that observed that, at the same level of sequence similarity, structural differences between paralogs are larger compared to orthologs[43]. We confirm, on a global scale, a working hypothesis in the field of medicinal and biological chemistry, intuitively based on the notion that orthologs fulfill the same function in two species while duplicated genes within one species are free to evolve to functional divergence. However, for the first time, we demonstrate this truism with analysis of a large-scale pharmacologically relevant data set. Consistent with our data is that the conservation of ligand binding depends to a large degree on few but crucial mutations in the binding site more than overall sequence identity. Our study demonstrates that the magic methyl paradigm applies not only to ligands but equally to the binding site of a protein, and that crucial substitutions override the underlying correlation of sequence identity and ligand binding. Our study differs from prior chemogenomic studies[44],[45] in its scope, which is global and integrates experimental results from different literature sources. The heterogeneity of the data imposes unknown challenges and requires new approaches to analyzing the data. Different measurement techniques and report formats introduce drastic deviations between single measurements. However, these smooth out from a global point of view, due to the sheer bulk of heterogeneous data. We anticipate a significant increase in the usefulness of global models as more bioactivity becomes available in parseable formats.","answer":"Many drugs are small molecules that specifically bind to proteins involved in disease related processes .

The development of drugs crucially relies on assays that measure the potency of the effect a small molecule exerts on its protein target . We compared the potencies of small molecules measured for human proteins and the corresponding ( orthologous ) protein in rat . Our results suggest that , after subtraction of statistical noise , most human proteins are equally susceptible to small molecule binding as their orthologs in rats . However , we identified a small number of exceptions to this rule , for example the histamine H3 receptor , a protein of the central nervous system . We also compared the potency of small molecules measured against a human protein and another member of the same protein family .

Invitation to screening reduced all-cause mortality significantly according to time-to-event data (hazard ratio: 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-0.99; P = .003) despite no reduction according to dichotomous data (odds ratio [OR]: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.96-1.01; P = .23). Invitation to screening reduced AAA -related mortality significantly (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47-0.93; P = .02) but did not reduce non - AAA -related mortality (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.98-1.02; P = .96). All-cause, AAA -related, and non - AAA -related mortalities were significantly lower in attenders than in nonattenders, in noninvitees, or in both.

The purpose of the study was to find an appropriate animal model that can be used in degradation studies of protein and peptide drugs. Different substrates were used as the relative specific substrates for the determination of aminopeptidase enzymatic activity: 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide of L-alanine for aminopeptidase N, 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide of L-leucine for leucine aminopeptidase, 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide of L-glutamic acid for aminopeptidase A and 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide of L-arginine for aminopeptidase B. The vaginal aminopeptidase enzymatic activity of different species was determined spectrofluorometrically. The inhibition of aminopeptidase activity in the presence of bestatin and puromycin inhibitors was also investigated. The results showed the presence of aminopeptidase enzymatic activity in all vaginal homogenates in the order: sheep > guinea-pig > rabbit > or = human > or = rat. Based on the results of the hydrolysis and inhibition of the 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide substrates, it was difficult to have an exact decision on the aminopeptidase type in the vaginal homogenates from the species studied. It was found that the aminopeptidase activity in rat, rabbit and humans was not statistically different. Therefore, we suggest that rats and rabbits could be used as model animals for vaginal enzymatic activity studies and for determination of the degradation of protein and peptide drugs in the vagina.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"L-leucine\\", \\"L-alanine\\", \\"bestatin\\", \\"leucine\\", \\"4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide\\", \\"L-glutamic acid\\", \\"L-arginine\\", \\"puromycin\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"aminopeptidase B\\", \\"aminopeptidase\\", \\"aminopeptidases\\", \\"leucine aminopeptidase\\", \\"vaginal aminopeptidase\\", \\"aminopeptidase A\\", \\"aminopeptidase N\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

To overcome the challenge of formalizing what stimulus features should modulate single voxel responses, we introduce a general approach for making directly testable predictions of single voxel responses to statistically adapted representations of ecologically valid stimuli. These representations are learned from unlabeled data without supervision. Our approach is validated using a parsimonious computational model of( i) how early visual cortical representations are adapted to statistical regularities in natural images and( ii) how populations of these representations are pooled by single voxels. This computational model is used to predict single voxel responses to natural images and identify natural images from stimulus-evoked multiple voxel responses. We show that statistically adapted low-level sparse and invariant representations of natural images better span the space of early visual cortical representations and can be more effectively exploited in stimulus identification than hand-designed Gabor wavelets. Our results demonstrate the potential of our approach to better probe unknown cortical representations.Introduction:An important goal of contemporary cognitive neuroscience is to characterize the relationship between stimulus features and human brain activity. This relationship can be studied from two distinct but complementary perspectives of encoding and decoding[1]. The encoding perspective is concerned with how certain aspects of the environment are stored in the brain and uses models that predict brain activity in response to certain stimulus features. Conversely, the decoding perspective uses models that predict specific stimulus features from stimulus-evoked brain activity and is concerned with how specific aspects of the environment are retrieved from the brain. Stimulus-response relationships have been extensively studied in computational neuroscience to understand the information contained in individual or ensemble neuronal responses, based on different coding schemes[2]. The invasive nature of the measurement techniques of these studies has restricted human subjects to particular patient populations[3],[4]. However, with the advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging( fMRI), encoding and decoding in fMRI has made it possible to noninvasively characterize the relationship between stimulus features and human brain activity via localized changes in blood-oxygen-level dependent( BOLD) hemodynamic responses to sensory or cognitive stimulation[5]. Encoding models that predict single voxel responses to certain stimulus features typically comprise two main components. The first component is a( non) linear transformation from a stimulus space to a feature space. The second component is a( non) linear transformation from the feature space to a voxel space. Encoding models can be used to test alternative hypotheses about what a voxel represents since any encoding model embodies a specific hypothesis about what stimulus features modulate the response of the voxel[5]. Furthermore, encoding models can be converted to decoding models that predict specific stimulus features from stimulus-evoked multiple voxel responses. In particular, decoding models can be used to determine the specific class from which the stimulus was drawn( i. e. classification)[6],[7], identify the correct stimulus from a set of novel stimuli( i. e. identification)[8],[9] or create a literal picture of the stimulus( i. e. reconstruction)[10]â[12]. The conventional approach to encoding and decoding makes use of feature spaces that are typically hand-designed by theorists or experimentalists[8],[9],[11],[13]â[16]. However, this approach is prone to the influence of subjective biases and restricted to a priori hypotheses. As a result, it severely restricts the scope of alternative hypotheses that can be formulated about what a voxel represents. This restriction is evident by a paucity of models that adequately characterize extrastriate visual cortical voxels. A recent trend in models of visual population codes has been the adoption of natural images for the characterization of voxels that respond to visual stimulation[8],[13]. The motivation behind this trend is that natural images admit multiple feature spaces such as low-level edges, mid-level edge junctions, high-level object parts and complete objects that can modulate single voxel responses[5]. Implicit about this motivation is the assumption that the brain is adapted to the statistical regularities in the environment[17] such as those in natural images[18],[19]. At the same time, recent developments in theoretical neuroscience and machine learning have shown that normative and predictive models of natural image statistics learn statistically adapted representations of natural images. As a result, they predict statistically adapted visual cortical representations, based on different coding principles. Some of these predictions have been shown to be similar to what is found in the primary visual cortex such as topographically organized simple and complex cell receptive fields[20]. Building on previous studies of visual population codes and natural image statistics, we introduce a general approach for making directly testable predictions of single voxel responses to statistically adapted representations of ecologically valid stimuli. To validate our approach, we use a parsimonious computational model that comprises two main components( Figure 1). The first component is a nonlinear feature model that transforms raw stimuli to stimulus features. In particular, the feature model learns the transformation from unlabeled data without supervision. The second component is a linear voxel model that transforms the stimulus features to voxel responses. We use an fMRI data set of voxel responses to natural images that were acquired from the early visual areas( i. e. V1, V2 and V3) of two subjects( i. e. S1 and S2)[21]. We show that the encoding and decoding performance of this computational model is significantly better than that of a hand-designed Gabor wavelet pyramid( GWP) model of phase-invariant complex cells. The software that implements our approach is provided at http://www. ccnlab. net/research/.Discussion:This study addresses the question of how to model feature spaces to better predict brain activity. We introduced a general approach for making directly testable predictions of single voxel responses to statistically adapted representations of ecologically valid stimuli. Our approach relies on unsupervised learning of a feature model followed by supervised learning of a voxel model. To benchmark our approach against the conventional approach that makes use of predefined feature spaces, we compared a two-layer sparse coding model of simple and complex cells with a Gabor wavelet pyramid model of phase-invariant complex cells. While the GWP model is the fundamental building block of many state-of-the-art encoding and decoding models, the GWP2 model was found to be significantly outperformed by the SC2 model. We used control models to determine the contribution of the different components of the SC2 and GWP2 models to this performance difference. Analyses revealed that the SC2 model better accounts for both the representations and the nonlinearities of the voxels in the early visual areas than the GWP2 model. Given that the representations of the SC2 model are qualitatively similar to those of the GWP model, their contribution to this performance difference suggests that the SC model automatically learns an optimal set of spatially localized, oriented and bandpass representations that better span the space of early visual cortical representations since it adapts to the same statistical regularities in the environment as the brain is assumed to be adapted to[20]. Our approach eliminates the need for predefining feature spaces. However, the SC model does have a number of free parameters( e. g. patch size, number of simple and complex cells, etc.) that must either be specified by hand or using model selection methods such as cross-validation. Because of computational considerations, we used the same free parameters as those in[22]. While the choice of these free parameters can influence what the SC model can learn, the SC2 model was shown to outperform the GWP2 model even without cross-validation. Next to cross-validation, other methods that also infer these free parameters can further improve the performance of the SC2 model. One method is to first estimate voxel receptive fields using any approach and then use these estimates as free parameters( e. g. voxel receptive field eccentricity as patch size) of voxel-specific feature models. Another method is to use more sophisticated nonparametric Bayesian sparse factor models[40] that can simultaneously learn sparse representations while inferring their number. Furthermore, our approach included only feedforward projections such that representations and responses were solely determined by stimuli. However, taking top-down modulatory effects into account is essential to adequately characterize how sensory information is represented and processed in the brain. For example, attention has been shown to warp semantic representations across the human brain[41], and prior expectations have been shown to bias sensory representations in visual cortex[42]. Extensions of our approach that include feedback projections can be used to address the question of how representations and responses are influenced by top-down processes. Further extensions of our approach can be used to probe mid- to high-level extrastriate visual cortical representations in a fully automated manner. In particular, the SC model can be replaced by highly nonlinear multi-layer statistical models of natural images that learn hierarchical feature spaces( i. e. deep learning[43]). Some of the feature spaces that are learned by these models such as mid-level edge junctions have been shown to match well with neural response functions in area V2[44]. Models that learn even higher-level representations such as high-level object parts[45] or complete objects[46] can be used to probe extrastriate visual cortical representations. For example, heterogenous hierarchical convolutional neural networks have been shown to predict the representational dissimilarity matrices that characterize representations in human inferior temporal gyrus[47]. Similar models have been shown to learn feature spaces that are admitted by stimulus sets other than natural images, both within the visual modality( e. g. natural movies[48]) as well as in other modalities( e. g. auditory or somatosensory[49]). These models can be used to probe cortical representations in different sensory modalities. One approach to estimate deep models is to maximize the likelihood of all layers at the same time. However, this approach is not scalable and requires the computation of intractable partition functions that are impossible to integrate analytically and computationally expensive to integrate numerically. Nevertheless, methods such as score-matching[50] and noise-contrastive estimation[51] have been used to estimate unnormalized nonlinear multi-layer statistical models of natural images[52],[53]. An alternative approach is to use models such as deep belief networks that comprise multiple layers of restricted Boltzmann machines. These models can be scaled by convolution[45] and estimated by maximizing the likelihood of one layer at a time, using the output of each layer as input for the subsequent layer[54]. Importantly, generative models such as deep belief networks make it possible to sample stimuli based on internal network states. Conditioning these internal network states on stimulus-evoked brain activity results in a generative approach to decoding. For example, we have previously shown that a deep belief network that comprise multiple layers of conditional restricted Boltzmann machines can reconstruct handwritten digits by sampling from the model after conditioning it on stimulus-evoked multiple voxel responses[55]. While introducing a new approach to probe cortical representations, this study complements other developments in encoding and decoding. For example, encoding models that involve computations to account for contrast saturation or heterogeneous contrast energy were shown to improve prediction of single voxel responses to visual stimuli[16]. At the same time, these modeling efforts go hand in hand with developments in fMRI such as the improvements in contrast-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution that are facilitated by increases in magnetic field strength[56]. For example, spatial features of orientation-selective columns in humans were demonstrated by using high-field fMRI[57]. Jointly, such developments can provide novel insights into how cortical representations are learned, encoded and transformed. In conclusion, we introduced a general approach that improves prediction of human brain activity in response to natural images. Our approach primarily relies on unsupervised learning of transformations of raw stimuli to representations that span the space of cortical representations. These representations can also be effectively exploited in stimulus classification, identification or reconstruction. Taken together, unsupervised feature learning heralds new ways to characterize the relationship between stimulus features and human brain activity.","answer":"An important but difficult problem in contemporary cognitive neuroscience is to find what stimulus features best drive responses in the human brain .

Yet, in order to achieve real-world acceptance, both qualities are fundamentally essential. We present a unique approach to achieve inexpensive and robust autonomous and semi-autonomous assistive navigation for existing fielded wheelchairs, of which there are approximately 5 million units in Canada and United States alone. Our prototype wheelchair platform is capable of localization and mapping, as well as robust obstacle avoidance, using only a commodity RGB-D sensor and wheel odometry. As a specific example of the navigation capabilities, we focus on the single most common navigation problem: the traversal of narrow doorways in arbitrary environments. The software we have developed is generalizable to corridor following, desk docking, and other navigation tasks that are either extremely difficult or impossible for people with upper-body mobility impairments.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: This paper proposes a solution to the cross-a-door problem in unknown environments for a robotic wheelchair commanded through a Human-Machine Interface (HMI). The problem is solved by a dynamic path planning algorithm implementation based on successive frontier points determination. An adaptive trajectory tracking control based on the dynamic model of the robotic wheelchair is implemented on the vehicle to direct the wheelchair motion along the path in a smooth movement. An EKF feature-based SLAM is also implemented on the vehicle which gives an estimate of the wheelchair pose inside the environment. The SLAM allows the map reconstruction of the environment for safe navigation purposes. The whole system steers satisfactorily the wheelchair with smooth movements through common doorways which are narrow considering the size of the vehicle. Implementation results validating the proposal are also shown in this work.","answer":"One possible alternative to visual sensing is to employ active scanning devices.

or - none ; while p5abc has an intermediate state @xcite .interestingly , we note that , p5abc@xmath63 although has been observed as two - state molecule in the experiment , a weaker intermediate state presents in the constant extension ensemble , while it can not be observed in the constant force ensemble .if we purchase the precision of our methods , quantitative comparison between the theoretical molecular unfolding force @xmath72 and the experimental measurements of course is essential .but we find that they do not coincide : in the constant extension ensemble , the experimental unfolding force of p5ab is @xmath73 pn , of p5abc@xmath74a is @xmath75 pn . and of p5abc is @xmath76 pn @xcite ; while our calculations are @xmath77 pn , @xmath78 pn and @xmath79 pn , respectively .so what causes result to the larger differences between the experiment and the theory ?the experiment and previous theoretical works contributed the differences to the change of free energy of the rna secondary structure ; this change results from the different ionic concentration of the experiment and the standard condition : in the rna unfolding experiment , @xmath80 mm and with and without @xmath81 mm @xcite . to reproduce the experimental ionic condition ,a correction on the energy of a base pair equal to @xmath82 + 3.3[mg^{2+}]^{1/2}) ] has been applied @xcite .their values are summarized in tab .[ table ] . besides the three molecules from ref .@xcite , other unfolding forces of the molecules published in the lectures @xcite are also listed there .we still see that the ionic correction can not explain the derivation between the theory and experiment .    considering that the free energy parameters of the rna secondary structure were measured in bulk experiments, one might doubt whether they can be used in single - molecule studies as well as we thought before @xcite . on the other hand, however , it is known that the mechanical parameter , the persistent length @xmath29 is also sensitive to ionic condition .although this parameter indeed were measured under a similar experimental conditions with the small rna unfolding experiment ( see ref .@xcite ) , their validity for describing small molecules is questionable .recent fret experiment measured that for shorter ssdna @xmath29 is about 2.2 nm at @xmath80 mm @xcite . if we choose this value in our calculation , the predicted unfolding forces are closer with the experimental measurements ; see tab .[ table ] . of course, we can not exclude the intrinsic limitation of our coarse - grain model .for example , another possible force work formula has been used in the constant force ensemble @xcite .in this work , we review the monte carlo methods and develop the exact numerical methods to study the force stretching single rna molecules issue .we respectively compare the two independent method in the constant force and extension ensembles , and find that they agree with each other quite well .we also point out that only ionic correction on the rna secondary structure alone can not explain the larger discrepancies of the unfolding forces between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurement ; the ionic correction on the rna molecular mechanical properties should be important .although the results of the exact numerical method are consistent with the monte carlo method when force stretches single rna in equilibrium , it does not mean the former can completely replace the later .such situation is similar with the study of 2-dimension ising model in condense matter physics @xcite . compared to the exact method, the monte carlo method would be more sophisticate in dealing possible more complicated experimental condition .for instance , recent simulation work could include pseduknots structure @xcite , while the exact partition function technique would be hardly to realize . in our point of view, monte carlo simulation is more important in studying single molecular non -

This review focuses on exploring various host resilience mechanisms that could be exploited for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other respiratory viruses that cause acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Text: The 21st century was heralded with the emergence of two novel coronaviruses (CoV) that have unusually high pathogenicity and mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) was first identified in 2003 [6] [7] [8] [9] . While there was initially great concern about SARS-CoV, once no new cases emerged, funding and research decreased. However, a decade later Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), also known as HCoV-EMC, emerged initially in Saudi Arabia [3, 10] . SARS-CoV infected about 8000 people, and resulted in the deaths of approximately 10% of those infected [11] . While MERS-CoV is not as widespread as SARS-CoV, it appears to have an even higher mortality rate, with 35-50% of diagnosed infections resulting in death [3, [12] [13] . These deadly betacoronavirus viruses existed in animal reservoirs [4] [5] 9, [14] [15] . Recently, other CoVs have been detected in animal populations raising the possibility that we will see a repeat of these types of outbreaks in the near future [11, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Both these zoonotic viruses cause a much more severe disease than what is typically seen for CoVs, making them a global health concern. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV result in severe lung pathology. Many infected patients have acute lung injury (ALI), a condition that is diagnosed based on the presence of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure without a cardiac cause. In some patients there is a progression to the more severe form of ALI, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [21] [22] [23] . In order to survive a given infection, a successful host must not only be able to clear the pathogen, but tolerate damage caused by the pathogen itself and also by the host's immune response [24] [25] [26] . We refer to resilience as the ability of a host to tolerate the effects of pathogens and the immune response to pathogens. A resilient host is able to return to a state of health after responding to an infection [24, [27] [28] . Most currently available treatment options for infectious diseases are antimicrobials, For reprint orders, please contact: reprints@futuremedicine.com REviEW Jamieson future science group and thus target the pathogen itself. Given the damage that pathogens can cause this focus on rapid pathogen clearance is understandable. However, an equally important medical intervention is to increase the ability of the host to tolerate the direct and indirect effects of the pathogen, and this is an area that is just beginning to be explored [29] . Damage to the lung epithelium by respiratory pathogens is a common cause of decreased resilience [30] [31] [32] . This review explores some of the probable host resilience pathways to viral infections, with a particular focus on the emerging coronaviruses. We will also examine factors that make some patients disease tolerant and other patients less tolerant to the viral infection. These factors can serve as a guide to new potential therapies for improved patient care. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are typified by a rapid progression to ARDS, however, there are some distinct differences in the infectivity and pathogenicity. The two viruses have different receptors leading to different cellular tropism, and SARS-CoV is more ubiquitous in the cell type and species it can infect. SARS-CoV uses the ACE2 receptor to gain entry to cells, while MERS-CoV uses the ectopeptidase DPP4 [33] [34] [35] [36] . Unlike SARS-CoV infection, which causes primarily a severe respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV infection can also lead to kidney failure [37, 38] . SARS-CoV also spreads more rapidly between hosts, while MERS-CoV has been more easily contained, but it is unclear if this is due to the affected patient populations and regions [3] [4] 39 ]. Since MERS-CoV is a very recently discovered virus, [40, 41] more research has been done on SARS-CoV. However, given the similarities it is hoped that some of these findings can also be applied to MERS-CoV, and other potential emerging zoonotic coronaviruses. Both viral infections elicit a very strong inflammatory response, and are also able to circumvent the immune response. There appears to be several ways that these viruses evade and otherwise redirect the immune response [1, [42] [43] [44] [45] . The pathways that lead to the induction of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response are common targets of many viruses, and coronaviruses are no exception. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are contained in double membrane vesicles (DMVs), that prevents sensing of its genome [1, 46] . As with most coronaviruses several viral proteins suppress the type I IFN response, and other aspects of innate antiviral immunity [47] . These alterations of the type I IFN response appear to play a role in immunopathology in more than one way. In patients with high initial viral titers there is a poor prognosis [39, 48] . This indicates that reduction of the antiviral response may lead to direct viral-induced pathology. There is also evidence that the delayed type I IFN response can lead to misregulation of the immune response that can cause immunopathology. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the type I IFN response is delayed [49] . The delay of this potent antiviral response leads to decreased viral clearance, at the same time there is an increase in inflammatory cells of the immune system that cause excessive immunopathology [49] . In this case, the delayed antiviral response not only causes immunopathology, it also fails to properly control the viral replication. While more research is needed, it appears that MERS has a similar effect on the innate immune response [5, 50] . The current treatment and prevention options for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are limited. So far there are no licensed vaccines for SAR-CoV or MERS-CoV, although several strategies have been tried in animal models [51, 52] . There are also no antiviral strategies that are clearly effective in controlled trials. During outbreaks several antiviral strategies were empirically tried, but these uncontrolled studies gave mixed results [5, 39] . The main antivirals used were ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir [38, 53] . These were often used in combination with IFN therapy [54] . However, retrospective analysis of these data has not led to clear conclusions of the efficacy of these treatment options. Research in this area is still ongoing and it is hoped that we will soon have effective strategies to treat novel CoV [3,36,38,40, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . The lack of effective antivirals makes it necessary to examine other potential treatments for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Even if there were effective strategies to decrease viral burden, for these viruses, the potential for new emerging zoonotic CoVs presents additional complications. Vaccines cannot be produced in time to stop the spread of an emerging virus. In addition, as was demonstrated during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks, there is always a challenge during a crisis situation to know which Host resilience to emerging coronaviruses REviEW future science group www.futuremedicine.com antiviral will work on a given virus. One method of addressing this is to develop broad-spectrum antivirals that target conserved features of a given class of virus [65] . However, given the fast mutation rates of viruses there are several challenges to this strategy. Another method is to increase the ability of a given patient to tolerate the disease, i.e., target host resilience mechanisms. So far this has largely been in the form of supportive care, which relies on mechanical ventilation and oxygenation [29, 39, 66] . Since SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were discovered relatively recently there is a lack of both patient and experimental data. However, many other viruses cause ALI and ARDS, including influenza A virus (IAV). By looking at data from other high pathology viruses we can extrapolate various pathways that could be targeted during infection with these emerging CoVs. This can add to our understanding of disease resilience mechanisms that we have learned from direct studies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Increased understanding of host resilience mechanisms can lead to future host-based therapies that could increase patient survival [29] . One common theme that emerges in many respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is that much of the pathology is due to an excessive inflammatory response. A study from Josset et al. examines the cell host response to both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and discovered that MERS-CoV dysregulates the host transcriptome to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV [67] . It demonstrates that glucocorticoids may be a potential way of altering the changes in the host transcriptome at late time points after infection. If host gene responses are maintained this may increase disease resilience. Given the severe disease that manifested during the SARS-CoV outbreak, many different treatment options were empirically tried on human patients. One immunomodulatory treatment that was tried during the SARS-CoV outbreak was systemic corticosteroids. This was tried with and without the use of type I IFNs and other therapies that could directly target the virus [68] . Retrospective analysis revealed that, when given at the correct time and to the appropriate patients, corticosteroid use could decrease mortality and also length of hospital stays [68] . In addition, there is some evidence that simultaneous treatment with IFNs could increase the potential benefits [69] . Although these treatments are not without complications, and there has been a lack of a randomized controlled trial [5, 39] . Corticosteroids are broadly immunosuppressive and have many physiological effects [5, 39] . Several recent studies have suggested that other compounds could be useful in increasing host resilience to viral lung infections. A recent paper demonstrates that topoisomerase I can protect against inflammation-induced death from a variety of viral infections including IAV [70] . Blockade of C5a complement signaling has also been suggested as a possible option in decreasing inflammation during IAV infection [71] . Other immunomodulators include celecoxib, mesalazine and eritoran [72, 73] . Another class of drugs that have been suggested are statins. They act to stabilize the activation of aspects of the innate immune response and prevent excessive inflammation [74] . However, decreasing immunopathology by immunomodulation is problematic because it can lead to increased pathogen burden, and thus increase virus-induced pathology [75, 76] . Another potential treatment option is increasing tissue repair pathways to increase host resilience to disease. This has been shown by bioinformatics [77] , as well as in several animal models [30-31,78-79]. These therapies have been shown in cell culture model systems or animal models to be effective, but have not been demonstrated in human patients. The correct timing of the treatments is essential. Early intervention has been shown to be the most effective in some cases, but other therapies work better when given slightly later during the course of the infection. As the onset of symptoms varies slightly from patient to patient the need for precise timing will be a challenge. Examination of potential treatment options for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should include consideration of host resilience [29] . In addition to the viral effects, and the pathology caused by the immune response, there are various comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that lead to adverse outcomes. Interestingly, these additional risk factors that lead to a more severe disease are different between the two viruses. It is unclear if these differences are due to distinct populations affected by the viruses, because of properties of the virus themselves, or both. Understanding these factors could be a key to increasing host resilience to the infections. MERS-CoV patients had increased morbidity and mortality if they were obese, immunocompromised, diabetic or had cardiac disease [4, 12] . REviEW Jamieson future science group Risk factors for SARS-CoV patients included an older age and male [39] . Immune factors that increased mortality for SARS-CoV were a higher neutrophil count and low T-cell counts [5, 39, 77] . One factor that increased disease for patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was infection with other viruses or bacteria [5, 39] . This is similar to what is seen with many other respiratory infections. A recent study looking at malaria infections in animal models and human patients demonstrated that resilient hosts can be predicted [28] . Clinical studies have started to correlate specific biomarkers with disease outcomes in ARDS patients [80] . By understanding risk factors for disease severity we can perhaps predict if a host may be nonresilient and tailor the treatment options appropriately. A clear advantage of targeting host resilience pathways is that these therapies can be used to treat a variety of different infections. In addition, there is no need to develop a vaccine or understand the antiviral susceptibility of a new virus. Toward this end, understanding why some patients or patient populations have increased susceptibility is of paramount importance. In addition, a need for good model systems to study responses to these new emerging coronaviruses is essential. Research into both these subjects will lead us toward improved treatment of emerging viruses that cause ALI, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Though there are abundant datasets annotated with event relations for story comprehension, many have no empirical results associated with them. In this work, we establish strong baselines for event temporal relation extraction on two under-explored story narrative datasets: Richer Event Description (RED) and Causal and Temporal Relation Scheme (CaTeRS). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results reported on these two datasets. We demonstrate that neural network-based models can outperform some strong traditional linguistic feature-based models. We also conduct comparative studies to show the contribution of adopting contextualized word embeddings (BERT) for event temporal relation extraction from stories. Detailed analyses are offered to better understand the results.IntroductionEvent temporal relation understanding is a major component of story/narrative comprehension. It is an important natural language understanding (NLU) task with broad applications to downstream tasks such as story understanding BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , question answering BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , and text summarization BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 .The goal of event temporal relation extraction is to build a directed graph where nodes correspond to events, and edges reflect temporal relations between the events. Figure FIGREF1 illustrates an example of such a graph for the text shown above. Different types of edges specify different temporal relations: the event assassination is before slaughtered, slaughtered is included in rampage, and the relation between rampage and war is vague.Modeling event temporal relations is crucial for story/narrative understanding and storytelling, because a story is typically composed of a sequence of events BIBREF7 . Several story corpora are thus annotated with various event-event relations to understand commonsense event knowledge. CaTeRS BIBREF8 is created by annotating 320 five-sentence stories sampled from ROCStories BIBREF7 dataset. RED BIBREF9 contains annotations of rich relations between event pairs for storyline understanding, including co-reference and partial co-reference relations, temporal; causal, and sub-event relations.Despite multiple productive research threads on temporal and causal relation modeling among events BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 and event relation annotation for story understanding BIBREF8 , the intersection of these two threads seems flimsy. To the best of our knowledge, no event relation extraction results have been reported on CaTeRS and RED.We apply neural network models that leverage recent advances in contextualized embeddings (BERT BIBREF13 ) to event-event relation extraction tasks for CaTeRS and RED. Our goal in this paper is to increase understanding of how well the state-of-the-art event relation models work for story/narrative comprehension.In this paper, we report the first results of event temporal relation extraction on two under-explored story comprehension datasets: CaTeRS and RED. We establish strong baselines with neural network models enhanced by recent breakthrough of contextualized embeddings, BERT BIBREF13 . We summarize the contributions of the paper as follows:ModelsWe investigate both neural network-based models and traditional feature-based models. We briefly introduce them in this section.Datais created by annotating 1600 sentences of 320 five-sentence stories sampled from ROCStories BIBREF7 dataset. CaTeRS contains both temporal and causal relations in an effort to understand and predict commonsense relations between events.As demonstrated in Table TABREF16 , we split all stories into 220 training and 80 test. We do not construct the development set because the dataset is small. Note that some relations have compounded labels such as âCAUSE_BEFOREâ, âENABLE_BEFOREâ, etc. We only take the temporal portion of the annotations.annotates a wide range of relations of event pairs including their coreference and partial coreference relations, and temporal, causal and subevent relationships. We split data according to the standard train, development, test sets, and only focus on the temporal relations.The common issue of these two datasets is that they are not densely annotated â not every pair of events is annotated with a relation. We provide one way to handle negative (unannotated) pairs in this paper. When constructing negative examples, we take all event pairs that occur within the same or neighboring sentences with no annotations, labeling them as âNONEâ. The negative to positive samples ratio is 1.00 and 11.5 for CaTeRS and RED respectively. Note that RED data has much higher negative ratio (as shown in Table TABREF16 ) because it contains longer articles, more complicated sentence structures, and richer entity types than CaTeRS where all stories consist of 5 (mostly short) sentences.In both the development and test sets, we add all negative pairs as candidates for the relation prediction. During training, the number of negative pairs we add is based on a hyper-parameter that we tune to control the negative-to-positive sample ratio.To justify our decision of selecting negative pairs within the same or neighboring sentences, we show the distribution of distances across positive sentence pairs in Table TABREF18 . Although CaTeRS data has pair distance more evenly distributed than RED, we observe that the vast majority (85.87% and 93.99% respectively) of positive pairs have sentence distance less than or equal to one.To handle negative pairs that are more than two sentences away, we automatically predict all out-of-window pairs as âNONEâ. This means that some positive pairs will be automatically labeled as negative pairs. Since the percentage of out-of-window positive pairs is small, we believe the impact on performance is small. We can investigate expanding the prediction window in future research, but the trade-off is that we will get more negative pairs that are hard to predict.Implementation DetailsCAEVO consists of both linguistic-rule-based sieves and feature-based trainable sieves. We train CAEVO sieves with our train set and evaluate them on both dev and test sets. CAEVO is an end-to-end system that automatically annotates both events and relations. In order to resolve label annotation mismatch between CAEVO and our gold data, we create our own final input files to CAEVO system. Default parameter settings are used when running the CAEVO system.In an effort of building a general model and reducing the number of hand-crafted features, we leverage pre-trained (GloVe 300) embeddings in place of linguistic features. The only linguistic feature we use in our experiment is token distance. We notice in our experiments that hidden layer size, dropout ratio and negative sample ratio impact model performance significantly. We conduct grid search to find the best hyper-parameter combination according to the performance of the development set.Note that since the CaTeRS data is small and there is no standard train, development, and test splits, we conduct cross-validation on training data to choose the best hyper-parameters and predict on test. For RED data, the standard train, development, test splits are used.As we mentioned briefly in the introduction, using BERT output as word embeddings could provide an additional performance boost in our NN architecture. We pre-process our raw data by feeding original sentences into a pre-trained BERT model and output the last layer of BERT as token representations. In this experiment, we fix the negative sample ratio according to the result obtained from the previous step and only search for the best hidden layer size and dropout ratio.Result and AnalysisTable TABREF25 contains the best hyper-parameters and Table TABREF26 contains micro-average F1 scores for both datasets on dev and test sets. We only consider positive pairs, i.e. correct predictions on NONE pairs are excluded for evaluation. In general, the baseline model CAEVO is outperformed by both NN models, and NN model with BERT embedding achieves the greatest performance. We now provide more detailed analysis and discussion for each dataset.Temporal Relation DataCollecting dense TempRel corpora with event pairs fully annotated has been reported challenging since annotators could easily overlook some pairs BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF10 . TimeBank BIBREF20 is an example with events and their relations annotated sparsely. TB-Dense dataset mitigates this issue by forcing annotators to examine all pairs of events within the same or neighboring sentences. However, densely annotated datasets are relatively small both in terms of number of documents and event pairs, which restricts the complexity of machine learning models used in previous research.Feature-based ModelsThe series of TempEval competitions BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 have attracted many research interests in predicting event temporal relations. Early attempts by BIBREF24 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF25 , BIBREF26 only use pair-wise classification models. State-of-the-art local methods, such as ClearTK BIBREF27 , UTTime BIBREF28 , and NavyTime BIBREF29 improve on earlier work by feature engineering with linguistic and syntactic rules. As we mention in the Section 2, CAEVO is the current state-of-the-art system for feature-based temporal event relation extraction BIBREF10 . It's widely used as the baseline for evaluating TB-Dense data. We adopt it as our baseline for evaluating CaTeRS and RED datasets. Additionally, several models BramsenDLB2006, ChambersJ2008, DoLuRo12, NingWuRo18, P18-1212 have successfully incorporated global inference to impose global prediction consistency such as temporal transitivity.Neural Network ModelNeural network-based methods have been employed for event temporal relation extraction BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF12 which achieved impressive results. However, the dataset they focus on is TB-Dense. We have explored neural network models on CaTeRS and RED, which are more related to story narrative understanding and generation.In our NN model, we also leverage Bidrectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) BIBREF30 which has shown significant improvement in many NLP tasks by allowing fine-tuning of pre-trained language representations. Unlike the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) BIBREF31 , BERT uses a biderctional Transformer BIBREF32 instead of a unidirectional (left-to-right) Transformer to incorporate context from both directions. As mentioned earlier, we do not fine-tune BERT in our experiments and simply leverage the last layer as our contextualized word representations.ConclusionWe established strong baselines for two story narrative understanding datasets: CaTeRS and RED. We have shown that neural network-based models can outperform feature-based models with wide margins, and we conducted an ablation study to show that contextualized representation learning can boost performance of NN models. Further research can focus on more systematic study or build stronger NN models over the same datasets used in this work. Exploring possibilities to directly apply temporal relation extraction to enhance performance of story generation systems is another promising research direction.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, as well as the members of the USC PLUS lab for their early feedback.

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spikeâs receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection. Text: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronavirdiae, order Nidovirales. There are four genera of CoVs, namely, Alphacoronavirus (Î±CoV), Betacoronavirus (Î²CoV), Deltacoronavirus (Î´CoV), and Gammacoronavirus (Î³CoV) [1] . Evolutionary analyses have shown that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most Î±CoVs and Î²CoVs, while avian species are the gene sources of most Î´CoVs and Î³CoVs. CoVs have repeatedly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens. The best-known examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) which emerged in China in 2002-2003 to cause a large-scale epidemic with about 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) which has caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 [2, 3] . In both of these epidemics, these viruses have likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host [the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) for MERS-CoV] before crossing species barriers to infect humans. Prior to December 2019, 6 CoVs were known to infect human, including 2 Î±CoV (HCoV-229E and HKU-NL63) and 4 Î²CoV (HCoV-OC43 [ HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and elderly [4] . In contrast, SARS-CoV (lineage B Î²CoV) and MERS-CoV (lineage C Î²CoV) may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as diarrhea, lymphopenia, deranged liver and renal function tests, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of â¼10% and â¼35%, respectively [5, 6] . On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [7] . Subsequent virological testing showed that a novel CoV was detected in these patients. As of 16 January 2020, 43 patients have been diagnosed to have infection with this novel CoV, including two exported cases of mild pneumonia in Thailand and Japan [8, 9] . The earliest date of symptom onset was 1 December 2019 [10] . The symptomatology of these patients included fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea. Among 41 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan, 13 (32%) required intensive care and 6 (15%) died. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computerized tomography scans [10] . We recently reported a familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection in a Shenzhen family with travel history to Wuhan [11] . In the present study, we analyzed a 2019-nCoV complete genome from a patient in this familial cluster and compared it with the genomes of related Î²CoVs to provide insights into the potential source and control strategies. The complete genome sequence of 2019-nCoV HKU-SZ-005b was available at GenBank (accession no. MN975262) ( Table 1 ). The representative complete genomes of other related Î²CoVs strains collected from human or mammals were included for comparative analysis. These included strains collected from human, bats, and Himalayan palm civet between 2003 and 2018, with one 229E coronavirus strain as the outgroup. Phylogenetic tree construction by the neighbour joining method was performed using MEGA X software, with bootstrap values being calculated from 1000 trees [12] . The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) was shown next to the branches [13] . The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and were in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site [14] . All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [15] . Multiple alignment was performed using CLUSTAL 2.1 and further visualized using BOX-SHADE 3.21. Structural analysis of orf8 was performed using PSI-blast-based secondary structure PREDiction (PSIPRED) [16] . For the prediction of protein secondary structure including beta sheet, alpha helix, and coil, initial amino acid sequences were input and analysed using neural networking and its own algorithm. Predicted structures were visualized and highlighted on the BOX-SHADE alignment. Prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using the TMHMM 2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Secondary structure prediction in the 5 â² -untranslated region (UTR) and 3 â² -UTR was performed using the RNAfold WebServer (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/ RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) with minimum free energy (MFE) and partition function in Fold algorithms and Table 2 .

Putative function/domain Amino acid position Putative cleave sitecomplex with nsp3 and 6: DMV formationcomplex with nsp3 and 4: DMV formationshort peptide at the end of orf1a basic options. The human SARS-CoV 5 â² -and 3 â² -UTR were used as references to adjust the prediction results. The single-stranded RNA genome of the 2019-nCoV was 29891 nucleotides in size, encoding 9860 amino acids. The G + C content was 38%. Similar to other (Table 2 ). There are no remarkable differences between the orfs and nsps of 2019-nCoV with those of SARS-CoV (Table 3) . The major distinction between SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV is in orf3b, Spike and orf8 but especially variable in Spike S1 and orf8 which were previously shown to be recombination hot spots. Spike glycoprotein comprised of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP). We found that the S2 subunit of 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV (Figure 2 ). Thus the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 would be an important preventive and treatment modality for testing in animal models before clinical trials [18] . Though the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV (Figure 3(A) ), the core domain of RBD (excluding the external subdomain) are highly conserved (Figure 3(B) ). Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction with the host receptor. Further investigation of this soluble variable external subdomain region will reveal its receptor usage, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis. Unlike 2019-nCoV and human SARS-CoV, most known bat SARSr-CoVs have two stretches of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) when compared with that of human SARS-CoV. But some Yunnan strains such as the WIV1 had no such deletions and can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor.  It is interesting to note that the two bat SARS-related coronavirus ZXC21 and ZC45, being closest to 2019-nCoV, can infect suckling rats and cause inflammation in the brain tissue, and pathological changes in lung & intestine. However, these two viruses could not be isolated in Vero E6 cells and were not investigated further. The two retained deletion sites in the Spike genes of ZXC21 and ZC45 may lessen their likelihood of jumping species barriers imposed by receptor specificity. A novel short putative protein with 4 helices and no homology to existing SARS-CoV or SARS-r-CoV protein was found within Orf3b ( Figure 4 ). It is notable that SARS-CoV deletion mutants lacking orf3b replicate to levels similar to those of wildtype virus in several cell types [19] , suggesting that orf3b is dispensable for viral replication in vitro. But orf3b may have a role in viral pathogenicity as Vero E6 but not 293T cells transfected with a construct expressing Orf3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time points [20] . Orf3b was also shown to inhibit expression of IFN-Î² at synthesis and signalling [21] . Subsequently, orf3b homologues identified from three bat SARSrelated-CoV strains were C-terminally truncated and lacked the C-terminal nucleus localization signal of SARS-CoV [22] . IFN antagonist activity analysis demonstrated that one SARS-related-CoV orf3b still possessed IFN antagonist and IRF3-modulating activities. These results indicated that different orf3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SARS-related-CoV orf3b function and pathogenesis. The importance of this new protein in 2019-nCoV will require further validation and study. Orf8 orf8 is an accessory protein found in the Betacoronavirus lineage B coronaviruses. Human SARS-CoVs isolated from early-phase patients, all civet SARS-CoVs, and other bat SARS-related CoVs contain fulllength orf8 [23] . However, a 29-nucleotide deletion,Bat SL-CoV ZXC21 2018Bat which causes the split of full length of orf8 into putative orf8a and orf8b, has been found in all SARS-CoV isolated from mid-and late-phase human patients [24] . In addition, we have previously identified two bat SARS-related-CoV (Bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C) and proposed that the original SARS-CoV full-length orf8 is acquired from these two bat SARS-related-CoV [25] . Since the SARS-CoV is the closest human pathogenic virus to the 2019-nCoV, we performed phylogenetic analysis and multiple alignments to investigate the orf8 amino acid sequences. The orf8 protein sequences used in the analysis derived from early phase SARS-CoV that includes full-length orf8 (human SARS-CoV GZ02), the mid-and late-phase SARS-CoV that includes the split orf8b (human SARS-CoV Tor2), civet SARS-CoV (paguma SARS-CoV), two bat SARS-related-CoV containing full-length orf8 (bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C), 2019-nCoV, the other two closest bat SARS-related-CoV to 2019-nCoV SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45), and bat SARS-related-CoV HKU3-1 ( Figure 5(A) ). As expected, orf8 derived from 2019-nCoV belongs to the group that includes the closest genome sequences of bat SARS-related-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45. Interestingly, the new 2019-nCoV orf8 is distant from the conserved orf8 or Figure 5(B) ) which was shown to trigger intracellular stress pathways and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes [26] , but this is absent in this novel orf8 of 2019-nCoV. Based on a secondary structure prediction, this novel orf8 has a high possibility to form a protein with an alpha-helix, following with a betasheet(s) containing six strands ( Figure 5(C) ). The genome of 2019-nCoV has overall 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-related-CoV SL-CoVZXC21 (MG772934.1), and 82% with human SARS-CoV BJ01 2003 (AY278488) and human SARS-CoV Tor2 (AY274119). The phylogenetic trees constructed using the amino acid sequences of orf1a/b and the 4 structural genes (S, E, M, and N) were shown (Figure 6(A-E) ).Question: What is the consequence of  lack of deletions in Yunnan strains?","answer":"can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

We show that this matrix constitutes a valid word embedding. When training language models, we recommend tying the input embedding and this output embedding. We analyze the resulting update rules and show that the tied embedding evolves in a more similar way to the output embedding than to the input embedding in the untied model. We also offer a new method of regularizing the output embedding. Our methods lead to a significant reduction in perplexity, as we are able to show on a variety of neural network language models. Finally, we show that weight tying can reduce the size of neural translation models to less than half of their original size without harming their performance.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.[2]: [3]: The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \\"Canada\\" and \\"Air\\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \\"Air Canada\\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.[4]: A fundamental goal of search engines is to identify, given a query, documents that have relevant text. This is intrinsically difficult because the query and the document may use different vocabulary, or the document may contain query words without being relevant. We investigate neural word embeddings as a source of evidence in document ranking. We train a word2vec embedding model on a large unlabelled query corpus, but in contrast to how the model is commonly used, we retain both the input and the output projections, allowing us to leverage both the embedding spaces to derive richer distributional relationships. During ranking we map the query words into the input space and the document words into the output space, and compute a query-document relevance score by aggregating the cosine similarities across all the query-document word pairs. We postulate that the proposed Dual Embedding Space Model (DESM) captures evidence on whether a document is about a query term in addition to what is modelled by traditional term-frequency based approaches. Our experiments show that the DESM can re-rank top documents returned by a commercial Web search engine, like Bing, better than a term-matching based signal like TF-IDF. However, when ranking a larger set of candidate documents, we find the embeddings-based approach is prone to false positives, retrieving documents that are only loosely related to the query. We demonstrate that this problem can be solved effectively by ranking based on a linear mixture of the DESM and the word counting features.[5]: The word2vec software of Tomas Mikolov and colleagues (this https URL ) has gained a lot of traction lately, and provides state-of-the-art word embeddings. The learning models behind the software are described in two research papers. We found the description of the models in these papers to be somewhat cryptic and hard to follow. While the motivations and presentation may be obvious to the neural-networks language-modeling crowd, we had to struggle quite a bit to figure out the rationale behind the equations. This note is an attempt to explain equation (4) (negative sampling) in \\"Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality\\" by Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado and Jeffrey Dean.","answer":"The skip-gram word2vec model introduced in [2] [3] learns representations of words. This model learns a representation for each word in its vocabulary, both in an input embedding matrix and in an output embedding matrix. When training is complete, the vectors that are returned are the input embeddings. The output embedding is typically ignored, although [4] [1] use both the output and input embeddings of words in order to compute word similarity. Recently, [5] argued that the output embedding of the word2vec skip-gram model needs to be different than the input embedding."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Materials And Methods Six hundred forty-eight patients with hormone receptor-positive or -unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive TAM (n = 215), TOR60 (n = 221), or TOR200 (n = 212).  results The combined response rates (by intent to treat) were as follows;: TAM, 44%; TOR60, 50%; and TOR200, 48%. Complete and partial response rates were as follows: TAM, 19%; TOR60, 21%, and TOR200, 23% (not statistically different). Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. Adverse events (lethal, serious but nonlethal, and important but non-life-threatening) were similar in all three arms, except that patients in the TOR200 arm had a statistically significantly increased rate of nausea (37% v 26% and 26% for TOR200, TAM, and TOR60, respectively; P = .027). Quality-of-life assessments were not different among the three arms.  conclusion The activity, toxicity, and side effects of TOR in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or -unknown metastatic breast cancer are similar if not equivalent to those of TAM. We detected no clear evidence of a dose-response effect for TOR. TOR60 is an effective and safe agent for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer and can be considered an alternative to TAM as first-line treatment for such patients.sentence: Randomized comparison of tamoxifen and two separate doses of toremifene in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

For the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, sexual reproduction is proposed to have yielded hyper virulent and drug resistant variants. The life cycle of this pathogen commences with mating, followed by the yeast-hypha transition and hyphal growth, and it concludes with fruiting body differentiation and sporulation. How these sequential differentiation events are orchestrated to ensure developmental continuality is enigmatic. Here we revealed the genetic network of the yeast-to-hypha transition in Cryptococcus by analyzing transcriptomes of populations with a homogeneous morphotype generated by an engineered strain. Among this network, we found that a Pumilio-family protein Pum1 and the matricellular signal Cfl1 represent two major parallel circuits directing the yeast-hypha transition. Interestingly, only Pum1 coordinates the sequential morphogenesis events during a-Î± bisexual and Î± unisexual reproduction. Pum1 initiates the yeast-to-hypha transition, partially through a novel filament-specific secretory protein Fas1; Pum1 is also required to sustain hyphal growth after the morphological switch. Furthermore, Pum1 directs subsequent differentiation of aerial hyphae into fruiting bodies in both laboratory and clinical isolates. Pum1 exerts its control on sexual reproduction partly through regulating the temporal expression of Dmc1, the meiosis-specific recombinase. Therefore, Pum1 serves a pivotal role in bridging post-mating morphological differentiation events with sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus. Our findings in Cryptococcus illustrate how an environmental pathogen can ensure the completion of its life cycle to safeguard its long-term lineage success.Introduction:Selective pressures from the environment shape microbial evolution. To cope with the challenges presented by both predictable and erratic environmental fluctuations, microbes employ various adaptation and bet-hedging strategies, like coordinated community behaviors and morphotype transition[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7]. The transition between different morphotypes confers genetically identical cells the distinct ability in responding to different environmental stimuli. This maximizes the community fitness and enhances species survival under disparate conditions[3],[4],[6],[8],[9]. Similarly, morphotype transition is widely adopted by evolutionally divergent pathogens to assist their survival both inside and outside of the host[3],[4],[6],[7],[9]. The causal agent of the most common fungal disease of the central nervous system, Cryptococcus neoformans, can undergo the transition between yeast and hypha states[6],[10]. This morphotype transition is linked with its virulence potential[7]. Hyphal growth( filamentation) in this ubiquitous pathogen generally occurs as a cellular response to environmental stimuli that induce sexual reproduction[11],[12],[13]. Sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus has been known for decades to take place between cells of opposite mating types, a and Î±( bisexual mating). Such bisexual mating generates an equal number of a and Î± meiotic progeny[14],[15]. However, the Cryptococcus population worldwide is sharply skewed towards the Î± mating type( >99%) and the chance of locating a compatible mating partner nearby is slim. Yet, many natural and clinical isolates maintain the ability to mate[14]. The discovery of the unisexual life cycle in C. neoformans that involves cells of only a single mating type, most often the Î± mating type[16],[17],[18], offers a plausible explanation for the observed dominance by Î± isolates[12],[16],[17],[19]. Besides the fact that spores produced by sexual reproduction are infectious propagules[20],[21], unisexual mating may have played a variety of roles in cryptococcal infections[22],[23],[24]. For instance, Î± unisexual mating is proposed to have yielded hyper-virulent Cryptococcus isolates[22], and may have assisted this pathogen in adapting to host environment[25]. Unisex in C. neoformans can also lead to aneuploidy[24], which could offer fitness benefit under certain stress conditions[26]. Sexual reproduction, including both unisexual and bisexual reproduction, occurs only in a subpopulation of a Cryptococcus mating community. It involves sequential morphological differentiation events in a stochastic manner[23]. The life cycle of this pathogen commences with early mating events controlled by the pheromone signaling pathway and is followed by the transition from the yeast to the hyphal form. Hyphae generated from this morphological transition are mostly concentrated at the periphery of the mating colony and they can invade solid substrates, extend on the surface, or expand into air. Some of the aerial hyphae further develop into fruiting bodies on their apexes, which form cup-shaped basidia that eventually give rise to four chains of spores( Figure 1A). The spores disperse and germinate into yeasts and a new life cycle begins. The architecture of the upstream signaling pathways engaged in unisexual reproduction resembles that of bisexual reproduction[11],[16]. In this regard, the pheromone signaling( MAPK pathway) plays a prominent role in integrating external inputs into the initiation of the mating development[11],[23],[27]( Figure 1A). The ultimate decision maker for the morphological transition from yeasts to hyphae is the C2H2 zinc finger regulator Znf2. Upregulation of Znf2 initiates the formation of dikaryotic( bisexual) or monokaryotic( unisexual) hyphae and Znf2 is also required to sustain hyphal growth[18]. Overexpression of Znf2 can drive the yeast-to-hypha transition independent of environment cues, which generates a homogenous hyphal population[7]. Thus, Znf2, as a master regulator of filamentation, links the upstream signaling activation, including the ones from the pheromone pathway, to the yeast-hypha cellular response. Like many other human fungal pathogens, the yeast-to-hypha transition is linked with virulence potential in Cryptococcus, and Znf2 plays a crucial role in this connection[7],[28]. Znf2 orchestrates these two behaviors( morphogenesis and virulence) partially through its downstream target Cfl1[7]. Cfl1 is a cell-wall associated adhesion protein and it also functions as a signaling molecule upon its release into the extracellular matrix[2]. This matrix protein plays a similar but less prominent role than Znf2 in regulating filamentation in C. neoformans[7]. These observations indicate the existence of additional players in coordinating hyphal development. In this study, we elucidated a genetic network controlling morphotype transition in C. neoformans. We discovered that Pum1, a RNA-binding protein, acts in concert with Cfl1 to direct Znf2-dependent filamentation. Pum1 plays a pleiotropic role in cryptococcal development: it regulates the initiation and the extension of hyphal growth; it directs the progression from aerial hyphal morphogenesis to the formation of fruiting body; and intriguingly, it also controls meiosis and sporulation during bisexual and unisexual mating. Pum1 regulates filamentation and meiosis partly through its control of the spatiotemporal expression pattern of filament-specific and meiosis-specific proteins Fas1 and Dmc1. Not surprisingly, Pum1 is critical for filamentation and sporulation in both laboratory and clinical isolates. Hence, this investigation offers a new prospective in our understanding of forces that shape cell fate and sexual reproduction in environmental pathogens.Discussion:Facing unpredictable changes in the environment, terrestrial microbes have evolved sophisticated adaptation strategies. One well-known example is morphotype transition[3],[6],[10], which essentially achieves a functional transition by changing cell shape or size[3]. This strategy is commonly adopted by environmental pathogens to survive in the environment and inside a host, conditions that could differ drastically from each other[3],[6]. As the transition between yeasts and hyphae is linked to pathogenesis in many environmental fungal pathogens[3],[6],[43],[44],[45], and that morphogenesis is an integral part of fungal development, understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling fungal morphogenesis is crucial in our understanding of fungal pathogenic strategies and fungal biology. Because morphotype transition in Cryptococcus is a stochastic process, identification of phase-specific genes and their regulation systems in this organism has been challenging. In this study, we took advantage of an engineered cryptococcal strain to generate homogeneous yeast and hyphal populations. This approach enabled a more sensitive comparison between the two cryptococcal morphotypes and allowed us to uncover a more reliable Znf2 regulon. Functional classification of this regulon revealed similar genetic programs related to filamentous growth controlled by Znf2 in Cryptococcus as the ones regulated by Rbf1 in the basidiomycete plant pathogen Ustilago maydis[46],[47]. Although Rbf1 is much smaller than Znf2, both regulators contain the similar C2-H2 Zinc-finger DNA binding domain[47]( data not shown). A considerable proportion of Rbf1's regulon also encode secretory proteins and factors involved in cell cycle progression[47],[48]. Such a striking parallelism in Cryptococcus and Ustilago suggests that Znf2 and Rbf1 might have evolved from a common regulator, which controlled the morphological transition in an ancient Basidiomycota species. The inherent properties of yeasts or hyphae might dictate the necessary genetic programs common in diverse fungi regardless of the upstream species-specific regulatory systems. For instance, extracellular proteins and cell wall-modifying proteins are required to reconstruct different cell shapes[30],[32]. Cell cycle progression is overrepresented in a yeast population compared to a filamentous population[30] likely because all but the apical compartments are quiescent in the hyphal population. Given that the yeast-to-hypha transition is observed in major fungal phyla[3],[5],[30],[32],[49], the ability to undergo morphological switches might have existed in original fungi prior to the demarcation of these phyla. Species-specific features could be wired later into the regulation of morphological transition to optimize the adaptation of each fungal species to their unique natural niches, as in the case of mating-initiated yeast-hyphal transition in C. neoformans and in U. maydis. In both organisms, filamentation is developmentally associated with the progression of sex, which helps ensure species' long term success through the creation of genetic variants and infectious spores[22],[23],[24],[50],[51]. In the development of a cryptococcal mating community, the yeast-to-hypha transition is followed by sustained hyphal growth and subsequent formation of fruiting bodies from aerial hypha apexes. Although it is clear that Znf2 controls filamentation in Cryptococcus and a few proteins like Dmc1 and Spo11 are involved in meiosis, the factor that connects filamentation with sexual reproduction remains elusive( Figure 8). From the Znf2 regulon, we found two major regulatory branches downstream of Znf2 controlling the yeast-to-hypha transition: Pum1 and the matricellular signal Cfl1. Cfl1 does not play a major role in promoting sustained hyphal growth or the fruiting body formation, suggesting that this signal probably exerts a dedicated control at the stage of hyphal initiation[2]( Figure 8). By contrast, Pum1 is important for multiple developmental stages. Pum1 promotes yeast-to-hypha transition in a mating colony through its regulation of hypha-specific proteins( e. g. Fas1)( Figures 5F and 8); Pum1 bridges the progression from aerial hyphal growth to meiosis through its additional regulation on multiple meiosis-related genes( Figure 8). The representation of genes involved in diverse functions in the Pum1 regulon( Table S2) is also consistent with its pleiotropic role. One of the interesting finding of this study is the dynamic expression pattern of the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1. Dmc1 is undetectable in undifferentiating growing hyphae( none in invasive hyphae), and is only expressed in aerial hypha apexes that are differentiating into fruiting bodies( Figures 6B and 7A). The concurrence of the onset of meiosis and the terminal differentiation of hyphal growth represents a culminating feature for the committed sexual reproduction. The dynamics of the expression of the highly conserved meiosis-specific protein during the development of basidia( Figure 6E) in a unisex colony provides yet another strong piece of evidence for the meiotic nature of this novel life cycle[16]. What remains to be established is the mode of action of Pum1. Pum1 contains an mRNA-binding Pumilio domain. The members of this family control a variety of biological processes through modulating the stability and the translation of their target transcripts[33]. Pumilio proteins are generally considered repressors and they recruit the deadenylase to decay their target mRNAs[33]. However, accumulating evidence indicates that regulators of this family can also function as activators[33]. One such example is Puf9 from the parasite Trypanosoma brucei[52]. Puf9 in T. brucei stabilize its mRNA targets, likely through a competition with a repressor for the mRNA binding[52]. Here, we show that Pum1 also plays a positive role in the control of the gene expression( e. g. FAS1 and DMC1). Loss of Pum1 decreases the overall expression levels of FAS1 and DMC1 but increases the variations of these protein expression levels among cells in the same population. This suggests that Pum1 may mediate a stochastic buffering-like regulatory mechanism[38]. It remains to be determined if Pum1 positively controls the expression level of its targets through promoting their transcription, stabilizing their mRNAs, or facilitating their translation. Further investigations into Pum1-interating factors and the dynamics of target mRNAs at different developmental stages would help obtain a mechanistic understanding of how Pum1 coordinates hyphal and sexual development.","answer":"Sex , despite its cost , is an important means to maximize species fitness in coping with unpredictable environmental challenges .

The ACT-ONE trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, phase II multicentre trial in patients (25-80 years) with stages III or IV colorectal cancer or non-small cell lung cancer -related cachexia that tested two doses of espindolol (a novel non-selective Î² blocker with central 5-HT1a and partial Î²2 receptor agonist effects). The primary endpoint was the difference in the rate of weight change over 16 weeks (linear mixed-effect model for repeated measures) between high-dose espindolol and placebo. Eighty-seven patients were randomized centrally in blocks in a ratio 3:2:1 [42 high dose, 10 mg twice daily (bd):31 placebo :14 low dose, 2.5 mg bd]. High-dose espindolol produced a statistically and clinically significant weight gain (+0.54 kg/4 weeks, 95% CI 0.38-0.70) compared with a weight loss on placebo (-0.21 kg/4 weeks, 95% CI -0.37-0.05); P < 0.0001. High-dose espindolol produced a statistically significant increase in lean body mass, whilst changes in fat mass were neutral. Hand grip strength significantly (high dose -1.15 Â± 0.7 kg, placebo -3.51 Â± 0.8 kg change per 4 weeks; P = 0.0134), stair climbing power, and 6-min walk test non-significantly were all directionally in favour of high-dose espindolol. There were no clinically significant differences in safety signals or survival between treatment groups, although a numerical excess of dyspnoea was seen with high-dose espindolol (19.1%) compared with placebo (3.2%). This positive trial showed that espindolol 10 mg bd significantly reversed weight loss, improved fat free mass, and maintained fat mass in advanced colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer -related cachexia. This was associated with a significant improvement in handgrip strength, supporting the further investigation of 10 mg bd espindolol for the treatment of cancer cachexia. Although not powered to look at dose response, most treatment effects for low dose lay between high dose and placebo, suggesting that there may be a dose response in the effects of espindolol.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer\\", \\"stages III or IV colorectal cancer\\", \\"colorectal cancer\\", \\"non-small cell lung cancer\\", \\"cancer cachexia\\", \\"Cancer cachexia\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"non-selective u03b2 blocker\\", \\"placebo\\", \\"central 5-HT1a\\", \\"espindolol\\", \\"Espindolol\\", \\"u03b22 receptor agonist\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"lean body mass\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"weight gain\\", \\"cachexia\\", \\"dyspnoea\\", \\"fat free mass\\", \\"weight loss\\", \\"stair climbing\\", \\"weight change\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"treatment\\", \\"prevention\\", \\"6-min walk test\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"positive trial\\", \\"ACT-ONE trial\\", \\"parallel group\\", \\"double-blind\\", \\"randomized\\", \\"phase II multicentre trial\\", \\"dose response\\", \\"international multicentre phase II study (the ACT-ONE trial)\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Similar to enzymatic catalysis, attractive noncovalent interactions are responsible for many of the remarkable rate acceleration and stereoselectivity improvements by lowering the kinetic barrows through stabilization of the transition state and suppressing the degree of freedom in the transition state. 3 Consequently, intensive research efforts have been directed toward the development of a new efficient catalytic system utilizing attractive noncovalent interactions. 4 As summarized by Jacobson et al. (Table 1), 3 among the three representative noncovalent interactions, the steric repulsion is highly distance dependent (1/r 12 ) wherein weak interaction was observed with long distance. H-Bond interaction (1/r 2 ) and ion pair interaction (1/r) are relatively less distance dependent and the ion pair interaction showed the strongest interaction. We anticipated that the strong ion pair noncovalent interaction can be utilized in the development of a new efficient catalytic system for asymmetric hydrogenation (AH), wherein the substrates can interact with the catalyst strongly, accelerating the reaction rate to a large extent. However, only a few examples have been reported concerning of the strong ion pair noncovalent interaction and the substrate scope was limited. 5 With regard to the utilization of the strong ion pair noncovalent interaction in the development of new chiral catalysts for AH, we found that Ugi's amine is a privileged motif in which the dimethyl amine moiety can play as a proton acceptor which can interact with the acid substrates strongly through noncovalent ion pair interaction (Scheme 1). Moreover, the Ugi's amine motif can conveniently incorporate planar chirality, C-chirality and P-chirality into the catalytic system as exempli-îed by many efficient chiral ligands such as Josiphos, 6 Walphos, 7 Taniaphos, 8 Bophoz, 9 Mandyphos, 10 TRAP, 11 Trifer 5a and Chenphos. 5b Herein, we report a new class of bisphosphorus ligands incorporating the Ugi's amine motif (Scheme 1). This type of bisphosphorus ligand possesses one chiral phosphine and the chiral Ugi amine moiety. Two large substituents of the non-chiral phosphine together with a ferrocene backbone block three quadrants, and the small substituent of the chiral phosphine makes the remaining quadrant open. This three blocked quadrant model is believed to have good chiral induction. 12 Furthermore, the dimethyl amine unit in the ligand can be a proton acceptor and thus can interact with the acid substrates through noncovalent ion pair interaction. According to the above hypothesis, this catalytic system is believed to exhibit excellent enantioselectivity and activity in the AH of unsaturated acid substrates. AH of 2-substituted acrylic acids will generate chiral a-substituted propanoic acids which are important units that widely exist in pharmaceuticals and îne chemicals (Scheme 2). Good examples are the well-known non-steroid anti-inîammatory and analgesic drugs such as naproxen, ibuprofen and îurbiprofen, 13 the esteriîcation potent inhibitors 4 against the inîammatory phenotype of the cystic îbrosis (CF) lung disease, 14 the bioactive natural product 5 isolated from the Fusarium oxysporum which shows cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines PC-3, PANC-1 and A549, 15 and artemisnin 16 which is a famous drug against Plasmodium falciparum malaria that won the 2015 Nobel Prize in medicine. Furthermore, a-substituted propanoic acid can also be used to prepare the synthetically important Roche ester, a well-known synthon in total synthesis. 17 Although AH of 2-substituted acrylic acids was previously realized using chiral Ru catalysts, 18 the reactions were limited by the generally required high pressure. Chiral Rh and Ir catalysts have also recently been reported to realize this valuable transformation. 19 However, most of these catalytic systems need an equivalent base to neutralize the free acid. 19 This method is non-direct and needs additional procedure to remove the base. Herein we report a ferrocenyl catalytic system that can înely utilize the free acid via the attractive noncovalent ion pair interaction to realize this valuable transformation in a direct and concise way without any base with ee (enantiomeric excess) up to 99% and TON up to 20 000 (Scheme 3).</p>Results and discussion<p>The new ferrocenyl bisphosphorus ligands we report herein can be easily synthesized in two-pot with very high diastereoselectivity (dr > 99 : 1) (Scheme 4). Starting from (S)-Ugi amine, a one pot sequential reaction gave 1 efficiently. Importantly, compound 1 was obtained as a single diastereomer as determined by NMR which makes the synthesis to be very simple and practical. The subsequent lithiation followed by treating with different chlorophosphines afforded the desired ligands L1-L5 in good yields. Moreover, the absolute conîguration of L1 was determined using X-ray spectrum analysis as (S c , R FC , S p ). 20 Importantly, ligands L1-L5 are all highly air stable even when stored under air for more than one year. With ligands L1-L5 in hand, AH of 2-substituted acrylic acids was initiated by evaluating ligand effects using 2-phenyl acrylic acid 2a as a model substrate (Table 2). We were pleased to înd that the substrate was all smoothly converted except when using L5 as the ligand (Table 2, entry 5) in the absence of any base. The hydrogenation results highly depended on the ligand structure. With L1, a good ee was obtained (Table 2, entry 1). Changing the phenyl group in L1 into a cyclohexyl group (L2, Table 2, entry 2), the ee signiîcantly increased to 98%. However, to our surprise, further changing the phenyl group into the steric bulky t-butyl group resulted in a very low ee and the product conîguration was changed from (S) to (R) (L3, Table 2,  entry 3). This is probably due to the much too big steric hindrance of the t-butyl group which inîuences the noncovalent ion pair interaction between the ligand and substrate. Further changing the phenyl group into the p-tolyl group resulted in a decreased ee (L4, Table 2, entry 4). Using L5 as a ligand with a phenyl group instead of a methyl group attached to the chiral phosphine, the ee dropped signiîcantly (L5, Table 2, entry 5). This result corresponds to the hypothesis that we made that the ligand should have three blocked quadrants and make the remaining quadrant open in order to get good enantioselectivities (Scheme 1). In terms of reactivity and enantioselectivity, L2 was selected as the optimum ligand for further investigation. Due to the remarkable performance, herein we name L2 Wudaphos.</p><p>Subsequently, the substrate scope of the AH of 2-substituted acrylic acids was investigated using the optimum ligand Wudaphos under the best reaction conditions (for the screening of the reaction conditions and the discussion of the solvent effects, see ESI â ). As listed in Table 3, 2-aryl acrylic acids were efficiently hydrogenated with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions in the absence of any base regardless of whether the substituents on the phenyl ring were electron donating (Table 3, 3a-3e), electron withdrawing (Table 3, 3h), or halogens (Table 3, 3f-3h). 2-Alkyl acrylic acids were also smoothly hydrogenated with high ee (Table 3, 3i, 3j,  3m). Thus, the intermediate for the preparation of Roche ester was conveniently obtained in high ee (Table 3, 3m). Furthermore, the well-known anti-inîammatory drugs ibuprofen and naproxen were also easily obtained in excellent ee under mild conditions (Table 3, 3k, 3l). Our catalytic system shows a clear advance compared with the previous systems owing to its high enantioselectivity and base free conditions.</p><p>The asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-substituted acrylic acids was also conducted with low catalyst loading using 2a as a model substrate under 50 bar H 2 atmosphere. Satisfyingly, our catalyst system showed excellent activity under very mild conditions in the absence of any base when the catalyst loading was 0.02 mol% (S/C Â¼ 5000) without any decrease of the ee (Table 4, entry 1). Moreover, the hydrogenation also proceeded smoothly with full conversion and high ee when lowering the catalyst loading to 0.01 mol% (S/C Â¼ 10 000, Table 4, entry 2) or 0.005 mol% (S/C Â¼ 20 000, Table 4, entry 3) albeit with a slight drop of ee.

The effect of the chain length between the oleîn and the acid moiety was îrst investigated. It was found that the chain length played an important role in determining the ee. Although the hydrogenation reactions of compounds 6, 7 and 2a all proceeded smoothly, the ee obtained in the hydrogenation of 6 and 7 was very low (Scheme 6), which indicated that the excellent enantiomeric control was based on a matched chain length. Subsequently, the effect of the ion pair noncovalent interaction was also investigated. Hydrogenation of the ester substrate 8 did not occur at all. The ee of the hydrogenation of 2a also dropped evidently when adding 0.5 equivalent of Cs 2 CO 3 . Moreover, only a racemic product was observed when one equivalent amount of triethylamine was added. It is probably due to the reason that the ion pair interaction between the ligand and substrate was interrupted by the additional base. These results suggested that the ion pair noncovalent interaction between the ligand and the acid substrates is critical (Scheme 6).</p><p>On the basis of the observed (S)-enantioselectivity, the X-ray crystal structure of ligand L1 (Scheme 1) and previous computational studies, 21 3D models were built to account for the important roles of the ion pair interaction and the small substituent on the phosphine ligand (Scheme 7). The favorable ionic pair interaction is present and the phenyl group on the substrate experiences less repulsion with the phosphine ligand for (S)-hydrogenation. In contrast, such an ionic pair interaction cannot form and the phenyl group on the substrate has larger repulsion with the ferrocenyl group for the (R)-hydrogenation. These 3D models also correspond to the hypothesis that we made that the good enantiomeric control of the Wudaphos is based on the three hindered quadrant model.</p>Conclusions<p>In summary, a new class of ferrocenyl chiral bisphosphorus ligand, Wudaphos, was developed.

We first examined the inducing effect of myeloma cells on migration of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Five myeloma cell lines produced varying amounts of VEGF, and migration of HUVECs was induced by coculture with myeloma cells. We next examined the inhibitory effect of a novel synthetic retinoid Am80 (Tamibarotene) on both myeloma cells and HUVECs. Am80 is specific for the retinoic-acid receptor-alpha/beta, and has therapeutic effects in all-trans retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia. Am80 slightly inhibited the growth of both myeloma cells and HUVECs, and remarkably inhibited the growth of HUVECs stimulated by VEGF. Am80 showed little growth inhibition of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but it markedly inhibited migration of HUVECs by cocultured myeloma cells. Am80 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor. In addition, VEGF-induced formation of tube-like structures in vitro and neovascularization in mouse corneas were significantly inhibited by Am80. These findings clearly demonstrate that Am80 is a potential inhibitor of angiogenesis caused by the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and myeloma cells, and might be a useful therapeutic agent against MM.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Tamibarotene\\", \\"retinoic-acid\\", \\"retinoid\\", \\"all-trans retinoic acid\\", \\"Am80\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"VEGF receptor\\", \\"retinoic-acid receptor-alpha/beta\\", \\"VEGF\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

This study was done to develop criteria that could successfully predict the outcome of surgery based on preoperative data, including percutaneous liver biopsy, allowing a more selective approach to the care of these babies.(METHODS) The charts and biopsy results of 31 patients who underwent a Kasai procedure for biliary atresia between 1984 and 1994 were reviewed. Values for preoperative albumin, bilirubin, age of patient at Kasai, and lowest postoperative bilirubin were recorded. Surgical success was defined as postoperative bilirubin that returned to normal. A pathologist blinded to the child's eventual outcome graded the pre-Kasai needle liver biopsy results according to duct proliferation, ductal plate lesion, bile in ducts, lobular inflammation, giant cells, syncitial giant cells, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, hepatocyte ballooning, bile in zone 1, 2, and 3, cholangitis, and end-stage cirrhosis. Clinical outcome was then predicted.(RESULTS) Success after portoenterostomy could not reliably be predicted based on gender, age at Kasai, preoperative bilirubin or albumin levels. Histological criteria, however, predicted outcome in 27 of 31 patients (P<.01). Fifteen of 17 clinical successes were correctly predicted; as were 12 of 14 clinical failures (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 88%). Individually, the presence of syncitial giant cells, lobular inflammation, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, and cholangitis, were each associated with failure of the portoenterostomy (P<.05). Bile in zone 1 was associated with clinical success of the procedure (P<.05).Question:Biliary atresia: should all patients undergo a portoenterostomy?Answer:","answer":"NO"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

This neuromodulationof plasticity, which involves several chemicals (particularly dopamine; BID1 He et al. 2015; BID13 BID43 , plays an important role in learning and adaptation BID22 BID32 Kreitzer & Malenka, 2008) . By allowing the brainto control its own modification as a function of ongoing states and events, the neuromodulation of plasticity can filter out irrelevant events while selectively incorporating important information, combat catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge, and implement a self-contained reinforcement learning algorithm by altering its own connectivity in a reward-dependent manner BID31 BID24 BID7 Hoerzer et al., 2014; BID19 BID4 BID38 .The complex organizationof neuromodulated plasticity is not accidental: it results from a long process of evolutionary optimization. Evolution has not only designedthe general connection pattern of the brain, but has also sculpted the machinery that controls neuromodulation, endowing the brain with carefully tuned self-modifying abilities and enabling efficient lifelong learning. In effect, this coupling of evolutionand plasticity is a meta-learning process (the original and by far most powerful example of meta-learning), whereby a simple but powerful optimization process (evolution guided by natural selection) discovered how to arrange elementary building blocks to produce remarkably efficient learning agents.Taking inspiration from nature, several authors have shown that evolutionary algorithms can design small neural networks (on the order of hundreds of connections) with neuromodulated plasticity (see the \\"Related Work\\" section below). However, many of the spectacular recentadvances in machine learning make use of gradient-based methods (which can directly translate error signals into weight gradients) rather than evolution (which has to discover the gradients through random weight-space exploration). If we could make plastic, neuromodulatednetworks amenable to gradient descent, we could leverage gradient-based methods for optimizing and studying neuromodulated plastic networks, expanding the abilities of current deep learning architectures to include these important biologically inspired self-modifying abilities.Here we build on the differentiable plasticity framework BID19 BID20 to implement differentiable neuromodulated plasticity. As a result, for the first time to our knowledge, we are able to train neuromodulated plastic networks with gradient descent. We call our framework backpropamine in referenceto its ability to emulate the effects of natural neuromodulators (like dopamine) in artificial neural networks trained by backpropagation. Our experimental results establish that neuromodulatedplastic networks outperform both non-plastic and non-modulated plastic networks, both on simple reinforcement learning tasks and on a complex language modeling task involving a multi-million parameter network. By showing that neuromodulated plasticity can be optimizedthrough gradient descent, the backpropamine framework potentially provides more powerful types of neural networks, both recurrent and feedforward, for use in all the myriad domains in which neural networks have had tremendous impact.This paper introduces a biologically-inspired method for training networks to self-modify their weights.Building upon the differentiable plasticity framework, which already improved performance (sometimes dramatically) over non-plastic architectures on various supervised and RL tasks BID18 BID20 , here we introduce neuromodulated plasticity to let the network control its own weight changes.As a result, for the first time, neuromodulated plastic networks can be trained with gradient descent, opening up a new research direction into optimizing large-scale self-modifying neural networks.As a complement to the benefits in the simple RL domains investigated, our finding that plastic and neuromodulated LSTMs outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task (importantly, a central domain of application of LSTMs) is potentially of great importance.LSTMs are used in real-world applications with massive academic and economic impact.Therefore, if plasticity and neuromodulation consistently improve LSTM performance (for a fixed search space size), the potential benefits could be considerable.We intend to pursue this line of investigation and test plastic LSTMs (both neuromodulated and non) on other problems for which LSTMs are commonly used, such as forecasting.Conceptually, an important comparison point is the \\"Learning to Reinforcement Learn\\" (L2RL) framework introduced by BID39 .In this meta-learning framework, the weights do not change during episodes: all within-episode learning occurs through updates to the activity state of the network.This framework is explicitly described BID40 as a model of the slow sculpting of prefrontal cortex by the reward-based dopamine system, an analogy facilitated by the features of the A2C algorithm used for meta-training (such as the use of a value signal and modulation of weight changes by a reward prediction error).As described in the RL experiments above, our approach adds more flexibility to this model by allowing the system to store state information with weight changes, in addition to hidden state changes.However, because our framework allows the network to update its own connectivity, we might potentially extend the L2RL model one level higher: rather than using A2C as a hand-designed reward-based weight-modification scheme, the system could now determine its own arbitrary weight-modification scheme, which might make use of any signal it can compute (reward predictions, surprise, saliency, etc.) This emergent weight-modifying algorithm (designed over many episodes/lifetimes by the \\"outer loop\\" meta-training algorithm) might in turn sculpt network connectivity to implement the meta-learning process described by BID40 .Importantly, this additional level of learning (or \\"meta-meta-learning\\") is not just a pure flight of fancy: it has undoubtedly taken place in evolution.Because humans (and other animals) can perform meta-learning (\\"learning-to-learn\\") during their lifetime (Harlow, 1949; BID40 , and because humans are themselves the result of an optimization process (evolution), then meta-meta-learning has not only occurred, but may be the key to some of the most advanced human mental functions.Our framework opens the tantalizing possibility of studying this process, while allowing us to replace evolution with any gradient-based method in the outermost optimization loop.To investigate the full potential of our approach, the framework described above requires several improvements.These include: implementing multiple neuromodulatory signals (each with their own inputs and outputs), as seems to be the case in the brain BID12 Howe & Dombeck, 2016; BID27 ; introducing more complex tasks that could make full use of the flexibility of the framework, including the eligibility traces afforded by retroactive modulation and the several levels of learning mentioned above; and addressing the pitfalls in the implementation of reinforcement learning with reward-modulated Hebbian plasticity (e.g. the inherent interference between the unsupervised component of Hebbian learning and reward-based modifications; BID9 BID8 , so as to facilitate the automatic design of efficient, selfcontained reinforcement learning systems.Finally, it might be necessary to allow the meta-training algorithm to design the overall architecture of the system, rather than simply the parameters of a fixed, hand-designed architecture.With such a rich potential for extension, our framework for neuromodulated plastic networks opens many avenues of exciting research.DISPLAYFORM0 j t , f t and o t are used for controlling the data-flow through the LSTM and i t is the actual data.Therefore, plasticity is introduced in the path that goes through i t (adding plasticity to the control paths of LSTM is for future-work) .The corresponding pre-synaptic and post-synaptic activations (denoted by x i (t â 1) and x j (t) respectively in equations 1 and2) are h tâ1 and i t .A layer of size 200 has 40k (200Ã200) plastic connections.Each plastic connection has its own individual Î· (used in equation2) that is learned through backpropagation.The plasticity coefficients (Î± i,j ) are used as shown in equation 1.","answer":"Neural networks can be trained to modify their own connectivity, improving their online learning performance on challenging tasks."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

BACKGROUND: Cytokines produced by helper T cells are intimately involved in chronic allergic diseases associated with eosinophilic inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the production of IL-5, a potent growth factor and chemotactic factor for eosinophils, by CD4 + T lymphocytes in patients with asthma. METHODS: Allergen-specific T cell clones and T cell hybridomas were established from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with asthma, and the responses to various stimuli were determined. RESULTS: After nonspecific stimulation, IL-5 production by CD4 + T cells from both atopic and nonatopic subjects with asthma was significantly enhanced compared with that by cells from healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic asthma patients both proliferated and produced IL-5 after incubation with mite allergen, suggesting that mite-specific helper T cells were involved in the eosinophilic inflammation of atopic asthma. A human IL-5 promoter / enhancer luciferase gene construct transfected into IL-5-producing T cell clones was clearly transcribed after stimulation, indicating that the 515 base pair IL-5 gene segment upstream of the coding region was sufficient to respond to activating signals in human helper T cells. The same gene segment was not transcribed in IL-5-nonproducing T cell clones, suggesting that human T cell IL-5 synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level. Experiments with T cell hybridomas confirmed these findings and suggested that a unique transcription factor may be essential for human IL-5 gene transcription. CONCLUSION: Enhanced IL-5 production by helper T cells seems to cause the eosinophilic inflammation of both atopic and nonatopic asthma. Elucidation of IL-5-specific regulatory mechanisms may facilitate the development of novel treatments for allergic diseases associated with eosinophilic inflammation.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"IL - 5 - producing T cell clones\\", \\"IL - 5 - nonproducing T cell clones\\", \\"IL - 5\\", \\"allergen - specific human helper T cells\\", \\"helper T cells\\", \\"T cell hybridomas\\", \\"Allergen - specific T cell clones\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"CD4 + T lymphocytes\\", \\"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\\", \\"eosinophils\\", \\"mite - specific helper T cells\\", \\"peripheral blood lymphocytes\\", \\"CD4 + T cells\\", \\"helper T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"IL - 5 gene segment\\", \\"IL - 5 promoter / enhancer luciferase gene construct\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Cytokines\\", \\"IL - 5\\", \\"unique transcription factor\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Two ORFs of Ps. putida A (ATCC 12633), which in Ps. putida KT2440 encode the putative CL synthase genes cls and cls2, were cloned, sequenced and mutated. Only the double mutant lacking cls and cls2 showed a reduction of the CL content, 83% lower than the amount produced by the wild-type. Accompanying this change was a 40% decrease in the content of unsaturated fatty acid. Consequently, the membrane of the mutant was more rigid than the one of the parental strain, as observed using fluorescence polarization techniques. The mutant strain showed reduced viability in the presence of tetradecyltrimethylammonium. The incorporation of exogenous CL into its membrane relieved sensitivity to the cationic detergent. Pseudomonas Putida cells with low levels of CL die in the presence of tetradecyltrimethylammonium, because they cannot counter the fluidizing effect of the cationic surfactant. The modification in the membrane phospholipids composition allows knowing the adaptation strategy of Ps. putida when these bacteria are exposed to cationic surfactant.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"Pseudomonas Putida cells\\", \\"membrane\\", \\"cls\\", \\"ORFs\\", \\"wild-type\\", \\"cls2\\", \\"double mutant lacking cls\\", \\"mutant\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"Ps. putida A (ATCC 12633)\\", \\"Ps. putida\\", \\"bacteria\\", \\"Ps. putida KT2440\\", \\"Pseudomonas Putida\\", \\"Pseudomonas putida A (ATCC 12633)\\", \\"Pseudomonas putida\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"viability\\", \\"die\\", \\"adaptation\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"cationic surfactants\\", \\"membrane phospholipids\\", \\"CL synthase\\", \\"cationic surfactant\\", \\"tetradecyltrimethylammonium\\", \\"CL\\", \\"cardiolipin\\", \\"unsaturated fatty acid\\", \\"cationic detergent\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"sensitivity\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"cloned\\", \\"sequenced\\", \\"fluorescence polarization techniques\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Current machine translation (MT) systems are still not perfect. In practice, the output from these systems needs to be edited to correct errors. A way of increasing the productivity of the whole translation process (MT plus human work) is to incorporate the human correction activities within the translation process itself, thereby shifting the MT paradigm to that of computer-assisted translation. This model entails an iterative process in which the human translator activity is included in the loop: In each iteration, a prefix of the translation is validated (accepted or amended) by the human and the system computes its best (or n-best) translation suffix hypothesis to complete this prefix. A successful framework for MT is the so-called statistical (or pattern recognition) framework. Interestingly, within this framework, the adaptation of MT systems to the interactive scenario affects mainly the search process, allowing a great reuse of successful techniques and models. In this article, alignment templates, phrase-based models, and stochastic finite-state transducers are used to develop computer-assisted translation systems. These systems were assessed in a European project (TransType2) in two real tasks: The translation of printer manuals; manuals and the translation of the Bulletin of the European Union. In each task, the following three pairs of languages were involved (in both translation directions): English-Spanish, English-German, and English-French.Literature Review:","answer":"One relevant challenge in SMT is domain adaptation, because the more similar is the training material to the test material, the better the translation quality. The increase in the amount of available data has pushed research in domain adaptation. In addition to allowing for a better translation quality, research in domain adaptation may allow to develop SMT systems of better quality to offer to professional translators. Domain adaptation may be really helpful in the recent initiative of Interactive Machine Translation (IMT), where the system aids the translator by interactively making suggestions for completing the translation. The IMT idea have been developed in the TransType and TransType2 European projects, see BIB002 and BIB001 . The continuation of the mentioned projects is the Casmacat European Project 5 . Out of these projects, a relevant online IMT (i.e. Caitra) system is now available 6 ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Early B cell factor (EBF) and E47 participate in the transcriptional control of early B lymphocyte differentiation. With the aim of identifying genetic targets for these transcription factors, we stably transfected cDNAs encoding EBF or a covalent homodimer of E47, individually or together, into immature hematopoietic Ba / F3 cells, which lack both factors. In combination, EBF and E47 induce efficient expression of the endogenous immunoglobulin surrogate light chain genes, lambda5 and VpreB, whereas other pre-B cell-specific genes remain silent. Multiple functionally important EBF and E47 binding sites were identified in the lambda5 promoter / enhancer region, indicating that lambda5 is a direct genetic target for these transcription factors. Taken together, these data suggest that EBF and E47 synergize to activate expression of a subset of genes that define an early stage of the B cell lineage.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"immature hematopoietic Ba / F3 cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"B cell lineage\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"VpreB\\", \\"EBF and E47 binding sites\\", \\"Early B cell factor (EBF)\\", \\"lambda5 promoter / enhancer region\\", \\"E47\\", \\"transfected cDNAs\\", \\"endogenous immunoglobulin surrogate light chain genes\\", \\"EBF\\", \\"lambda5\\", \\"pre - B cell - specific genes\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"EBF\\", \\"Early B cell factor\\", \\"E47\\", \\"transcription factors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In damaged and inflamed tissue, LL-37 functions as a chemoattractant, mitogen and pro-angiogenic factor suggesting that the peptide may potentiate tumor progression. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution of hCAP-18/LL-37 in normal and cancerous ovarian tissue and to examine the effects of LL-37 on ovarian cancer cells. Expression of hCAP-18/LL-37 was localized to immune and granulosa cells of normal ovarian tissue. By contrast, ovarian tumors displayed significantly higher levels of hCAP-18/LL-37 where expression was observed in tumor and stromal cells. Protein expression was statistically compared to the degree of immune cell infiltration and microvessel density in epithelial-derived ovarian tumors and a significant correlation was observed for both. It was demonstrated that ovarian tumor tissue lysates and ovarian cancer cell lines express hCAP-18/LL-37. Treatment of ovarian cancer cell lines with recombinant LL-37 stimulated proliferation, chemotaxis, invasion and matrix metalloproteinase expression. These data demonstrate for the first time that hCAP-18/LL-37 is significantly overexpressed in ovarian tumors and suggest LL-37 may contribute to ovarian tumorigenesis through direct stimulation of tumor cells, initiation of angiogenesis and recruitment of immune cells. These data provide further evidence of the existing relationship between pro-inflammatory molecules and ovarian cancer progression.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"cancerous ovarian tissue\\", \\"ovarian cancer cell lines\\", \\"epithelial-derived ovarian tumors\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"ovarian cancer cell\\", \\"ovarian cancer\\", \\"Ovarian cancers\\", \\"ovarian cancer cells\\", \\"cancer\\", \\"ovarian tissue\\", \\"granulosa cells\\", \\"immune cells\\", \\"tumor cells\\", \\"ovarian\\", \\"ovarian tumor tissue lysates\\", \\"tissue\\", \\"immune cell\\", \\"stromal cells\\", \\"ovarian tumors\\", \\"immune\\", \\"microvessel\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

Appropriate care requires accurate physician estimates of severity. It is unknown if accuracy of physician estimates differs between black and white patients, and how this relates to asthma care disparities.(OBJECTIVE) We hypothesized that: 1) physician underestimation of asthma severity is more frequent among black patients; 2) among black patients, physician underestimation of severity is associated with poorer quality asthma care.(DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS) We conducted a cross-sectional survey among adult patients with asthma cared for in 15 managed care organizations in the United States. We collected physicians' estimates of their patients' asthma severity. Physicians' estimates of patients' asthma as being less severe than patient-reported symptoms were classified as underestimates of severity.(MEASUREMENTS) Frequency of underestimation, asthma care, and communication.(RESULTS) Three thousand four hundred and ninety-four patients participated (13% were black). Blacks were significantly more likely than white patients to have their asthma severity underestimated (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.08-1.79). Among black patients, underestimation was associated with less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids (13% vs 20%, p<.05), less physician instruction on management of asthma flare-ups (33% vs 41%, p<.0001), and lower ratings of asthma care (p = .01) and physician communication (p = .04).Question:Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The pitfalls of naive robot simulations have been recognised for areas such as evolutionary robotics. It has been suggested that carefully validated simulations with a proper treatment of noise may overcome these problems. This paper reports the results of experiments intended to test some of these claims. A simulation was constructed of a two-wheeled Khepera robot with IR and ambient light sensors. This included detailed mathematical models of the robot-environment interaction dynamics with empirically determined parameters. Artificial evolution was used to develop recurrent dynamical network controllers for the simulated robot, for obstacle-avoidance and light-seeking tasks, using different levels of noise in the simulation. The evolved controllers were down-loaded onto the real robot and the correspondence between behaviour in simulation and in reality was tested. The level of correspondence varied according to how much noise was used in the simulation, with very good results achieved when realistic quantities were applied. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to develop successful robot controllers in simulation that generate almost identical behaviours in reality, at least for a particular class of robot-environment interaction dynamics. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We present a comprehensive survey of robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), a technique that develops policies from example state to action mappings. We introduce the LfD design choices in terms of demonstrator, problem space, policy derivation and performance, and contribute the foundations for a structure in which to categorize LfD research. Specifically, we analyze and categorize the multiple ways in which examples are gathered, ranging from teleoperation to imitation, as well as the various techniques for policy derivation, including matching functions, dynamics models and plans. To conclude we discuss LfD limitations and related promising areas for future research. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  The presented paper shows a pilot development of a robot âtask programming methodâ. In this method, the user programs the robot task by demonstrating it (Programming by Demonstration, PbD). PbD is applied on a robotic arm with two degrees-of-freedom for programming a constrained motion task. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  In robotics, the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to endow robots with the ability to learn, improve, adapt and reproduce tasks with dynamically changing constraints based on exploration and autonomous learning. We give a summary of the state-of-the-art of reinforcement learning in the context of robotics, in terms of both algorithms and policy representations. Numerous challenges faced by the policy representation in robotics are identified. Three recent examples for the application of reinforcement learning to real-world robots are described: a pancake flipping task, a bipedal walking energy minimization task and an archery-based aiming task. In all examples, a state-of-the-art expectation-maximization-based reinforcement learning is used, and different policy representations are proposed and evaluated for each task. The proposed policy representations offer viable solutions to six rarely-addressed challenges in policy representations: correlations, adaptability, multi-resolution, globality, multi-dimensionality and convergence. Both the successes and the practical difficulties encountered in these examples are discussed. Based on insights from these particular cases, conclusions are drawn about the state-of-the-art and the future perspective directions for reinforcement learning in robotics. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is poised to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and represents a step toward building autonomous systems with a higherlevel understanding of the visual world. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning (RL) to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. DRL algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of RL, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep RL, including the deep Q-network (DQN), trust region policy optimization (TRPO), and asynchronous advantage actor critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via RL. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  As robots and other intelligent agents move from simple environments and problems to more complex, unstructured settings, manually programming their behavior has become increasingly challenging and expensive. Often, it is easier for a teacher to demonstrate a desired behavior rather than attempt to manually engineer it. This process of learning from demonstrations, and the study of algorithms to do so, is called imitation learning. This work provides an introduction to imitation learning. It covers the underlying assumptions, approaches, and how they relate; the rich set of algorithms developed to tackle the problem; and advice on effective tools and implementation. We intend this paper to serve two audiences. First, we want to familiarize machine learning experts with the challenges of imitation learning, particularly those arising in robotics, and the interesting theoretical and practical distinctions between it and more familiar frameworks like statistical supervised learning theory and reinforcement learning. Second, we want to give roboticists and experts in applied artificial intelligence a broader appreciation for the frameworks and tools available for imitation learning. We pay particular attention to the intimate connection between imitation learning approaches and those of structured prediction Daume III et al. [2009]. To structure this discussion, we categorize imitation learning techniques based on the following key criteria which drive algorithmic decisions: ::: ::: 1) The structure of the policy space. Is the learned policy a time-index trajectory (trajectory learning), a mapping from observations to actions (so called behavioral cloning [Bain and Sammut, 1996]), or the result of a complex optimization or planning problem at each execution as is common in inverse optimal control methods [Kalman, 1964, Moylan and Anderson, 1973]. ::: ::: 2) The information available during training and testing. In particular, is the learning algorithm privy to the full state that the teacher possess? Is the learner able to interact with the teacher and gather corrections or more data? Does the learner have a (typically a priori) model of the system with which it interacts? Does the learner have access to the reward (cost) function that the teacher is attempting to optimize? ::: ::: 3) The notion of success. Different algorithmic approaches provide varying guarantees on the resulting learned behavior. These guarantees range from weaker (e.g., measuring disagreement with the agentâs decision) to stronger (e.g., providing guarantees on the performance of the learner with respect to a true cost function, either known or unknown). We organize our work by paying particular attention to distinction (1): dividing imitation learning into directly replicating desired behavior (sometimes called behavioral cloning) and learning the hidden objectives of the desired behavior from demonstrations (called inverse optimal control or inverse reinforcement learning [Russell, 1998]). In the latter case, behavior arises as the result of an optimization problem solved for each new instance that the learner faces. In addition to method analysis, we discuss the design decisions a practitioner must make when selecting an imitation learning approach. Moreover, application examplesâsuch as robots that play table tennis [Kober and Peters, 2009], programs that play the game of Go [Silver et al., 2016], and systems that understand natural language [Wen et al., 2015]â illustrate the properties and motivations behind different forms of imitation learning. We conclude by presenting a set of open questions and point towards possible future research directions for machine learning.Literature Review:","answer":"Robotic behaviors can be learned with many different approaches. Two relevant branches are reinforcement learning and supervised learning. Recent surveys on reinforcement learning in robotics have been published by BIB005 ; BIB006 . Deep reinforcement learning is a new field that makes use of the results from deep learning. Although there are only a few applications of deep reinforcement learning in robotics, results of these methods are interesting for behaviors that involve difficult perception problems. A recent survey of deep reinforcement learning has been published by BIB007 and a survey of deep learning for robotic perception and control by . Supervised learning can be used to learn the perception part of a behavior, the action part, or both. If actions are learned supervised, this is called imitation learning or programming by demonstration. Surveys have been written by BIB004 ; BIB003 BIB008 . We not discuss algorithms in this section. Please refer to these surveys or to other papers that we cite in this section to learn more about specific algorithms that can be used to learn behaviors. We neither discuss the reported performance of the solutions from the presented works. We will focus on kinematically or sensorially complex robots. That includes humanoid robots or parts of humanoid robots like legged robots or robotic arms. We only consider applications for unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, or wheeled robots if the learned behaviors are relevant for humanoid robots. That excludes some early works that apply machine learning to robotic control, for example, BIB001 learn a behavior to find and push a box with a wheeled robot, but also more recent work with deep reinforcement learning on robotic systems. We also do not discuss behaviors that have only been demonstrated in simulation because of the reality gap BIB002 . In this section, we try to capture the large variety of robotic behavior learning problems according to the presented definition of behavior. We group problems according to the categories introduced in the previous section and point out similarities and differences between and difficulties of these problems. A histogram that shows the distribution of the analyzed papers by publication dates is displayed in Figure 2 . Although we do not claim to have included definitely every relevant work, it shows that the number of applications of behavior learning to robotic systems has been growing fast in the last 10 years. Figure 3 shows how individual behaviors can be grouped by their domain of application. Some behaviors can of course be applied in several domains. These are elementary behaviors. Examples are walking and grasping. Table 1 summarizes the behavior learning problems, corresponding publications, and their categorization. The remainder of this section is separated in manipulation behaviors, locomotion behaviors, and behaviors that do not fit any of these categories. Figure 4 shows the categorization of manipulation behaviors that we used to structure this section. Manipulation behaviors change the state of the robot's environment, hence, we categorized behaviors by the softness of the manipulated object and the dynamics of the behavior. This is similar to how Sanchez et al. (2018) manipulation and sensing of deformable objects. We found this categorization to be useful to organize publications that we present here. It might, however, not be easily applicable in other cases. For example, in case of a robot that moves a catheter  , we would have to answer the question if the catheter is the manipulated object or part of the robot. If the catheter is part of the robot, what would be the manipulated object?"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Conversely, autoimmune encephalitides are reversible conditions that can occur in the presence or absence of cancer. To report the induction of autoimmune encephalitis in 2 patients after treatment of metastatic cancer with a combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and ipilimumab. A retrospective case study was conducted of the clinical and management course of 2 patients with progressive, treatment - refractory metastatic cancer who were treated with a single dose each (concomitantly) of the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, 1 mg/kg, and ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg. Nivolumab and ipilimumab. The clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy in suspected autoimmune encephalitis in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitor use. Autoantibody testing confirmed identification of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 patient. Withdrawal of immune checkpoint inhibitors and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, consisting of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate equivalent to 1000 mg of methylprednisolone for 5 days, 0.4 mg/kg/d of intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days, and 2 doses of rituximab, 1000 mg, in 1 patient and oral prednisone, 60 mg/d, in the other patient, resulted in improved neurologic symptoms. Immune checkpoint inhibition may favor the development of immune responses against neuronal antigens, leading to autoimmune encephalitis. Early recognition and treatment of autoimmune encephalitis in patients receiving immune checkpoint blockade therapy will likely be essential for maximizing clinical recovery and minimizing the effect of drug-related toxic effects. The mechanisms by which immune checkpoint inhibition may contribute to autoimmune encephalitis require further study.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"metastatic cancer\\", \\"cancer\\", \\"immune checkpoint inhibition\\", \\"Metastatic Cancer\\", \\"Paraneoplastic encephalitides\\", \\"Immune checkpoint inhibition\\", \\"Autoimmune Encephalitis\\", \\"refractory metastatic cancer\\", \\"autoimmune encephalitis\\", \\"autoimmune encephalitides\\", \\"immune responses\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"cerebrospinal fluid\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"rituximab\\", \\"Nivolumab\\", \\"nivolumab\\", \\"immune checkpoint inhibitor\\", \\"intravenous immunoglobulin\\", \\"Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor\\", \\"ipilimumab\\", \\"anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies\\", \\"immune checkpoint inhibitors\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"clinical response\\", \\"improved\\", \\"neurologic symptoms\\", \\"presence\\", \\"confirmed\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"clinical and management\\", \\"diagnosis of cancer\\", \\"immunosuppressive therapy\\", \\"immune checkpoint blockade therapy\\", \\"Autoantibody testing\\", \\"treated with\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"retrospective case study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

Methods Four subgroups from the prospect i ve community-based Chingford Cohort Study were identified based on presence/absence of pain and ROA at baseline : ( Painâ/ROAâ ; Pain+/ROAâ ; Painâ/ROA+ ; Pain+/ROA+ ) . Pain was defined as side-specific pain in the preceding month , while side-specific ROA was defined as Kellgren â Lawrence grade â¥2 . All-cause , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and cancer-related mortality over the 23-year follow-up was based on information collected by the Office for National Statistics . Associations between subgroups and all-cause/cause-specific mortality were assessed using Cox regression , adjusting for age , body mass index , typical cardiovascular risk factors , occupation , past physical activity , existing CVD disease , glucose levels and medication use . Results 821 and 808 women were included for knee and h and analyses , respectively . Compared with the knee Painâ/ROAâ group , the Pain+/ROAâ group had an increased risk of CVD-specific mortality ( HR 2.93 ( 95 % CI 1.47 to 5.85 ) ) , while the knee Pain+/ROA+ group had an increased HR of 1.97 ( 95 % CI 1.23 to 3.17 ) for all-cause and 3.57 ( 95 % CI 1.53 to 8.34 ) for CVD-specific mortality . We found no association between h and OA and mortality . Conclusion We found a significantly increased risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality in women experiencing knee pain with or without ROA but not ROA alone . No relationship was found between h and OA and mortality risk . This suggests that knee pain , more than structural changes of OA is the main driver of excess mortality in patients with OATitle 2:Knee osteoarthritis and all-cause mortality: the Wuchuan Osteoarthritis Study.Abstract 2:BACKGROUND Previous studies showed that knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) is associated with increased mortality in Caucasians . While prevalence of knee OA is higher in Chinese than in Caucasians , no study has examined whether knee OA increases mortality in Chinese population . METHODS Between 8/2005 - 10/2005 1025 residents aged â¥50 years were recruited in r and omly selected rural communities in Wuchuan , China . Subjects completed a home interview and had weight-bearing posteroanterior semiflexed view of radiographs at tibiofemoral joints and skyline view of radiographs at patellofemoral joints , and were followed until end of 2013 . A knee was defined as having radiographic osteoarthritis ( ROA ) if either Kellgren/Lawrence ( KL ) score at tibiofemoral joint â¥2 or presence of OA at patellofemoral joint based on OARSI criteria . Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis ( SxOA ) was defined if both pain ( i.e. , knee pain occurred on most days in past month ) and ROA were present at the same knee . We examined the relation of knee SxOA and knee ROA to the all-cause mortality , respectively , using Cox-proportional hazard models adjusting for potential confounders . RESULTS Over the follow-up period 99 subjects  died . The mortality rates were 32.6 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 19.6 - 54.0 ) and 10.9 ( 95 % CI : 8.8 - 13.5 ) per 1000 person-years among subjects with and without SxOA , respectively . Multivariable adjusted hazard ratio of all-cause mortality for knee SxOA was 1.9 ( 95 % CI : 1.0 - 3.5 ) . However , no such association was observed for knee ROA ( hazard ratio = 1.2 , 95 % CI : 0.7 - 1.9 ) . CONCLUSIONS Knee SxOA was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality among the residents in the rural areas of ChinaTitle 3:Effect of weight loss and exercise on frailty in obese older adults.Abstract 3:BACKGROUND Obesity exacerbates the age-related decline in physical function and causes frailty in older persons . However , appropriate treatment for obese older persons is unknown . We evaluated the effects of weight loss and exercise therapy on physical function and body composition in obese older persons . METHODS We screened 40 obese older volunteers and eventually r and omized 27 frail obese older volunteers to treatment or control groups . Treatment consisted of 6 months of weekly behavioral therapy for weight loss in conjunction with exercise training 3 times per week . Physical function was evaluated with measurements of frailty ( Physical Performance Test , peak oxygen consumption , and Functional Status Question naire ) ; strength , gait , and balance tests ; body composition with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ; and quality of life using the Medical Outcomes Survey 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey . Results are reported as mean + /- SD . RESULTS Two subjects in the treatment group did not comply with the intervention , and 1 subject in the control group withdrew . Analyses included all 27 subjects originally r and omized to the treatment and control groups . The treatment group lost 8.4 % + /- 5.6 % of body weight , whereas weight did not change in the control group ( + 0.5 % + /- 2.8 % ; P<.001 ) . Compared with the control group , fat mass decreased ( -6.6 + /- 3.4 vs + 1.7 + /- 4.1 kg ; P<.001 ) , without a change in fat-free mass ( -1.2 + /- 2.1 vs -1.0 + /- 3.5 kg ; P = .75 ) in the treatment group . The Physical Performance Test score ( 2.6 + /- 2.5 vs 0.1 + /- 1.0 ; P = .001 ) , peak oxygen consumption ( 1.7 + /- 1.6 vs 0.3 + /- 1.1 mL/min per kilogram ; P = .02 ) , and Functional Status Question naire score ( 2.9 + /- 3.7 vs -0.2 + /- 3.9 ; P = .02 ) improved in treated subjects compared with control subjects . Treatment also improved strength , walking speed , obstacle course , 1-leg limb stance time , and health survey physical subscale scores ( all P<.05 ) . CONCLUSION These findings suggest that weight loss and exercise can ameliorate frailty in obese older adults . Trial Registration clinical trials.gov Identifier : NCT00146133Title 4:Validation of American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for knee osteoarthritis using arthroscopically defined cartilage damage scores.Abstract 4:OBJECTIVE To vali date the ability of the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) clinical classification criteria and the ACR clinical plus radiographic classification criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee to predict articular cartilage damage . METHODS Ninety subjects with knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) who were enrolled in a prospect i ve study determining the therapeutic efficacy of arthroscopic irrigation  were characterized as to whether they fulfilled the ACR clinical classification criteria or the ACR clinical plus radiographic classification criteria . Ten rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients were included as controls .  Cartilage damage was defined using the ACR/Knee Arthroscopy Osteoarthritis Scale ( ACR/KAOS ) system , which is a vali date d outcome instrument for knee OA based on arthroscopic visualization . Mean values of the damage scores in each group were calculated and compared by t-test to determine statistical significance between the 3 groups . RESULTS The mean ACR/KAOS score for the 10 RA patients was 1.8 [ SD 1.22 ; range 0 to 4 ] . Of the 90 OA patients who underwent arthroscopy , only 73 patients had sufficient videotape to make an accurate assessment by the blinded assessor . The mean ACR/KAOS score for the 6 OA patients who fulfilled only the ACR clinical classification was 17.4 [ SD 11.3 ; range 5 to 34.3 ] and the mean ACR/KAOS score for the 67 patients who fulfilled the ACR clinical plus radiographic classification criteria was 42.0 [ SD 29.1 ; range 5.1 to 118.4 ] . These differences were statistically significant ( RA versus OA clinical P=0.02 ; RA versus OA clinical + radiographic P < or=0.01 ) . Nonparametric multivariate analysis did not reveal significant correlations between ACR/KAOS scores and WOMAC global scores ( r=0.11 , P=0.39 ) , patient VAS ( r=0.29 , P=0.022 ) , and age ( r=0.29 , P=0.08 ) . CONCLUSIONS The ACR clinical and clinical plus radiographic criteria for OA of the knee accurately predict cartilage damage as assessed by arthroscopy . Furthermore , the ACR clinical classification criteria identify OA patients with cartilage damage before any radiographic change , while the ACR clinical plus radiographic classification criteria identify OA patients with more severe cartilage damage .

Bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips were incubated with 10 microM fenoterol or vehicle for various periods of time (5, 30 min, 18 h) at 37 degrees C. After extensive washout (3 h, 37 degrees C), isometric contractions were measured to the full muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine, the partial muscarinic receptor agonist 4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium (McN-A-343) and histamine. Fenoterol treatment significantly reduced the sensitivity (pEC(50)) to methacholine in a time-dependent manner, without affecting maximal contraction (E(max)). Fenoterol treatment similarly reduced the pEC(50) of McN-A-343 and histamine; however, E(max) values were also reduced, to approximately 70% of control after 18-h treatment. The inverse agonist timolol, having no effect on control preparations, consistently restored the reduced pEC(50) and E(max) values of the contractile agonists. Remarkably, in the presence of timolol the pEC(50) values of McN-A-343 and histamine in fenoterol-treated airways were significantly enhanced compared to controls. In conclusion, fenoterol-induced constitutive beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity reduces muscarinic receptor agonist- and histamine-induced contractions of bovine tracheal smooth muscle, which can be reversed by the inverse agonist timolol. Moreover, after beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist treatment, inverse agonism by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may cause enhanced airway reactivity to contractile mediators.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Fenoterol\\", \\"fenoterol\\", \\"timolol\\", \\"4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium\\", \\"McN-A-343\\", \\"methacholine\\", \\"histamine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"beta(2)-adrenoceptor\\", \\"beta-adrenoceptor\\", \\"muscarinic receptor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment by laser or ultrasonic surgical aspiration from 2000-2005. Preoperative biopsy was done to confirm presence of dysplasia. Patients completed a visual analog scale regarding pain and were evaluated at 2-4 weeks to assess scarring, wound healing, and adverse effects. Patients returned every 3 months for 1 year for pelvic examination and cytology to assess recurrence. Follow-up colposcopy and biopsy were used at the discretion of the treating physician. Student t test, chi2, analysis of variance and multiple logistic regression were used for analysis.                One hundred ten patients were randomly assigned. Ninety-six (87.3%) patients completed 1 year follow-up. Mean age of patients was 48.5 years. Mean visual analog scale score was significantly lower in patients treated by ultrasonic surgical aspiration (20.7 compared with 35.1; P=.032). For patients with vulvar lesions, there was less scarring with ultrasonic surgical aspiration (P<.01). Recurrence overall was 25% and was similar for ultrasonic surgical aspiration compared with laser (relative risk 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.64-1.50, number needed to treat 95.6). Recurrence was associated with younger age (P<.01).                Patients treated with ultrasonic surgical aspiration for vulvar and vaginal dysplasia reported less postoperative pain.

METHODS Fifty-four subjects were selected from a pool of patients satisfying the following inclusion criteria : non extraction treatment in the m and ibular or maxillary arches ; eruption of all m and ibular teeth ; no spaces in the m and ibular arch ; irregularity index greater than 2 in the m and ibular arch ; and no therapeutic intervention planned with any extraoral or intraoral appliance . The patients were r and omly assigned to 2 groups : 1 group received treatment with a self-ligating bracket ( Damon 2 , Ormco , Glendora , Calif ) and the other with a conventional edgewise appliance ( Microarch , GAC , Central Islip , NY ) , both with 0.022-in slots . The irregularity index of the m and ibular arch was normalized between the groups , and the time to alignment was estimated in days . Treatment duration was assessed by data modeling with the Cox proportional hazard regression . Lateral cephalometric radiographs were used to assess the alteration of m and ibular incisor position before and after alignment . Measurements of intercanine and intermolar widths were also made on dental casts to determine changes associated with correction . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Overall , no difference in the time required to correct m and ibular crowding with Damon 2 and conventional brackets was observed . For moderate crowding ( irregularity index < 5 ) , however , the self-ligating group had 2.7 times faster correction . This difference was marginally insignificant for subjects with irregularity index scores greater than 5 . Greater crowding prolonged treatment by an additional 20 % for each irregularity index unit . Increases in intercanine and intermolar widths associated with crowding correction regardless of bracket group were noted . The self-ligating group showed a statistically greater intermolar width increase than the conventional group . Also , an alignment-induced increase in the proclination of the m and ibular incisors was observed for both bracket groups , but no difference was found between Damon 2 and conventional brackets for this parameterTitle 2:Maxillary canine retraction with self-ligating and conventional brackets.Abstract 2:OBJECTIVE To measure space closure during the retraction of upper permanent canines with self-ligating and conventional brackets . MATERIAL S AND METHODS Fifteen patients who required maxillary canine retraction into first premolar extraction sites as part of their orthodontic treatment completed this study . In a r and om split-mouth design , the retraction of upper canines was performed using an elastomeric chain with 150 g of force . The evaluations were performed in dental casts ( T0 , initial ; T1 , 4 weeks ; T2 , 8 weeks ; T3 , 12 weeks ) . The amount of movement and the rotation of the canines as well as anchorage loss of the upper first molars were evaluated . RESULTS There was no difference between self-ligating and conventional brackets regarding the distal movement of upper canines and mesial movement of first molars ( P > .05 ) . Rotation of the upper canines was minimized with self-ligating brackets ( P < .05 ) . CONCLUSION Distal movement of the upper canines and anchorage loss of the first molars were similar with both conventional and self-ligating brackets .  Rotation of the upper canines during sliding mechanics was minimized with self-ligating bracketsTitle 3:The clinical significance of error measurement in the interpretation of treatment results.Abstract 3:The aims of this investigation were to determine the errors involved in cephalometric l and mark identification and to link these to the interpretation of treatment results . Fifty cephalograms were r and omly selected from patient files and the following were determined . ( i ) Accuracy of the digitizer -- single tracing digitized on five occasions on each of 10 different positions on the digitizer by one observer . ( ii ) Intra- and inter-observer digitizing error--35 l and marks on the same tracing ( on a fixed position ) digitized on five occasions by each of four judges . ( iii ) Intra- and inter-observer  tracing error -- five separate tracings of 10 different cephalograms by four judges . There were no significant differences in the variances of the co-ordinates for each l and mark between the different positions on the digitizer ( mean variance x-axis 0.07 mm and y-axis 0.08 mm ) . ( ii ) One-way ANOVA showed no significant intra- or inter-observer differences in digitation . ( iii ) Levene 's test for homogeneity of variance showed significant differences in the co-ordinates of different l and marks and between the same l and marks on different cephalograms . Two-way ANOVA showed significant differences between observers for the same l and mark that were greater than the intra-observer differences . The results indicate that tracing accuracy is a limiting factor in cephalometry . The variance of each l and mark is dependent on the quality of the cephalogram . Inter-observer differences were greater than intra-observer effects and these were r and om , rather than systematic errors . Minimal error estimation calculations enable discrimination between treatment results and measurement errorsTitle 4:Canine retraction rate with self-ligating brackets vs conventional edgewise brackets.Abstract 4:OBJECTIVE To compare the rates of retraction down an archwire of maxillary canine teeth when bracketed with a self-ligating bracket was used on one side and a conventional bracket on the other . MATERIAL S AND METHODS In 43 patients requiring maxillary premolar extraction , a self-ligating bracket ( Damon3 , SmartClip ) was used on the maxillary canine on one side and a conventional bracket ( Victory Series ) on the other . The teeth were retracted down a 0.018-inch stainless steel archwire , using a medium Sentalloy retraction spring ( 150 g ) . The rates of retraction were analyzed using a paired t-test . RESULTS The mean movement per 28 days for the conventional bracket was 1.17 mm . For the Damon bracket it was 0.9 mm and for the SmartClip bracket it was 1.10 mm . The differences between the conventional and self-ligating brackets were statistically significant : paired t-test , SmartClip , P < .0043 ; Damon3 , P < .0001 ) . CONCLUSION The retraction rate is faster with the conventional bracket , probably because of the narrower bracket width of the self-ligating bracketsTitle 5:Canine retraction and anchorage loss: self-ligating versus conventional brackets in a randomized split-mouth study.Abstract 5:OBJECTIVE To evaluate the velocity of canine retraction , anchorage loss and changes on canine and first molar inclinations using self-ligating and conventional brackets . MATERIAL S AND METHODS Twenty-five adults with Class I malocclusion and a treatment plan involving extraction s of four first premolars were selected for this r and omized split-mouth control trial . Patients had either  conventional or self-ligating brackets bonded  to maxillary canines r and omly . Retraction was accomplished using 100-g nickel-titanium closed coil springs , which were reactivated every 4 weeks . Oblique radiographs were taken before and after canine retraction was completed , and the cephalograms were superimposed on stable structures of the maxilla . Cephalometric points were digitized twice by a blinded operator for error control , and the following l and marks were collected : canine cusp and apex horizontal changes , molar cusp and apex horizontal changes , and angulation changes in canines and molars . The blinded data , which were normally distributed , were analyzed through paired t-tests for group differences . RESULTS No differences were found between the two groups for all variables tested . CONCLUSIONS Both brackets showed the same velocity of canine retraction and loss of anteroposterior anchorage of the molars . No changes were found between brackets regarding the inclination of canines and first molarsTitle 6:Randomized clinical trial of orthodontic treatment efficiency with self-ligating and conventional fixed orthodontic appliances.Abstract 6:INTRODUCTION Our objective was to test the hypotheses that treatment with 2 fixed orthodontic appliances ( SmartClip and Victory ; 3 M Unitek , Monrovia , Calif ) would result in no difference in ( 1 ) the duration of orthodontic treatment or ( 2 ) the number of visits required . METHODS Sixty-six consecutive patients were r and omly allocated to treatment with a self-ligating bracket system ( SmartClip ) or a conventional appliance ( Victory ) . The duration of treatment and the number of visits required in addition to the initial and final peer assessment rating ( PAR ) scores were recorded . The number of teeth extracted during treatment and the frequency of mechanical eruption of canines were also noted . Analyses of covariance were used to assess the influence of bracket type on treatment duration s , visits required , and percentage PAR score reductions . RESULTS Fifty-four ( 81.8 % ) participants completed the study . The duration of treatment was 3 months greater in the group treated with SmartClip . However , bracket type had no statistical influence on treatment duration ( P = 0.076 ) , total visits required ( P = 0.184 ) , or percentage PAR score reduction ( P = 0.255 ) . CONCLUSIONS Neither hypothesis could be rejected . Bracket type did not influence the duration of treatment or the number of visits required . The percentages of PAR score reductions were also unaffected by the choice of appliance","answer":"Conclusion There is some evidence from this review that both brackets showed the same rate of canine retraction and loss of antero-posterior anchorage of the molars ."},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Subcellular localization of BORG was not dependent on the context or level of its expression or decay but rather depended on the sequence of the mature, spliced transcript. Mutational analyses indicated that nuclear localization of BORG was mediated through a novel RNA motif consisting of the pentamer sequence AGCCC with sequence restrictions at positions -8 (T or A) and -3 (G or C) relative to the first nucleotide of the pentamer.A novel RNA motif mediates the strict nuclear localization of a long noncoding RNA.","answer":"The lncRNA localization to the nucleus can be mediated by the pentamer sequence AGCCC."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

In this work we go beyond the state of the art by studying search target prediction in an open-world setting in which we no longer assume that we have fixation data to train for the search targets. We present a dataset containing fixation data of 18 users searching for natural images from three image categories within synthesised image collages of about 80 images. In a closed-world baseline experiment we show that we can predict the correct target image out of a candidate set of five images. We then present a new problem formulation for search target prediction in the open-world setting that is based on learning compatibilities between fixations and potential targets.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Is it possible to infer a person's goal by decoding their fixations on objects? Two groups of participants categorically searched for either a teddy bear or butterfly among random category distractors, each rated as high, medium, or low in similarity to the target classes. Target-similar objects were preferentially fixated in both search tasks, demonstrating information about target category in looking behavior. Different participants then viewed the searchers' scanpaths, superimposed over the target-absent displays, and attempted to decode the target category (bear butterfly). Bear searchers were classified perfectly; butterfly searchers were classified at 77 . Bear and butterfly Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were also used to decode the same preferentially fixated objects and found to yield highly comparable classification rates. We conclude that information about a person's search goal exists in fixation behavior, and that this information can be behaviorally decoded to reveal a search targetâessentially reading a person's mind by analyzing their fixations.[2]: We address the question of inferring the search target from fixation behavior in visual search. Such inference is possible since during search, our attention and gaze are guided toward visual features similar to those in the search target. We strive to answer two fundamental questions: what are the most powerful algorithmic principles for this task, and how does their performance depend on the amount of available eye movement data and the complexity of the target objects? In the first two experiments, we choose a random-dot search paradigm to eliminate contextual influences on search. We present an algorithm that correctly infers the target pattern up to 50 times as often as a previously employed method and promises sufficient power and robustness for interface control. Moreover, the current data suggest a principal limitation of target inference that is crucial for interface design: if the target pattern exceeds a certain spatial complexity level, only a subpattern tends to guide the observers' eye movements, which drastically impairs target inference. In the third experiment, we show that it is possible to predict search targets in natural scenes using pattern classifiers and classic computer vision features significantly above chance. The availability of compelling inferential algorithms could initiate a new generation of smart, gaze-controlled interfaces and wearable visual technologies that deduce from their users' eye movements the visual information for which they are looking. In a broader perspective, our study shows directions for efficient intent decoding from eye movements.

grown hairs , cysts , and necrosis .recipient area necrosis is a rare but dangerous complication that arises when an increased number of recipient grafts are utilized and de - vascularization of the scalp occurs as a result of dense splitting of recipient skin that results in large wound areas .although in the literature it has been mentioned that this complication is rare , our survey in iran determined that many hair transplant centers face this complication but do not officially report these cases . accordingly , after describing the standard methods of prevention of scalp skin necrosis used so far , we decided to locate these cases from the literature and iranian hair transplant centers to determine the dangerous zone in an effort to develop a method for prevention of scalp necrosis in dense packing transplantation .predisposing factors of skin necrosis : recipient - site necrosis is a result of vascular compromise .predisposing influence composed of patient s factors and technical factors are as follows :  patient s factors : smoking , atrophic skin damage , diabetes mellitus , scarring of the recipient site or a history of scalp surgery .technical factors : dense packing , megasessions , large openings , use of solutions with high epinephrine concentration , and deep recipient incisions .patient s factors : smoking , atrophic skin damage , diabetes mellitus , scarring of the recipient site or a history of scalp surgery .technical factors : dense packing , megasessions , large openings , use of solutions with high epinephrine concentration , and deep recipient incisions . methods of hair grafting / hair transplantation techniques and the risk of the recipient site skin necrosis : follicular unit transplantation ( fut ) : the donor strip can be harvested with a knife , after the strip has been harvested , the gap can be closed either with staples or sutures .the grafts are placed into the recipient slits / holes using fine - angled forceps .follicular unit extraction ( fue ) : fue is a type of hair transplantation in which the method of extraction is different but implantation is the same as fut .it is a sutureless method of hair restoration in which hair follicles are extracted from the back of the head under local anesthesia with the help of special micropunches that are then implanted in the bald area .automated fue hair transplantation or s.a.f.e.r [ suction assisted follicular extraction and reimplantation ] : the fue matic machine ( medicamat ; malakoff , france ) is an automated hair transplant machine that seeks to assist the doctor in performing a hair transplant using the fue technique .however , there is greater pulling and twisting of grafts , which puts the graft at risk of damage , resulting in greater transection .notably these techniques have almost the same graft insertion but with a different donor harvesting process , and all of them have the same risk of donor site necrosis according to the above -

slit the scalp and put some of the grafts in the non - dangerous zone on the first day in a horseshoe pattern , and after 24 hours of reperfusion time for the dangerous zone and the other dark areas we continued to engraft the remaining slits . with this methodif colleagues decide to graft hair follicles in one session , we recommend slitting the scalp as the first step in the session , followed by a rest period of a few hours , with subsequent engraftment because more reperfusion time would decrease the ischemic insults that most likely occur as a result of angina of the scalp skin where demand of oxygen is greater than the supply to implanted hair follicles . based on our knowledge ,this is the first study regarding the recipient scalp necrosis which compares several cases of necrosis and provides a method for prevention of this vascular catastrophe .in order to prevent development of recipient area necrosis following a hair transplant procedure , graft insertion ideally should occur 24 hours following dense slitting . in our method , we recommend dense slitting the scalp with some engraftment in the non - dangerous zones on the first day in a horseshoe pattern with a 24-hour rest reperfusion time for danger zones and other dark areas . following this , we recommend engrafting of the slits .adequate reperfusion time is required to allow for appropriate development of implanted hairs and prevents development of necrosis . in our experience , with this method we have performed many dense packing hair transplantation processes without any vascular compromise .","answer":"hair restoration is a safe procedure and most of its associated complications are preventable by the surgeon and/or the patient .  recipient area necrosis is rare but arises when an increased number of recipient grafts are utilized and de -

Unfortunately, the common mean-field approach requires analytical solutions of expectations w.r.t. the approximate posterior, which are also intractable in the general case. We show how a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a simple differentiable unbiased estimator of the lower bound; this SGVB (Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes) estimator can be used for efficient approximate posterior inference in almost any model with continuous latent variables and/or parameters, and is straightforward to optimize using standard stochastic gradient ascent techniques. For the case of an i.i.d. dataset and continuous latent variables per datapoint, we propose the Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB) algorithm. In the AEVB algorithm we make inference and learning especially efficient by using the SGVB estimator to optimize a recognition model that allows us to perform very efficient approximate posterior inference using simple ancestral sampling, which in turn allows us to efficiently learn the model parameters, without the need of expensive iterative inference schemes (such as MCMC) per datapoint. The learned approximate posterior inference model can also be used for a host of tasks such as recognition, denoising, representation and visualization purposes. When a neural network is used for the recognition model, we arrive at the variational auto-encoder. In this section weâll give an example where we use a neural network for the probabilistic encoder q_{boldsymbol{phi}}(mathbf{z}|mathbf{x}) (the approximation to the posterior of the generative model p_{boldsymbol{theta}}(mathbf{x},mathbf{z})) and where the parameters boldsymbol{phi} and boldsymbol{theta} are optimized jointly with the AEVB algorithm. The AEVB algorithm exposes a connection between directed probabilistic models (trained with a variational objective) and auto-encoders. A connection between linear auto-encoders and a certain class of generative linear-Gaussian models has long been known. In Â [Row98] it was shown that PCA corresponds to the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution of a special case of the linear-Gaussian model with a prior p(mathbf{z})=mathcal{N}(0,mathbf{I}) and a conditional distribution p(mathbf{x}|mathbf{z})=mathcal{N}(mathbf{x};mathbf{W}mathbf{z},epsilonmathbf{I}), specifically the case with infinitesimally small epsilon. We compared performance of AEVB to the wake-sleep algorithmÂ [HDFN95]. We employed the same encoder (also called recognition model) for the wake-sleep algorithm and the variational auto-encoder. All parameters, both variational and generative, were initialized by random sampling from mathcal{N}(0,0.01), and were jointly stochastically optimized using the MAP criterion. Stepsizes were adapted with AdagradÂ [DHS10]; the Adagrad global stepsize parameters were chosen from {0.01, 0.02, 0.1} based on performance on the training set in the first few iterations. Minibatches of size M=100 were used, with L=1 samples per datapoint.Question: What are the steps in AEVB algorithm?","answer":"The AEVB algorithm connects between directed probabilistic models(trained with a variational objective) and auto-encoders.

Oxyradical damage to phospholipids results in the production of reactive aldehydes that adduct proteins and modulate their function. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), a common product of oxidative damage to lipids, adducts proteins at exposed Cys, His, or Lys residues. Here, we demonstrate that peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase A1 (Pin1), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the peptide bond of pSer/pThr-Pro moieties in signaling proteins from cis to trans, is highly susceptible to HNE modification. Incubation of purified Pin1 with HNE followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry resulted in detection of Michael adducts at the active site residues His-157 and Cys-113. Time and concentration dependencies indicate that Cys-113 is the primary site of HNE modification. Pin1 was adducted in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with 8-alkynyl-HNE as judged by click chemistry conjugation with biotin followed by streptavidin-based pulldown and Western blotting with anti-Pin1 antibody. Furthermore, orbitrap MS data support the adduction of Cys-113 in the Pin1 active site upon HNE treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells. siRNA knockdown of Pin1 in MDA-MB-231 cells partially protected the cells from HNE-induced toxicity. Recent studies indicate that Pin1 is an important molecular target for the chemopreventive effects of green tea polyphenols. The present study establishes that it is also a target for electrophilic modification by products of lipid peroxidation.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"His\\", \\"biotin\\", \\"pThr\\", \\"polyphenols\\", \\"8-alkynyl-HNE\\", \\"Lys\\", \\"4-Hydroxynonenal\\", \\"HNE\\", \\"prolyl\\", \\"Pro\\", \\"pSer\\", \\"aldehydes\\", \\"Cys\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase A1\\", \\"Pin1\\", \\"peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase A1\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

INTRODUCTION 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Industry investment and research interest in edge computing, in which computing and storage nodes are placed at the Internet's edge in close proximity to mobile devices or sensors, have grown dramatically in recent years. This emerging technology promises to deliver highly responsive cloud services for mobile computing, scalability and privacy-policy enforcement for the Internet of Things, and the ability to mask transient cloud outages. The web extra at www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmrZVvFtthdP3fwHPy_4d61oDvQY_RBgS includes a five-video playlist demonstrating proof-of-concept implementations for three tasks: assembling 2D Lego models, freehand sketching, and playing Ping-Pong. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Abstract Cloud computing with its services models (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) and its characteristics such as (on demand services, rapid elastics, and scalability) still has a number of problems that prevent some applications from the advantages of this computing paradigm. The long distance between the end-users and the cloud server might be the biggest issue for some real time applications, such as online gaming and content delivery, in term of latency. Fog computing is an emerging paradigm used to solve some issues in cloud computing. It empowers deploying the resources and the services at the edge of the network that is close to end users. The use of streaming services for sensor networking applications is a very important model in machine-to- machine paradigm of communication. In this paper we propose a system for content delivery services for mobile users using fog computing. The fog nodes are distributed at the edge of the network, in the middle between the cloud and mobile users. These nodes receive requests from the users and respond to each request either immediately, in case the service is already downloaded in the fog server, or by bringing the servers either from the cloud server or other fog nodes. The fog nodes are represented as server using COAP protocol. As expected, the results show fog computing provides low response time against the cloud computing. The results also, investigate the power consumption of mobile users for the four dierent modes, Low power mode, Transmission mode (Tx), Receiving mode (Rx), and CPU when they connect directly to fog servers. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  The amount of data generated by sensors, actuators, and other devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) has substantially increased in the last few years. IoT data are currently processed in the cloud, mostly through computing resources located in distant data centers. As a consequence, network bandwidth and communication latency become serious bottlenecks. This paper advocates edge computing for emerging IoT applications that leverage sensor streams to augment interactive applications. First, we classify and survey current edge computing architectures and platforms, then describe key IoT application scenarios that benefit from edge computing. Second, we carry out an experimental evaluation of edge computing and its enabling technologies in a selected use case represented by mobile gaming. To this end, we consider a resource-intensive 3-D application as a paradigmatic example and evaluate the response delay in different deployment scenarios. Our experimental results show that edge computing is necessary to meet the latency requirements of applications involving virtual and augmented reality. We conclude by discussing what can be achieved with current edge computing platforms and how emerging technologies will impact on the deployment of future IoT applications. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Neuromorphic computing is non-von Neumann computer architecture for the post Mooreâs law era of computing. Since a main focus of the post Mooreâs law era is energy-efficient computing with fewer resources and less area, neuromorphic computing contributes effectively in this research. In this paper, we present a memristive neuromorphic system for improved power and area efficiency. Our particular mixed-signal approach implements neural networks with spiking events in a synchronous way. Moreover, the use of nano-scale memristive devices saves both area and power in the system. We also provide device-level considerations that make the system more energy-efficient. The proposed system additionally includes synchronous digital long term plasticity, an online learning methodology that helps the system train the neural networks during the operation phase and improves the efficiency in learning considering the power consumption and area overhead. 5.

In this paper, we develop circuits and systems to achieve the optimized design of an HTM SP, an HTM TM, and a memristive analog pattern matcher for pattern recognition applications. The HTM SP realizes an optimized hardware design through the introduction of mean overlap calculations and by replacing the threshold determination in the inhibition stage with a weighted summation operator over the neighborhood of the pixel under consideration. HTM TM is based on discrete analog memristive memory arrays and a weight update procedure. The operation of the proposed system is demonstrated for a face recognition problem, using the standard AR, ORL, and Yale databases, and for speech recognition, using the TIMIT database, with achieved accuracies of 87.21% and approximately 90%, respectively, given an SNR of 10 dB. Visual data processing using binary HTM SP features requires less storage and processing memory than required by the traditional processing methods, with the area and power requirements for its implementation being 0.096 mm2 and 1756 mW, respectively. The design of the TM circuit for a single pixel requires 23.85 {mu}text{m}^{2} of area and 442.26 {mu}text{W} of power. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  The on-chip implementation of learning algorithms would speed up the training of neural networks in crossbar arrays. The circuit level design and implementation of a back-propagation algorithm using gradient descent operation for neural network architectures is an open problem. In this paper, we propose analog backpropagation learning circuits for various memristive learning architectures, such as deep neural network, binary neural network, multiple neural network, hierarchical temporal memory, and long short-term memory. The circuit design and verification are done using TSMC 180-nm CMOS process models and TiO2-based memristor models. The application level validations of the system are done using XOR problem, MNIST character, and Yale face image databases. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  This paper presents a survey of the currently available hardware designs for implementation of the human cortex inspired algorithm, Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). In this review, we focus on the state-of-the-art advances of memristive HTM implementation and related HTM applications. With the advent of edge computing, HTM can be a potential algorithm to implement on-chip near sensor data processing. The comparison of analog memristive circuit implementations with the digital and mixed-signal solutions is provided. The advantages of memristive HTM over digital implementations against performance metrics such as processing speed, reduced on-chip area, and power dissipation are discussed. The limitations and open problems concerning the memristive HTM, such as the design scalability, sneak currents, leakage, parasitic effects, lack of the analog learning circuits implementations, and unreliability of the memristive devices integrated with CMOS circuits are also discussed. 8. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB008):  Long-short term memory (LSTM) is a cognitive architecture that aims to mimic the sequence temporal memory processes in human brain. The state and time-dependent based processing of events is essential to enable contextual processing in several applications such as natural language processing, speech recognition and machine translations. There are many different variants of LSTM and almost all of them are software based. The hardware implementation of LSTM remains as an open problem. In this work, we propose a hardware implementation of LSTM system using memristors. Memristor has proved to mimic behavior of a biological synapse and has promising properties such as smaller size and absence of current leakage among others, making it a suitable element for designing LSTM functions. Sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions hardware realization can be performed by using a CMOS-memristor threshold logic circuit. These ideas can be extended for a practical application of implementing sequence learning in real-time sensory processing data. 9. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB009):  Recent breakthroughs in recurrent deep neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units have led to major advances in artificial intelligence. However, state-of-the-art LSTM models with significantly increased complexity and a large number of parameters have a bottleneck in computing power resulting from both limited memory capacity and limited data communication bandwidth. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the synaptic weights shared in different time steps in an LSTM can be implemented with a memristor crossbar array, which has a small circuit footprint, can store a large number of parameters and offers in-memory computing capability that contributes to circumventing the âvon Neumann bottleneckâ. We illustrate the capability of our crossbar system as a core component in solving real-world problems in regression and classification, which shows that memristor LSTM is a promising low-power and low-latency hardware platform for edge inference.Literature Review:","answer":"T HE increase in the number of edge devices such as mobile phones, and wearable electronics connected to Internet drives the scale-up of intelligent data applications.

The high velocity and volume of data generated lead to the need to scale up data centers, and puts added pressure on lowering energy consumption.

This study aim ed to assess the effectiveness of a targeted school-based dental screening program in terms of the proportion of children with dental care needs it identified . METHODS The target population was all children in junior and senior kindergarten and grade s 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 who attended schools in four Ontario communities . The study was conducted in a r and om sample of 38 schools stratified according to caries risk .  Universal screening was implemented in these schools . The parents of all children identified as having dental care needs were sent a short question naire to document the sociodemographic and family characteristics of these children . Children with needs were divided into two groups : those who would and who would not have been identified had the targeted program been implemented . The characteristics of the two groups were compared . RESULTS Overall , 21.0 percent of the target population were identified as needing dental care , with 7.4 percent needing urgent care . The targeted program would have identified 43.5 percent of those with dental care needs and 58.0 percent of those with urgent needs . There were substantial differences across the four communities in the proportions identified by the targeted program . Identification rates were lowest when the difference in prevalence of need between the high- and low-risk groups was small and where the low-risk group was large in relation to the high-risk group . The targeted program was more effective at identifying children from disadvantaged background s. Of those with needs who lived in households receiving government income support , 59.0 percent of those with needs and 80.1 percent of those with urgent needs would be identified . CONCLUSIONS The targeted program was most effective at identifying children with dental care needs from disadvantaged background s. However , any improvements in cost effectiveness achieved by targeting must be balanced against inequities in access to public health care re sourcesTitle 2:The development of a consensus among primary care dentists of referral criteria for school dental screeningAbstract 2:Objective To obtain consensus amongst a sample of primary care dentists in the North West of Engl and on a set of clinical criteria that should trigger referral following school dental screening . Design Delphi process . Setting Primary dental care , Engl and 2002 Method Primary care dentists in the North West of Engl and were r and omly selected to complete a two round ' Delphi exercise ' that included 10 potential referral criteria . The dentists were invited to express their level of support for the inclusion of each referral criterion . Main outcome measures Level of agreement for each referral criterion . Acceptance of any criterion was that the interquartile range should be no more than 3 scale points with the lower value being no less than 7 . Results Eighty-eight dentists , ( 72.7 % ) , completed the Delphi exercise . Six referral criteria met with the groups ' approval : Child with caries in permanent dentitionChild with darkened/discoloured permanent incisorsChild aged 9 - 10 years with overjet greater than 10 mmChild over six years with either gross plaque , calculus or swollen gumsChild with evidence of sepsisChild registered with a GDP with caries in permanent dentition . Conclusion It is possible for a representative sample of primary care dentists in the North West to agree referral criteria following school dental screeningTitle 3:A randomised control trial of the effectiveness of personalised letters sent subsequent to school dental inspections in increasing registration in unregistered childrenAbstract 3:Background Recent studies have cast doubt on the effectiveness and efficiency of school based dental screening programmes in improving dental attendance or improving dental health . In 2002 the National Dental Inspection Programme was introduced in Scotl and which categorises children by their dental health and informs parents of the findings via a personalised letter home and encourages dental registration . In addition , epidemiological data for local and national planning purpose s is collected . This replaced an earlier school screening system in Lothian where a generic letter urging registration was sent to children who were identified as not being registered with a dentist . The objective of this study is to compare dental registration s rates among unregistered children in these two school inspection systems with a system where letters were sent home but no dental inspection was carried out . Methods The study was design ed as a single blinded , cluster r and omised , controlled trial involving 12,765 12â13-year-old children attending all 65 state Secondary schools in Lothian and Fife during the academic year 2003/4.After stratifying for school size and range of social deprivation , schools were r and omly allocated to one of four groups:1 . ' Traditional ' inspection , letter to unregistered children only,2 . Letter sent home to unregistered children only , no inspection,3 . National Dental Inspection Programme , letter to all children,4 . Control group in which the children were neither inspected nor sent a letter .  Dental Registration status was compared at baseline and 3 months post inspection . Results The registration levels in both the ' Traditional ' screening and the NDIP inspection groups rose 3 months post inspection ( 14 % and 15.8 % respectively ) but were not significantly different from one another or the control group which rose by 15.8 % ( p > 0.05 ) . The group who were sent a letter home but were not inspected also has a rise in registration levels of 18.1 % which was not significantly different from either of the groups who were inspected or the control group ( p > 0.05 ) . The only significant predictors of registration were previous registration ( p < 0.05 ) and within those who previously registered , the length of time since last registration ( P < 0.001 ) . Conclusion Neither of the two dental inspection methods nor a letter home to unregistered children result ed in a significant rise in registration rates in 12â13-year-olds compared to a control group of children who received no interventionTitle 4:Impacts on daily performances attributed to malocclusions by British adolescents.Abstract 4:The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of condition-specific impacts on daily performances attributed to malocclusion in British adolescents . Two hundred 16- to 17-year-old adolescents were r and omly selected from 957 children attending a public college in London , UK . During interviews , participants provided information about demographic variables and socio-dental impacts on quality of life attributed to malocclusions , using the Condition-Specific form of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances ( CS-OIDP ) index . Adolescents were also clinical ly examined using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need . Statistical comparison by covariates was performed using chi-squared test and chi-squared test for trends . The prevalence of oral impacts on daily performances attributed to any oral condition was 26.5 % whereas the prevalence of CS-OIDP attributed to malocclusion was 21.5 % . There was no statistically significant difference by sex , age , ethnicity or orthodontic treatment status of schoolchildren in the prevalence of CS-OIDP attributed to malocclusion ( P > /= 0.243 for all cases ) . However , there was a linear trend for the prevalence of CS-OIDP attributed to malocclusion , by level of normative orthodontic treatment need ( P = 0.042 ) . The prevalence of such impacts increased from 16.8 % for adolescents with no/slight need for orthodontic treatment , to 31.7 % for those with definite need for orthodontic treatment . Although findings support the idea that malocclusion has physical , psychological and social effects on quality of life of these adolescents , the inconsistencies in findings between the self-reports of impacts of malocclusion and the assessment of normative needs highlight the shortcomings of using only clinical indexes to estimate orthodontic treatment needsTitle 5:The effectiveness of school dental screening: dental attendance and treatment of those screened positiveAbstract 5:Objective To determine dental attendance and treatment outcomes following two models of dental screening . Design An observational prospect i ve cohort study . Setting Infant , primary and junior schools in the North West of Engl and .Subjects Children aged six to nine years at the start of the study . Interventions Subjects received a screening examination according to either a ' Traditional model ' or ' New model ' of school dental screeningMain outcome measures Attendance at a dentist within four months of the intervention and treatment received by children referred via the ' New model  ' with caries in their permanent teeth . Results In the ' New model ' of school dental screening 46 % of screened positive and 41 % of screened negative children attended a dentist during the study period . Some 44 % of children referred with caries in permanent teeth attended a dentist and 53 % of those attending received treatment for the referred condition . Larger proportions of children from disadvantaged background s were screened positive but higher proportions of children from more affluent background s attended the dentist and subsequently received treatment . Conclusion School dental screening has a minimal impact on dental attendance and only a small proportion of screened positive children receive appropriate treatment . The programme fails to reduce inequalities in utilisation of dental servicesTitle 6:The effect of school dental screening on dental attendance. The results of a randomised controlled trial.Abstract 6:The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a school dental screening in encouraging school children aged 4 to 6 years to visit a dentist . One thous and five hundred and sixty-two children attending the 13 primary schools in Wallasey . Merseyside , were examined by a single trained examiner ; those with urgent treatment needs or evidence of recent treatment were excluded . The remaining 528 children with signs of dental caries were entered into the study . Children within each school were stratified by age , sex and number of carious teeth and then allocated at r and om to test and control groups . Parents of children in the test group were advised by letter that their child would benefit from a more detailed clinical examination . A reply slip was attached to the letter and non-responders were carefully followed up . The control group received no such interventions . After 4 months , data on dental visits by both test and control group children were extracted from clinical records . Attendance data were obtained for 262 children ( 97 per cent ) in the test group and 243 children ( 94 per cent ) in the control group . Seventy-three per cent of the test group and 42 per cent of the control group visited the dentist over the review period ; the difference of 31 per cent favour of the test group was statistically significant . Attendances at both general dental practitioners and community dental clinics were increased . The effect of the screening procedure was seen particularly in areas of lower socio-economic status . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDSTitle 7:The Effectiveness of School Dental Screening: a Cluster-randomized Control TrialAbstract 7:Dental  screening of children in schools is undertaken in many countries . There is no evidence that this activity is effective . The objective of our study was to determine if school dental screening of children reduces untreated disease or improves attendance at the population level . A four-arm cluster-r and omized controlled trial was undertaken in the northwest of Engl and . In total , 16,864 children aged 6â9 years in 168 schools were r and omly allocated to 3 test groups , which received screening according to different models , and a control , which received no intervention . There were no significant differences in caries increment in the primary and secondary dentitions or in the proportions of children attending a dentist after screening between the control group and the 3 intervention arms . School dental screening delivered according to 3 different models was not effective at reducing levels of active caries and increasing attendance in the population under studyTitle 8:Does school-based dental screening for children increase follow-up treatment at dental school clinics?Abstract 8:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a screening program and referral system in stimulating dental attendance of children in need of treatment at Bapuji Dental College and Hospital of Davangere , India . A total of fourteen schools in the Davangere area were selected r and omly and divided into two groups : seven schools that had a dental screening program ( study group , n=2100 children ) , and seven schools that did not have one ( control group , n=2400 children ) . The attendance rate by members of the study group was determined during the three-month period from the date of initiating the school screening program . During this same period the students who visited the college from the control group underwent a dental examination . Chi-square tests were used to test the difference between different variables . The response rate for seeking treatment was 31 percent for the study group ( 34.2 percent for males ; 26.2 percent for females ) and 10 percent for the control group ( 9.6 percent for males ; 10.5 percent for females ) . In both the groups , the treatment need was highest for dental caries ( study group=36.3 percent , control group=11.1 percent ) and least for fluorosis ( study group=21.2 percent , control group=1.2 percent ) . The study demonstrated that  screening  and motivation significantly improved the percentage of school children who sought dental careTitle 9:Effectiveness of the school dental screening programme in stimulating dental attendance for children in need of treatment in Northern Ireland.Abstract 9:UNLABELLED The school dental screening programme has been in existence from the beginning of the 20th century yet its value in encouraging attendance among children with a dental health need is not fully established . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of school dental screening in promoting dental attendance among children with a treatment need and to examine the relative importance of screening , social class and other factors in dental attendance . METHODS Sixty-four participating schools were assigned to study and control groups using a stratified , blocked r and omisation technique . The study group children received the st and ard school dental screening and the dental attendance of those with a positive screening result was assessed after 2 months by means of a question naire issued to the children 's parents . The control group children were not , at this stage , screened , yet their parents received the same question naire assessing dental attendance  over the 2-month period . However , only question naires from control group children who had a positive result at a subsequent screening were retained for analysis . RESULTS A total of 2,321 children were screened , with 980 having a positive result . The mean dmft of those screening positive was 4.85 . In all , 664 completed question naires were returned , giving a response rate of 67.8 % . Dental attendance was reported among 45.5 % of the study group ( n=352 ) in the 2 months following screening . In the same period , 27.6 % of the control group ( n=312 ) cl aim ed attendance . The effect was found to be significant among the high employed group ( P<0.01 ) and the unemployed group ( P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSION School dental screening was capable of stimulating dental attendance . The strong effect among the lowest socio-economic group shows that school dental screening may be used to decrease dental health inequalities","answer":"There is currently no evidence to support or refute the clinical benefits or harms of dental screening .CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Evidence from the review ed trials suggests no clinical benefit from school-based screening in improving  children 's oral health ."},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

Existing methods rely on various kinds of explicit filter construction or hand-designed objective functions. It is thus difficult to understand, improve, and accelerate them in a coherent framework. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach to construct a joint filter based on Convolution-al Neural Networks. In contrast to existing methods that consider only the guidance image, our method can selectively transfer salient structures that are consistent in both guidance and target images. We show that the model trained on a certain type of data, e.g., RGB and depth images, generalizes well for other modalities, e.g., Flash/Non-Flash and RGB/NIR images. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint filter through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.","answer":"[[\\"learning-based approach\\", \\"modalities\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"Joint image filters\\", \\"enhancing spatial resolution\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"learning-based approach\\", \\"transfer salient structures\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"Existing methods\\", \\"learning-based approach\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"explicit filter construction\\", \\"Existing methods\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"data\\", \\"learning-based approach\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"guidance image\\", \\"Joint image filters\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"explicit filter construction\\", \\"hand-designed objective functions\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"hand-designed objective functions\\", \\"Existing methods\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"suppressing noise\\", \\"enhancing spatial resolution\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"coherent framework\\", \\"Existing methods\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"Convolution-al Neural Networks\\", \\"learning-based approach\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"guidance image\\", \\"Existing methods\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"RGB and depth images\\", \\"data\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"Flash/Non-Flash and RGB/NIR images\\", \\"modalities\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"Joint image filters\\", \\"state-of-the-art methods\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"Joint image filters\\", \\"suppressing noise\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"learning-based approach\\", \\"Joint image filters\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Paclitaxel (Taxol) is an anticancer drug that induces mitotic arrest via microtubule hyperstabilization but causes side effects due to its hydrophobicity and cellular promiscuity. The targeted cytotoxicity of hydrophilic paclitaxel-conjugated polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers has been demonstrated in cultured cancer cells. Mechanisms of action responsible for this cytotoxicity are unknown, that is, whether the cytotoxicity is due to paclitaxel stabilization of microtubules, as is whether paclitaxel is released intracellularly from the dendrimer. To determine whether the conjugated paclitaxel can bind microtubules, we used a combination of ensemble and single microtubule imaging techniques in vitro. We demonstrate that these conjugates adversely affect microtubules by (1) promoting the polymerization and stabilization of microtubules in a paclitaxel-dependent manner, and (2) bundling preformed microtubules in a paclitaxel-independent manner, potentially due to protonation of tertiary amines in the dendrimer interior. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel-conjugated PAMAM dendrimers and uncover unexpected risks of using such conjugates therapeutically.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"PAMAM\\", \\"Taxol\\", \\"paclitaxel\\", \\"polyamidoamine\\", \\"tertiary amines\\", \\"Paclitaxel\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

To evaluate response to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) and etoposide (VP-16) in patients who did not respond to mitoxantrone and cytarabine.  Patients And Methods Patients with relapsed/refractory AML (n = 101) and secondary AML (n = 13) were entered.  results mitoxantrone and cytarabine induction achieved a remission rate of 76% for relapsed/refractory patients and 77% for patients with secondary AML, with a 3% induction mortality rate. Cytarabine and etoposide intensification exceeded the acceptable toxic death rate of 10 % . The response rate of 2-CDA/VP-16 was 8%. Two-year overall survival was estimated at 24% and was better than historical control data. Patients with secondary AML had similar outcomes to relapsed or refractory patients. Initial remission longer than 1 year was the most important prognostic factor for patients with primary AML (2-year survival rate, 75%), whereas for patients with primary AML, with less than 12 months of initial remission, survival was 13% and was similar to that of refractory patients (6%).  conclusion mitoxantrone and cytarabine induction is effective with reasonable toxicity in patients with relapsed/refractory or secondary AML. The cytarabine and etoposide intensification regimen should be abandoned because of toxicity.

Despite the progress in understanding the biology of the pathogenesis of glioma made during the past decade, the clinical outcome of patients with GBM remains still poor. Deregulation of many signaling pathways involved in growth, survival, migration and resistance to treatment has been implicated in pathogenesis of GBM. One of these pathways is phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) / rapamycin-sensitive mTOR-complex (mTOR) pathway, intensively studied and widely described so far. Much less attention has been paid to the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 Î² (GSK3Î²), a target of AKT.

We were therefore surprised to find that a single fimbrial gene reconstitution can return the virulence-attenuated commensal strain Escherichia coli 83972 to virulence, defined by a disease phenotype in human hosts. E. coli 83972pap stably reprogrammed host gene expression, by activating an acute pyelonephritis-associated, IRF7-dependent gene network. The PapG protein was internalized by human kidney cells and served as a transcriptional agonist of IRF-7, IFN-Î² and MYC, suggesting direct involvement of the fimbrial adhesin in this process. IRF-7 was further identified as a potent upstream regulator(-log( p-value) = 61), consistent with the effects in inoculated patients. In contrast, E. coli 83972fim transiently attenuated overall gene expression in human hosts, enhancing the effects of E. coli 83972. The inhibition of RNA processing and ribosomal assembly indicated a homeostatic rather than a pathogenic end-point. In parallel, the expression of specific ion channels and neuropeptide gene networks was transiently enhanced, in a FimH-dependent manner. The studies were performed to establish protective asymptomatic bacteriuria in human hosts and the reconstituted E. coli 83972 variants were developed to improve bacterial fitness for the human urinary tract. Unexpectedly, P fimbriae were able to drive a disease response, suggesting that like oncogene addiction in cancer, pathogens may be addicted to single super-virulence factors.Introduction:Mucosal surfaces provide ideal living conditions for the normal flora but paradoxically, they also serve as attack sites for numerous bacterial pathogens that cause extensive morbidity and mortality. Understanding this dichotomy is critical for efforts to selectively target and remove pathogens without disturbing the commensal flora or its protective effects. The complex nature of disease predicts that virulence is multifaceted and that pathogens need multiple virulence factors to initiate tissue attack, disrupt immune homeostasis and create symptoms and pathology[1â8]. It is also well established that commensals fail to cause disease, due to a lack of critical virulence genes[9, 10]. About 50% of asymptomatic bacteriuria( ABU) isolates have a smaller genome size than acute pyelonephritis strains due, in part, to inactivating virulence gene deletions or point mutations[11â13]. These strains continue to accumulate loss of function mutations in vivo, supporting the notion of a virtually irreversible reductive evolution process, where spontaneous recovery of a virulent phenotype is not likely to occur. Surprisingly, these loss-of-function mutations also affect fimbrial subunits and adhesin genes[13], which are thought to be essential for bacterial persistence at mucosal sites[14â21]. Adhesive ligands arm bacteria with molecular tools to identify preferred tissue sites and attachment plays a decisive role in colonization and long-term adaptation. Certain fimbrial adhesins are ubiquitously expressed by commensals and pathogens alike, suggesting a homeostatic role. Others, in contrast, show a strong disease association in epidemiologic studies[14], suggesting more direct effects on pathobiology[22]. The urinary tract supports ABU; a commensal-like state[23], which has been shown to prevent super-infection with more virulent strains[24â27]. To reproduce this protective effect, we have established a protocol to create ABU, by inoculating patients with the ABU strain E. coli 83972[28, 29]. The therapeutic efficacy and safety of this procedure has been documented in placebo-controlled studies in patients with incomplete bladder voiding[30]. Genome sequencing of E. coli 83972 has revealed a general âloss of virulenceâ phenotype, which includes fimbrial genes[13, 31â33]. E. coli 83972 lacks functional P or type 1 fimbriae, due to attenuating point mutations in the papG adhesin gene and a large, inactivating deletion in the fim gene cluster[13]. Both fimbrial types have been proposed to enhance bacterial persistence in the urinary tract.Discussion:Bacterial pathogens have evolved sophisticated molecular strategies to colonize the appropriate host niche and adherence is an essential first step to enhance their virulence[39]. Like pathogens, commensals have evolved adhesive surface ligands to enhance their fitness, but the outcome is very different, suggesting that the quality of the adhesive interactions may distinguish commensals from pathogens( Fig 9). Here, we address this question by comparing P fimbriae, which are expressed by uropathogenic E. coli strains[49] to type 1 fimbriae, which are expressed among Gram-negative bacteria, with no apparent disease association. By reconstituting the pap or fim gene clusters in the non-virulent E. coli strain 83972 and inoculating human hosts with the fimbriated variants of this strain, we have had the unique opportunity to study fimbrial function and define molecular effects in human hosts. We made the unexpected observation that the acquisition of functional P fimbriae made the ABU strain virulent in two susceptible hosts. This is explained mechanistically by bacterial reprogramming of host gene expression, including the activation of IRF-7; a transcription factor that defines tissue pathology in the murine pyelonephritis model[8]. The PapG adhesin is identified as a transcriptional IRF7 agonist, in the context of IRF-3, IFN-Î² and MYC. We contrast this effect against type 1 fimbriae, which transiently inhibited genes involved in RNA processing and activated the expression of ion-channels and neuro-transmitters, with no evidence of symptoms in the host. Rather than reprogramming host gene expression, type 1 fimbriae broadly enhanced the inhibitory effects of the non-fimbriated wild type strain, suggesting a more homeostatic function. This does not exclude, however, a virulence-enhancing effect of the fimbriae, when expressed in the background of a fully virulent strain[50, 51]. The findings illustrate the remarkably divergent effects of fimbriae in the infected host. The rationale for this study was clinical, as protective effects of E. coli 83972 inoculation have been documented, in placebo-controlled studies[29]. Fimbriae were introduced in an attempt to increase the fitness of E. coli 83972 for the urinary tract and extend the use of human inoculation therapy. There was no indication from earlier human studies that P fimbriae alone would cause a disease-like response in inoculated hosts[49, 52] and unlike fully virulent strains, E. coli 83972pap did not activate a disease response in the murine UTI model. UPEC-associated virulence genes are attenuated in E. coli 83972 and even after prolonged carriage further attenuation of virulence has been shown to occur, suggesting that the strains evolve towards commensalism[13]. It is important to emphasize that E. coli 83972pap is sensitive to antibiotics and that antibiotic therapy resulted in rapid resolution of symptoms and infection, without sequels. These observations suggest, for the first time, that type 1 fimbriae may have potent inhibitory effects on the post-transcriptional machinery of the host, as E. coli 83972fim inhibited genes involved in RNA processing and translation. In addition we observed a rapid activation of K+ channels and solute carriers, as well as neuropeptides and their receptors, providing novel mechanistic insights into potential homeostatic effects and mechanism to broadly regulate cellular functions. Consistent with previous studies, NK cell function and integrin signaling was moderately affected by E. coli 83972fim( Fig 9B). A lack of distinct upstream transcriptional regulators suggested an entirely different level of control of the host response compared to P fimbriae, mainly executed at the post-transcriptional level. While type 1 fimbriae have been shown to increase mucosal inflammation in the murine UTI model and promote the formation of intracellular communities, type 1 fimbriae alone did not act as virulence factors in this study, when expressed in the background of a non-virulent strain. The dual role of P fimbriae as bacterial sensors and transcriptional regulators is fascinating and challenges the dogma that virulence must rely on a complex set of virulence genes in every case. The difference between P and type 1 fimbriae further suggests that the repertoire of regulated host genes may distinguish disease-generating adhesins like P fimbriae from adhesive ligands that are involved in more homeostatic tissue functions. Based on these findings, we propose that bacteria may suffer from âvirulence gene addictionâ, in analogy with the âoncogene addictionâ of cancer cells[53, 54]. While pathogens generally rely on multiple genes to survive in the host[55] this study suggests that a single, potent virulence determinant may be sufficient to enhance or attenuate virulence. It follows that a loss of P fimbria would represent a first step towards virulence attenuation and adaptation to long-term persistence in the urinary tract. This is supported by a high frequency of inactivating papG mutations in ABU isolates[13]. The findings raise the question whether therapeutic efforts should be focused on âsuper-virulenceâ gene attenuation rather than on functions that help the normal flora to maintain homeostasis in the host.","answer":"Urinary tract infections affect millions of individuals annually , and many patients suffer from recurring infections several times a year .

Here we show that if the activity of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is increased by visual stimulation or using chemogenetics, their axons regenerate. We also show that if enhancement of neural activity is combined with elevation of the cell-growth -promoting pathway involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), RGC axons regenerate long distances and re-innervate the brain. Analysis of genetically labeled RGCs revealed that this regrowth can be target specific: RGC axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided targets incorrect for their function. Moreover, these regenerated connections were successful in partially rescuing a subset of visual behaviors. Our findings indicate that combining neural activity with activation of mTOR can serve as powerful tool for enhancing axon regeneration, and they highlight the remarkable capacity of CNS neurons to re-establish accurate circuit connections in adulthood.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"RGCs\\", \\"connections\\", \\"RGC\\", \\"retinal ganglion cells\\", \\"axons\\", \\"Axons\\", \\"retinal\\", \\"neurons\\", \\"brain\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"regrowth\\", \\"regenerate\\", \\"pathway\\", \\"cell-growth\\", \\"regeneration\\", \\"axon regeneration\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [\\"CNS\\"], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"mTOR\\", \\"mammalian target of rapamycin\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"mouse\\", \\"mammalian\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"findings\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"visual stimulation\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"injury\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"Analysis\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"elevation\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Importantly, how sequence architecture mediates this unmethylated state remains unclear. To address this question in a comprehensive manner, we developed a method to interrogate methylation states of hundreds of sequence variants inserted at the same genomic site in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this assay, we were able to quantify the contribution of various sequence motifs towards the resulting DNA methylation state. Modeling of this comprehensive dataset revealed that CG density alone is a minor determinant of their unmethylated state. Instead, these data argue for a principal role for transcription factor binding sites, a prediction confirmed by testing synthetic mutant libraries. Taken together, these findings establish the hierarchy between the two cis-encoded mechanisms that define the DNA methylation state and thus the transcriptional competence of CpG islands.Introduction:Multiple levels of regulation control correct expression level of a gene. In addition to transcription factors( TF), epigenetic signals enable temporal integration of regulatory events through dynamic processes including cell division and organism development. Considerable progress has been made in mapping the occurrence of various epigenetic marks during the course of mammalian development. This has refined our picture of the spatio-temporal occurrence of epigenetic marks, yet our mechanistic understanding on how their deposition is regulated remains limited. In mammals, methylation of DNA occurs mainly at cytosines lying in a CG context and its presence correlates with transcriptionally repressed states( Deaton and Bird, 2011; Jones, 2012). Unmethylated CGs are concentrated in regions that are unusually rich in CG dinucleotides as compared to the rest of the genome( Bird, 1980). The extrapolation of this observation led to the concept of CG islands( CGI), as an operational definition of regions that are likely unmethylated based on their sequence composition. Recently generated methylation maps at basepair resolution from several tissues and organisms have experimentally identified unmethylated regions at unprecedented detail( Hodges et al., 2011; Molaro et al., 2011; Stadler et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2013; Ziller et al., 2013). These datasets revealed that many unmethylated regions( UMRs) extend far beyond the CGI definition and that CGI can show variable levels of methylation( Meissner et al., 2008; Mohn et al., 2008; Doi et al., 2009; Hodges et al., 2011; Molaro et al., 2011; Stadler et al., 2011). Moreover, these studies identified CG poor regions outside of CGIs having low methylation levels( Low Methylated RegionsâLMRs)( Hodges et al., 2011; Stadler et al., 2011; Hon et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2013; Ziller et al., 2013). These findings challenged the notion that a simple sequence definition provides the most accurate prediction for the methylation state of a DNA sequence( Hodges et al., 2011; Molaro et al., 2011; Long et al., 2013b) and motivated to derive improved models to predict CGIs that integrate multiple genomic features( Bock et al., 2007; Wrzodek et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2013). Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed that contribute to an unmethylated state on the basis of their correlative occurrence with unmethylated regions of the genome( Deaton and Bird, 2011). From sequence perspective, these include binding of unmethylated CGs by CXXC domain containing proteins, which have been proposed to inhibit or counteract methyltransferase activity directly or through the establishment of a specific chromatin state( Ooi et al., 2007; Cedar and Bergman, 2009). This model would predict that local CG content is the sole determinant of the unmethylated state. Recent experiments suggested that classical transcription factors that bind motifs more complex than CG generally promote a hypomethylated states within CG poor region( Hodges et al., 2011; Stadler et al., 2011). Notably transcription factors have been previously implicated to impact activity but also methylation state of CGI( Brandeis et al., 1994; Macleod et al., 1994; Dickson et al., 2010; Lienert et al., 2011). Yet, it is inherently difficult to dissociate the effects of CGs and TF binding sites since both coincide at UMRs. Transgenic studies have argued that both local CG concentration and binding of transcription factors( TF) have a role in promoting low methylation levels( Brandeis et al., 1994; Macleod et al., 1994; Dickson et al., 2010; Lienert et al., 2011). The cumbersome nature of targeted genetics in mammals limited the scale of these experiments preventing generalization of the observed effects as well their translation into predictive models. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that genetic information is necessary and sufficient to instruct methylation states, opening the possibility to study the regulation of methylation states through genetic perturbation. However this requires a large number of sequence variations in order to be comprehensive, which is a general prerequisite and experimental bottleneck in the analysis of DNA sequence contribution to regulation of biological processes. In order to be informative, such experiments have to be performed in a controlled environment to minimize context related interference. Recently such approaches have been successfully developed to dissect the organization of cis-regulatory elements by generating large pools of sequence variants and measuring their effect on transcription using transient reporter gene assays( Melnikov et al., 2012; Patwardhan et al., 2012; Sharon et al., 2012; Arnold et al., 2013). Such transient assays however are not suitable to study chromatin regulation, which requires stable genomic integration of the sequences of interest at the same chromosomal locus to account for influences of copy number and local chromatin environment. To move beyond these limits, we developed an assay that allows parallel insertion of thousands of DNA fragments in a defined locus in murine embryonic stem cells( ESC). We isolated and synthesized various collections of DNA sequences in order to separately test the quantitative effect of sequence features proposed to influence methylation states. Parallel profiling of the methylation status of this catalogue of sequences allowed us to derive a comprehensive dataset that permits the systematic association between sequence motifs and methylation states. Using this information, we derive quantitative models describing the sequence determinants that govern the establishment of DNA methylation states. This surprisingly reveals that transcription factor binding sites are essential to explain the unmethylated state of the majority of CpG islands. We further demonstrate the utility of such datasets by explaining methylation changes observed in the course of normal differentiation. Moreover, we observe that deviation from the derived models is a characteristic hallmark of methylation changes associated with cancer states suggesting that this phenomenon is mechanistically distinct from differentiation related methylation changes.Discussion:In this study, we report a high-throughput genome engineering protocol and demonstrate its potential to determine the contribution of DNA sequence to the establishment of epigenetic states. We establish that DNA insertions at a given locus in mammalian genomes through RMCE can be performed with high complexity DNA libraries, opening the possibility to dissect regulatory mechanisms such as the ones that govern the establishment of DNA methylation patterns. In principle this approach can be adapted for any genomic readout( e. g. transcription or replication) in order to understand the interplay between multiple regulatory layers that function in cis. It further circumvents the limitations of previously used transient transfections( Melnikov et al., 2012; Patwardhan et al., 2012; Sharon et al., 2012; Arnold et al., 2013), which lack a proper chromosomal context and are not controlled for amount of sequence variants per cell and their copy number. We measured the ability of several thousand DNA sequence variants to acquire DNA methylation in mouse embryonic stem cells. The specific design and scale of the tested libraries enabled us to gain insights into the sequence determinants that drive the establishment of unmethylated states at CG rich regions and to build predictive models based on these methylation measurements and the underlying DNA sequence characteristics. One of our key findings is the quantification of the effect of CG density on methylation states. Surprisingly, while we confirm that CG density is sufficient to create an unmethylated state, only every second island harbors sequence stretches above that threshold( Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). Combined, these CG rich stretches only cover 30% of the total number of CGs that reside in islands. Mechanistically, it remains to be determined how CG richness drives unmethylated states, yet several scenarios are compatible with our observations. Proteins that specifically recognize unmethylated CG via a CXXC domain could antagonize de novo DNA methylation as previously proposed( Long et al., 2013a). Alternatively, presence of dinucleotide concentrations such as CG stretches could alter nucleosomal organization( Brogaard et al., 2012; Struhl and Segal, 2013) and thereby impact DNA methylation. Since, transcription factors and CG richness can both impact nucleosome positioning( Struhl and Segal, 2013), it is tempting to speculate that nucleosome depletion could be a unifying principle underlying the formation of unmethylated regions. Our data suggest that a key driver of hypomethylated states is the local binding of transcription factors. Others and we have recently shown that TF binding creates reduced methylation at CG poor regulatory regions such as tissue specific enhancers( Hodges et al., 2011; Stadler et al., 2011), a finding that extends to CG rich regions. Their methylation however is less dynamic during cellular differentiation since most CGIs are constitutively active as promoters of housekeeping genes. Moreover the effect driven by CG density is stable across cell types restricting the amplitude of the changes. Our data argue that the higher the CG content, the lower the TF dependent changes in methylation and vice versa. This scenario explains mechanistically why unmethylated regions frequently extend beyond CGI definitions( Hodges et al., 2011; Molaro et al., 2011; Long et al., 2013b) and predict that the methylation changes at borders of CG rich regions( also referred to as CGI shores( Doi et al., 2009)) are a function of TF binding. Importantly however the observed variability in methylation is not restricted to any particular location within CGIs but is only defined by local CG frequency. We believe it is important to account for this property when studying differential methylation patterns. We identified a striking contrast in the type of CGs affected by methylation changes within CG rich regions during normal differentiation vs those that occur during transformation to a cancerous state. Notably it is not individual cytosines that are predictive for cancer, as these vary widely between types, but it is rather the class of CGs affected as defined by our CG density model. While the nature of this predictive difference remains unknown, we note that unlike methylation changes occurring during normal cellular changes, the loss of TF binding is unlikely to explain the observed differences. Hypermethylation in cancer particularly targets CGIs that control genes that are inactive( Gebhard et al., 2010; Berman et al., 2012; Sproul et al., 2012). Moreover, the study of cancer methylomes revealed that hyper-methylated CGIs were embedded within larger domains of intermediate methylation( Partially Methylated DomainsâPMDs)( Hansen et al., 2011; Berman et al., 2012). If CGI methylation changes within PMD's are a general phenomenon it might indicate that the observed changes at CGIs in cancer reflect the loss of the local sequence autonomy in determining correct DNA methylation. The observation that TF binding contributes substantially to hypomethylation at CGIs has potential implications for their evolutionary origin as it is compatible with the idea that the emergence of CG rich regions could have occurred indirectly through TF-driven demethylation and resulting reduced C to T transition. This is in line with reports of limited positive selection for the CG content of islands( Cohen et al., 2011; Molaro et al., 2011) and that nucleotide composition including CG frequencies vary substantially between unmethylated regions across vertebrates( Long et al., 2013b). Thus our findings support the notion that CGIs arose as an evolutionary footprint of ancient regulatory regions. Such scenario is still compatible with a subsequent specialization of proteins such as CFP1 or KDM2A to recognize unmethylated CGs by CXXC domains in order to target chromatin processes to regulatory regions( Blackledge et al., 2010; Thomson et al., 2010).","answer":"Regions of DNA called genes produce the proteins and other molecules that are essential for life .

New methods for optical stimulation and optical recording of neurons make it possible to map circuit connectivity on a very large scale. However, single synapses produce small responses that are difficult to measure on a large scale. Here I analyze how single synaptic responses may be detectable using relatively coarse readouts such as optical recording of somatic calcium. I model a network consisting of 10, 000 input axons and 100 CA1 pyramidal neurons, each represented using 19 compartments with voltage-gated channels and calcium dynamics. As single synaptic inputs cannot produce a measurable somatic calcium response, I stimulate many inputs as a baseline to elicit somatic action potentials leading to a strong calcium signal. I compare statistics of responses with or without a single axonal input riding on this baseline. Through simulations I show that a single additional input shifts the distribution of the number of output action potentials. Stochastic resonance due to probabilistic synaptic release makes this shift easier to detect. With â¼80 stimulus repetitions this approach can resolve up to 35% of individual activated synapses even in the presence of 20% recording noise. While the technique is applicable using conventional electrical stimulation and extracellular recording, optical methods promise much greater scaling, since the number of synapses scales as the product of the number of inputs and outputs. I extrapolate from current high-speed optical stimulation and recording methods, and show that this approach may scale up to the order of a million synapses in a single two-hour slice-recording experiment.Introduction:The neuronal wiring diagram of many mammalian brain regions is known in a statistical sense, but not at the level of individual neurons[1]. The hippocampal CA3 to CA1 region is a particularly simple circuit with considerable functional relevance in memory, and is therefore an interesting test case for working out detailed connectivity. An idealized way to work out the neuronal connection matrix( Figure 1F) is to stimulate one input neuron at a time, record the outputs of each CA1 neuron, and enter these values as the weights of that row of the connection matrix. The major exercise of this paper is to analyze how to detect individual synapses, despite experimental limitations that complicate this idealized approach. The first limitation is stimulus specificity. How can we stimulate exactly one input neuron at a time? Recent optical stimulation experiments using localized glutamate uncaging[2]â[4] have been used to estimate spatial connectivity profiles in the hippocampus and cortex. These studies provide high spatial resolution, which approaches single neuron resolution. Optogenetics provides another approach[5],[6]. By inserting the channelrhodopsin-2( ChR2) gene into hippocampal neurons, it is possible to stimulate cells with <5 ms precision[7]. Current ChR2 constructs have not been reported to be used with 2-photon excitation to obtain single-neuron specificity in the slice, but the method does provide for genetic targeting to specific neuronal populations( reviewed in[8]). High resolution is also possible using minimal stimulation on arrays of electrodes[9], though it is difficult to scale this to more than a few hundred inputs. The second limitation is output sensitivity. Whole-cell patch recordings have long been used as sensitive measures of synaptic responses. Modeling and experimental studies have used patch-clamp data in the presence of spontaneous activity to obtain distributions of synaptic conductances[10],[11]. When coupled to electrical[12],[13] or optical[14] stimulation, patch recordings have been used to obtain spatial distributions of synaptic connectivity in networks. Individual synaptic data are more difficult to obtain in neural circuits. By performing large numbers of pair wise patch-clamp recordings it is possible to measure single synaptic connections in circuits( e. g.,[15]). As many as seven cells have been reported to be patched simultaneously( e. g.,[16]), and the current technical limit is â¼12. However, patch recordings do not scale well. Demanding experiments such as multi-patch recording can give connectivity information for tens of synapses, but one would like to work out circuitry for many times this number, and to do so in an individual slice. The alternative is to turn to more scalable but less sensitive methods. These include Ca2+ recordings and single-unit extracellular electrode recordings. Ca2+ dye recordings have been used to simultaneously monitor hundreds of individual neurons[17]. Implanted extracellular electrodes have also been used to record from hundreds of isolated single units[18],[19]. Such recordings require the neuron to fire and generate a Ca2+ transient or an extracellular spike. This is a highly nonlinear process. Even with intracellular recordings, spiking nonlinearities greatly complicate the estimation of synaptic conductances[20]. It typically takes 50 or more simultaneous synaptic inputs to elicit an action potential in CA1 pyramidal neurons[21],[22]. In other words, we would not be able to see a response to a single input fiber stimulus. In this study we overcome this by adding a baseline stimulus to bring the output neuron near threshold, and then monitor how the addition of the single fiber stimulus changes the response. The third limitation is stochasticity in synaptic release[23],[24]. Even with perfect optics and recordings, there is a modest( 50% or smaller) probability that any given action potential will elicit a postsynaptic response at a given synapse. Furthermore, this probability is strongly history dependent. This introduces variability in neuronal responses to identical stimuli. While this variability complicates estimates of synaptic connection strength, it is also an essential requirement for the proposed method. Stochasticity in synaptic release helps the measurement by providing fluctuations near the action potential threshold, so that repeated samples reveal differences in distribution due to the addition of the single synaptic stimulus. A similar process has been proposed for physiological neuronal responses in the context of subthreshold background input, and has been shown to be effective in improving detection of single synaptic inputs[25]. In this study I perform a series of in silico experiments on the hippocampal CA1 network to design and analyze a synaptic estimation method that only needs extracellular or low-resolution optical recordings. These computational âexperimentsâ have the advantage that the correct synaptic weight matrix can be directly read out from the model definition, as well as from more physiologically practical readouts such as Ca2+ responses. This gives an unambiguous assay of the accuracy of synapse prediction. The method scales as the product of number of stimulus points and readout neurons. With current techniques this method should be able to resolve thousands of synapses, and it has the potential to scale to around a million.Discussion:In order to validate the proposed approach, a conclusive experimental method for identifying synapses must be combined with this high-throughput experimental analysis. One possible experimental design would be to perform patch recordings in conjunction with bipolar electrode stimulation and dye recording from the target patched neuron. The patch recordings would detect putative single synaptic inputs to compare with the statistical analysis from the optical recording method. Paired patch recordings may be necessary to show that the input is from precisely one neuron. This experiment would allow us to test if the predicted true and false positives are as accurate as these simulations suggest. Using this approach we can at best sample from about 50 synapses( <1%) per neuron, from perhaps 10, 000 neurons in a slice( â¼2% of hippocampal CA1 neurons)[32],[33]. How useful is such a sparse sampling of synaptic connectivity? While it is difficult to anticipate outcomes of these proposed experiments, there are grounds to expect that even a sparse functional wiring diagram would be very informative. First, known hippocampal representations of space are distributed and broad[34]. Recent direct experiments on hippocampal memory indicate that some aspects of memory traces may be observed even from a small number of recording electrodes[35]. Thus a sparse sample may cover a substantial number of synapses involved in âmemory engramsâ. Second, even a sparse circuit measurement may reveal signatures of repeated neuronal microcircuits( e. g.,[3],[12],[36]). Indeed, almost all current knowledge of vertebrate circuitry has been obtained from sparse sampling methods combined with neuroanatomy[1],[32]. Third, the coupling of precise but sparse functional data with new anatomical methods such as block-face sectioning[37] and multicolor genetic labeling[38] may build a more complete picture of neural circuitry than either approach on its own. Such a combination is especially important because geometrical connectivity does not always translate to functional connectivity[39]. This analysis was done on the relatively simple neuronal circuit in the CA1, and ignores interneurons. Other brain regions with more complex circuits will require their own stimulus designs and the deployment of multiple kinds of optogenetic or electrical stimuli. The KS analysis should be effective for inhibitory as well as excitatory inputs, but would not work well for weak synapses( Figure 6, 8). In many neuronal circuits( e. g., cortex) there are many local circuits in addition to long-range fiber tracts. In such cases, interneurons and recurrence complicate the analysis, which is too slow to resolve polysynaptic effects. Our preliminary calculations( Fig 7) suggest that the method may be able to resolve monosynaptic input in the presence of as much as 60% recurrence. Nevertheless, it will require a cortex-specific study to better understand the capabilities of this approach in the far more complicated cortical circuit. A possible experimental approach to reversibly âsimplifyâ such networks is to transiently silence interneurons using pharmacological blockers or halorhodopsin[40]. While the current analysis assumes the use of brain slices, the general multi-input/multi-output approach is readily carried over to in-vivo recordings. Our data suggest that modest levels of background activity would be tolerated by the method. Optical methods have already been employed in vivo[5], and electrode recordings routinely monitor hundreds of neurons[18]. Electrode recordings have the additional advantage of fine time resolution, which allows the use of spike-timing data that was discarded in this study. The fundamental benefit as well as difficulty of this approach is its scalability. The benefit is that the number of monitored synapses scales as the product of recorded and stimulated neurons. The difficulty is due to the increasingly stringent timing and accuracy requirements at larger scales. Current array electrodes have â¼60 contact points[9], each of which could be used with near-minimal stimulation to address a set of around 10 axons. Current optical methods can readily record from 100 individual cells in the slice[17]. With the assumptions of 5% connectivity and a 50% synapse detection rate, it should be possible to record from â¼1500 synapses in this configuration. This contrasts favorably with the current maximum of â¼12 patch electrodes, which should yield about 6 synapses assuming 5% connectivity. Beyond these current capabilities, a major goal of this study was to extrapolate from existing methods and set technical targets that would enable high-throughput recording. The slice configuration itself would require some optimization. Neuronal projection patterns in the hippocampal slice are well known. With careful selection of the plane of slicing, it is possible to establish unbroken connections between CA3 and CA1 neurons. Nevertheless, it is challenging to retain enough connections to achieve several thousand intact axonal projections. Both stimulation and recording may require optical techniques to scale up to very large network reconstructions. Methods already exist to do so for up to 1000 neurons in cortex[41]. In the hippocampus one may have to use separate CA3 stimulation and CA1 recording scanning optics. Two-photon methods are likely to be required for sufficient resolution in each case. This is currently feasible for the recordings, and for glutamate uncaging, but to my knowledge two-photon stimulation of optogenetic constructs is yet to be demonstrated. One possible configuration may use paired inverted and upright optical assemblies. Another possible configuration could utilize light guides[42] to provide the stimulus. These simulations suggest a target of â¼80 repeats per input to achieve around 20% accuracy in synaptic identification. To deliver the required stimulus, the stimulating apparatus must generate reliable action-potential trains with â¼10 ms resolution, applied to â¼10, 000 CA3 neurons. While this level of accuracy has been achieved with illumination of single neurons[40], it will require fast and precise scanning methods[43] to illuminate many neurons within this time window. The block design of the method relaxes these constraints significantly, so that only a handful( one to 10) axons/neurons must be stimulated precisely( within a â¼10 ms window) for any given trial, and the rest can be activated together using broad illumination or supraminimal electrical stimulation. In sum, the stimulus scaling targets appear achievable. The technical issues with scaling up the number of recorded CA1 neurons are familiar ones of scanning speed versus signal-to-noise versus photobleaching. The suggested 2-hour experiments are feasible for a small number of neurons without much photobleaching using enhanced CCD cameras( Parameshwaran and Bhalla, unpublished data). It is more challenging to perform long recordings using 2-photon imaging, but improved calcium reporters may extend the duration of such recordings as well. There are already Ca2+ recording methods which can monitor â¼1000 individual neurons[17]. This suggests that it should be possible to scale up recordings to several thousands of neurons. Accurate algorithms for estimating spike counts from experimental Ca2+ waveforms have been developed[44],[45], and these may give higher classification accuracy with better noise immunity that the methods in this study. Combining â¼50-synapses per neuron( Figure 8E), and â¼10, 000 recorded neurons, the target of almost a million synapses in a 2-hour experiment should be an ambitious but achievable technical goal. Such data would be a significant step toward reconstructing the functional wiring diagram of large neuronal circuits.","answer":"The circuitry of the brain is defined by the connections ( synapses ) between its cells .

This study shows that it is possible to measure single synapses using low-precision methods such as optical recordings from neuronal cell bodies . I model optical or electrical stimulation of many inputs to trigger a visible response from neurons , and find single synapses by testing how this response is modulated when a single additional input synapse is triggered as well . I predict that it should be possible to record from as many as a million synapses using new optical recording and stimulation methods . It is believed that memories are encoded in synaptic connection patterns , so such connectivity data may give us a picture of how memories are encoded .

The calculated equilibrium lattice constants (tabulated in Table 1) are in excellent agreement with experiment.</p>Intrinsic defect processes.<p>To understand the electrochemical behavior of an electrode material, intrinsic defect processes are crucial. A series of isolated point defect (vacancy and interstitial) energies were calculated, which were combined to determine the formation energies for Frenkel and Schottky-type defects in Li 9 V 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 .</p><p>The following equations represent the reactions involving these defects as written using KrÃ¶ger-Vink notation 27 .</p><p>The reaction energies for these intrinsic defect processes are reported in Fig. 2 and Table S2. The most favorable intrinsic disorder is Li Frenkel and the formation of other Frenkel and Schottky defects is unfavourable. The second most favorable defect process is calculated to be anti-site. This indicates that there will be a small percentage of Li on V sites ( â³ Li V ) and V on Li sites ( ââ V ) Li particularly at higher temperatures. It should be noted that this defect has been observed in a variety of Li ion battery materials during cycling 8,[28][29][30][31][32] . The formation enthalpy of   S2). This is a process that can lead to further â² V Li and â¢â¢ V O however at elevated temperatures.</p><p>Lithium ion-diffusion. The intrinsic lithium ion diffusion of Li 9 V 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 material is of crucial importance when assessing its use as a possible high-rate cathode material in lithium batteries. Using static atomistic simulation it is possible to examine various possible diffusion paths responsible for lihium ion conduction, which are often difficult to explore on the atomic scale by experiment alone. For the Li vacancy migration, we identified three lower energy long range paths connecting local Li hops (A, B C and D as shown in Fig. 3). There are two long range paths exhibit a zig-zag pattern along ab plane including a local Li hop with lower activation energy of migration of 0.38 eV but with overall activation energy of 1.07 eV (refer to Table 2 and Fig. 4). The third long range migration path along the c axis has identical Li hops with the activation energy of 0.72 eV. Thus this long range Li diffusion channel will have the overall activation energy of 0.72 eV in good agreement with the value of 0.74 eV reported by Jain et al. 26 . The activation energy of migration calculated along the ab plane is 1.30 eV 26 , which is in agreement with our calculated value of 1.07 eV. The difference in activation energy is due to description of ions in different methodologies. Here the activation energy of migration is defined as the position of the highest potential energy along the migration path. This indicates that long range diffusion is likely slow.</p><p>Tetravalent doping. The Li Frenkel is calculated to be only 0.44 eV/defect; however, an increase in the concentration of Li will further increase the applicability of Li 9 V 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 as a cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. A way to increase the content of intrinsic defects in oxides is by the solution of aliovalent  dopants as it was previously demonstrated in CeO 2 (for example ref. 33 and references therein). Here we considered the solution of RO 2 (R = Ce, Zr, Ti, Si and Ge) via the following process (in KrÃ¶ger-Vink notation):</p><p>Figure 5 reports the solution energies of RO 2 and it can be observed that GeO 2 and ZrO 2 have the lowest ones 2.40 eV and 2.42 eV respectively. These solution energies are higher as compared to the Li Frenkel process nevertheless the solution of GeO 2 or ZrO 2 during synthesis should be examined experimentally as they can increase the Li vacancy concentration (via relation ( 8)).</p><p>Figure 6 depicts the local coordination (including bond lengths and angles) with oxygen of the dopants occupying the V site and for comparison the octahedral VO 6 unit in the relaxed structure of undoped Li 9 V 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 . The ionic radius of V 3+ in octahedral coordination is 0.64 Ã. The ionic radius of Si 4+ is 0.38 Ã smaller that that of V 3+ . In the SiO 6 unit, there are two shorter bonds present compared to the other four Si-O bonds. This indicates that Si prefers SiO 4 unit as observed in most silicates and this is reflected in the solution energy. The lowest solution energy is calculated for Ge. There are six Ge-O bonds present with approximately equal bond distances. The bond distances are ~0.1 Ã shorter than the V-O bond lengths. Though Ge forms tetrahedral coordination in most of the complexes, the exact reason for the lowest solution energy should be due to other factors. The solution energy of Ti is ~0.40 eV higher than that of Ge. The second lowest solution energy is found for Zr. Zirconium normally forms octahedral six-coordinate complexes in their crystal structures and its ionic radius is closer to the ionic radius of V 3+ . This is reflected in the solution energy. In the relaxed structure of CeO 6 unit, Ce-O bond lengths are approximately the same but ~0.20 Ã longer than V-O bond lengths present in VO 6 unit. Furthermore, the ionic radius of Ce 4+ is 0.26 Ã longer than V 3+ . Thus the solution energy  is slightly high. However, the current solution energy values are still large and positive indicating that they are highly unfavourable.</p><p>Introducing dopants in a lattice can also have an impact on the activation energies of migration. We present in Fig. 7 the energy profile diagrams for Li vacancy hoping closer to the Ge and Zr substitutionals as these are the lowest solution enthalpy dopants. The presence of the Ge and Zr substitutionals will increase the migration energy barriers of Li in the ab plane, but will reduce them in the c-axis mechanism where it matters as it is the lowest energy mechanism (refer to Figs 4 and 7). The activation energy of Li migration in the vicinity of Ge substitutionals is 0.66 eV that is 0.08 eV lower than in undoped Li 9 V 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 .</p>Summary.<p>In the present study, the atomistic simulation techniques have been used to provide detailed insights into intrinsic defects, lithium ion mobility and tetravalent doping, which are relevant to the general electrochemical behavior of layered Li 9 V 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 as lithium battery cathodes. An advantage of this material is its low energy Li Frenkel (0.44 eV/defect). This will ensure that there will be considerable number of Li vacancies that are necessary as they act as vehicles for Li diffusion. We have considered the solution energies of RO 2 (R = Ce, Zr, Ti, Si and Ge) and calculated that GeO 2 and ZrO 2 have the lowest solution energies. These are far higher than the Li Frenkel process. At any rate if Li 9 V 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 doped with GeO 2 is synthesized it will have a lower</p>Methods.<p>In order to calculate the energetics for the formation of intrinsic defects and possible Li ion diffusion pathways, the classical pair potential method as implemented in the GULP package 34 was employed. This method is based on the classical Born model description of an ionic crystal lattice. All systems were treated as crystalline solids with interactions between ions consisting of the long-range attractions and short-range repulsive forces representing electron-electron repulsion and van der Waals interactions. The short range interactions were modelled using Buckingham potentials (refer to Table S1). Simulation boxes and the corresponding atom positions were relaxed using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm 35 . The Mott-Littleton method 36 was used to investigate the lattice relaxation about point defects and the migrating ions. It divides the crystal lattice into two concentric spherical regions, where the ions within the inner spherical region (on the order of >700 ions) immediately surrounding the defect relaxed explicitly. Li ion diffusion was calculated considering two adjacent vacancy sites as initial and final configurations. Seven interstitial Li ions were considered in a direct linear route and they were fixed while all other ions were free to relax. The local maximum energy along this diffusion path is calculated and reported as activation energy of migration. As the present model assumes a full charge ionic model with the calculations corresponding to the dilute limit the defect enthalpies will be overestimated, however, relative energies and trends will be consistent.</p>","answer":"2 has attracted considerable interest as a novel cathode material for potential use in rechargeable lithium batteries. The defect chemistry, doping behavior and lithium diffusion paths in Li 9 V 3 (P 2 O 7 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 are investigated using atomistic scale simulations. Here we show that the activation energy for Li migration via the vacancy mechanism is 0.72 eV along the c-axis. Additionally, the most favourable intrinsic defect type is Li Frenkel (0.44 eV/defect) ensuring the formation of Li vacancies that are required for Li diffusion via the vacancy mechanism. The only other intrinsic defect mechanism that is close in energy is the formation of anti-site defect, in which Li and V ions exchange their positions (1.02 eV/defect) and this can play a role at higher temperatures. Considering the solution of tetravalent dopants it is calculated that they require considerable solution energies, however, the solution of GeO 2 will reduce the activation energy of migration to 0.66 eV.Lithium ion batteries are widely used as a dominant power source in consumer electronics and electric vehicles 1-5 . Batteries with high-power density needed for large scale applications require new class of electrode materials providing large quantities of Li ions together with low cost, environmentally benign and constituent elements being high abundance.

No specific authorization was needed to retrospectively analyze anonymous data collected during routine care in the context of routine surveillance. A total of 137 outbreaks were recorded in the 14 sites. RTI outbreaks were more frequent than GE outbreaks (76 outbreaks and 5862 exposed residents vs. 61 outbreaks and 4309 exposed residents, respectively). Overall, 7643 of the exposed residents were women and 2528 were men. The median age was 86.7 years old (interquartile range: 81.1-91.0 years). Virus investigations (respectively 389 samples for RTI and 143 for GE with all the detailed results in S1-S4 Tables) confirmed a considerable number of norovirus-related GE outbreaks (34/61) and influenza-related RTI outbreaks (46/76). For GE outbreaks, 2524 residents were in a NoV+ context versus 1785 in a NoV-context, and for RTI outbreaks, 3479 residents were in a Flu+ context versus 2383 in a Flu-context. For GE surveillance in the NoV+ context, there were 1093 EI residents versus 1431 ENI residents, whereas in the NoV-context, there were 583 EI residents versus 1202 ENI residents. Therefore, the infection rate was higher in the NoV+ context (43.3%) than in the NoV-context (32.7%, (odds ratio (OR): 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.72), p < 0.001). For RTI surveillance, the rates of infection were similar with and without confirmed influenza: 31.5% (N = 1095 EI residents /3479 exposed residents) vs. 30.5% (N = 728 EI residents/ 2383 exposed residents, OR: 0.96, CI: 0.85-1.07, p = 0.47). Moreover, infection rate in the NoV + context was higher than the three other contexts: NoV-(OR: 0.63, CI: 0.56-0.72), Flu+ (OR: 0.60, CI:0.54-0.67) and Flu-(OR: 0.58, CI: 0.51-0.65). In univariate analysis, certain individual characteristics were associated with significant variations in the infection rate (S5 Table) . The infection rate increased with age (except in the Flucontext) and, decreased with LOS during GE outbreaks. The covariate adjusted analysis revealed specific significant effect modification according to sex (NoV+) and LOS (NoV-) (S6 Table) . In analyses stratified according to virus and sex, age adjusted for LOS remained significant for Flu+ and NoV+ outbreaks (males). In NoV-context, the effect modification of LOS remained significant (Table 1) . Finally, when autonomy was included and adjusted for age (virus, sex, LOS stratification), the less autonomous residents (female/LOS<4 years/age<86/ GIR 1-2) were affected more severely by Flu+ outbreaks with specific effect modification according to age (S7 Table) . The study of lethality rates in infected residents over the 56 days after onset indicated that there were significant variations for RTI but no change for GE (Table 2 ). Significant differences appeared after 28 days in the context of Flu+ outbreaks and other RTI outbreaks. The analysis of successive or simultaneous clusters in the same institutions was performed when the time period between the onset of symptoms of the last case in outbreak N and the onset of symptoms of the first case in outbreak N+1 was ï¿½56 days (S8 Table) . 44 of the 137 outbreaks (32.12%) were identified, and 194 of the 3499 exposed and infected residents contracted multiple infections. The percentage of exposed and infected residents implicated in more than one virus stratification was 11.09% ((194 ï¿½ 2)/3499). Moreover, two deceased residents were included in the NoV-Na and Flu lethality analyses because death occurred within 56 days for both infections. The analysis of virus stratification of the 44 outbreaks showed the absence of successive clusters for the same category. The same analysis for the first four 7-day intervals (Days 1 to 28) showed the respective values: 26 outbreaks (18.98%), 117 residents ((6.69% ((117 ï¿½ 2)/3499)), one dead resident. Finally, according to the higher lethality impact during the first four 7-day intervals and to limit the impact of successive clusters in the same site, all cause lethality rates were studied according to individual parameters for the four 7 days intervals with the respective number of According to the surveillance type (GE or RTI), the lethality rates differed significantly: 1.6% versus 3.4% (respectively NoV+ and NoV-contexts, OR: 2.24, CI: 1.16-4.39, p = 0.02) and 8.3% versus 5.6% (respectively Flu+ and Flu-, OR: 0.67, CI: 0.45-0.97, p = 0.04). In univariate analysis (S9 Table) , low autonomy status in the NoV+, Flu+ and Flu-contexts was most significantly associated with increased all-cause lethality, and age was associated with higher lethality in the Flu+ context. In the adjusted analysis, no significant statistical differences were identified in GE outbreaks. For RTI episodes, the adjusted analysis showed that autonomy had a significant impact when adjusted for sex, age or LOS (Flu+ and Flu-NA) and that age had a significant impact when adjusted for sex, autonomy or LOS (Flu+) (S10 Table) . In Table 3 , the specific effects of age or autonomy were tested. Significant OR age adjusted for autonomy were: Flu+/age ï¿½86 years (compared with the <86 group), 1.97 (1.19-3.25). OR autonomy adjusted for age were for GIR 3-6 (compared with GIR 1-2): Flu+, 0.41 (0.24-0.69); Flu-, 0.42 (0.20, 0.90). Finally, despite the low number of residents and deaths per category, and consequently the limited robustness of the results, autonomy adjusted for age with stratification according to virus, sex and LOS showed that the effects were higher among subgroups of less autonomous residents (female or male/LOS<4 years/GIR 1-2) in Flu+ outbreaks, and there was also higher mortality in the small subgroup of autonomous men with LOS ï¿½ 4 years (higher mortality) (S11 Table) . In the Flu+ context, data regarding vaccination status and oseltamivir prescriptions were available but not used in this study. In the present study, surveillance data obtained during GE and RTI outbreaks in nursing homes were used to construct stratified analyses and to identify specific infection and all-cause lethality rates according to the residents' individual characteristics. The infection rates observed here were similar to those found in previous studies of NoV and Influenza outbreaks (odds of being infected during a Flu+ outbreak were around 40% less than during a NoV+ outbreak). Reported infection rates were close to 30.0%  in influenza outbreaks and 40.0% in NoV outbreaks [18] [19] [20] . Older age appeared to increase the likelihood of GE and influenza infection, with increasing rates among older residents. Age is a well-known factor for influenza and norovirus severity in the elderly and in nursing homes [21, 22] . For NoV, the highest incidence estimates (5-year age strata) was found in the ï¿½85 year-category (approximately 800 men and for 1,400 women per 100,000 inhabitants). In our study, univariate analysis (NoV+) showed that the odds of being infected were 1.5 to 1.6 times higher if a resident was older than 85. Moreover, an adjusted analysis of GE outbreaks highlighted different effects among subgroups of residents according to sex and LOS. Indeed, multiple and/or repeated exposure to GE viruses while institutionalized may lead to susceptibility or possible increased immunity in some residents [23] . For the sex variable, two factors could explain the effect: a possible selection bias with men reporting mild infections less than women (particularly in the <86 years subgroup) or that male susceptibility was different (age, LOS, immunity,. . . ). A German study from 2013 also reported a greater impact in women [21] . Moreover, when age analysis was stratified by sex and LOS, no Epidemic impacts in nursing homes significant impact was observed in women; the only significant differences were fewer infections in men in the <86-subgroup (except in the NoV-with LOS <4 years). For the RTI outbreaks, sex and LOS variables did not have a significant effect. In residents older than 86, the odds of being infected in Flu+ context were 1.5 times higher for women and 1.7 for men. In univariate analysis, contrary to the other virus contexts where odds ratios were rarely above 2, residents over 95 years old had increased odds of infection of ï¿½ 2.8 compared with the 70-year-old category, and for the 100 year-old group the odds were approximately 3.8. In the Flu+ context, autonomy adjusted for age (virus, sex and LOS stratification) revealed a possible increase in infection rates among less autonomous residents. A previous study found that when elderly residents were exposed to the A(H3N2) virus, there were higher rates of infection and reinfection, and more significant effects on the institution than with other influenza types/subtypes. In the community, the relative illness ratio (RIR) in the [22, 24] . The incidence of influenza infection and the associated risks were well described by age group, but the specific impact according to age was not studied. The results of this work highlighted the specific age distribution of influenza illnesses among the nursing home residents and the more significant impact among the older residents. This specific susceptibility could be a critical factor in the institutional exposure and dissemination of influenza and could partly explain the high infection impact in the elderly institutional population. In this work, autonomy status was not the main factor associated with infection (no significant impact in GE and in Flu-contexts). However, in Flu+ outbreaks, a high level of dependency was associated with a higher risk of falling ill. This observation implies that staff could play a role in the spread of infection (highly dependent and less mobile residents are less likely to contaminate themselves) or that the more active residents may be less fragile and/or have a greater involvement in the recommended infection control measures. Finally, improving compliance with personal hygiene measures both for nursing staff and residents might be expected to have a beneficial effect on infection rates. Previous studies identified higher NoV infection rates in highly dependent individuals, but the results were not adjusted for age and LOS to take into account the potential correlation with the autonomy status [20] . Lethality is difficult to assess in nursing homes because death is frequent. Our GE and RTI episodes occurred during the winter seasons, and there are possible interactions between outbreaks and increased mortality at this time of the year [25] . The all-cause lethality rate of the infected residents in our study reflected global mortality including GE and RTI outbreaks and the global epidemiological context. Not surprisingly, a higher all-cause lethality rate was observed in the influenza contexts, as reported in previous studies [25] [26] [27] . Age and autonomy had similar effects in the different contexts, but in GE and to a lesser degree in Flu-outbreaks, the relatively small number of deaths could have limited the power of the statistical tests. In nursing homes, residents are generally discharged due to death. The number of residents lost to follow up was low (0.14% in the first 28 days), so the 7-day interval turnover rate calculated on the base of the median LOS provides a good indication of the average case fatality rate. The lethality rate for NoV+ outbreaks was similar to the estimated 7-day interval turnover rate (1.6%) indicating that this context had a limited impact on the death rate. The all-cause lethality rate was most affected by age and autonomy. Both individual characteristics were significant in the Flu+ outbreaks, and autonomy adjusted for age was significant in the Flu-episodes. The influence of age on mortality in a context of influenza has already been described: a very high mortality rate (831/100,000 inhabitants) was reported in persons 90 years of age and older compared with those aged 65-69 years (23/100,000 inhabitants) [28] . In our univariate analysis, the higher risk was observed in the ï¿½90 group whose risk of death was at least 2.6 higher than the <70 group. When adjusted for autonomy, the impact of age was not significant in more autonomous residents in the Flu+ context and not at all in the Flucontext. The opposite analysis (autonomy adjusted for age) showed higher global impact in the less autonomous group (Flu-) or only in the ï¿½86 age group (Flu+). Age and autonomy are a reflection of resident's level of frailty. Clinical frailty scores were not used in this study, but in a previous study of patients with critical illness, they were associated with greater mortality, regardless of age [29] . This suggests that in addition to age, autonomy can be a valuable indicator for the assessment of outbreak impact in outbreak surveillance. Other studies have suggested that age and certain comorbidities are independent risk factors for the influenza mortality rate or that mortality increase according to the number of risk factors [28, 30] . Comorbidities and underlying diseases of various severities could reflect overall frailty and consequently the risk of death. In nursing homes, information about autonomy and age are easier to collect and interpret than data on comorbidities. These various approaches should be evaluated and compared in the goal of optimizing risk assessment among nursing home residents. The present work has two main limitations. First, the virus information was incomplete (limited identification, mainly influenza rapid tests for the RTI). Consequently, some episodes in the levels with no available identification may also have been associated with influenza or norovirus, and multiple contaminations could have been underestimated or not taken into account. Moreover, vaccination and oseltamivir prescriptions were recorded but not included because the influenza genotype was not determined and identification was limited. Secondly, the deaths of uninfected residents were not recorded in this protocol even though such data would have provided valuable information about the global epidemiological context. In conclusion, specific susceptibility patterns were observed among exposed residents. In this cohort of nursing homes, infection rates varied according to virus, sex, length of stay and age, and there were major differences in lethality depending on virus, age and autonomy score. The collected data were easy to record and could be used to improve the characterization of seasonal outbreaks in nursing homes, whose residents are particularly vulnerable.Question: What was the reported infection rate for influenza?","answer":"30.0%"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously. Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured. Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed. Isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart. These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ST-segment. In addition, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP/O was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats. Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function. The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination.

In 2013 , formal malaria microscopy refresher training for microscopists and a pilot quality -assurance ( QA ) programme for malaria diagnostics were independently implemented to improve malaria microscopy diagnosis in malaria low-transmission areas of Kenya . A study was conducted to identify factors associated with malaria microscopy performance in the same areas . Methods From March to April 2014 , a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 42 public health facilities ; 21 were QA-pilot facilities . In each facility , 18 malaria thick blood slides archived during January â February 2014 were selected by simple r and om sampling . Each malaria slide was re-examined by two expert microscopists masked to health-facility results . Expert results were used as the reference for microscopy performance measures . Logistic regression with specific r and om effects modelling was performed to identify factors associated with accurate malaria microscopy diagnosis . Results Of 756 malaria slides collected , 204 ( 27 % ) were read as positive by health-facility microscopists and 103 ( 14 % ) as positive by experts . Overall , 93 % of slide results from QA-pilot facilities were concordant with expert reference compared to 77 % in non-QA pilot facilities ( p < 0.001 ) . Recently trained microscopists in QA-pilot facilities performed better on microscopy performance measures with 97 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity compared to those in non-QA pilot facilities ( 69 % sensitivity ; 93 % specificity ; p < 0.01 ) . The overall inter-reader agreement between QA-pilot facilities and experts was Îº = 0.80 ( 95 % CI 0.74â0.88 ) compared to Îº = 0.35 ( 95 % CI 0.24â0.46 ) between non-QA pilot facilities and experts ( p < 0.001 ) . In adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis , recent microscopy refresher training ( prevalence ratio [ PR ] = 13.8 ; 95 % CI 4.6â41.4 ) , â¥5 years of work experience ( PR = 3.8 ; 95 % CI 1.5â9.9 ) , and pilot QA programme participation ( PR = 4.3 ; 95 % CI 1.0â11.0 ) were significantly associated with accurate malaria diagnosis . Conclusions Microscopists who had recently completed refresher training and worked in a QA-pilot facility performed the best overall .

WHO recommends parasitological confirmation before treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) in all suspected malaria patients . The use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests ( mRDTs ) would make it possible for prescribers to diagnose malaria at point-of-care and better target the use of antimalarials . Therefore , a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on the introduction of mRDTs for management of malaria in under-five children in a high transmission area in Ghana where presumptive diagnosis was the norm in public health centres . Methods A cluster-r and omised controlled trial where thirty-two health centres were r and omised into test-based diagnosis of malaria using mRDTs ( intervention ) or clinical judgement ( control ) was used to measure the effect of mRDTs  on appropriate treatment : â a child with a positive reference diagnosis prescribed a course of ACT or a child with a negative reference diagnosis not given an ACT â . Cost data was collected from five purposively selected health centres and used to estimate the health sector costs of performing an mRDT and treat children for malaria and other common febrile illnesses . Costs of training healthcare personnel and supervision in the study period were also collected . A sample of caregivers to children participating in the trial was interviewed about household cost incurred on transport , drugs , fees , and special food during a period of one week after the health centre visit as well as days unable to work . A decision model approach was used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs ) . Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were applied to assess the robustness of ICERs . Results The availability of mRDTs for malaria diagnosis result ed in fewer ACT treatments compared to the clinical judgement approach ( 73 % versus 81 % ) and more children appropriately treated ( 70 % versus 57 % ) . The introduction of mRDT-based diagnosis would cost the Ministry of Health US 18.6 per extra appropriately treated child under five compared to clinical judgement while the ICER from a societal perspective was lower at US 11.0 per appropriately treated child . ICERs were sensitive to a decrease in adherence to negative mRDTs , malaria positivity rate and specificity of the mRDT . Conclusion The introduction of mRDTs is likely to be considered cost-effective in this high transmission setting as this intervention increased the number of appropriately treated children at low cost . Trial Registration Clinical Trials.govTitle 3:Cost-effectiveness of malaria microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests versus presumptive diagnosis: implications for malaria control in UgandaAbstract 3:Background Current Ug and a National Malaria treatment guidelines recommend parasitological confirmation either by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) before treatment with artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) . However , the cost-effectiveness of these strategies has not been assessed at rural operational primary care centres . Methods Three health centres ( HCs ) were r and omized to three diagnostic arms ( microscopy , RDT and presumptive diagnosis ) in a district of low and another of high malaria transmission intensities in Ug and a. Some 22,052 patients presenting with fever at out patients departments were enrolled from March 2010 to February 2011 . Of these , a r and om sample of 1,627 was selected to measure additional socio-economic characteristics . Costing was performed following the st and ard step-down cost allocation and the ingredients approach . Effectiveness was measured as the number and proportion of patients correctly diagnosed and treated . Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios ( ICERs ) were estimated from the societal perspective ( http:// Clinical trials.gov , NCT00565071 ) . Results Overall RDT was most cost-effective with lowest ICER US 5.0 compared to microscopy US 9.61 per case correctly diagnosed and treated . In the high transmission setting , ICER was US 4.38 for RDT and US 12.98 for microscopy . The corresponding ICERs in the low transmission setting were US 5.85 and US 7.63 respectively . The difference in ICERs between RDT and microscopy was greater in the high transmission area ( US 8.9 ) than in low transmission setting ( US 1.78 ) . At a willingness to pay of US 2.8 , RDT  remained cost effective up to a threshold value of the cost of treatment of US 4.7 . Conclusion RDT  was cost effective in both low and high transmission setting s. With a global campaign to reduce the costs of AL and RDT , the Malaria Control Programme and stakeholders need a strategy for malaria diagnosis because as the cost of AL decreases , presumptive treatment is likely to become more attractiveTitle 4:Cost-effectiveness analysis of malaria rapid diagnostic tests for appropriate treatment of malaria at the community level in UgandaAbstract 4:: In Sub-Saharan Africa , malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children under 5 , due to lack of access to prompt and appropriate diagnosis and treatment . Many countries have scaled-up community health workers ( CHWs ) as a strategy towards improving access . The present study was a cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of malaria rapid diagnostic tests ( mRDTs ) performed by CHWs in two areas of moderate-to-high and low malaria transmission in rural Ug and a. CHWs were trained to perform mRDTs and treat children with artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) in the intervention arm while CHWs offered treatment based on presumptive diagnosis in the control arm . Data on the proportion of children with fever ' appropriately treated for malaria with ACT ' were captured from a r and omised trial . Health sector costs included : training of CHWs , community sensitisation , supervision , allowances for CHWs and provision of mRDTs and ACTs . The opportunity costs of time utilised by CHWs were estimated based on self-reporting . Household costs of subsequent treatment-seeking at public health centres and private health providers were captured in a sample of households . mRDTs performed by CHWs was associated with large improvements in appropriate treatment of malaria in both transmission setting s. This result ed in low incremental costs for the health sector at US 3.0 per appropriately treated child in the moderate-to-high transmission area . Higher incremental costs at US 13.3 were found in the low transmission area due to lower utilisation of CHW services and higher programme costs . Incremental costs from a societal perspective were marginally higher . The use of mRDTs by CHWs improved the targeting of ACTs to children with malaria and was likely to be considered a cost-effective intervention compared to a presumptive diagnosis in the moderate-to-high transmission area . In contrast to this , in the low transmission area with low attendance , RDT use by CHWs was not a low cost intervention","answer":"Conclusions Based on available evidence , RDT had the potential to be more cost-effective than either microscopy or presumptive diagnosis ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

METHODS 60 in patients suffering from major depressive disorder ( MDD ) according to DSM-IV were r and omized for a 5 week treatment with Yoga or not ( control group ) and with either QXR ( 300 mg/day ) or ESC ( 10 mg/day ) . Serial dexamethasone/corticotropin releasing hormone ( DEX/CRH ) tests were performed to assess HPA axis function . The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( 21-HAMD ) was used weekly . RESULTS A more pronounced down regulation of the HPA axis activity due to yoga could not be detected . The stepwise long term cortisol reduction was seen in both medication groups , irrespectively of yoga add-on treatment . In addition , cortisol improvers in week 1 of therapy ( reduction in cortisol peak value within the DEX/CRH test ) reached significant greater amelioration of depressive symptoms after 5 weeks . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that antidepressant agents down regulate HPA axis function to a greater extent than additional Hatha yoga treatment . Moreover , an early reduction of HPA system hyperactivity after one week of pharmacological treatment seems to raise the possibility of a favorable treatment responseTitle 2:Yoga on Our Minds: A Systematic Review of Yoga for Neuropsychiatric DisordersAbstract 2:Background : The dem and for clinical ly efficacious , safe , patient acceptable , and cost-effective forms of treatment for mental illness is growing . Several studies have demonstrated benefit from yoga in specific psychiatric symptoms and a general sense of well-being . Objective : To systematic ally examine the evidence for efficacy of yoga in the treatment of selected major psychiatric disorders . Methods : Electronic search es of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the st and ard bibliographic data bases , MEDLINE , EMBASE , and PsycINFO , were performed through April 2011 and an up date d in June 2011 using the keywords yoga AND psychiatry OR depression OR anxiety OR schizophrenia OR cognition OR memory OR attention AND r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) . Studies with yoga as the independent variable and one of the above mentioned terms as the dependent variable were included and exclusion criteria were applied . Results : The search yielded a total of 124 trials , of which 16 met rigorous criteria for the final review . Grade B evidence supporting a potential acute benefit for yoga exists in depression ( four RCTs ) , as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia ( three RCTs ) , in children with ADHD ( two RCTs ) , and Grade C evidence in sleep complaints ( three RCTs ) . RCTs in cognitive disorders and eating disorders yielded conflicting results . No studies looked at primary prevention , relapse prevention , or comparative effectiveness versus pharmacotherapy . Conclusion : There is emerging evidence from r and omized trials to support popular beliefs about yoga for depression , sleep disorders , and as an augmentation therapy . Limitations of literature include inability to do double-blind studies , multiplicity of comparisons within small studies , and lack of replication . Biomarker and neuroimaging studies , those comparing yoga with st and ard pharmaco- and psychotherapies , and studies of long-term efficacy are needed to fully translate the promise of yoga for enhancing mental healthTitle 3:Is there more to yoga than exercise?Abstract 3:CONTEXT Yoga is increasing in popularity , with an estimated 15 million practitioners in the United States , yet there is a dearth of empirical data addressing the holistic benefits of yoga . OBJECTIVE To compare the physical and mental benefits of an exercise-based yoga practice to that of a more comprehensive yoga practice ( one with an ethical/spiritual component ) . DESIGN Students with mild to moderate depression , anxiety , or stress and who agreed to participate were assigned to one of three groups : integrated yoga , yoga as exercise , control . PARTICIPANTS A total of 81 undergraduate students 18 years and older at a university in the southeastern United States participated in the study . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Depression , anxiety , stress , hope , and salivary cortisol . RESULTS Over time , participants in both the integrated and exercise yoga groups experienced decreased depression and stress , an increased sense of hopefulness , and increased flexibility compared to the control group . However , only the integrated yoga group experienced decreased anxiety-related symptoms and decreased salivary cortisol from the beginning to the end of the study . CONCLUSIONS Yoga , practice d in a more integrated form , ie , with an ethical and spiritual component , may provide additional benefits over yoga practice d as an exercise regimenTitle 4:Feasibility, acceptability, and effects of gentle Hatha yoga for women with major depression: findings from a randomized controlled mixed-methods study.Abstract 4:Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is a common , debilitating chronic condition in the United States and worldwide . Particularly in women , depressive symptoms are often accompanied by high levels of stress and ruminations , or repetitive self-critical negative thinking . There is a research and clinical imperative to evaluate complementary therapies that are acceptable and feasible for women with depression and that target specific aspects of depression in women , such as ruminations . To begin to address this need , we conducted a r and omized , controlled , mixed- methods community-based study comparing an 8-week yoga intervention with an attention-control activity in 27 women with MDD . After controlling for baseline stress , there was a decrease in depression over time in both the yoga group and the attention-control group , with the yoga group having a unique trend in decreased ruminations . Participants in the yoga group reported experiencing increased connectedness and gaining a coping strategy through yoga . The findings provide support for future large scale research to explore the effects of yoga for depressed women and the unique role of yoga in decreasing ruminationTitle 5:Partial Normalization of Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Remitted Patients after a Major Depressive EpisodeAbstract 5:We had previously reported decreased serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) levels in depressed patients . In the present study , we tested the hypothesis that antidepressant treatment would normalize serum BDNF levels , at least in a subgroup of patients . Major depressed patients ( 15 females and 11 males ) diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and healthy controls ( 13 females and 13 males ) participated in this study . Serum BDNF was assayed with the ELISA method for depressed and remitted patients and the severity of depression was evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale . An analysis of variance showed that treatment had an effect [ F(1 , 24 ) = 4.46 , p = 0.045 ] on the normalization of serum BDNF levels . We also found a correlation between the severity of depression ( r = 0.51 , p = 0.008 ) , the pretreatment BDNF levels ( r = 0.62 , p = 0.001 ) and the difference in serum BDNF levels after antidepressant treatment . These results suggest that antidepressant treatment has a positive effect on serum BDNF levels and support the hypothesis of neurotrophic factor involvement in affective disordersTitle 6:Open Trial of Vinyasa Yoga for Persistently Depressed Individuals: Evidence of Feasibility and AcceptabilityAbstract 6:The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of Vinyasa yoga as an adjunctive treatment for depressed patients who were not responding adequately to antidepressant medication . The authors also planned to ask participants for qualitative feedback on their experience of the class and to assess change over time in depression and in possible mediating variables . The authors recruited 11 participants in 1 month for an 8-week open trial of yoga classes . They found that 10 participants completed follow-up assessment s , 9 of 10 were positive about their experience , and all provided feedback about what was and was not helpful about yoga , as well as barriers to class attendance . Over the 2-month period , participants exhibited significant decreases in depression symptoms and significant increases in an aspect of mindfulness and in behavior activation . This pilot study provided support for continuing to investigate Vinyasa yoga as an adjunct treatment for depression . The next step required is a rigorous r and omized clinical trial","answer":"In addition , preliminary studies suggest that alterations in cortisol , BDNF , and HRV may play a role in how yoga exerts its clinical effect .DISCUSSION The results suggest that body-oriented yoga could work through some of the theoretically predicted mechanisms ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain unclear. Cortical - ventral striatum (VS) circuitry is a common target of psychobehavioral interventions in drug addiction, and cortical - VS dysfunction has been reported in IGD; hence, the primary aim of the study was to investigate how the VS circuitry responds to psychobehavioral interventions in IGD. In a cross-sectional study, we examined resting-state functional connectivity of the VS in 74 IGD subjects (IGDs) and 41 healthy controls (HCs). In a follow-up craving behavioral intervention (CBI) study, of the 74 IGD subjects, 20 IGD subjects received CBI (CBI+) and 16 IGD subjects did not (CBI-). All participants were scanned twice with similar time interval to assess the effects of CBI. IGD subjects showed greater resting-state functional connectivity of the VS to left inferior parietal lobule (lIPL), right inferior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus, in positive association with the severity of IGD. Moreover, compared with CBI-, CBI+ showed significantly greater decrease in VS - lIPL connectivity, along with amelioration in addiction severity following the intervention. These findings demonstrated that functional connectivity between VS and lIPL, each presumably mediating gaming craving and attentional bias, may be a potential biomarker of the efficacy of psychobehavioral intervention. These results also suggested that non-invasive techniques such as transcranial magnetic or direct current stimulation targeting the VS - lIPL circuitry may be used in the treatment of Internet gaming disorders.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"right inferior frontal gyrus\\", \\"left inferior parietal lobule\\", \\"ventral striatum\\", \\"left middle frontal gyrus\\", \\"VS\\", \\"lIPL\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"IGDs\\", \\"Internet gaming disorder\\", \\"Internet gaming disorders\\", \\"internet gaming disorder\\", \\"addiction\\", \\"IGD\\", \\"drug addiction\\", \\"attentional bias\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"biomarker\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"results\\", \\"resting-state\\", \\"findings\\", \\"positive\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"scanned\\", \\"Psychobehavioral intervention\\", \\"transcranial magnetic\\", \\"direct current stimulation\\", \\"CBI\\", \\"psychobehavioral intervention\\", \\"behavioral intervention\\", \\"remediation\\", \\"follow-up\\", \\"psychobehavioral interventions\\", \\"craving behavioral intervention\\", \\"intervention\\", \\"treatment\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"participants\\", \\"subjects\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"cross-sectional study\\", \\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"Cortical\\", \\"cortical\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

throughput identifications of interacting proteins ( 1 ) . despite recent advances in the structural genomics project ( 2 ), the number of experimentally solved structures of protein  protein complexes remains very low ( 3 ) .therefore , computational methods are essential for 3d characterization of protein  protein interactions .   protein  protein docking aims to predict the 3d structure of a protein complex given the structures of the individual proteins that assemble it .protein flexibility ( 4 ) and the absence of robust scoring functions present a major challenge in the docking field .the flexibility of proteins includes both backbone and side - chain movements , and dealing with it significantly extends the search space for the optimal complex structure ( 5,6 ) .in addition , state of the art scoring functions are not tolerant enough to the inaccuracies in the predicted structures ( 7 ) .first , soft rigid docking is performed ( 811 ) , allowing a certain amount of steric clashes .then , thousands of solution candidates are refined and re - scored in a refinement stage ( 5,6 ) . in this stage , each solution candidate is improved by modeling the protein flexibility and optimizing the rigid - body orientation .most of the refinement methods use an optimization of the side - chain conformations and/or rigid - body orientation in order to minimize a certain scoring function .one of the main differences between the refinement methods is in the approach used for side - chain optimization : monte - carlo ( mc ) ( 12,13 ) , graph theory - based methods ( 14,15 ) , linear programming ( lp ) ( 16 ) , etc .the optimization of the rigid - body orientation usually involves a randomized perturbation followed by energy minimization .the minimization is performed using methods such as steepest descent ( 17 ) , newton  raphson ( 18,19 ) , quasi - newton ( 12,16 ) and more .there are several web servers that deal with different aspects of the docking challenge : zdock ( 20 ) and patchdock ( 21 ) perform rigid - body docking .smoothdock ( 24 ) is a newer version of cluspro that also refines the representatives of the largest clusters .rosettadock ( 12,25 ) web server allows local search in the vicinity of a single given input solution candidate .the gramm - x ( 26 ) and hex ( 27 ) web servers perform rigid - body docking followed by an optimization of the rigid - body orientation .we present the firedock web server that provides a user - friendly interface for running this protocol online .the method simultaneously targets the problem of flexibility and scoring of solutions produced by fast rigid - body docking algorithms .the output provides a list of refined complexes , sorted by a binding energy function , and a 3d visualization for observing and comparing between the refined complexes .additionally , we suggest a platform for performing full docking protocol : rigid - body docking by the patchdock web server ( 21 ) and a redirection of the results for refinement and scoring by firedock web server . this protocol was thoroughly tested ( 16 ) on protein  protein docking benchmarks ( 28,29 ) .the method refines each candidate and ranks all the candidates according to the binding energy .the firedock ( 16 ) method includes three main steps :  side - chain optimization : the side - chain flexibility of the receptor and the ligand is modeled by a rotamer library .the optimal combination of rotamers for the interface residues is found by solving an integer lp problem ( 3032 ) .this lp minimizes a partial energy function consisting repulsive van der waals and rotamer probabilities terms.rigid-body minimization : this minimization stage is performed by a mc technique that attempts to optimize an approximate binding energy by refining the orientation of the ligand structure .the binding energy consists of softened repulsive and attractive van der waals terms . in each cycle of the mc method ,a local minimization is performed by the quasi - newton algorithm ( 33,34 ) . by default, 50 mc cycles are performed.scoring and ranking : this final ranking stage attempts to identify the near - native refined solutions .the ranking is performed according to a binding energy function that includes a variety of energy terms : desolvation energy ( atomic contact energy , ace ) , van der waals interactions , partial electrostatics , hydrogen and disulfide bonds , -stacking and aliphatic interactions , rotamer 's ; probabilities and more .side - chain optimization : the side - chain flexibility of the receptor and the ligand is modeled by a rotamer library .the optimal combination of rotamers for the interface residues is found by solving an integer lp problem ( 3032 ) .this lp minimizes a partial energy function consisting repulsive van der waals and rotamer probabilities terms .rigid -

native solution in the top 15 predictions for 83% of the 30 enzyme inhibitor test cases and for 78% of the 18 semi - unbound antibody  antigen test cases .the firedock web server is available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il / firedock/. there are two input options for the firedock web server . in the first option , the user uploads or specifies codes of two protein data bank ( pdb ) ( 35 ) files ( receptor and ligand ) and provides a list of up to 1000 transformations ( the required format is detailed in the help page of the web server ) .each transformation , when applied on the ligand , produces a candidate docking solution . in the second option, the user can upload an input pdb file , with each docking solution represented by a model .the candidate solutions for firedock can be generated by rigid -

throughput refinement of docking candidates . due to the high efficiency of the algorithm, we are able to present a web server that allows online refinement of large number of candidates within reasonable running times .the web server interface is easy to understand and simple , requiring no previous knowledge in docking algorithms .in addition , we provide an option for redirection of the solution candidates from the patchdock web server to the refinement process of firedock .this allows the users to perform a full docking protocol of global search ( patchdock ) and local refinement ( firedock ) in a fully automated manner .the algorithm of firedock was proven to be successful in the task of refinement and selection of near - native solution out of thousand candidates ( 16 ) .we believe that the server will enable biologists to use this state - of - the - art docking algorithm in order to predict the structure of new protein  protein complexes .","answer":"structural details of protein  protein interactions are invaluable for understanding and deciphering biological mechanisms .  computational docking methods aim to predict the structure of a protein  protein complex given the structures of its single components .  protein flexibility and the absence of robust scoring functions pose a great challenge in the docking field . due to these difficulties  most of the docking methods involve a two -

Precisely-timed electrical stimulation could be used to restore corrective feedback mechanisms and promote adaptive plasticity after neurological insult, such as spinal cord injury( SCI) or stroke. This study provides the first evidence that closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation( CLV) based on the synaptic eligibility trace leads to dramatic recovery from the most common forms of SCI. The addition of CLV to rehabilitation promoted substantially more recovery of forelimb function compared to rehabilitation alone following chronic unilateral or bilateral cervical SCI in a rat model. Triggering stimulation on the most successful movements is critical to maximize recovery. CLV enhances recovery by strengthening synaptic connectivity from remaining motor networks to the grasping muscles in the forelimb. The benefits of CLV persist long after the end of stimulation because connectivity in critical neural circuits has been restored.Introduction:Recovery from serious neurological injury requires substantial rewiring of neural circuits. Many methods have been developed to enhance synaptic plasticity in hopes of enhancing recovery. Unfortunately, these methods have largely failed in the clinic likely due to the challenge of precisely targeting specific synapses and absence of testing in clinically-relevant models( Gladstone et al., 2006; Levy et al., 2016). Real-time control of neural activity provides a new avenue to promote synaptic plasticity in specific networks and restore function after injury( Engineer et al., 2011; Nishimura et al., 2013; McPherson et al., 2015; Guggenmos et al., 2013). Human and animal studies demonstrate that precisely timed vagus nerve stimulation( VNS) can improve recovery of sensory and motor function. VNS engages neuromodulatory networks and triggers release of pro-plasticity factors including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and fibroblast growth factor( Hays, 2016; Hulsey et al., 2017; Hulsey et al., 2016). This in turn influences expression and phosphorylation of proteins associated with structural and synaptic plasticity, including Arc, CaMKII, TrkB, and glutamate receptors( Alvarez-Dieppa et al., 2016; Furmaga et al., 2012). Engagement of neuromodulatory networks activates a transient synaptic eligibility trace to support spike-timing-dependent plasticity( STDP)( He et al., 2015), thus raising the prospect that closed-loop neuromodulatory strategies may provide a means to direct specific, long-lasting plasticity to enhance recovery after neurological injury. Indeed, in the absence of neurological damage, repeatedly pairing sensory or motor events with brief bursts of VNS yields robust plasticity in sensory or motor cortex that is specific to the paired experience( Engineer et al., 2011; Hulsey et al., 2016). Moreover, the addition of VNS to rehabilitative training improves recovery in rodent models of unilateral brain injury and in chronic stroke patients, highlighting the clinical potential of closed-loop neuromodulatory strategies( Hays, 2016; Khodaparast et al., 2016; Pruitt et al., 2016; Hays et al., 2014a; Dawson et al., 2016). We tested the hypothesis that closed-loop VNS( CLV) could be harnessed to enhance recovery after spinal cord injury( SCI). To do so, we developed a real-time closed-loop neuromodulation paradigm based on the synaptic eligibility trace to deliver VNS immediately after the most successful forelimb movements during motor rehabilitation. The strategy uses a control algorithm that adaptively scales stimulation threshold to trigger a brief 0. 5 s train of VNS on trials in which pull forces fall within the top quintile of previous trials( Top 20% CLV; Figure 1a, b, and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a). To test the hypothesis that temporal precision is required for VNS-dependent effects, we employed a similar algorithm in which stimulation was delivered on the weakest quintile of trials( Bottom 20% CLV; Figure 1b and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1g). Both algorithms deliver the same amount of VNS during rehabilitative training, but Bottom 20% CLV results in a significant delay between VNS and the most successful trials.Discussion:In this study, we developed a novel closed-loop neuromodulation strategy to make use of the high temporal precision of the synaptic eligibility trace. We demonstrate that activation of the vagus nerve improves recovery when reliably delivered within seconds of a successful movement, and we provide the first evidence that CLV enhances reorganization of synaptic connectivity in remaining networks in two non-overlapping models of SCI. The flexibility to promote reorganization in a range of pathways is a critical benefit of CLV, given the great heterogeneity in the etiology, location, and extent of damage present in SCI patients. Classical studies by Skinner demonstrate that adaptive reinforcement of successive approximations, or shaping, drives behavior toward a desired response( Skinner, 1953). This principle has been adopted for use in rehabilitation, with the intention to reinforce successively better movements( Wood, 1990). We made use of this concept by applying an adaptively-scaled stimulation threshold to deliver CLV with the most successful forelimb movements during rehabilitation. Enhanced recovery was observed only when CLV was paired with trials that approximated the desired outcome, highlight the importance of timing for closed-loop stimulation to shape behavioral outcomes and maximize recovery. The magnitude of neuromodulatory activation elicited by an event is directly proportional to the surprise, or unpredictability, of the event( Hangya et al., 2015; Hollerman and Schultz, 1998; Sara and Segal, 1991). This phenomenon is ascribed to reward prediction error( Schultz, 2002). Unsurprising events fail to activate neuromodulatory systems, and even rewarding events fail to trigger neuromodulator release if they are expected. We posit the predictability and accompanying tedium of long, frustrating rehabilitation and the minimal reinforcement of practicing a previously simple motor task blunts plasticity and limits recovery after SCI. The closed-loop neuromodulation strategy developed here circumvents this by artificially engaging neuromodulatory networks and providing a repeated, non-adapting reinforcing signal typically associated with surprising consequences( Hays, 2016; Hulsey et al., 2017; Hulsey et al., 2016). CLV drives temporally-precise neuromodulatory release to convert the synaptic eligibility trace in neuronal networks that generate optimal motor control to long-lasting plasticity( He et al., 2015). CLV is a minimally-invasive, safe strategy to provide precisely-timed engagement of multiple neuromodulatory networks to boost plasticity during rehabilitation( Hays, 2016). Preliminary results in chronic stroke and tinnitus patients highlight the clinical potential of CLV, while delivering less than 1% of the total FDA-approved amount of stimulation( Dawson et al., 2016; De Ridder et al., 2014; Ben-Menachem, 2001). Moreover, the flexibility to deliver stimulation with a variety of rehabilitative exercises raises the possibility to design CLV-based to target motor dysfunction of the lower limbs, somatosensory loss, and bowel and bladder issues, all of which are prevalent in SCI patients. Delineation of the timing requirements and documentation of neuronal changes driven by CLV in this study provide a framework for development of this strategy for a range of neurological conditions, including stroke, peripheral nerve injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder( Hays, 2016; Lozano, 2011).","answer":"The spine houses a network of neurons that relays electric signals from the brain cells to the muscles .

To understand how balance between SCPs controls the dynamics of whole cell responses we studied neurite outgrowth in rat primary cortical neurons in culture. We used a combination of dynamical models and experiments to understand the conditions that permitted growth at a specified velocity and when aberrant growth could lead to the formation of dystrophic bulbs. We hypothesized that dystrophic bulb formation is due to quantitative imbalances between SCPs. Simulations predict redundancies between lower level sibling SCPs within each type of high level SCP. In contrast, higher level SCPs, such as vesicle transport and exocytosis or microtubule growth characteristic of each type need to be strictly coordinated with each other and imbalances result in stalling of neurite outgrowth. From these simulations, we predicted the effect of changing the activities of SCPs involved in vesicle exocytosis or microtubule growth could lead to formation of dystrophic bulbs. siRNA ablation experiments verified these predictions. We conclude that whole cell dynamics requires balance between the higher-level SCPs involved and imbalances can terminate whole cell responses such as neurite outgrowth.Introduction:Neurite outgrowth is an early event that changes the state of neurons[1] and allows neurons to develop axons and dendritic trees that connect to other neurons and become electrically active. When there is nerve injury and the axons are severed, the process of regeneration which is similar to neurite outgrowth often fails, resulting in the formation of bulbs at the ends of regenerating axons. These bulbs are called dystrophic bulbs[2]. Although some of the cellular pathways involved in axonal regeneration, failure and formation of the dystrophic bulbs are known[3, 4] the mechanisms by which these lead to failure are not well understood. In this study we have used an integrated computational and experimental approach to understand the origins of dystrophic bulbs and more generally the conditions under which whole cell responses such as neurite outgrowth can be maintained. The central question we asked in this study is whether quantitative imbalances between subcellular processes can lead to the formation of dystrophic bulbs. Whole cell responses that involve, both morphological and physiological changes, are complex because they can engage many subcellular processes( SCPs) that are together responsible for whole cell functions. SCPs include biochemical pathways and cell biological processes involved the functions of different organelles. Coordinated changes in the activities of SCPs often lead to a change in cell state, such as moving to a more differentiated phenotype. Detailed understanding of how different SCPs collaborate to produce an integrated whole cell response requires experiments, along with mathematical models that capture the dynamics of individual SCPs as well as the interrelationship between the dynamics of multiple SCPs. Based on the biological detail that is represented by the SCPs they can be classified as Level-1, Level-2 and Level-3 SCPs. Higher level SCPs( i. e. SCPs with smaller numbers) represent a cell biological function that combines the functions of their lower level SCP children[5]. To understand whole cell responses, it is necessary to delineate the quantitative coordination between the dynamics of the SCPs. In the case of neurite outgrowth, three Level-1 SCPs, Production of Membrane Components, Vesicle Transport & Exocytosis and Microtubule Growth need to be coordinated. Membrane components such as membrane lipids and proteins are synthesized in the cell body and transported to the growth cone via vesicle transport. Vesicles that fuse with the growth cone plasma membrane deliver their membrane lipids to the neurite tip, causing the neurite shaft to grow. Microtubule constitute the structural element of the neurite shaft, and they need to grow as the shaft increase in length. Tsaneva-Atanasova et al[6] developed a model of the interaction between microtubules and membrane vesicles in regulating neurite outgrowth. The framework of this model serves as a useful starting point for more extensive models where we can consider how a group of distinct but related SCPs such as Vesicle Budding, Vesicle Transport and Vesicle Fusion along with a second group of SCPs that involves Microtubule Nucleation, Microtubule Growth and Conversion of Dynamic to Stable Microtubules interact to enable the growth of neurites. Such detailed models could serve as basis for understanding how a single network can regulate the relationship between kinetic parameters and changes in the levels or activities of molecular components within the different SCPs. To develop a detailed model of neurite outgrowth based on interactions between SCPs of different levels, we constructed a multi compartment ordinary differential equation model to extend and integrate the microtubule growth model developed by Margolin et al.[7] with the vesicle transport model by Heinrich and Rapoport[8]( Heinrich and Rapoport, 2005). We have also incorporated more recent experimental data to make the model contemporary. Many mathematical models of neurite outgrowth have been developed[9, 10] and these models have provided valuable insights into how complex biological processes can be modeled at various levels of description. Often these models abstract the details of the underlying mechanisms and consequently it is difficult to decipher how the balance between the various SCPs is achieved to generate whole cell responses. Some studies have focused on specific facets of the neurite outgrowth process such the role of signaling and regulatory motifs in determining how particular neurites are selected to become axons[11]. Such models are useful in understanding the regulation of complex cellular responses. In developing our dynamical model of neurite outgrowth, we have made a critical change from our previous approaches to dynamical modeling in developing this model. We had typically used a bottom-up approach where individual reactions are assembled into modules that have emergent behaviors[12, 13]. In contrast, the approach we use here can be called top-down as we made a starting postulate that the three Level-1 SCPs involved in neurite outgrowth need to be appropriately coordinated to produce a steady velocity of neurite outgrowth. We start with experimental observations of neurite outgrowth velocities and use numerical simulations to determine how their Level-2 children and Level-3 grandchildren SCPs need to be coordinated to allow neurite outgrowth with the observed velocities and under kinetic parameter constellations that match additional experimental data. Our simulations show redundancy between Level-3 sibling SCP activities. Changes in function of one Level-3 sibling SCP can be compensated by alteration of function in another. However, such generalized reciprocal relationships do not exist between Level-2 SCPs. Change in activity in one Level-2 SCP cannot be simply compensated by activity adaptation of one of its sibling Level-2 SCPs but requires adaptations of multiple sibling SCPs. Consequently, loss of coordinated whole cell function is more likely. A direct consequence of this loss of coordination during neurite outgrowth is the formation of dystrophic bulbs. We used the findings from analyses of the computational models to develop predictions regarding effects of modulating higher SCPs on whole cell function. We tested the predictions experimentally and found them to be valid.Discussion:Neurite outgrowth depends on the coordinated activities of various sub-cellular processes( SCPs). Of the different SCPs involved in our model, the types of Level-1 SCPs are critical. Three major sub-cellular functions that are covered by these SCPs are Production of Membrane Components, Vesicle Transport & Exocytosis and Microtubule Growth. We curated SCPs that are involved in these Level-1 sub-cellular functions and classified them as Level-2 and Level-3 SCPs that are in parent-child relationships. Based on the hierarchical relationships between these SCPs, we developed a dynamical model that incorporates the three types of Level-1 SCPs and documented that the activity of the SCPs involved need to be highly coordinated to allow neurite outgrowth at a certain velocity. To develop this whole cell model of neurite outgrowth, we merged two models[7, 8] that contain biochemically well characterized and estimated parameters. We updated these models by inclusion of further reactions. However currently there is no suitable experimental framework to reliably estimate hundreds of unknown parameters for different reactions in mesoscale dynamical models such as ours. Hence our combined neurite outgrowth model does have several parameters that are unknown. Some of these were obtained from the published biochemical literature and are specified in Table S7. The remaining parameters are constrained by top down analytical solution approach we use. To make the model more manageable, our simulations were done with the following assumptions:( 1) the size of the TGN & GC-PM( 50 Î¼m2) is independent of the outgrowth velocity;( 2) the rate of back transported membrane from the growth cone to the TGN is 0. 5 Î¼m2/min;( 3) 90% of the anterograde vesicles in the neurite shaft cytoplasm and the growth cone cytoplasm serve as membrane reservoir( i. e. these vesicles are not actively transported along the MT or fusing with the GC-PM) and( 4) 20 Î¼m of the neurite microtubule scaffold consists of dynamic MTs and the rest of stable MTs. All these assumptions are based on previous experimental data and allowed us to identify the key features of the balance between SCP types required for a dynamic whole cell response. We developed an analytical prediction for steady state dynamics at the specified NOG velocities that allowed us to investigate SCP relationships in a systematic manner. We could show that the activities of Level-3 SCP siblings needed to generate the function of their Level-2 SCP parent inversely depends on each other. This applied to both Level-3 SCPs involved in Vesicular Transport & Exocytosis as well as Level-3 SCPs involved in Microtubule Growth. This complementary compensatory capability will confer to the cell the ability to mount a response in a robust manner. In contrast, the activities of Level-2 SCPs must be highly coordinated to maintain the Level-1 SCP function. The impaired activity of one Level-2 SCP cannot be simply compensated by an increased activity of another Level-2 SCP. Dependencies between Level-2 SCPs are more complex. In case of Vesicle Transport & Exocytosis, loss of function of one Level-2 SCP might only be compensated, if multiple other Level-2 SCPs also reduce their function. Impaired Level-2 SCP activities were simulated by reduction of the activity of one of its Level-3 children SCPs without compensatory activity modification of the other. Our predictions proposed that reduced exocytosis does not influence NOG velocity. We predicted that this results in an excess of anterograde vesicle in the GC that can be one of the reasons for the formation of dystrophic bulbs. In agreement with our prediction, knockdown of v-SNARE VAMP7 did not change NOG velocity but rather, it creates a pathological phenotype with multiple dystrophic bulbs instead of healthy growth cones. A reduction in the growth of stable MTs was predicted to cause a reduction in NOG length, and it was experimentally confirmed by knock down of MTCL1. As the activities of the SCPs related to Vesicle Transport & Exocytosis are unchanged, in this case the reduction in neurite outgrowth will be accompanied by the appearance of dystrophic bulbs. This prediction was also experimentally confirmed. The observations in this study both computational and experimental demonstrate the critical need for balance and coordination between different types of subcellular processes required to mount a whole cell response. It is noteworthy that robustness of whole cell responses arises from the relative redundancy of lower level subcellular processes within each type. However at least for neurite outgrowth, such redundancies do not occur at higher level SCPs where, when imbalance occurs the whole cell function shuts down even though each high level SCP might be operational for a certain time period. It is the uncoordinated functioning of the higher level SCPs that result in the morphological abnormalities like the dystrophic bulbs. Since lack of coordination can arise due to dysfunction of different higher level SCPs, we get similar dystrophic bulbs when we partially ablate a microtubule stabilizing protein or a vesicle fusion protein. This provides a striking example of phenotypic convergence in spite of molecular divergence. At this stage our model only includes microtubule dynamics and vesicle transport. The inclusion of additional subcellular functions into the model, such as actin filament dynamics at the growth cone, could further document multiple molecular states that underlie the same phenotype. Actin filaments interact with microtubules at the growth and could be an additional factor regulating dynamic microtubule growth apart from the free tubulin concentration and GTP hydrolysis rate that our model considers so far. The same might account for the interaction between actin filaments and vesicles that plays an important role within vesicle endocytosis and exocytosis. Overall the major conclusions of this study are that 1) elements of both robustness and fragility coexist within subcellular processes needed to produce whole cell responses; 2) since multiple types of subcellular processes are involved in mounting a whole cell responses changes in in different molecular entities or subcellular processes can result in the same aberrant phenotype; 3) quantitative imbalances between different types of subcellular processes are sufficient for alteration in cellular dynamics causing abnormal phenotype.","answer":"Mechanisms that cause a change of state of a cell arise from unique patterns of interactions between multiple subcellular processes ( SCPs ) .

BACKGROUND &#38; OBJECTIVE: It has been proved that Epstein- Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (EBV-LMP1) can induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). This study was designed to investigate the effect of EBV-LMP1 on related factors of metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE1. METHODS: Expression of MMP-9 was studied in human NPC cell lines cultured in vitro: CNE1 (well differentiated cell line of NPC) and CNE1-GL (CNE1 cell line transfected with an eukaryotic LMP1-expression plasmid) by SP immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Cell-matrix adhesion assay was used to study the adhesive ability of CNE1-GL cells. The effects of LMP1 on the invasion and migration of CNE1 cells were investigated by transwell methods. RESULTS: MMP-9 was expressed in both cell lines but the intensity of the staining was different. The positive rates of expression of MMP-9 in CNE1 and CNE1-GL cells were 30.2% and 98.2%, respectively (P< 0.05). The increased expression of MMP-9 was also shown in CNE1-GL cells by Western blot analysis. Cell-matrix adhesion assay showed that the adhesive ability of CNE1-GL with the matrix (mean A value: 1.2508+/-0.0711) was higher than that of CNE1 cell (mean A value: 0.9519+/-0.068) (P< 0.001). Invasion assay and migration assay showed that the invasion and migration of CNE1-GL cell were higher than those of CNE1 cells (P< 0.01). CONCLUSION: The transfection of LMP1 can increase the expression of MMP-9 in CNE1 cells. Abilities of adhesion, migration, and invasion of CNE1 cell were induced by LMP1. It is suggested that MMP-9 may have a role in the LMP1-induced acceleration of invasion and metastasis of NPC cells.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"cell line\\", \\"NPC\\", \\"nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE1\\", \\"matrix\\", \\"CNE1-GL cells\\", \\"NPC cells\\", \\"NPC cell lines\\", \\"CNE1-GL cell\\", \\"Cell\\", \\"CNE1 cells\\", \\"CNE1 cell line\\", \\"cell lines\\", \\"CNE1 cell\\", \\"CNE1-GL\\", \\"plasmid\\", \\"CNE1\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

To test the hypothesis that 20-HETE increases endothelial cell (EC) proliferation via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), we studied the effects of WIT003 [20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoic acid], a 20-HETE analog on human macrovascular or microvascular EC. WIT003, as well as pure 20-HETE, stimulated EC proliferation by approximately 40%. These proliferative effects were accompanied by increased VEGF expression and release that were observed as early as 4 h after 20-HETE agonist addition. This was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor 2. The proliferative effects of 20-HETE were markedly inhibited by a VEGF-neutralizing antibody. Polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) markedly inhibited both the increases in VEGF expression and the proliferative effects of 20-HETE. In contrast, administration of the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin had no effect to the proliferative response to 20-HETE. The 20-HETE agonist markedly increased superoxide formation as reflected by an increase in dihydroethidium staining of EC, and this increase was inhibited by PEG-SOD but not by apocynin. 20-HETE also increased the phosphorylation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in EC, whereas an inhibitor of MAPK [U0126, 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene] suppressed the proliferative and the VEGF changes but not the pro-oxidant effects of 20-HETE. These data suggest that 20-HETE stimulates superoxide formation by pathways other than apocynin-sensitive NAD(P)H oxidase, thereby activating MAPK and then enhancing VEGF synthesis that drives EC proliferation. Thus, 20-HETE may be involved in the regulation of EC functions, such as angiogenesis.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"endothelial cell\\", \\"EC\\", \\"microvascular EC\\", \\"macrovascular\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Previous sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) dialogue generation work treats the KB query as an attention over the entire KB, without the guarantee that the generated entities are consistent with each other. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which queries the KB in two steps to improve the consistency of generated entities. In the first step, inspired by the observation that a response can usually be supported by a single KB row, we introduce a KB retrieval component which explicitly returns the most relevant KB row given a dialogue history. The retrieval result is further used to filter the irrelevant entities in a Seq2Seq response generation model to improve the consistency among the output entities. In the second step, we further perform the attention mechanism to address the most correlated KB column. Two methods are proposed to make the training feasible without labeled retrieval data, which include distant supervision and Gumbel-Softmax technique. Experiments on two publicly available task oriented dialog datasets show the effectiveness of our model by outperforming the baseline systems and producing entity-consistent responses.Definition ::: Dialogue HistoryGiven a dialogue between a user (u) and a system (s), we follow eric:2017:SIGDial and represent the k-turned dialogue utterances as lbrace (u_{1}, s_{1} ), (u_{2} , s_{2} ), ... , (u_{k}, s_{k})rbrace . At the i^{text{th}} turn of the dialogue, we aggregate dialogue context which consists of the tokens of (u_{1}, s_{1}, ..., s_{i-1}, u_{i}) and use mathbf {x} = (x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{m}) to denote the whole dialogue history word by word, where m is the number of tokens in the dialogue history.Definition ::: Seq2Seq Dialogue GenerationWe define the Seq2Seq task-oriented dialogue generation as finding the most likely response mathbf {y} according to the input dialogue history mathbf {x} and KB B. Formally, the probability of a response is defined aswhere y_t represents an output token.Our FrameworkIn this section, we describe our framework for end-to-end task-oriented dialogues. The architecture of our framework is demonstrated in Figure FIGREF3, which consists of two major components including an memory network-based retriever and the seq2seq dialogue generation with KB Retriever. Our framework first uses the KB-retriever to select the most relevant KB row and further filter the irrelevant entities in a Seq2Seq response generation model to improve the consistency among the output entities. While in decoding, we further perform the attention mechanism to choose the most probable KB column. We will present the details of our framework in the following sections.Our Framework ::: Vanilla Attention-based DecoderHere, we follow eric:2017:SIGDial to adopt the attention-based decoder to generation the response word by word. LSTM is also used to represent the partially generated output sequence (y_{1}, y_2, ...,y_{t-1}) as (tilde{mathbf {h}}_{1}, tilde{mathbf {h}}_2, ...,tilde{mathbf {h}}_t). For the generation of next token y_t, their model first calculates an attentive representation tilde{mathbf {h}}^{^{prime }}_t of the dialogue history asThen, the concatenation of the hidden representation of the partially outputted sequence tilde{mathbf {h}}_t and the attentive dialogue history representation tilde{mathbf {h}}^{^{prime }}_t are projected to the vocabulary space mathcal {V} by U asto calculate the score (logit) for the next token generation. The probability of next token y_t is finally calculated asOur Framework ::: Entity-Consistency Augmented DecoderAs shown in section SECREF7, we can see that the generation of tokens are just based on the dialogue history attention, which makes the model ignorant to the KB entities. In this section, we present how to query the KB explicitly in two steps for improving the entity consistence, which first adopt the KB-retriever to select the most relevant KB row and the generation of KB entities from the entities-augmented decoder is constrained to the entities within the most probable row, thus improve the entity generation consistency. Next, we perform the column attention to select the most probable KB column. Finally, we show how to use the copy mechanism to incorporate the retrieved entity while decoding.Our Framework ::: Entity-Consistency Augmented Decoder ::: KB Row Selection ::: Dialogue History Representation:We encode the dialogue history by adopting the neural bag-of-words (BoW) followed the original paper BIBREF13. Each token in the dialogue history is mapped into a vector by another embedding function phi ^{text{emb}^{prime }}(x) and the dialogue history representation mathbf {q} is computed as the sum of these vectors: mathbf {q} = sum ^{m}_{i=1} phi ^{text{emb}^{prime }} (x_{i}) .Our Framework ::: Entity-Consistency Augmented Decoder ::: KB Column SelectionAfter getting the retrieved row result that indicates which KB row is the most relevant to the generation, we further perform column attention in decoding time to select the probable KB column. For our KB column selection, following the eric:2017:SIGDial we use the decoder hidden state (tilde{mathbf {h}}_{1}, tilde{mathbf {h}}_2, ...,tilde{mathbf {h}}_t) to compute an attention score with the embedding of column attribute name. The attention score mathbf {c}in R^{|mathcal {E}|} then become the logits of the column be selected, which can be calculated aswhere mathbf {c}_j is the attention score of the j^{text{th}} KB column, mathbf {k}_j is represented with the embedding of word embedding of KB column name. W^{^{prime }}_{1}, W^{^{prime }}_{2} and mathbf {t}^{T} are trainable parameters of the model.Training the KB-RetrieverAs mentioned in section SECREF9, we adopt the memory network to train our KB-retriever. However, in the Seq2Seq dialogue generation, the training data does not include the annotated KB row retrieval results, which makes supervised training the KB-retriever impossible. To tackle this problem, we propose two training methods for our KB-row-retriever. 1) In the first method, inspired by the recent success of distant supervision in information extraction BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19, we take advantage of the similarity between the surface string of KB entries and the reference response, and design a set of heuristics to extract training data for the KB-retriever. 2) In the second method, instead of training the KB-retriever as an independent component, we train it along with the training of the Seq2Seq dialogue generation. To make the retrieval process in Equation DISPLAY_FORM13 differentiable, we use Gumbel-Softmax BIBREF14 as an approximation of the operatornamewithlimits{argmax} during training.Training the KB-Retriever ::: Training with Gumbel-SoftmaxIn addition to treating the row retrieval result as an input to the generation model, and training the kb-row-retriever independently, we can train it along with the training of the Seq2Seq dialogue generation in an end-to-end fashion. The major difficulty of such a training scheme is that the discrete retrieval result is not differentiable and the training signal from the generation model cannot be passed to the parameters of the retriever. Gumbel-softmax technique BIBREF14 has been shown an effective approximation to the discrete variable and proved to work in sentence representation. In this paper, we adopt the Gumbel-Softmax technique to train the KB retriever. We useas the approximation of T, where mathbf {g}_{j} are i.i.d samples drawn from text{Gumbel}(0,1) and tau  is a constant that controls the smoothness of the distribution. T^{text{approx}}_{j} replaces T^{text{}}_{j} in equation DISPLAY_FORM13 and goes through the same flattening and expanding process as mathbf {V} to get mathbf {v}^{mathbf {t}^{text{approx}^{prime }}} and the training signal from Seq2Seq generation is passed via the logitTo make training with Gumbel-Softmax more stable, we first initialize the parameters by pre-training the KB-retriever with distant supervision and further fine-tuning our framework.ResultsFollow the prior works BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF9, we adopt the BLEU and the Micro Entity F1 to evaluate our model performance. The experimental results are illustrated in Table TABREF30.In the first block of Table TABREF30, we show the Human, rule-based and KV Net (with*) result which are reported from eric:2017:SIGDial. We argue that their results are not directly comparable because their work uses the entities in thier canonicalized forms, which are not calculated based on real entity value. It's noticing that our framework with two methods still outperform KV Net in InCar dataset on whole BLEU and Entity F metrics, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.In the second block of Table TABREF30, we can see that our framework trained with both the distant supervision and the Gumbel-Softmax beats all existing models on two datasets. Our model outperforms each baseline on both BLEU and F1 metrics. In InCar dataset, Our model with Gumbel-Softmax has the highest BLEU compared with baselines, which which shows that our framework can generate more fluent response. Especially, our framework has achieved 2.5% improvement on navigate domain, 1.8% improvement on weather domain and 3.5% improvement on calendar domain on F1 metric. It indicates that the effectiveness of our KB-retriever module and our framework can retrieve more correct entity from KB. In CamRest dataset, the same trend of improvement has been witnessed, which further show the effectiveness of our framework.Besides, we observe that the model trained with Gumbel-Softmax outperforms with distant supervision method. We attribute this to the fact that the KB-retriever and the Seq2Seq module are fine-tuned in an end-to-end fashion, which can refine the KB-retriever and further promote the dialogue generation.Results ::: Generation ConsistencyIn this paper, we expect the consistent generation from our model. To verify this, we compute the consistency recall of the utterances that have multiple entities. An utterance is considered as consistent if it has multiple entities and these entities belong to the same row which we annotated with distant supervision.The consistency result is shown in Table TABREF37. From this table, we can see that incorporating retriever in the dialogue generation improves the consistency.Results ::: Human EvaluationWe provide human evaluation on our framework and the compared models. These responses are based on distinct dialogue history. We hire several human experts and ask them to judge the quality of the responses according to correctness, fluency, and humanlikeness on a scale from 1 to 5. In each judgment, the expert is presented with the dialogue history, an output of a system with the name anonymized, and the gold response.The evaluation results are illustrated in Table TABREF37. Our framework outperforms other baseline models on all metrics according to Table TABREF37. The most significant improvement is from correctness, indicating that our model can retrieve accurate entity from KB and generate more informative information that the users want to know.Related WorkSequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models in text generation BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4 has gained more popular and they are applied for the open-domain dialogs BIBREF24, BIBREF25 in the end-to-end training method. Recently, the Seq2Seq can be used for learning task oriented dialogs and how to query the structured KB is the remaining challenges.Properly querying the KB has long been a challenge in the task-oriented dialogue system. In the pipeline system, the KB query is strongly correlated with the design of language understanding, state tracking, and policy management. Typically, after obtaining the dialogue state, the policy management module issues an API call accordingly to query the KB. With the development of neural network in natural language processing, efforts have been made to replacing the discrete and pre-defined dialogue state with the distributed representation BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF26. In our framework, our retrieval result can be treated as a numeric representation of the API call return.Instead of interacting with the KB via API calls, more and more recent works tried to incorporate KB query as a part of the model. The most popular way of modeling KB query is treating it as an attention network over the entire KB entities BIBREF6, BIBREF27, BIBREF8, BIBREF28, BIBREF29 and the return can be a fuzzy summation of the entity representations. madotto2018mem2seq's practice of modeling the KB query with memory network can also be considered as learning an attentive preference over these entities. wen2018sequence propose the implicit dialogue state representation to query the KB and achieve the promising performance. Different from their modes, we propose the KB-retriever to explicitly query the KB, and the query result is used to filter the irrelevant entities in the dialogue generation to improve the consistency among the output entities.ConclusionIn this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve entities consistency by querying KB in two steps. In the first step, inspired by the observation that a response can usually be supported by a single KB row, we introduce the KB retriever to return the most relevant KB row, which is used to filter the irrelevant KB entities and encourage consistent generation. In the second step, we further perform attention mechanism to select the most relevant KB column. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method. Extensive analysis further confirms the observation and reveal the correlation between the success of KB query and the success of task-oriented dialogue generation.Figure 1: An example of a task-oriented dialogue that incorporates a knowledge base (KB). The fourth row in KB supports the second turn of the dialogue. A dialogue system will produce a response with conflict entities if it includes the POI in the fourth row and the address in the fifth row, like âValero is located at 899 Ames Ctâ.Table 1: Comparison of our model with baselinesTable 2: The generation consistency and Human Evaluation on navigation domain.

Although NFAT has been recently shown to be inducible in several non-T immune cells, the NFAT gene family members characterized to date have been isolated only from T cells. To further characterize NFAT function in human B cells and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of NFAT proteins, we report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from the Raji B cell line. The cDNA clone encodes a new isoform, NFATc. beta, of the NFAT gene family member NFATc (designated here NFATc. alpha). The amino acid sequence of NFATc. beta differs from that of NFATc. alpha in the first NH2-terminal 29 residues and contains an additional region of 142 residues at the COOH terminus. Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two mRNA species of 2. 7 and 4. 5 kilobase pairs, while an NFATc. beta-specific probe detected only the 4. 5-kilobase pair mRNA which was preferentially expressed in the spleen. Transient expression of NFATc. beta was capable of activating an interleukin-2 NFAT-driven reporter gene in stimulated Jurkat cells in a CsA-sensitive manner. However, NFATc. beta neither bound to the kappa3 element (an NFAT-binding site) in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter nor activated the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in cotransfection assays. These data suggest that different members or isoforms of NFAT gene family may regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"stimulated Jurkat cells\\", \\"Raji B cell line\\", \\"Jurkat cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human B cells\\", \\"non - T immune cells\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"NFAT - binding site\\", \\"NFAT gene family members\\", \\"kappa3 element\\", \\"cDNA clone\\", \\"NFATc . beta - specific probe\\", \\"interleukin - 2 NFAT - driven reporter gene\\", \\"cytokine genes\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor - alpha promoter\\", \\"NFAT gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"142 residues\\", \\"NFAT gene family member\\", \\"NFATc . alpha\\", \\"NFAT\\", \\"amino acid sequence\\", \\"NFAT proteins\\", \\"cyclosporin A (CsA) / FK506 - sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells\\", \\"NH2 - terminal 29 residues\\", \\"NFATc\\", \\"nuclear factor of activated T cells\\", \\"interleukin - 2\\", \\"NFATc . beta\\", \\"T cells\\", \\"COOH terminus\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"4 . 5 - kilobase pair mRNA\\", \\"2 . 7 and 4 . 5 kilobase pairs\\", \\"mRNA species\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2012 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Clostridium difficile toxin A displays both cytotoxic and enterotoxic activities. It has recently been demonstrated that toxin A exerts its cytotoxic effect by the glucosylation of the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family. Diethyl pyrocarbonate, at pH 7.0, was used to chemically modify exposed histidine residues on toxin A. Modification of toxin A with diethyl pyrocarbonate abolished both its cytotoxic activity and the ability of the toxin to bind Zn-Sepharose gel. Treatment of toxin A with [(14)C]-diethyl pyrocarbonate revealed concentration dependent labelling of histidine residues on the toxin molecules. The effects of diethyl pyrocarbonate could be reversed by hydroxylamine treatment. These data suggest the modified histidine residues on toxin A are critical to its cytotoxic activity. Histidine modification had no effect on the glucosyl transferase enzyme activity of toxin A. However, modification abolished the 'cold' binding of toxin to bovine thyroglobulin in an ELISA and reduced ligand binding activity in a rabbit erythrocyte haemagglutination assay. The data suggest that the histidine residues may be crucial to the receptor-binding activity of toxin A. Exposed histidines on toxin A are available for zinc chelation, and these have been exploited in the development of a novel purification protocol for toxin A using zinc-chelating chromatography.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"zinc\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": [\\"hydroxylamine\\", \\"Clostridium difficile toxin A\\", \\"Diethyl pyrocarbonate\\", \\"toxin A\\", \\"diethyl pyrocarbonate\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

However, most human solid tumors have an abnormal karyotype implying that gain and loss of chromosomes by cancer cells confers a selective advantage. CIN can be induced in the mouse by inactivating the spindle assembly checkpoint. This is lethal in the germline but we show here that adult T cells and hepatocytes can survive conditional inactivation of the Mad2l1 SAC gene and resulting CIN. This causes rapid onset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia( T-ALL) and progressive development of hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC), both lethal diseases. The resulting DNA copy number variation and patterns of chromosome loss and gain are tumor-type specific, suggesting differential selective pressures on the two tumor cell types.Introduction:Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, is a hallmark of solid tumors and in human cancers is frequently an indicator of poor prognosis. Genomic instability has the potential to promote loss of tumor suppressors and increases in oncogene copy number, thereby driving tumorigenesis. However, experiments in non-transformed cells show that chromosome imbalance imposes a physiological burden that reduces cell fitness( Torres et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2008; Kops et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2003). Primary murine embryonic fibroblasts( MEFs) engineered to carry an extra chromosome grow more slowly than wild-type cells and exhibit significant changes in metabolism. The same is true of cells from Down syndrome patients, which carry a supernumerary chromosome 21( Williams et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2010). It remains poorly understood how the oncogenic effects of genomic instability as a driver of gene gain and loss, and the burden of aneuploidy in reducing fitness play out in real tumors. It has been suggested that tumors experience a burst of chromosome instability( CIN) leading to the emergence of clones with greater oncogenic potential but that CIN is then suppressed so that cancer cells maintain a relatively stable karyotype( Lengauer et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2014). This model of âgenome restabilizationâ is supported by statistical analysis of tumor karyotype across large numbers of human cancer genomes including identification of a common cancer karyotype, overlaid by tissue-specific differences, in genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas( Davoli et al., 2013). In addition, aneuploidy appears most common in areas of the genome having more oncogenes and tumor suppressors, implying positive selection. Conversely, however, many solid tumors are genetically heterogeneous, suggesting that CIN is not fully suppressed in growing tumors( Nicholson and Cimini, 2013). Mouse models of CIN provide an excellent tool for studying the role of aneuploidy in tumorigenesis. One method to induce CIN is to disrupt the spindle assembly checkpoint( SAC). The SAC senses the presence of maloriented or detached kinetochores and blocks exit from mitosis until pairs of sister chromatids achieve the bipolar geometry that is uniquely compatible with normal chromosome disjunction( Jallepalli and Lengauer, 2001; Taylor et al., 2004; Rieder et al., 1995). Studying the SAC in mice is complicated by the fact that germline deletion of murine SAC genes is lethal byÂ ~E10. 5( Li et al., 2009; Dobles et al., 2000; Babu et al., 2003; Baker et al., 2004; GarcÃ­a-Higuera et al., 2008; Iwanaga et al., 2007; Perera et al., 2007; Putkey et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004). As a result, most studies of SAC knockouts to date have employed heterozygous animals or hypomorphic alleles, resulting in weak and sporadic tumor development at long latencies( Iwanaga et al., 2007; Burds et al., 2005; Dai et al., 2004; Michel et al., 2001). We have previously shown that deletion of Mad2l1( HUGO MD2L1; UniProt Q9Z1B5), an essential component of the SAC, is tolerated by murine interfollicular epidermal cells, which terminally differentiate to form the outer layers of the skin, but not by hair follicle bulge stem cells, a specialized self-renewing cell type required for hair follicle maintenance( Foijer et al., 2013). These findings support the idea that a functional SAC is required in cells undergoing repeated division, but not necessarily in differentiated cells with limited proliferative potential. The implications for cancer are unclear, since cancers grow from one or a small number of cells which must divide many times to create a macroscopic tumor. In this paper we describe an analysis of tumorigenesis in mice carrying a conditional Mad2l1 deletion in a highly proliferative cell type( T-cells) and in a second cell type in which proliferation is induced by injury( hepatocytes). To tolerize cells to checkpoint loss we also introduced conditional deletions or mutations in Trp53. We found that T-cells and hepatocytes survive checkpoint loss in both the presence and absence of Trp53 mutation but that Trp53 mutations promote oncogenesis( Jacks et al., 1994; Purdie et al., 1994; Donehower et al., 1992). In T-cells, loss of Mad2l1 and Trp53 causes rapidly growing acute lymphoblastic leukemia( T-ALL) and in hepatocytes it causes progressive disease that ends in lethal hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC). Single-cell sequencing shows that Mad2l1-null T-ALLs experienced an elevated rate of chromosome mis-segregation relative to normal T cells and murine T-cells in which the SAC is partially inactivated by truncation of Mps1( Mps1 is another SAC component;( Bakker et al., 2016; Foijer et al., 2014). In contrast, when Mad2l1-null T-ALLs and HCCs were assayed at a population level using array-based comparative genomic hybridization( aCGH) recurrent and tissue-specific patterns of chromosome loss and gain were observed. The differences between single-cell and population-level measures of aneuploidy are most parsimoniously explained by postulating that Mad2l1-null tumors experience ongoing CIN but that specific aneuploid genomes predominate in a tumor as a result of tissue-specific selection.Discussion:The rapid growth of Mad2l1-deficient liquid and solid tumors stands in contrast to previous data showing that Mad2l1 is essential for the survival of cancer cell lines and for development of early mouse embryos( Kops et al., 2004; Dobles et al., 2000). Mad2l1 loss substantially accelerates tumor development in Trp53-positive and/or mutant backgrounds( depending on cell type) emphasizing that checkpoint inactivation and CIN are not just tolerated by cells, they accelerate disease onset in animals already mutant for a potent tumor suppresser. In cultured MEFs and thymocytes assayed in vivo, the microtubule poisons nocodazole and taxol provoke a significantly weaker cell cycle arrest than in wild-type cells. The near-complete absence of response to nocodazole in MEFs is consistent with checkpoint inactivation but in vivo experiments with thymocytes reveal partial responsiveness to taxol. It is unclear whether this reflects the presence of a Mad2l1-independent pathway for detecting and responding to spindle damage, or the presence of unrecombined Mad2l1-positive cells that have a normal checkpoint response; additional single-cell experiments will be required to resolve this matter. Parallel experiments in our labs have shown that checkpoint deficiency is also tolerated by basal epidermal skin cells but is lethal to hair follicle stem cells( Foijer et al., 2013). These data established that SAC inactivation is compatible with proliferation of some cell types but not others. However, our previous hypothesis that the SAC would be required in highly proliferating cells appears not be true. Since most T-ALLs are clonal and show no evidence of Mad2l1 expression, they must arise from a single checkpoint-null initiating cell following many rounds of cell division. Further experiments with Mad2l1f/f animals and Cre drivers should reveal which tissues tolerate checkpoint loss and which do not. The consequences of Mad2l1 inactivation for chromosome structure also appear to differ with cell type: in Mad2l1-deficient HCCs we observe fewer and smaller lesions that in T-ALL. The reasons for this are unknown and the result is subject to the caveat that T-ALLs are clonal and HCC polyclonal. Nonetheless, the data suggest that the consequences of SAC inactivation can vary, providing a rationale for expanding the study of chromosome segregation in human cells from a few transformed lines to multiple primary cell types. Loss of Mad2l1 creates a mutator phenotype in the absence of an overt oncogenic driver. In the current study we detect frequent loss of known tumor suppressor genes, Pten in T-ALL for example, and amplification of known oncogenes, such as MET in HCC. CNVs are also found in many other genes whose function in cancer remains unknown. Large-scale genomic analysis of Mad2l1-deficient tumors may be a generally useful means for identifying new oncogenes and tumor suppressors as well as genes( such as Trp53) whose mutation tolerizes cells to checkpoint loss and aneuploidy( Torres et al., 2010; Fujiwara et al., 2005). Mad2l1f/f animals may also be useful in studying the role of genomic instability in drug resistance and tumor recurrence( Burrell and Swanton, 2014b, 2014a) and in the clonal evolution of tumors( Sotillo et al., 2010). Single-cell sequencing of T-ALLs from Mad2l1-deficient mice reveals extensive aneuploidy and intratumor karyotypic heterogeneity. In some animals with liver cancer, we found evidence of clonal progression from HCA to HCC as well as genetic progression among physically distinct HCCs in a single animal. This is precisely what we would expect of cells experiencing ongoing CIN. Our data are also consistent with findings from ultra-deep whole genome sequencing of lung cancers demonstrating extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity at the level of point mutations and structural chromosome abnormalities( de Bruin et al., 2014; Gerlinger et al., 2012). In these studies, different physical regions from the same tumor were repeatedly sequenced, revealing the presence of shared mutations as well as mutations unique to each region, a pattern consistent with genomic instability. In Mad2l1-deficient murine T-ALLs, HCAs and HCCs, the average karyotype of cell populations is shown by aCGH to involve pan-cancer and tissue-specific patterns of whole chromosome loss and gain. For example, Chr13 is lost and Chr15 gained in both T-ALL and HCC whereas Chr4 and Chr12 are gained in T-ALL and lost in HCC. In humans, recurrent cancer karyotypes have also been observed and these differ between carcinomas, sarcomas and liquid tumors( Zack et al., 2013). Single cell and aCGH data are most easily reconciled by postulating that tumor cells experience ongoing CIN but that specific karyotypes have a selective advantage within the environment of a tumor. Karyotypic variation presumably results in differential loss and gain of oncogenes and tumor suppressors as discussed above, but it also causes large-scale changes in gene expression. In general, genes that are located on chromosomes with abnormal ploidy also change in levels of expression, but even when T-ALL and HCC experience the same change in ploidy for a particular chromosome, GSEA shows that differentially expressed genes do not overlap. We therefore speculate that karyotypic selection is imposed both at the level of structural rearrangements in specific genes and broad changes in gene expression. Selection in the face of ongoing CIN contrasts with a model of a genome restabilization in which CIN is a transient phenomenon and tumor karyotype maintained because aneuploid or structurally abnormal chromosomes are subsequently transmitted with good fidelity. However, further analysis of tumor cells passaged in culture or in syngeneic animals will be required to distinguish unambiguously among these two possibilities.","answer":"An estimated 350 billion of the cells in the human body are dividing at any given moment .

Sometimes mistakes in cell division can result in cells that have the wrong number of chromosomes â a state called aneuploidy . Aneuploidy is rare in healthy cells but occurs in over 75% of cancers . It is the result of a process called chromosomal instability that often leads to the death of healthy cells . However , it is not well understood how aneuploidy affects how cancer cells develop or behave . Mice are commonly used to investigate cancer because they have many genetic similarities with humans . To better understand the relationship between aneuploidy and cancer , Foijer , Albacker et al . engineered mice in which they could induce aneuploidy in liver cells and immune cells called T-cells . This modification accelerated the formation of liver cancer and lymphoma â a cancer of the immune system . The number of chromosomes in the cells of these cancers varied greatly , demonstrating that these cells experience constant chromosomal instability . Overall , this suggests that aneuploidy increases the likelihood of cancer developing . The mouse cancer cells closely resemble their human counterparts , and so could potentially be used to test new cancer drugs . In the future , developing new therapies that selectively target aneuploid cells could result in cancer treatments that have fewer side effects than existing treatments ."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

This results in a significant improvement in speed for high-accuracy detection (59 FPS with mAP 74.3% on VOC2007 test, vs. Faster R-CNN 7 FPS with mAP 73.2% or YOLO 45 FPS with mAP 63.4%). The fundamental improvement in speed comes from eliminating bounding box proposals and the subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage. We are not the first to do this (cf [4, 5]), but by adding a series of improvements, we manage to increase the accuracy significantly over previous attempts. Our improvements include using a small convolutional filter to predict object categories and offsets in bounding box locations, using separate predictors (filters) for different aspect ratio detections, and applying these filters to multiple feature maps from the later stages of a network in order to perform detection at multiple scales. With these modificationsâespecially using multiple layers for prediction at different scalesâwe can achieve high-accuracy using relatively low resolution input, further increasing detection speed. While these contributions may seem small independently, we note that the resulting system improves accuracy on real-time detection for PASCAL VOC from 63.4% mAP for YOLO to 74.3% mAP for our SSD. This is a larger relative improvement in detection accuracy than that from the recent, very high-profile work on residual networksÂ [3]. Furthermore, significantly improving the speed of high-quality detection can broaden the range of settings where computer vision is useful. We summarize our contributions as follows:â¢We introduce SSD, a single-shot detector for multiple categories that is faster than the previous state-of-the-art for single shot detectors (YOLO), and significantly more accurate, in fact as accurate as slower techniques that perform explicit region proposals and pooling (including Faster R-CNN).â¢The core of SSD is predicting category scores and box offsets for a fixed set of default bounding boxes using small convolutional filters applied to feature maps.â¢To achieve high detection accuracy we produce predictions of different scales from feature maps of different scales, and explicitly separate predictions by aspect ratio.â¢These design features lead to simple end-to-end training and high accuracy, even on low resolution input images, further improving the speed vs accuracy trade-off.â¢Experiments include timing and accuracy analysis on models with varying input size evaluated on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC and are compared to a range of recent state-of-the-art approaches.Question: How input image resolution affects the accuracy of the SSD framework?","answer":"The accuracy of SSD framework is relatively more on higher resolution images than on lower resolution images."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

During a review of small intestinal neoplasms, six primary carcinomas of jejunum or ileum with an anaplastic and sarcomatoid histology were identified. At presentation, three of the patients had symptoms related to metastatic disease and three had symptoms referable to the local tumor. The tumors were large (greater than 4.5 cm in diameter), usually endophytic masses composed of large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, anaplastic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. In many areas, the cells had a spindled configuration. Mucin positivity was identified in all six cases. Electron microscopic findings in two cases were indicative of epithelial differentiation. The tumors behaved aggressively; all five patients for whom there was clinical follow-up died of metastases within 40 months. The six anaplastic and sarcomatoid carcinomas were compared with 29 typical adenocarcinomas arising in the jejunum or ileum. Only two of the latter group had symptoms referable to distant metastases at presentation. These tumors also tended to be smaller at presentation (11 tumors were less than 4 cm in greatest dimension). Of 25 patients with typical adenocarcinomas who had acceptable follow-up, 18 (72%) died of disease and five (20%) were alive with no evidence of disease after 5 years. We conclude that anaplastic and sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare variant of small intestinal carcinoma with an aggressive clinical course.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"small intestinal neoplasms\\", \\"anaplastic and sarcomatoid carcinomas\\", \\"anaplastic and sarcomatoid carcinoma\\", \\"metastases\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"eosinophilic cytoplasm\\", \\"Anaplastic and sarcomatoid carcinoma\\", \\"ileum\\", \\"adenocarcinomas\\", \\"masses\\", \\"small intestine\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"nuclei\\", \\"small intestinal carcinoma\\", \\"metastatic disease\\", \\"Carcinomas\\", \\"jejunum\\", \\"epithelial\\", \\"cells\\", \\"primary carcinomas\\", \\"nucleoli\\", \\"sarcomatoid\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010 [3] . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study [1] . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 [1] . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention [4] . Notwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] . Childhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia.  Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course. Chest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization's (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \\"end-point consolidation\\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \\"Other infiltrate\\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \\"Primary end-point pneumonia\\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \\"other\\" infiltrate). Widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] . The WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \\"presumed bacterial pneumonia\\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia. Empyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] . Several national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] . In addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] . A systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] . More recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] . Another etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] . However recent evidence from South Africa (where the acellular vaccine is used) shows an appreciable incidence of pertussis among infants presenting with acute pneumonia: 2% of clinical pneumonia cases among infants enrolled in a birth cohort were caused by pertussis [39] , and 3.7% of infants and young children presenting to a tertiary academic hospital had evidence of pertussis infection [47] . Similarly, childhood tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen in acute pneumonia in children living in high tuberculosis-prevalence settings. Postmortem studies of children dying from acute respiratory illness have commonly reported M. tuberculosis [48, 49] . A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] . Because intrathoracic tuberculosis disease is only culture-confirmed in a minority of cases, the true burden could be even higher; tuberculosis could therefore be an important contributor to childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality in high-prevalence areas. Childhood pneumonia and clinically severe disease result from a complex interaction of host and environmental risk factors [37] . Because of the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination for prevention of radiologic and clinical pneumonia, incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Other risk factors include low birth weight, which is associated with 3.2 times increased odds of severe pneumonia in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.8 times increased odds in high-income countries [51] . Similarly, lack of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4 months of life increases odds of severe pneumonia by 2.7 times in low-and middle-income countries and 1.3 times in highincome countries.Question: What is the increase in the risk of respiratory disease after having childhood pneumonia.","answer":"The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

However, it is reasonable to expect that mechanistically complementary combinations of these measures could have a worthwhile impact on survival times and, when used as adjuvants, could improve the cure rates achievable with standard therapies.

We examined whether betulin, a naturally abundant compound, has anticancer functions in human cancer cells. The results showed that betulin significantly inhibited cell viability in cervix carcinoma HeLa cells, hepatoma HepG2 cells, lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, and breast cancer MCF-7 cells with IC(50) values ranging from 10 to 15 microg/mL. While betulin exhibited only moderate anticancer activity in other human cancer cells such as hepatoma SK-HEP-1 cells, prostate carcinoma PC-3, and lung carcinoma NCI-H460, with IC(50) values ranging from 20 to 60 microg/mL, it showed minor growth inhibition in human erythroleukemia K562 cells (IC(50) > 100 microg/mL). We further investigated the mechanism of anticancer activity by betulin, using HeLa cells as an experimental model. Betulin (10 microg/mL) induces apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by morphological characteristics such as membrane phosphatidylserine translocation, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation. A kinetics analysis showed that the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c occurred as early as 30 min after treatment with betulin. Betulin, unlike its chemical derivative betulinic acid, did not directly trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria. Importantly, Bax and Bak were rapidly translocated to the mitochondria 30 min after betulin treatment. The sequential activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3/-7 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were observed behind those mitochondrial events. Furthermore, specific downregulation of either caspase-9, Bax, or Bak by siRNA effectively reduced PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Taken together, the lines of evidence demonstrate that betulin triggers apoptosis of human cancer cells through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"prostate carcinoma PC-3\\", \\"erythroleukemia K562 cells\\", \\"mitochondria\\", \\"breast cancer MCF-7 cells\\", \\"cancer\\", \\"HeLa cells\\", \\"mitochondrial\\", \\"cell\\", \\"hepatoma HepG2 cells\\", \\"membrane\\", \\"nuclear\\", \\"cervix carcinoma HeLa cells\\", \\"apoptotic body\\", \\"mitochondrial membrane\\", \\"lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells\\", \\"hepatoma SK-HEP-1 cells\\", \\"cancer cells\\", \\"lung carcinoma NCI-H460\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Dose escalation and MTD determination were based on the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1 only.  results A total of 36 patients were enrolled, 26 of whom had NSCLC. All patients received at least one dose of study drug at one of five dose levels. The MTD of the combined regimen was determined to be 1.0/75 mg/m bortezomib/docetaxel. The combination was generally well tolerated. Toxicities were manageable, and no additive toxicities were observed. The most common adverse events were fatigue (67% of patients), nausea (50%), diarrhea (39%), and neutropenia (39%). Two patients with NSCLC achieved a partial response, and seven (19%) patients achieved stable disease (including six patients with NSCLC).  conclusion The combination of bortezomib and docetaxel was feasible and well tolerated in patients with advanced NSCLC or other solid tumors. The recommended phase II dose is bortezomib 1.0 mg/m on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 plus docetaxel 75 mg/m on day 1 , cycled every 21 days . Therapeutic doses of docetaxel and bortezomib are achievable for this combination.sentence: The recommended phase II dose is bortezomib 1.0 mg/m on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 plus docetaxel 75 mg/m on day 1 , cycled every 21 days .","answer":"[[\\"bortezomib\\", \\"docetaxel\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, contact tracing and testing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of a vaccine may be necessary to effectively curtail and eliminating COVID-19 in human populations. This study is based on the use of a mathematical model for assessing the impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19 in the United States. An analytical expression for the minimum percentage of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated in order to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with COVID-19 mortality data for the U.S., show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, at least 82% of the susceptible US population need to be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US, using the hypothetical vaccine, is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with other interventions, such as face mask usage and/or social distancing. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the level of the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the pandemic in the US. For instance, the herd immunity threshold decreases to 72% if half of the US population regularly wears face masks in public (the threshold decreases to 46% if everyone wears a face mask).","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\", \\"Epidemic Forecasting\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

AIM To assess in a randomized study the patient-centred outcome of two guided surgery systems ( mucosa or bone supported ) compared to conventional implant placement , in fully edentulous patients . MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty-nine patients ( 72 jaws ) with edentulous maxillas and/ or mandibles , were consecutively recruited and randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups . Outcome measures were the Dutch version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire ( MPQ-DLV ) , the Health-related quality of life instrument ( HRQOL ) , visual analogue scales ( VAS ) , the duration of the procedure , and the analgesic doses taken each day . RESULTS Three hundred and fourteen implants were placed successfully . No statistical differences could be shown between treatment groups on pain response ( MPQ-DLV ) , treatment perception ( VAS ) or number or kind of pain killers . For the HRQOLI-instrument , a significant difference was found between the Materialise Mucosa and Materialise Bone group at day 1 ( p = 0.02 ) and day 2 ( p = 0.01 ) . For the duration of the surgery , a statistical difference ( p = 0.005 ) was found between the Materialise mucosa and the Mental group , in favour of the first .

Using the software WordSmith Tools, the corpus of an undergraduate chiropractic curriculum was analyzed by reviewing collocated terms and through discourse analysis of text blocks containing words based on the root ' sublux .' It was possible to identify 3 distinct concepts which were each referred to as ' subluxation :' i) an acute or instantaneous injurious event; ii) a clinical syndrome which manifested post - injury; iii) a physical lesion, i.e. an anatomical or physiological derangement which in most instances acted as a pain generator. In fact, coherent implicit definitions of subluxation exist and may enjoy broad but subconscious acceptance. However, confusion likely arises from failure to distinguish which concept an author or speaker is referring to when they employ the term subluxation.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"identify\\", \\"subconscious\\", \\"distinguish\\", \\"confusion\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"chiropractic\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"pain\\", \\"possible\\", \\"lesion\\", \\"derangement\\", \\"acceptance\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"subluxation\\", \\"Subluxation\\", \\"injury\\", \\"injurious\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"text\\", \\"definitions\\", \\"software WordSmith Tools\\", \\"words\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"speaker\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"author\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"analyzed\\", \\"study\\", \\"corpus\\", \\"analyze\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"broad\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control. In vitro binding studies with human serum proteins indicate that glipizide binds differently than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicylate or dicumarol. However, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical situation and in the use of glipizide with these drugs. Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be closely observed for loss of control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known. The effect of concomitant administration of fluconazole and glipizide has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled crossover study in normal volunteers. All subjects received glipizide alone and following treatment with 100 mg of fluconazole as a single daily oral dose for seven days. The mean percentage increase in the glipizide AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"phenytoin\\", \\"isoniazid\\", \\"glipizide\\", \\"nicotinic acid\\", \\"chloramphenicol\\", \\"miconazole\\", \\"fluconazole\\", \\"dicumarol\\", \\"tolbutamide\\", \\"probenecid\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"corticosteroids\\", \\"diuretics\\", \\"sulfonylureas\\", \\"calcium channel blocking drugs\\", \\"estrogens\\", \\"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents\\", \\"beta adrenergic blocking agents\\", \\"thiazides\\", \\"azoles\\", \\"salicylates\\", \\"phenothiazines\\", \\"hypoglycemic agents\\", \\"contraceptives\\", \\"salicylate\\", \\"monoamine oxidase inhibitors\\", \\"sulfonamides\\", \\"coumarins\\", \\"thyroid products\\", \\"sympathomimetics\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Although many functions of human alveolar macrophages are altered compared with their precursor cell, the blood monocyte (monocyte), the reason (s) for these functional changes have not been determined. We recently reported that human alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity (Monick, M. M., Carter, A. B., Gudmundsson, G., Geist, L. J., and Hunninghake, G. W. (1998) Am. J. Physiol. 275, L389-L397). To determine why alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity, we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex. There was, however, a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein, REF-1 (which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN proteins), in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes. In addition, in vitro differentiation of monocytes to a macrophage-like cell resulted in decreased amounts of REF-1. Finally, addition of REF-1 from activated monocytes to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in AP-1 DNA binding. These studies strongly suggest that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is associated with a loss of REF-1 and AP-1 activity. This observation may explain, in part, some of the functional differences observed for alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"monocytes\\", \\"alveolar macrophages\\", \\"macrophage - like cell\\", \\"monocyte\\", \\"activated monocytes\\", \\"precursor cell\\", \\"blood monocyte\\", \\"human alveolar macrophages\\", \\"Human alveolar macrophages\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"nuclear protein\\", \\"JUN proteins\\", \\"REF - 1\\", \\"FOS and JUN proteins\\", \\"AP - 1\\", \\"FOS\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

The wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans and the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated  [61] . As members of the parvovirus family, AAVs are small non-enveloped viruses that are stable and amenable to long-term storage without a cold chain. While there is limited preexisting immunity, availability of non-human strains as vaccine candidates eliminates these concerns. Modifications to the vector have increased immunogenicity, as well [60] . There are limited studies using AAVs as vaccine vectors for influenza. An AAV expressing an HA antigen was first shown to induce protective in 2001 [62] . Later, a hybrid AAV derived from two non-human primate isolates (AAVrh32.33) was used to express influenza NP and protect against PR8 challenge in mice [63] . Most recently, following the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, rAAV vectors were generated expressing the HA, NP and matrix 1 (M1) proteins of A/Mexico/4603/2009 (pH1N1), and in murine immunization and challenge studies, the rAAV-HA and rAAV-NP were shown to be protective; however, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + NP + M1 had the most robust protection. Also, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + rAAV-NP + rAAV-M1 were also partially protected against heterologous (PR8, H1N1) challenge [63] . Most recently, an AAV vector was used to deliver passive immunity to influenza [64, 65] . In these studies, AAV (AAV8 and AAV9) was used to deliver an antibody transgene encoding a broadly cross-protective anti-influenza monoclonal antibody for in vivo expression. Both intramuscular and intranasal delivery of the AAVs was shown to protect against a number of influenza virus challenges in mice and ferrets, including H1N1 and H5N1 viruses [64, 65] . These studies suggest that rAAV vectors are promising vaccine and immunoprophylaxis vectors. To this point, while approximately 80 phase I, I/II, II, or III rAAV clinical trials are open, completed, or being reviewed, these have focused upon gene transfer studies and so there is as yet limited safety data for use of rAAV as vaccines [66] . Alphaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Togaviridae family. A variety of alphaviruses have been developed as vaccine vectors, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis (SIN) virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus, as well as chimeric viruses incorporating portions of SIN and VEE viruses. The replication defective vaccines or replicons do not encode viral structural proteins, having these portions of the genome replaces with transgenic material. The structural proteins are provided in cell culture production systems. One important feature of the replicon systems is the self-replicating nature of the RNA. Despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels [67] . SIN, SFV, and VEE have all been tested for efficacy as vaccine vectors for influenza virus [68] [69] [70] [71] . A VEE-based replicon system encoding the HA from PR8 was demonstrated to induce potent HA-specific immune response and protected from challenge in a murine model, despite repeated immunization with the vector expressing a control antigen, suggesting preexisting immunity may not be an issue for the replicon vaccine [68] . A separate study developed a VEE replicon system expressing the HA from A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) and demonstrated varying efficacy after in ovo vaccination or vaccination of 1-day-old chicks [70] . A recombinant SIN virus was use as a vaccine vector to deliver a CD8 + T cell epitope only. The well-characterized NP epitope was transgenically expressed in the SIN system and shown to be immunogenic in mice, priming a robust CD8 + T cell response and reducing influenza virus titer after challenge [69] . More recently, a VEE replicon system expressing the HA protein of PR8 was shown to protect young adult (8-week-old) and aged (12-month-old) mice from lethal homologous challenge [72] . The VEE replicon systems are particularly appealing as the VEE targets antigen-presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, priming rapid and robust immune responses [73] . VEE replicon systems can induce robust mucosal immune responses through intranasal or subcutaneous immunization [72] [73] [74] , and subcutaneous immunization with virus-like replicon particles (VRP) expressing HA-induced antigen-specific systemic IgG and fecal IgA antibodies [74] . VRPs derived from VEE virus have been developed as candidate vaccines for cytomegalovirus (CMV). A phase I clinical trial with the CMV VRP showed the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and potent T cell responses. Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and considered safe [75] . A separate clinical trial assessed efficacy of repeated immunization with a VRP expressing a tumor antigen. The vaccine was safe and despite high vector-specific immunity after initial immunization, continued to boost transgene-specific immune responses upon boost [76] . While additional clinical data is needed, these reports suggest alphavirus replicon systems or VRPs may be safe and efficacious, even in the face of preexisting immunity. Baculovirus has been extensively used to produce recombinant proteins. Recently, a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use and was first available for use in the United States for the 2013-2014 influenza season [4] . Baculoviruses have also been explored as vaccine vectors. Baculoviruses have a number of advantages as vaccine vectors. The viruses have been extensively studied for protein expression and for pesticide use and so are readily manipulated. The vectors can accommodate large gene insertions, show limited cytopathic effect in mammalian cells, and have been shown to infect and express genes of interest in a spectrum of mammalian cells [77] . While the insect promoters are not effective for mammalian gene expression, appropriate promoters can be cloned into the baculovirus vaccine vectors. Baculovirus vectors have been tested as influenza vaccines, with the first reported vaccine using Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) expressing the HA of PR8 under control of the CAG promoter (AcCAG-HA) [77] . Intramuscular, intranasal, intradermal, and intraperitoneal immunization or mice with AcCAG-HA elicited HA-specific antibody responses, however only intranasal immunization provided protection from lethal challenge. Interestingly, intranasal immunization with the wild type AcNPV also resulted in protection from PR8 challenge. The robust innate immune response to the baculovirus provided non-specific protection from subsequent influenza virus infection [78] . While these studies did not demonstrate specific protection, there were antigen-specific immune responses and potential adjuvant effects by the innate response. Baculovirus pseudotype viruses have also been explored. The G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus controlled by the insect polyhedron promoter and the HA of A/Chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1) HPAIV controlled by a CMV promoter were used to generate the BV-G-HA. Intramuscular immunization of mice or chickens with BV-G-HA elicited strong HI and VN serum antibody responses, IFN-Î³ responses, and protected from H5N1 challenge [79] . A separate study demonstrated efficacy using a bivalent pseudotyped baculovirus vector [80] . Baculovirus has also been used to generate an inactivated particle vaccine. The HA of A/Indonesia/CDC669/2006(H5N1) was incorporated into a commercial baculovirus vector controlled by the e1 promoter from White Spot Syndrome Virus. The resulting recombinant virus was propagated in insect (Sf9) cells and inactivated as a particle vaccine [81, 82] . Intranasal delivery with cholera toxin B as an adjuvant elicited robust HI titers and protected from lethal challenge [81] . Oral delivery of this encapsulated vaccine induced robust serum HI titers and mucosal IgA titers in mice, and protected from H5N1 HPAIV challenge. More recently, co-formulations of inactivated baculovirus vectors have also been shown to be effective in mice [83] . While there is growing data on the potential use of baculovirus or pseudotyped baculovirus as a vaccine vector, efficacy data in mammalian animal models other than mice is lacking. There is also no data on the safety in humans, reducing enthusiasm for baculovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza at this time. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes disease in poultry. NDV has a number of appealing qualities as a vaccine vector. As an avian virus, there is little or no preexisting immunity to NDV in humans and NDV propagates to high titers in both chicken eggs and cell culture. As a paramyxovirus, there is no DNA phase in the virus lifecycle reducing concerns of integration events, and the levels of gene expression are driven by the proximity to the leader sequence at the 3' end of the viral genome. This gradient of gene expression enables attenuation through rearrangement of the genome, or by insertion of transgenes within the genome. Finally, pathogenicity of NDV is largely determined by features of the fusion protein enabling ready attenuation of the vaccine vector [84] . Reverse genetics, a method that allows NDV to be rescued from plasmids expressing the viral RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid proteins, was first reported in 1999 [85, 86] . This process has enabled manipulation of the NDV genome as well as incorporation of transgenes and the development of NDV vectors. Influenza was the first infectious disease targeted with a recombinant NDV (rNDV) vector. The HA protein of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) was inserted into the Hitchner B1 vaccine strain. The HA protein was expressed on infected cells and was incorporated into infectious virions. While the virus was attenuated compared to the parental vaccine strain, it induced a robust serum antibody response and protected against homologous influenza virus challenge in a murine model of infection [87] . Subsequently, rNDV was tested as a vaccine vector for HPAIV having varying efficacy against H5 and H7 influenza virus infections in poultry [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . These vaccines have the added benefit of potentially providing protection against both the influenza virus and NDV infection. NDV has also been explored as a vaccine vector for humans. Two NHP studies assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of an rNDV expressing the HA or NA of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; VN1203) [95, 96] . Intranasal and intratracheal delivery of the rNDV-HA or rNDV-NA vaccines induced both serum and mucosal antibody responses and protected from HPAIV challenge [95, 96] . NDV has limited clinical data; however, phase I and phase I/II clinical trials have shown that the NDV vector is well-tolerated, even at high doses delivered intravenously [44, 97] . While these results are promising, additional studies are needed to advance NDV as a human vaccine vector for influenza. Parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) is a paramyxovirus vaccine vector being explored for delivery of influenza and other infectious disease vaccine antigens. PIV5 has only recently been described as a vaccine vector [98] . Similar to other RNA viruses, PIV5 has a number of features that make it an attractive vaccine vector. For example, PIV5 has a stable RNA genome and no DNA phase in virus replication cycle reducing concerns of host genome integration or modification. PIV5 can be grown to very high titers in mammalian vaccine cell culture substrates and is not cytopathic allowing for extended culture and harvest of vaccine virus [98, 99] . Like NDV, PIV5 has a 3'-to 5' gradient of gene expression and insertion of transgenes at different locations in the genome can variably attenuate the virus and alter transgene expression [100] . PIV5 has broad tropism, infecting many cell types, tissues, and species without causing clinical disease, although PIV5 has been associated with -kennel coughâ in dogs [99] . A reverse genetics system for PIV5 was first used to insert the HA gene from A/Udorn/307/72 (H3N2) into the PIV5 genome between the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene and the large (L) polymerase gene. Similar to NDV, the HA was expressed at high levels in infected cells and replicated similarly to the wild type virus, and importantly, was not pathogenic in immunodeficient mice [98] . Additionally, a single intranasal immunization in a murine model of influenza infection was shown to induce neutralizing antibody responses and protect against a virus expressing homologous HA protein [98] . PIV5 has also been explored as a vaccine against HPAIV. Recombinant PIV5 vaccines expressing the HA or NP from VN1203 were tested for efficacy in a murine challenge model. Mice intranasally vaccinated with a single dose of PIV5-H5 vaccine had robust serum and mucosal antibody responses, and were protected from lethal challenge. Notably, although cellular immune responses appeared to contribute to protection, serum antibody was sufficient for protection from challenge [100, 101] . Intramuscular immunization with PIV5-H5 was also shown to be effective at inducing neutralizing antibody responses and protecting against lethal influenza virus challenge [101] . PIV5 expressing the NP protein of HPAIV was also efficacious in the murine immunization and challenge model, where a single intranasal immunization induced robust CD8 + T cell responses and protected against homologous (H5N1) and heterosubtypic (H1N1) virus challenge [102] .Question: What is the advantage of the AAV vector?","answer":"The wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans and the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

Also, there is some evidence of the presence of CB2 receptor in the CNS3.</p><p>Recently, numerous agonists/antagonists of cannabinoid receptors have been explored due to the important role of the endocannabinoid system in various diseases and disorders4. Among these, CB1 receptor ligands have been developed for pain, appetite stimulation, nausea, neurodegeneration, hypermotility, and inflammation.5 However, the CB1 receptor ligands are known to cause side effects in the CNS such as cognitive dysfunction, motor incoordination, and sedation.6 Due to differences in receptor distribution and signal transduction mechanisms, CB2-selective ligands are considered as medications without CNS side effects,7 and such ligands are being actively investigated for use in a multitude of diseases and pathological conditions8, such as atherosclerosis9, myocardial infarction10, stroke11, gastrointestinal inflammatory12, autoimmune13, neurodegenerative14 disorders, bone disorders15, and cancer16.</p><p>The development of CB2 receptor-selective ligands has attracted significant attention due to the therapeutic potential of CB2 receptor modulation.17 The first CB2 inverse agonist is SR144528, which is extensively used as the standard to measure the specificity of various cannabinoid inverse agonists for CB2 in animal models.18 Other notable examples of CB2 receptor agonists/antagonists include AM63019, JTE-907,20Sch225336,21 and JWH-13322. Recently, based on the research in 3D CB2 receptor structure model23 and pharmacophore database searches, our group also reported the discovery of novel bis-amide derivatives (1, Figure 1) as CB2 receptor inverse agonists and osteoclast inhibitors24. However, the optimization of bisamide derivatives is limited by the synthesis method and symmetrical scaffold.</p><p>Based on continuing virtual screening and QSAR results25, we designed and synthesized 2, with a trisubstituted sulfonamide scaffold, as a novel chemotype with CB2 binding activity (CB2Ki = 750 nM). Compared with the structure of 1 and considering the QSAR results, we believed that a longer chain in Zone A was important for the CB2 inverse agonist (Figure 1). Compound 3 with a diethylamino group was synthesized and confirmed to have a better CB2 binding affinity (CB2Ki = 53 nM) and a good CB2 selectivity index (SI = 43, calculated as Ki(CB1)/Ki(CB2) ratio). Given this promising result, 3 was chosen as a prototype for further structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of novel trisubstituted sulfonamide derivatives as CB2 inverse agonists. Binding activities were investigated to define their SAR and ligand functionality. After we modified the groups at Zones A, B, and C, some derivatives, such as 34 (CB2Ki = 5.5 nM, SI = 15), 39 (CB2Ki = 5.4 nM, SI = 95) and 45 (CB2Ki = 4.o nM, SI = 120) were identified as CB2-selective ligands with improved CB2 binding affinity and high selectivity. These compounds were selected for the functional property investigation by a cAMP assay, which showed their high potency (34, EC50 = 8.2 nM, and 39, EC50 = 2.5 nM) as CB2 inverse agonists. Moreover, these compounds also showed great inhibition activity with osteoclast cells.</p><p>The trisubstituted sulfonamide derivatives were synthesized by two general strategies (Scheme 1). In the first strategy, the different imine intermediates, synthesized from reductive amination reactions of substituted aryl aldehydes and various amines, were reacted with different sulfonyl chlorides to prepare compounds 3-12, 14-25, 31-36, and 39-48, as well as with benzyl bromide to obtain 13. Compounds 26-30, 37 and 38 were obtained by the reaction of intermediate 25 with various bromides. The structures of all the compounds were characterized by 1H NMR and ESI-HRMS spectra; purity was confirmed by HPLC.</p><p>Biological data of compounds with different substituents of Zone A are collected in Table 1. Some alkyl chains, whose substituents had been shown in our previous study to be favorable for CB2 receptor affinity24, were introduced to the 4 position of phenyl, such as the bi-alkyl chain (dimethylamino, isopropoxyl, isopropyl), monoalkyl chain substituents (ethoxyl, propoxyl, butyl), and cycloalkanes (1-piperidinyl). Among them, 3 (R1 = diethylamino) and 6 (R1 = 1-piperidinyl) showed higher affinities for CB2 receptor (Ki = 53 nM and 44 nM, respectively) with good CB2 selective index (SI = 43, 28). These results indicated that longer chains and double chains are necessary for improving binding affinity in this scaffold.</p><p>The modification of Zone B was based on maintenance of the diethylamino group in Zone A, as shown in Table 2. Compound 13, in which the sulfo group was replaced by CH2, showed a little lower affinity. A similar result was found when a CH2 was added between the sulfo and the phenyl group (14). Many substituents were introduced to the 4 position of the sulfophenyl, such as Cl, F, H, acetylamide, isopropyl, methoxyl, isopropoxyl, and trifluoromethoxyl. Other than 20 (R2 = 4-methoxyphenyl), which had a similar binding affinity for CB2 receptor (Ki = 46 nM) as 3, 13-22 did not show obvious increased binding affinity. Big groups, like naphthyl and 1,1â²-biphenyl, were also used to replace the 4-methylphenyl. This replacement resulted in a lower binding affinity. These results indicated that 4-methylphenyl and 4-methoxylphenyl are the best groups among our modification of Zone B. Moreover, the CB2 selective indexes of 15, 16, 19, and 20 were quite low, ranging from 6 to 15.</p><p>After investigation of the SAR of R1 and R2 in Zones A and B, the binding affinities were not obviously improved. The following modification of the group R3 in Zone C was based on maintenance of the R1 and R2 groups in 3 (Table 3). As expected, the group R3 is a key substituent for enhancing the CB2 affinity. Firstly, another CH2 was introduced to the N atom and the phenyl ring; compound 26 showed a lower CB2 binding affinity (Ki = 120 nM). The same reduced trends were found when diethylamino and halogen (Cl and F) were added to the phenyl ring in Zone C. The binding affinity at CB2 receptor of 27, 28, 29, and 30 was 540 nM, 210 nM, 390 nM, and 120 nM, respectively. After substitution of the phenyl in Zone C with cyclohexyl, a small increase in affinity was achieved (31, CB2Ki = 34 nM), while replacement by five-membered heterocyclic moieties (in 32 and 33 ) enhanced affinity dramatically, yielding a Ki value of 9.5 and 14 nM at CB2 receptors and of 570 and 610 nM at CB1 receptors, respectively. It seemed that a smaller group in Zone C is preferable for CB2 binding activity, so some compounds with smaller group were synthesized. Compound 34 with the reduced CH2 between the N atom in the core and phenyl group showed a higher CB2 binding affinity (Ki = 5.5 nM, selectivity index = 15). However, replacement with other smaller groups, such as cyclohexyl (35), 5-methylthiazolyl (36), cyclopentyl (37), and allyl (38), significantly reduced the binding activity (CB2Ki = 18 nM, 14 nM, 36 nM, and 66 nM, respectively). Especially, 25, without any substituted group except with an H atom at R3, showed quite low CB2 binding activity (CB2Ki = 3600 nM). This result suggests that the space of the phenyl group is suitable for Zone C and thus addition of a bigger or smaller group results in lower CB2 binding activity.</p><p>Based on the SAR research of Zones A, B, and C, we found that the introduction of some groups to R1, R2, and R3 could improve CB2 binding activity. Further SRA research was based on the compounds library of combinations of these groups: R1 = diethylamino and 1-piperidinyl, R3 = phenyl, cyclohexyl, furan-2-ylmethyl, and 5-methylthiazolyl, and R4 = methoxyl, Cl, isopropyl, and methyl. The results are shown in Table 4 with CB2 binding affinity ranging from 4 nM to 310 nM and selective index ranging from 9 to 120. Among them, two compounds were identified with better CB2 binding activity and selectivity, 39 with CB2Ki = 5.4 nM, SI = 92 and 45 with CB2Ki = 4.0 nM, SI = 120.</p><p>Functional properties were investigated in cAMP assays by using cell-based LANCE cAMP assays as our published protocol26 to measure the agonistic or antagonistic functional activities of the CB2 selective compounds. Since CB2 is a GÎ±i-coupled receptor, an agonist inhibits the forskolin-induced cAMP production, resulting in an increase of the LANCE signal, while an antagonist or inverse agonist decreases the LANCE signal. In addition to 34, 39, 45, and 47, with respective modifications in Zones A, B, and C for good binding activity were selected for cAMP assays. As shown in Figure 2, reduction of the LANCE signal occurred with increasing concentrations of 34, 39, 45, 47 and SR144528 with EC50 values of 8.2Â± 3.1 nM, 2.5 Â± 1.4 nM, 73 Â± 2 nM, 49 Â± 2 nM, and 14 Â± 3 nM, respectively. Such a contrary phenomenon was observed with agonists CP55,940 and HU30827, which showed cAMP production with EC50 values of 11 Â± 2 nM and 85 Â± 5 nM, respectively. Based on the LANCE signal change and the high EC50 value closely correlated with the high affinity value, it suggests that 34, 39, 45, and 47 behaved as CB2 receptor inverse agonists.</p><p>Modulating osteoclast function is a well-known activity of CB2 receptor agonists28 and inverse agonists15c. Three compounds, 34, 39, and 45, were selected based on the results of binding affinity and selectivity, as well as their functionality as candidate inhibitors of osteoclast (OCL) formation. As shown in Figure 3, we tested the effects of these most promising CB2 ligands on osteoclast (OCL) formation using mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells treated by the mouse receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL) plus macrophageâcolony-stimulating factor (MCSF) (see Supporting Information). These three compounds exhibited great inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Among them, 34 showed the most favorable activity. At 0.1, 1 and 5 Î¼M, it suppressed osteoclast formation by 55%, 83%, and 99.7%, respectively. To investigate their cell toxicity, 34 was tested in a cytotoxicity assay without showing any cytotoxic effects at the concentration of 5 Î¼M. These results indicate that our compounds possess favorable therapeutic indexes and the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis is not a result of their cytotoxicity.</p><p>In summary, we have discovered the trisubstituted sulfonamide chemotype as a novel series possessing significant cannabinoid CB2 receptors. Some compounds with high binding affinities and selective indexes of CB2 receptors were identified by optimization of Zones A, B, and C. The potencies of the novel compounds were measured in functional assays, with high potency values (represented by EC50) that are closely correlated with the high affinity values (expressed as Ki), revealing that the novel series behaves as CB2 receptor inverse agonists. The promising inhibition activity to osteoclast cells of this novel series of compounds offers an attractive starting point for further optimization.</p>","answer":"An extensive exploration of the SAR of a trisubstituted sulfonamides series led to the identification of 39, which is a potent and selective CB2 receptor inverse agonist (CB2 Ki = 5.4 nM, and CB1 Ki = 500 nM). The functional properties measured by cAMP assays indicated that the selected compounds were CB2 inverse agonists with high potency values (34, EC50 = 8.2 nM, and 39, EC50 = 2.5 nM). Furthermore, an osteoclastogenesis bioassay indicated that trisubstituted sulfonamide compounds showed great inhibition of osteoclast formation."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Even a moderate increase in the cellular cysteine supply elevates the intracellular glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels and potentiates immunological functions of lymphocytes in vitro. At low GSSG levels, T cells can not optimally activate the immunologically important transcription factor NF kappa B, whereas high GSSG levels inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF kappa B. The effects of GSSG are antagonized by reduced thioredoxin (TRX). As the protein tyrosine kinase activities p56lck and p59fyn are activated in intact cells by hydrogen peroxide, they are likely targets for GSSG action. These redox-regulated enzymes trigger signal cascades for NF kappa B activation and transduce signals from the T cell antigen receptor, from CD4 and CD8 molecules, and from the IL-2 receptor beta-chain. The effector phase of cytotoxic T cell responses and IL-2-dependent functions are inhibited even by a partial depletion of the intracellular GSH pool. As signal transduction is facilitated by prooxidant conditions, we propose that the well-known immunological consequences of GSH depletion ultimately may be results of the accompanying GSSG deficiency. As HIV-infected patients and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have, on the average, significantly decreased plasma cyst (e) ine and intracellular GSH levels, we also hypothesize that AIDS may be the consequence of a GSSG deficiency as well.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"cytotoxic T cell\\", \\"lymphocytes\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"p59fyn\\", \\"thioredoxin\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"T cell antigen receptor\\", \\"IL - 2 receptor beta - chain\\", \\"NF kappa B\\", \\"redox - regulated enzymes\\", \\"p56lck\\", \\"CD4\\", \\"TRX\\", \\"protein tyrosine kinase\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"CD8 molecules\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

MacAlthough M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as a vital therapeutic target in cancer therapy due to their role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis, very few compounds have been identified to inhibit M2-like polarization of TAMs. HEliciting effective antitumor immune responses in patients who fail checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a critical challenge in cancer immunotherapy, and in such patients, tumor-associated myeloid cells and macrophages (TAMs) are promising therapeutic targets. WeAs CSCs depend on their specific niche, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), elucidating the network between CSCs and TAMs may help to effectively inhibit the progression and ADT resistance of prostate cancer.Experimental Design: The underlying intracellular mechanism that sustains the stem-like characteristics of CSCs in prostate cancer was assessed via RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and other assays.Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy, while TAMs targeting therapy using nano-sized drug delivery system (NDDS) is a great challenge.Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a crucial part in cancer evolution.Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of M2 phenotype have mediated the immunosuppression in a tumor microenvironment, facilitating the escape of tumor cells from immunosurveillance.In this review, we outline the importance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to cancer therapy.In particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant leucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a protective niche for tumor cells.These cells, known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), play complex but pivotal roles in the outcome of photodynamic therapy (PDT) of malignant lesions.Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the most abundant innate immune cells in tumors.Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant immune cells in the TME.","answer":"Tumor Associated Macrophages"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial was a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to test whether selenium as selenized yeast ( 200 microg daily ) could prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer among 1312 patients from the Eastern United States who had previously had this disease . Results from September 15 , 1983 , through December 31 , 1993 , showed no association between treatment and the incidence of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin . This report summarizes the entire blinded treatment period , which ended on January 31 , 1996 . The association between treatment and time to first nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis and between treatment and time to multiple skin tumors overall and within subgroups , defined by baseline characteristics , was evaluated . Although results through the entire blinded period continued to show that selenium supplementation was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of basal cell carcinoma ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.09 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.94 to 1.26 ) , selenium supplementation was associated with statistically significantly elevated risk of squamous cell carcinoma ( HR = 1.25 , 95 % CI = 1.03 to 1.51 ) and of total nonmelanoma skin cancer ( HR = 1.17 , 95 % CI = 1.02 to 1.34 ) . Results from the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial conducted among individuals at high risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer continue to demonstrate that selenium supplementation is ineffective at preventing basal cell carcinoma and that it increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma and total nonmelanoma skin cancer .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"selenium as selenized yeast\\", \\"Selenium supplementation\\", \\"placebo-controlled\\", \\"selenium supplementation\\", \\"secondary prevention\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"squamous cell carcinoma\\", \\"basal cell carcinoma\\", \\"basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin\\", \\"elevated risk of squamous cell carcinoma\\", \\"total nonmelanoma skin cancer\\", \\"total nonmelanoma skin cancer .\\", \\"time to multiple skin tumors\\", \\"risk of basal cell carcinoma\\", \\"time to first nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"Eastern United States\\", \\"nonmelanoma skin cancer\\", \\"previously had this disease\\", \\"1312\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

cell stent systems , such as the enterprise stent , in wide - necked cerebral aneurysms . however , in closed - cell stent systems , apposition of the stent strut to the vessel wall may be difficult in cerebral aneurysms with tortuous vasculature .a closed - cell stent system was recently reported to yield \\" incomplete stent apposition in the tortuous vasculature\\".2)3 ) the neuroform ez stent system has an open - cell stent system that employs a microcatheter - based transfer technique .furthermore , this system is expected to provide good navigability and accessibility in the vessel .we expect the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system to be a good option for wide - necked aneurysms with tortuous vasculature . in this retrospective study, we evaluated the feasibility of the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system in cerebral aneurysms that were unfavorable to simple coiling .starting in june 2011 , we developed a jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system , mainly for the coiling of cerebral aneurysms that were unfavorable to simple coiling . from june 2011 to december 2011 , the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system was planned in 22 cerebral aneurysms ( table 1 ) . these lesions were included in our study , which was approved by the institutional review board .the primary techniques used for coil embolization included the jailing technique in 21 lesions and simple coiling in one . in two lesions , we changed the treatment strategy , halting the use of the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system because of failure of the primary treatment plan . without developing an initial plan for the coil embolization , such as a single - catheter technique or stent - assisted coiling , we administered aspirin ( 300 mg ) and clopidogrel ( 300 mg ) to the patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms for at least three hours before the procedure but prescribed the same dose of aspirin and clopidogrel to the patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms immediately after the procedure via nasogastric tube .anticoagulation was initiated by the injection of a bolus of 3000 iu heparin intravenously immediately after femoral puncture , followed by intermittent bolus injection of 1000 iu heparin hourly .coil embolization was performed via a single femoral access in all cases , with a 7 f guider guiding catheter ( boston scientific , natick , ma , usa ) .we attempted several variations of the jailing technique to develop a safer and more efficient strategy for the use of this method : 1 ) a renegade hi flo ( boston scientific , watertown , ma , usa ) microcatheter was positioned first , and then an excelsior sl-10 ( boston scientific , natick , ma , usa ) microcatheter was inserted into the cerebral aneurysm . finally , a neuroform ez stent delivery system was advanced into the renegade hi flo microcatheter ( n = 9 ) .2 ) an excelsior sl-10 microcatheter was first inserted into the cerebral aneurysm , and then a renegade hi flo microcatheter was positioned distal to the cerebral aneurysm .finally , a neuroform ez stent delivery system was advanced into the renegade hi flo microcatheter ( n = 7 ) .flo microcatheter was positioned first , and then a neuroform ez stent delivery system was advanced into the renegade hi flo microcatheter .subsequently , an excelsior sl-10 microcatheter was inserted into the cerebral aneurysm ( n = 6 ) . in all cases , partial coil packing of the aneurysmwas performed to reduce the risk of unexpected rupture of the aneurysm due to interference between the two microcatheters before the advance of the neuroform ez stent delivery system into the renegade hi flo microcatheter .based on accumulated clinical experience , we suggest that the tortuosity of the vasculature and interference between the microcatheters will be major determinants of the success of the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent systemthe carotid siphon angle is defined as the angle between the supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid artery and the anterior vertical or horizontal segment of the cavernous internal carotid artery .the measurement of the carotid siphon angle was performed semi - automatically on a lateral view of conventional angiography using the picture archiving and communication system ( pacs ) software system ( maroview ; marotech , seoul , kr ) .interference between the two microcatheters is defined as the phenomenon in which one microcatheter , which is inserted into the cerebral aneurysm , is contacted and dislodged from its previous position by another microcatheter that is positioned for stent deployment during any step of the jailing technique .the differences in various characteristics between the presence and absence of interference of microcatheters were evaluated using the fisher exact test for nominal data and the mann - whitney u test for numerical data .null hypotheses of no difference were rejected if p values were less than 0.05 . the form consent was not obtained because this study was a retrospective analysis .the study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the inje university busan paik hospital ( irb no .the differences in various characteristics between the presence and absence of interference of microcatheters were evaluated using the fisher exact test for nominal data and the mann - whitney u test for numerical data .the study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the inje university busan paik hospital ( irb no .we found that the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system was successfully accomplished in 19 cerebral aneurysms and failed in three ( 12.5% ) , although the renegade microcatheter was well positioned in all of the lesions .failure of the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system developed in three lesions during several steps of the procedure , as follows : 1 ) the neuroform ez stent delivery system failed to advance into the positioned renegade microcatheter ( fig .1 ) ; 2 ) the excelsior sl-10 , which had been inserted into the cerebral aneurysm , was dislodged from the cerebral aneurysm by the advance of the neuroform ez stent system into the renegade microcatheter ; and 3 ) the excelsior sl-10 microcatheter failed to insert into the cerebral aneurysm after the renegade microcatheter had been positioned distal to the aneurysm .the case in which the neuroform ez stent delivery system failed to advance into the renegade microcatheter was switched to a jailing technique using an enterprise stent system of a closed - cell design ( fig .the other two cases were treated using the conventional sequential technique of stent - assisted coiling with insertion of the microcatheter into the cerebral aneurysm after stent deployment .interference between the two microcatheters , possibly a major determinant of the success of the jailing technique , developed in six of 21 cerebral aneurysms ( 28.6% ) excluding one lesion into which the microcatheter was not inserted .interference between two microcatheters always developed during the step of the procedure in which the neuroform ez stent delivery system was advanced into the renegade microcatheter regardless of which strategy of the jailing technique was used .analysis of the factors influencing the interference between two microcatheters revealed that the carotid siphon angle is the only statistically significant variable in univariate analysis ( table 2 ) .procedural complications developed in four lesions ( 16.7% ) , including one thromboembolism , one stretched coil loop , and contrast leakage in two lesions .none of the cases of procedural morbidity ( thromboembolism , n = 1 ; contrast leakage , n = 1 ) resulted in neurological deficits at discharge .our study demonstrates that the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system is difficult to apply , especially to cerebral aneurysms with an acute carotid siphon angle .the failure of the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system is explainable by two influences .a case in which the neuroform ez stent delivery system failed to advance into the renegade microcatheter suggests that crumpling of the microcatheter in the tortuous vasculature and subsequent compromise of the inner lumen adversely influence the jailing technique .our test of the renegade microcatheter supported this suggestion that compromise of the inner lumen by crumpling was initiated by curving the microcatheter at approximately 90 degrees and was not restored by the release of the microcatheter in the distal segment .therefore , compromise of the inner lumen of the renegade microcatheter in tortuous vasculature and a lack of subsequent restoration of the inner lumen after the release of the tension on the renegade microcatheter are one of the influencing factors in the failure of the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system .the excelsior xt-27 microcatheter ( striker neurovascular , fremont , ca , usa ) is used in clinical settings and may overcome the drawbacks of the renegade microcatheter such as compromise of the inner lumen .this microcatheter should be studied in the acute carotid siphon angle compared with the renegade microcatheter .another factor influencing failure of this technique is interference between two microcatheters ( one catheter for coiling and another catheter for stent deployment ) . in our series , all cases of interference between two microcatheters developed during the advance of the neuroform ez stent delivery system into the renegade microcatheter .therefore , to reduce interference in the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system , the renegade microcatheter is first navigated distal to the cerebral aneurysm , and then the neuroform ez stent delivery system is advanced into the renegade microcatheter immediately before unsheathing the stent .in addition , the carotid siphon angle is the only statistically significant factor affecting the interference between two microcatheters in the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system .interference between two microcatheters may be expected to occur in the carotid siphon angle less than 50 degree .therefore , in the planning of the coiling of cerebral aneurysms with tortuous vasculature ( carotid siphon angle less than 50 degree ) , the conventional sequential technique , which consists of prior deployment of the stent and subsequent insertion of the microcatheter into the cerebral aneurysm , should be considered for stent - assisted coiling using the neuroform ez stent system .furthermore , in the coiling of cerebral aneurysms in which the insertion of the microcatheter into the aneurysms is expected to be difficult , the jailing technique using a closed - cell stent system , such as the enterprise stent system , should be considered .although our study has a small sample size and is a retrospective design , its significance is focused on the feasibility of the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system in clinical practice .the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system should be carefully considered , especially in the coiling of cerebral aneurysms with tortuous vasculatures .the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system showed considerable rates of technical failure due to interference between the microcatheters in cerebral aneurysms that were unfavorable to simple coiling .therefore , the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent system should be used carefully , especially in cerebral aneurysms with tortuous vasculature .","answer":"objectivean open cell stent system may offer better apposition of cell struts to vessel wall than a closed cell stent system in acute vasculature .  the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of coiling using the jailing technique with the neuroform ez stent system.methodsthe jailing technique using the open - cell stent system of the neuroform ez stent was planned in 22 consecutive patients with 22 cerebral aneurysms .  we retrospectively evaluated the technical success of the jailing technique and the occurrence of interference between two microcatheters as well as the factors influencing this interference.resultsthe jailing technique was successful in 19/22 patients ( 86.4% ) , and interference between two microcatheters occurred in 6/21 ( 28.6% ) .  the jailing technique failed in 3/22 patients , with problems that included failure of the stent delivery system to advance into the positioned microcatheter in one , interference between the microcatheters during the advancement of the stent delivery system in one , and failure of microcatheter insertion into the aneurysm sac in the remaining patient .  interference between the two microcatheters developed during the advance of the stent delivery system into the positioned microcatheter in all cases .  one factor that influences interference between two microcatheters more than expected by chance is the carotid siphon angle ( p = 0.019).conclusionthe acuteness of the carotid siphon angle influences the interference between two microcatheters .  therefore , the jailing technique using the neuroform ez stent should be performed carefully in cerebral aneurysms with an acute carotid siphon angle because the procedure may possibly fail ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The widely used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based 2 target genes (ORF1ab and N). Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging. RESULTS: In 95 samples that tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy number of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2 = 0.83; N gene, R2 = 0.87). Four (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral loads ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test. The viral load of respiratory samples was then compared and the average viral load in sputum (17 429 +/- 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 +/- 1965 copies/test, P < .001) and nasal swabs (651 +/- 501 copies/test, P < .001). Furthermore, the viral loads in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46 800 +/- 17 272 vs 1252 +/- 1027, P < .001) analyzed by sputum samples. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative monitoring of viral load in lower respiratory tract samples helps to evaluate disease progression, especially in cases of low viral load.","answer":"[\\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Selection experiments, which reproduce rapid evolution under controlled conditions, are excellent tools to study how genomes evolve under selection. Here we present a genomic dissection of the Longshanks selection experiment, in which mice were selectively bred over 20 generations for longer tibiae relative to body mass, resulting in 13% longer tibiae in two replicates. We synthesized evolutionary theory, genome sequences and molecular genetics to understand the selection response and found that it involved both polygenic adaptation and discrete loci of major effect, with the strongest loci tending to be selected in parallel between replicates. We show that selection may favor de-repression of bone growth through inactivating two limb enhancers of an inhibitor, Nkx3-2. Our integrative genomic analyses thus show that it is possible to connect individual base-pair changes to the overall selection response.Introduction:Understanding how populations adapt to a changing environment is an urgent challenge of global significance. The problem is especially acute for mammal populations, which are often small and fragmented due to widespread habitat loss. Such populations often show increased inbreeding, leading to the loss of genetic diversity( Hoffmann and SgrÃ², 2011). Because beneficial alleles in mammals typically come from standing genetic variation rather than new mutations like in microbes, this loss of diversity would ultimately impose a limit on the ability of small populations to adapt. Nonetheless, mammals respond readily to selection in many traits, both in nature and in the laboratory( Darwin, 1859; Gingerich, 2001; Garland and Rose, 2009; Keightley et al., 2001). In quantitative genetics, such traits are interpreted as the overall effect from a large set of loci, each with an infinitesimally small( and undetectable) effect( âinfinitesimal modelâ). Broadly speaking, the infinitesimal model has performed remarkably well across a wide range of selection experiments, and the model is the basis for commercial breeding( Walsh and Lynch, 2018). However, it remains unclear what type of genomic change is associated with rapid response to selection, especially in small populations where allele frequency changes can be dominated by random genetic drift. While a large body of theory exists to describe the birth, rise and eventual fixation of adaptive variants under diverse selection scenarios( Maynard Smith and Haigh, 1974; Barton, 1995; Otto and Barton, 2001; Weissman and Barton, 2012; Crow and Kimura, 1965; Hill and Robertson, 1966), few empirical datasets capture sufficient detail on the founding conditions and selection regime to allow full reconstruction of the selection response. This is particularly problematic in nature, where historical samples, environmental measurements and replicates are often missing. Selection experiments, which reproduce rapid evolution under controlled conditions, are therefore excellent tools to understand response to selectionâand by extensionâadaptive evolution in nature( Garland and Rose, 2009). Here we describe an integrative, multi-faceted investigation into an artificial selection experiment, called Longshanks, in which mice were selected for increased tibia length relative to body mass( Marchini et al., 2014). The mammalian limb is an ideal model to study the dynamics of complex traits under selection: it is both morphologically complex and functionally diverse, reflecting its adaptive value; and limb development has been studied extensively in mammals, birds and fishes as a genetic and evolutionary paradigm( Petit et al., 2017). The Longshanks selection experiment thus offers the opportunity to study selection response not only from a quantitative and population genetics perspective, but also from a developmental( Marchini and Rolian, 2018) and genomic perspective. By design, the Longshanks experiment preserves a nearly complete archive of the phenotype( trait measurements) and genotype( via tissue samples) in the pedigree. Previously, Marchini et al. investigated how selection was able to overcome correlation between tibia length and body mass and produced independent changes in tibia length during the first 14 generations of the Longshanks experiment( Marchini et al., 2014). Importantly, that study focused on the phenotypes and inferred genetic correlations indirectly using the pedigree. The current genomic analysis was initiated when the on-going experiment reached generation 17 and extends the previous study by integrating both phenotypic and genetic aspects of the Longshanks experiment. By sequencing the initial and final genomes, the current analysis benefits from direct and highly resolved genetic information. Here, with essentially complete information, we wish to answer a number of important questions regarding the factors that determine and constrain rapid adaptation: Are the observed changes in gene frequency due to selection or random drift? Does rapid selection response of a complex trait proceed through innumerable loci of infinitesimally small effect, or through a few loci of large effect? What type of signature of selection may be associated with this process? Finally, when the same trait changes occur independently, do these depend on changes in the same gene( s) or the same pathways( parallelism)?Discussion:Using the Longshanks selection experiment and synthesizing theory, empirical data and molecular genetics, we show that it is possible to identify some of the individual SNPs that have contributed to the response to selection on morphology. In particular, discrete, large-effect loci are revealed by their parallel response. Further work should focus on dissecting the mechanisms behind the dynamics of selective sweeps and/or polygenic adaptation by re-sequencing the entire selection pedigree, testing how the selection response depends on the genetic architecture, and the extent to which linkage places a fundamental limit on our inference of selection. Improved understanding in these areas may have broad implications for conservation, rapid adaptation to climate change and quantitative genetics in medicine, agriculture and in nature.","answer":"Humans have been making use of artificial selection for thousands of years . Much of what we eat , for example , from beef to poultry to cereals , comes from a collection of organisms with genomes that have been completely reshaped by the actions of generations of farmers and breeders . Yet , despite decades of research in evolutionary biology , it remains difficult to predict what will happen to an organismâs genes when selective pressure is applied . Traits that at first seem simple often arise from layers upon layers of complexity . It can take hundreds if not thousands of tiny changes to many genes , plus just the right alterations to a few key ones , to have a desired effect on a single trait . Also , if you consider that often the genomes of the starting population are unknown and that many traits are under simultaneous selection in wild populations , it becomes clear why many questions remain unanswered . Castro , Yancoskie , et al . have analyzed an on-going laboratory experiment dubbed âthe Longshanks experimentâ to explore how an animalâs genome changes under strong selection . Over five years , two independent populations of mice were selectively bred to have longer legs . In each generation , the mice were measured and those with the longest tibia â a bone in the shin â relative to their body mass were allowed to breed . Genetic data were also recorded . Now , Castro , Yancoskie , et al . have analyzed the genetic data up to the first 17 generations in the Longshanks experiment to find out what kind of genes may be relevant to the 13% increase in leg length seen in the mice so far . This analysis uncovered many genes , possibly thousands , all acting in concert to increase tibia length . But the gene with the largest effect by far was a key developmental gene called Nkx3-2 . Mutations in this gene cause a disease called spondylo-megaepiphyseal-metaphyseal dysplasia in people , which can lead to long limbs and a short trunk . Although inactivating this gene completely in mice is lethal , among the founding group of mice in the Longshanks experiment was a rare copy of Nkx3-2 . This copy of the gene worked perfectly in all tissues with the exception of the legs , where a genetic switch that controls it was left in the âoffâ state . Mice inheriting this short stretch of DNA ended up having longer tibia . In effect , these mice held the winning ticket in the genetic lottery that was the Longshanks experiment . Even in highly controlled experiments that record a great deal of information about the organisms involved , predicting how the genome will change and which genes will be involved is not a straightforward question . Finding out how the genome may change in response to selection is important because scientists can build better models to help with breeding farm animals or crops , or with predicting the consequences of climate change . As a result , experiments such as these may have broad applications in conservation , genomic medicine and agriculture ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

The aim of this study was to assess the first night effect on SB.(METHODS) A retrospective polysomnographic (PSG) analysis was performed of data from a sample of SB patients (12 females, 4 males; age range: 17-39 years) recorded in a sleep laboratory over 2 consecutive nights. Sleep parameters and jaw muscle activity variables (i.e., rhythmic masticatory muscle activity [RMMA]) for SB were quantified and compared between the 2 nights. Subjects were classified into groups according to severity of RMMA frequency, such as low frequency (2-4 episodes/h and/or<25 bursts/h) and moderate-high frequency (â¥ 4 episodes/h and â¥ 25 bursts/h).(RESULTS) Overall, no first night effects were found for most sleep variables. However, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and stage transitions showed significant time and group interactions (repeated measures ANOVAs, p â¤ 0.05). The RMMA episode index did not differ between the 2 nights, whereas the second night showed significantly higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration (repeated measure ANOVAs, p â¤ 0.05). Five patients of 8 in the low frequency group were classified into the moderate-high frequency group on the second night, whereas only one patient in the moderate-high frequency group moved to the low frequency group.Question:Is there a first night effect on sleep bruxism?Answer:","answer":"NO"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Dendritic cells (DC) are potent APC during primary and secondary immune responses. The first objective of this study was to determine whether human DC mediate in vitro sensitization of naive CD4 + T cells to epitopes of the immediate early 62 (IE62) protein of varicella zoster virus (VZV). The induction of CD4 + T cell proliferative responses to eight synthetic peptides representing amino acid sequences of the VZV IE62 protein was assessed using T cells and DC from VZV-susceptible donors. The second objective was to compare in vitro responses of naive T cells with responses to VZV peptides induced in vivo after immunization with varicella vaccine. T cell proliferation was induced by three peptides, P1, P4, and P7, in 71-100% of the donors tested before and after vaccination using DC as APC. Monocytes were effective APC for VZV peptides only after immunization. Two peptides, P2 and P8, induced naive T cell proliferation less effectively and were also less immunogenic for T cells from vaccinated or naturally immune donors. T cell recognition of specific peptides was concordant between naive, DC-mediated responses, and postvaccine responses using monocytes as APC in 69% of comparisons (p = 0. 05; chi2); the predictive value of a positive response to an IE62 peptide before immunization for T cell sensitization in vivo was 82%. These observations indicate that primary T cell responses detected in vitro using DC as APC may be useful to characterize the potential immunogenicity of viral protein epitopes in vivo.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"DC\\", \\"APC\\", \\"monocytes\\", \\"naive T cells\\", \\"naive CD4 + T cells\\", \\"Dendritic cells\\", \\"Dendritic cells (DC)\\", \\"dendritic cells\\", \\"T cells\\", \\"naive human T cells\\", \\"Monocytes\\", \\"human DC\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"amino acid sequences\\", \\"epitopes\\", \\"CD4 +\\", \\"immediate early 62 (IE62) protein\\", \\"VZV IE62 protein\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Background: Chronic sialadenitis is one of the most frequent chronic complications after radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for thyroid cancer. To evaluate the long-term effects of RAI ablation on salivary gland function, we investigated scintigraphic changes in salivary glands by direct comparison of two salivary gland scintigraphies (SGSs) taken before and at 5 years after an RAI ablation. Methods: SGS was performed just before RAI ablation (pre-SGS) and â¼5 years after RAI ablation (F/U SGS) in 213 subjects who underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. The uptake score (U score) was graded, and the ejection fraction (EF) was quantified for the parotid and submandibular glands at pre-SGS and F/U SGS. Changes in salivary gland function were graded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the differences in U score and EF between the two SGSs. Xerostomia was assessed and compared with the SGS findings. Results: Worsening of the U score was observed in 182 of 852 salivary glands (total: 21.3%; mild: 4.2%, moderate: 7.4%, severe: 9.7%), and 47.4% of the patients had a worsening U score for at least one of four salivary glands. A decrease in EF was observed in 173 of 852 salivary glands (total: 20.3%; mild: 5.4%, moderate: 6.8%, severe: 8.1%), and 43.7% of the patients experienced a decrease in the EF of at least one of the four salivary glands. Bilateral parotid gland dysfunction was the most commonly observed condition. Thirty-five (16.4%) patients complained of xerostomia at 5 years after RAI ablation. Scintigraphic changes in salivary gland function and xerostomia were more common in patients receiving 5.55âGBq, compared with 3.7âGBq. Xerostomia was more common in patients with submandibular gland dysfunction than those with parotid gland dysfunction (68.8% vs. 33.3%, p<0.05). The number of dysfunctional salivary glands was correlated with xerostomia (p<0.01). Conclusion: About 20% of the salivary glands were dysfunctional on SGS 5 years after a single RAI ablation, especially in patients who received higher doses of RAI. While parotid glands are more susceptible to (131)I-related damage, xerostomia was more associated with submandibular gland dysfunction and the prevalence of dysfunctional salivary glands.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"RAI\\", \\"radioactive iodine\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Open Issues 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Internet of Things (IoTs) has emerged to motivate various intelligent applications based on the data collected by various âthings.â Cloud computing plays an important role for big data processing by providing data computing and processing services. However, cloud service providers may invade data privacy and provide inaccurate data processing results to users, and thus cannot be fully trusted. On the other hand, limited by computation resources and capabilities, cloud users mostly cannot independently process big data and perform verification on the correctness of data processing. This raises a special challenge on cloud computing verification, especially when user data are stored at the cloud in an encrypted form and processed for satisfying the requests raised in different contexts. But the current literature still lacks serious studies on this research issue. In this paper, we propose a context-aware verifiable computing scheme based on full homomorphic encryption by deploying an auditing protocol to verify the correctness of the encrypted data processing result. We design four optional auditing protocols to satisfy different security requirements. Their performance is evaluated and compared through performance analysis, algorithm implementation, and system simulation. The results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our designs. The pros and cons of all protocols are also analyzed and discussed based on rigorous comparison. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Abstract Social-Internet of Things (S-IoT) fortifies the relationship between computing entities for efficient utilization of resources. S-IoT accentuates on building convivial circles between the devices, which sanction sharing of information without compromising own performance. Trust and privacy are the two factors responsible for the maintenance of these social circles. Trust establishes faith between the entities and privacy supports abstraction of device information. There exist a plethora of approaches, which fixate on trust and privacy in social networks. However, the subsisting solutions rely on a trust scoring system and utilize a single centralized server for these calculations. Such scoring systems are manipulable by eavesdroppers, which engender erroneous reputation leading to high trust values. Considering the desideratum of an efficient trust and privacy-preserving solution, this paper proposes a novel solution in the form of fission computing. The proposed approach relies on the edge-crowd integration for maintenance of trust and preservation of privacy rules in S-IoT. The proposed solution uses crowdsources as mini-edge servers and entropy modeling for defining trust between the entities. Fission managers are responsible for maintaining the privacy rules, which operate for every S-IoT application. The proposed approach is analyzed through numerical simulations by using a safe network as a performance benchmark. Further, the article presents a case study on the detection of fake news sources in S-IoT as an application of the proposed approach. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has gained popularity for its potential to leverage individual mobile devices to sense, collect, and analyze data instead of deploying sensors. As the sensing data become increasingly fine-grained and complicated, there is a tendency to enhance MCS with the edge computing paradigm to reduce time delays and high bandwidth costs. The sensing data may reveal personal information, and thus it is of great significance to preserve the privacy of the participants. However, preserving privacy may hinder the process of handling malicious participants. In this paper, we propose two privacy preserving reputation management schemes for edge computing enhanced MCS to simultaneously preserve privacy and deal with malicious participants. In the basic scheme, a novel reputation value updating method is designed based on the deviations of the encrypted sensing data from the final aggregating result. The basic scheme is efficient at the expense of revealing the deviation value of each participant to the reputation manager. To conquer this drawback, we propose an advanced scheme by updating the reputation values utilizing the rank of deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both these two schemes have high cost efficiency and are effective to deal with malicious participants. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Abstract In recent years, cloud computing has become the most popular and promising service platform. A cloud user can outsource its heavy computation overhead to a cloud service provider (CSP) and let the CSP make the computation instead. In order to guarantee the correctness of the outsourced processing (e.g., machine learning and data mining), a proof should be provided by the CSP in order to make sure that the processing is carried out properly. On the other hand, from the security and privacy points of view, users will always encrypt their sensitive data first before they are outsourced to the CSP rather than sending the raw data directly. However, processing and verifying of encrypted data computation has always been a challenging problem. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has been proposed to tackle this task on computations over encrypted data and ensure the confidentiality of the data. However, original HE cannot provide an efficient approach to verify the correctness of computation over encrypted data that is processed by CSP. In this paper, we propose a verifiable outsourced computation scheme over encrypted data with the help of fully homomorphic encryption and polynomial factorization algorithm. Our scheme protects user data security in outsourced processing and allows public verification on the computation result processed by CSP with zero knowledge. We then prove the security of our scheme and analyze its performance by comparing it with some latest related works. Performances analysis shows that our scheme reduces the overload of both the cloud users and the verifier.Literature Review:","answer":"Based on the analysis and comparison on the existing works in Section V, we outline several open issues on secure data analytics in edge computing as follows. First of all, how to balance security and efficiency is still an open problem. From Table IV , we can observe that most works need user devices or edge nodes to perform some complex operations, which incurs high computation cost. In fact, some IoT applications in edge computing have a high demand on real-time response. The complex computation obviously impacts efficiency, especially for resource-constrained user devices. Therefore, making a tradeoff between security and efficiency becomes necessary in many practical situations. Second, the trustworthiness of networked devices in highly distributed network still need further researches. Though there are a few studies BIB003 , BIB001 , BIB004 on trustworthiness of networked devices, they still have some disadvantages. For example, the works in BIB003 and BIB004 consider only single application scenario and the study in BIB001 does not support mobility and scalability. However, device trustworthiness is an important demand to ensure the QoS of edge nodes and prevent a device from malfunction. Thus, an effective trust model for edge computing should be proposed. Third, UP is ignored in all reviewed works. However, it is very necessary to protect UP in edge computing. Since edge computing is designed specifically for IoT applications, the collected data contain user behavior information and living habit information. An eavesdropper or an edge node could easily obtain usage patterns even if data are encrypted before uploading to an edge server. For example, an eavesdropper can predict when a user is at home through the changes of the readings of a smart meter. Fourth, the literature still lacks an effective solution to verify the correctness of data computation when utilizing edge nodes to do data analytics. The correctness of calculation remains high importance in outsourced data analytics BIB005 , BIB002 . In edge computing, neither cloud servers nor edge nodes can be fully trusted, which makes it hard to ensure the correctness of data computation, processing and analytics. If there is no security solution to guarantee the above correctness, end users will be reluctant to use the services provided by edge computing. Fifth, mobility and scalability of mobile devices cannot be well supported in the current literature. Most existing works neglect the mobility and scalability of user devices when designing security schemes for edge computing. However, user devices and edge nodes might frequently migrate from one place to another. At the same time, user devices could quickly join or leave an edge network. Thus, a security scheme should support mobility and scalability in the context of edge computing, however, this is still an open issue."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In mammals, the principal androgens are testosterone and its 5alpha-reduced metabolite, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Although these androgenic hormones are diverse in character, it is believed that their effects are mediated via the protein products of a single androgen receptor gene encoded on the X-chromosome. A great deal of information has now accumulated pertaining to the mechanisms by which nuclear receptors, such as the androgen receptor, modulate the activity of responsive genes. The studies have demonstrated the participation of a number of ancillary proteins in modulating activation or repression by nuclear receptors. In addition to studies focused on the mechanisms of nuclear receptor function, additional work has illuminated the mechanism by which androgens are metabolized in selected tissues. This information provides a perspective on the number of levels of complexity by which differential gene regulation by androgens may occur in different tissues and in different cell types.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"androgens\\", \\"5alpha-dihydrotestosterone\\", \\"DHT\\", \\"androgen\\", \\"Androgens\\", \\"testosterone\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"nuclear receptors\\", \\"androgen receptor\\", \\"nuclear receptor\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

In this study, we demonstrated that treatment of rat primary astrocytes with antofine induced dose-dependent inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC), as assessed by scrape-loading 6-carboxyfluorescein dye transfer. Levels of Cx43 protein were also decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner following antofine treatment. Double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy showed that antofine (10ng/ml) induced endocytosis of surface gap junctions into the cytoplasm, where Cx43 was co-localized with the early endosome marker EEA1. Inhibition of lysosomes or proteasomes by co-treatment with antofine and their respective specific inhibitors, NH4Cl or MG132, partially inhibited the antofine-induced decrease in Cx43 protein levels, but did not inhibit the antofine-induced inhibition of GJIC. After 30min of treatment, antofine induced a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and activation of protein kinase C (PKC)Î±/Î²II, which was maintained for at least 6h. Co-treatment of astrocytes with antofine and the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM prevented downregulation of Cx43 and inhibition of GJIC. Moreover, co-treatment with antofine and a specific PKCÎ² inhibitor prevented endocytosis of gap junctions, downregulation of Cx43, and inhibition of GJIC. Taken together, these findings indicate that antofine induces Cx43 gap junction disassembly by the PKCÎ² signaling pathway. Inhibition of GJIC by antofine may undermine the neuroprotective effect of astrocytes in CNS.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"antofine\\", \\"BAPTA-AM\\", \\"6-carboxyfluorescein\\", \\"MG132\\", \\"phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid\\", \\"Ca(2+)\\", \\"NH4Cl\\", \\"Antofine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"EEA1\\", \\"connexin43\\", \\"Cx43\\", \\"protein kinase Cu03b2\\", \\"protein kinase C (PKC)u03b1/u03b2II\\", \\"PKCu03b2\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Although it is well established that sequences downstream of the main promoter can affect expression, our understanding of the scale of this effect and how it is encoded in the DNA is limited. Here, to measure the effect of native S. cerevisiae 3â² end sequences on expression, we constructed a library of 85 fluorescent reporter strains that differ only in their 3â² end region. Notably, despite being driven by the same strong promoter, our library spans a continuous twelve-fold range of expression values. These measurements correlate with endogenous mRNA levels, suggesting that the 3â² end contributes to constitutive differences in mRNA levels. We used deep sequencing to map the 3â²UTR ends of our strains and show that determination of polyadenylation sites is intrinsic to the local 3â² end sequence. Polyadenylation mapping was followed by sequence analysis, we found that increased A/T content upstream of the main polyadenylation site correlates with higher expression, both in the library and genome-wide, suggesting that native genes differ by the encoded efficiency of 3â² end processing. Finally, we use single cells fluorescence measurements, in different promoter activation levels, to show that 3â² end sequences modulate protein expression dynamics differently than promoters, by predominantly affecting the size of protein production bursts as opposed to the frequency at which these bursts occur. Altogether, our results lead to a more complete understanding of gene regulation by demonstrating that 3â² end regions have a unique and sequence dependent effect on gene expression.Introduction:Studies aimed at understanding the determinants of gene expression have traditionally been focused on promoter and enhancer sequences. However, regulatory information is also encoded in other genomic regions such as the 5â² and 3â² untranslated regions( UTRs) and may even be embedded within the coding regions themselves[1]â[3]. Since measurements of endogenous expression levels of mRNAs[4]â[9] and proteins[10]â[12] represent the net effect of all regulatory regions and regulatory layers( e. g., transcription, translation and mRNA/protein degradation), it is difficult to use such data to dissect the relative contribution of any single genomic region to the overall measured levels. Thus, if the expression level of one gene is higher than another, we cannot tell which regulatory region or combination thereof causes this behavior. The situation becomes even more complicated when considering the recent observations that suggest that the different regulatory layers often affect each other[13]â[22]. In the context of transcription initiation, the challenge of deciphering the regulatory code that maps sequence into expression levels was addressed by separately fusing the promoter of different genes to a fluorescent protein reporter, integrating the resulting constructs into the same genomic location, and then comparing the levels of the reporters for different promoters[23]â[31]. Since strains for different genes in such synthetic libraries differ only in the promoter sequence that is fused to the reporter, this approach allows a direct measurement of the effect of each promoter sequence on gene expression providing important insights into cis-regulatory mechanisms and principles of promoter activation. Here we adopted this approach to study the independent effect of 3â² end regions on gene expression. Sequences downstream to the promoter are well known to affect expression, yet our knowledge of this effect is usually based on studies that examined single regulatory interactions in the 3â² UTR[32]â[35]. A genome wide view of the interaction network between RNA binding proteins( RBP) and their target mRNA was done in yeast[36],[37] revealing a rich and multidimensional network of interactions. While these results suggest extensive regulation, very few of these interactions were actually shown to affect protein levels. A systematic comparison of the effect of native 3â² end regions on protein expression, independent of genomic context, in similar ways with which promoter sequences were studied, has not been performed. Thus, basic questions such as what is the range of expression differences due to native 3â² end regions, and what fraction of genes have a 3â² end region that causes a significant effect on expression, are largely open. And our understanding of the sequence determinants, that affect protein expression in 3â² end regions, is limited. In addition, given that protein expression is known to occur in bursts[38], it is interesting to test whether different regulatory layers will affect the dynamics of such protein production bursts differentially. To study the effect of 3â² end sequences on protein expression we constructed a library of yeast strains that differ only in the 3â² end sequence integrated immediately downstream to a reporter gene( YFP) with a constant promoter. The yeast S. cerevisiae lacks RNAi activity[39] and thus serves as a good model system to study more basic mechanisms by which 3â² end sequences modulate protein levels. We measured the effect on expression of 85 different 3â² end constructs, taken from metabolic and ribosomal protein yeast genes. Measuring florescence of the various strains in the library, both in batch and in single cells, we found a continuous and wide span of expression values displaying distinct dynamics. We found that nucleotide composition upstream to the polyadenylation site correlates with expression, highlighting the importance of this genomic region to protein levels and suggesting that the efficiency of 3â² end formation may be partly responsible for the observed sequence-specific difference in expression in our library. Further characterization of these sequence features will be needed to identify the exact mechanisms through which 3â² end sequences affect expression levels to pave the way to a more complete understanding of gene regulation that also incorporates the effect of these regions.Discussion:To assess the quantitative effect of different genomic regions it is essential to establish experimental systems that separate these regions from their native genomic context and measure their direct effect. While it is well established that regulatory features other than the promoter can affect gene expression, to our knowledge our work provides the first systematic measurements of the independent effect of regulatory regions other than promoters in yeast. We show that native 3â² end sequences span a broad and continuous range of expression values of greater than 10-fold. Our library represents a limited number of 85 sequences, chosen without any prior knowledge on their expected effect on expression, and is composed of two unrelated functional groups from the yeast genome. Thus, it is likely that the effect of 3â² end sequences in the genome is larger than the effect we observe due to the small sample size of our library. These genes were chosen as they represent two different regulatory strategies, with ribosomal genes being house-keeping genes expressed constitutively in all growth conditions, and the other group being condition specific genes expressed in the growth condition in which we conduct our measurements. Notably, we did not find any major differences in the 3â²end mediated regulation. We quantify the independent effect and explained variance of 3â² end and promoter sequences by comparing our 3â² end library to a promoter library and correlating both to endogenous mRNA levels. The results show that constitutive expression levels are determined by a combination of both regulatory regions. Interestingly, despite the large regulatory potential( dynamic range) of isolated 3â² end constructs on YFP expression, their contribution to the explained variance of endogenous mRNA levels is relatively small. One possible explanation is that the effect of the two regions is not independent; it would thus be interesting to test different 3â² end sequences in different promoter contexts. Although we cannot say whether the A/T content itself causes higher expression or whether it is a proxy for a more specific signal, our results highlight the 3â²UTR end as a genomic region that may have a significant effect on mRNA levels. This sequence signal depends on aligning the sequences by the polyadenylation site. We thus speculate that increased A/T content may result in more efficient 3â² end formation that gives rise to elevated protein expression. It has been previously shown that A/T content is required for efficient 3â² end processing as part of the upstream efficiency element( UAS)[49],[50][51],[58]. More efficient 3â²end processing can result in efficient release of RNA polymerase after polyadenylation and recycling of transcription initiation machinery, given that polyadenylation and transcription termination were shown to be mechanistically coupled[59],[60][61]â[64]. Additional potential means by which efficient polyadenylation could give rise to higher protein expression comes from a recent work in mammalian cells[48], which suggested that with more efficient 3â² end processing, more transcripts escape from nuclear surveillance, resulting in more mature mRNA molecules exported into the cytoplasm. Notably, all of these mechanisms would result in changes in the size of expression bursts. Although it was shown that by deliberately mutating polyadenylation signals, mRNA and protein levels decrease[65]â[67], we suggest that the efficiency of this process varies between native genes and is partly responsible for the observed variability in protein and mRNA expression in the genome. Our study demonstrates the strength of a synthetic approach in establishing a causal link between sequence features and their outputs. Observing correlations in the genome, e. g. between sequence features in the 3â² UTR and expression levels could always be explained by indirect non-causal effects. For example, one could argue that the genes with certain UTR features may also have strong promoters. Observing such connections in a setup such as the current library in which the effect of 3â² UTR sequences is measured in isolation partly removes those potential confounders. Finally, we showed that the observed span of YFP values in our library, mediated by the different 3â² end constructs, affect population noise in a very distinct way compared to expression changes that are mediated by differential promoter activations. Our results thus put 3â² end sequences as appealing candidates for the design of specific circuits in which changes in the mean expression level of a population are needed with little effects on noise. They also demonstrate how the different layers of gene expression regulation affect protein expression with distinct dynamics and propose that such analysis can be used to gain insights into the different layers of regulation involved in an observed change in protein levels.","answer":"A basic question in gene expression is the relative contribution of different regulatory layers and genomic regions to the differences in protein levels .

Short-term administration of the thrombopoiesis-stimulating protein, romiplostim, has been shown to increase platelet counts in most patients with chronic ITP. We assessed the long-term administration of romiplostim in splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients with ITP.                In two parallel trials, 63 splenectomised and 62 non-splenectomised patients with ITP and a mean of three platelet counts 30x10(9)/L or less were randomly assigned 2:1 to subcutaneous injections of romiplostim (n=42 in splenectomised study and n=41 in non-splenectomised study) or placebo (n=21 in both studies) every week for 24 weeks. Doses of study drug were adjusted to maintain platelet counts of 50x10(9)/L to 200x10(9)/L. The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy of romiplostim as measured by a durable platelet response (platelet count > or =50x10(9)/L during 6 or more of the last 8 weeks of treatment) and treatment safety. Analysis was per protocol. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00102323 and NCT00102336.                A durable platelet response was achieved by 16 of 42 splenectomised patients given romplostim versus none of 21 given placebo (difference in proportion of patients responding 38% [95% CI 23.4-52.8], p=0.0013), and by 25 of 41 non-splenectomised patients given romplostim versus one of 21 given placebo (56% [38.7-73.7], p<0.0001). The overall platelet response rate (either durable or transient platelet response) was noted in 88% (36/41) of non-splenectomised and 79% (33/42) of splenectomised patients given romiplostim compared with 14% (three of 21) of non-splenectomised and no splenectomised patients given placebo (p<0.0001). Patients given romiplostim achieved platelet counts of 50x10(9)/L or more on a mean of 13.8 (SE 0.9) weeks (mean 12.3 [1.2] weeks in splenectomised group vs 15.2 [1.2] weeks in non-splenectomised group) compared with 0.8 (0.4) weeks for those given placebo (0.2 [0.1] weeks vs 1.3 [0.8] weeks). 87% (20/23) of patients given romiplostim (12/12 splenectomised and eight of 11 non-splenectomised patients) reduced or discontinued concurrent therapy compared with 38% (six of 16) of those given placebo (one of six splenectomised and five of ten non-splenectomised patients). Adverse events were much the same in patients given romiplostim and placebo. No antibodies against romiplostim or thrombopoietin were detected.                Romiplostim was well tolerated, and increased and maintained platelet counts in splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients with ITP. Many patients were able to reduce or discontinue other ITP medications. Stimulation of platelet production by romiplostim may provide a new therapeutic option for patients with ITP.Title 2:AMG 531, a thrombopoiesis-stimulating protein, for chronic ITP.Abstract 2:Most current treatments for chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) act by decreasing platelet destruction. In a phase 1-2 study, we administered a thrombopoiesis-stimulating protein, AMG 531, to patients with ITP.                In phase 1, 24 patients who had received at least one treatment for ITP were assigned to escalating-dose cohorts of 4 patients each and given two identical doses of AMG 531 (0.2 to 10 microg per kilogram of body weight). In phase 2, 21 patients were randomly assigned to receive six weekly subcutaneous injections of AMG 531 (1, 3, or 6 microg per kilogram) or placebo. The primary objective was to assess the safety of AMG 531; the secondary objective was to evaluate platelet counts during and after treatment.                No major adverse events that could be attributed directly to AMG 531 occurred during the treatment period; 4 of 41 patients had transient post-treatment worsening of thrombocytopenia. In phase 1, a platelet count that was within the targeted range (50,000 to 450,000 per cubic millimeter) and at least twice the baseline count was achieved in 4 of 12 patients given 3, 6, or 10 mug of AMG 531 per kilogram. Overall, a platelet count of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter was achieved in 7 of 12 patients, including 3 with counts exceeding 450,000 per cubic millimeter. Increases in the platelet count were dose-dependent; mean peak counts were 163,000, 309,000, and 746,000 per cubic millimeter with 3, 6, and 10 microg of AMG 531 per kilogram [corrected], respectively. In phase 2, the targeted platelet range was achieved in 10 of 16 patients treated with 1 or 3 mug of AMG 531 per kilogram per week for 6 weeks. Mean peak counts were 135,000, 241,000, and 81,000 per cubic millimeter in the groups that received the 1-mug dose, the 3-mug dose, and placebo, respectively.                AMG 531 caused no major adverse events and increased platelet counts in patients with ITP. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00111475 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

We aimed to compare the response to once daily eltrombopag versus placebo in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia during a 6-month period.                We undertook a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with previously treated immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months' duration who had baseline platelet counts lower than 30,000 per Î¼L. Patients were randomly allocated (in a 2:1 ratio) treatment with local standard of care plus 50 mg eltrombopag or matching placebo once daily for 6 months. Randomisation was done centrally with a computer-generated randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline platelet count (â¤ 15,000 per Î¼L), use of treatment for immune thrombocytopenia, and splenectomy status. Patients, investigators, and those assessing data were masked to allocation. Dose modifications were made on the basis of platelet response. Patients were assessed for response to treatment (defined as a platelet count of 50,000-400,000 per Î¼L) weekly during the first 6 weeks and at least once every 4 weeks thereafter; the primary endpoint was the odds of response to eltrombopag versus placebo. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00370331.                Between Nov 22, 2006, and July 31, 2007, 197 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (135 eltrombopag, 62 placebo). 106 (79%) patients in the eltrombopag group responded to treatment at least once during the study, compared with 17 (28%) patients in the placebo group. The odds of responding were greater in patients in the eltrombopag group compared with those in the placebo group throughout the 6-month treatment period (odds ratio 8Â·2, 99% CI 3Â·59-18Â·73; p<0Â·0001). 37 (59%) patients receiving eltrombopag reduced concomitant treatment versus ten (32%) patients receiving placebo (p=0Â·016). 24 (18%) patients receiving eltrombopag needed rescue treatment compared with 25 (40%) patients receiving placebo (p=0Â·001). Three (2%) patients receiving eltrombopag had thromboembolic events compared with none in patients on placebo. Nine (7%) eltrombopag-treated patients and two (3%) in the placebo group had mild increases in alanine aminotransferase concentration, and five (4%) eltrombopag-treated patients (vs none allocated to placebo) had increases in total bilirubin. Four (7%) patients taking placebo had serious bleeding events, compared with one (<1%) patient treated with eltrombopag.                Eltrombopag is effective for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, and could be particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded to splenectomy or previous treatment. These benefits should be balanced with the potential risks associated with eltrombopag treatment.                GlaxoSmithKline.                Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Stimulation of platelet production may be an effective treatment for this disorder.                We conducted a trial in which 118 adults with chronic ITP and platelet counts of less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter who had had relapses or whose platelet count was refractory to at least one standard treatment for ITP were randomly assigned to receive the oral thrombopoietin-receptor agonist eltrombopag (30, 50, or 75 mg daily) or placebo. The primary end point was a platelet count of 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter on day 43.                In the eltrombopag groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg per day, the primary end point was achieved in 28%, 70%, and 81% of patients, respectively. In the placebo group, the end point was achieved in 11% of patients. The median platelet counts on day 43 for the groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg of eltrombopag were 26,000, 128,000, and 183,000 per cubic millimeter, respectively; for the placebo group the count was 16,000 per cubic millimeter. By day 15, more than 80% of patients receiving 50 or 75 mg of eltrombopag daily had an increased platelet count. Bleeding also decreased during treatment in these two groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the placebo and eltrombopag groups.                Eltrombopag increased platelet counts in a dose-dependent manner in patients with relapsed or refractory ITP.

In this open-label, 52-week study, we randomly assigned 234 adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia, who had not undergone splenectomy, to receive the standard of care (77 patients) or weekly subcutaneous injections of romiplostim (157 patients). Primary end points were incidences of treatment failure and splenectomy. Secondary end points included the rate of a platelet response (a platelet count >50Ã10(9) per liter at any scheduled visit), safety outcomes, and the quality of life.                The rate of a platelet response in the romiplostim group was 2.3 times that in the standard-of-care group (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 2.6; P<0.001). Patients receiving romiplostim had a significantly lower incidence of treatment failure (18 of 157 patients [11%]) than those receiving the standard of care (23 of 77 patients [30%], P<0.001) (odds ratio with romiplostim, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.61). Splenectomy also was performed less frequently in patients receiving romiplostim (14 of 157 patients [9%]) than in those receiving the standard of care (28 of 77 patients [36%], P<0.001) (odds ratio, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.35). The romiplostim group had a lower rate of bleeding events, fewer blood transfusions, and greater improvements in the quality of life than the standard-of-care group. Serious adverse events occurred in 23% of patients (35 of 154) receiving romiplostim and 37% of patients (28 of 75) receiving the standard of care.                Patients treated with romiplostim had a higher rate of a platelet response, lower incidence of treatment failure and splenectomy, less bleeding and fewer blood transfusions, and a higher quality of life than patients treated with the standard of care.

Some researchers propose to use the conditional variational autoencoder(CVAE) which maximizes the lower bound on the conditional log-likelihood on a continuous latent variable. With different sampled la-tent variables, the model is expected to generate diverse responses. Although the CVAE-based models have shown tremendous potential, their improvement of generating high-quality responses is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we introduce a discrete latent variable with an explicit semantic meaning to improve the CVAE on short-text conversation. A major advantage of our model is that we can exploit the semantic distance between the latent variables to maintain good diversity between the sampled latent variables. Accordingly, we pro-pose a two-stage sampling approach to enable efficient diverse variable selection from a large latent space assumed in the short-text conversation task. Experimental results indicate that our model outperforms various kinds of generation models under both automatic and human evaluations and generates more diverse and in-formative responses.Related WorkIn this section, we briefly review recent advancement in encoder-decoder models and CVAE-based models for response generation.Proposed Models ::: DCVAE and Basic Network ModulesFollowing previous CVAE-based generation models BIBREF14, we introduce a latent variable z for each input sequence and our goal is to maximize the lower bound on the conditional data log-likelihood p(mathbf {y}|mathbf {x}), where mathbf {x} is the input query sequence and mathbf {y} is the target response sequence:Here, p(z|mathbf {x})/q(z|mathbf {y},mathbf {x})/p(mathbf {y}|mathbf {x},z) is parameterized by the prior/posterior/generation network respectively. D_{KL}(q(z|mathbf {y},mathbf {x})||p(z|mathbf {x})) is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the posterior and prior distribution. Generally, z is set to follow a Gaussian distribution in both the prior and posterior networks. As mentioned in the related work, directly using the above CVAE formulation causes the low output diversity problem. This observation is also validated in the short-text conversation task in our experiments.Now, we introduce our basic discrete CVAE formulation to alleviate the low output diversity problem. We change the continuous latent variable z to a discrete latent one with an explicit interpretable meaning, which could actively control the generation of the response. An intuitive way is to connect each latent variable with a word in the vocabulary. With a sampled latent z from the prior (in testing)/posterior network (in training), the generation network will take the query representation together with the word embedding of this latent variable as the input to decode the response. Here, we assume that a single word is enough to drive the generation network to output diverse responses for short text conversation, in which the response is generally short and compact.A major advantage of our DCVAE is that for words with far different meanings, their word embeddings (especially that we use a good pre-trained word embedding corpus) generally have a large distance and drive the generation network to decode scattered responses, thus improve the output diversity. In the standard CVAE, z's assumed in a continuous space may not maintain the semantic distance as in the embedding space and diverse z's may point to the same semantic meaning, in which case the generation network is hard to train well with such confusing information. Moreover, we can make use of the semantic distance between latent variables to perform better sampling to approximate the objective during optimization, which will be introduced in Section SECREF10.The latent variable z is thus set to follow a categorical distribution with each dimension corresponding to a word in the vocabulary. Therefore the prior and posterior networks should output categorical probability distributions:where theta  and phi  are parameters of the two networks respectively. The KL distance of these two distributions can be calculated in a closed form solution:where Z contains all words in the vocabulary.In the following, we present the details of the prior, posterior and generation network.Prior network p(z|mathbf {x}): It aims at inferring the latent variable z given the input sequence x. We first obtain an input representation mathbf {h}_{mathbf {x}}^{p} by encoding the input query mathbf {x} with a bi-directional GRU and then compute g_{theta }(mathbf {x}) in Eq. as follows:where theta  contains parameters in both the bidirectional GRU and Eq. DISPLAY_FORM8.Posterior network q(z|mathbf {y}, mathbf {x}): It infers a latent variable z given a input query mathbf {x} and its target response mathbf {y}. We construct both representations for the input and the target sequence by separated bi-directional GRU's, then add them up to compute f_{phi }(mathbf {y}, mathbf {x}) in Eq. to predict the probability of z:where phi  contains parameters in the two encoding functions and Eq. DISPLAY_FORM9. Note that the parameters of the encoding functions are not shared in the prior and posterior network.Generation network p(mathbf {y}|mathbf {x},z): We adopt an encoder-decoder model with attention BIBREF28 used in the decoder. With a sampled latent variable z, a typical strategy is to combine its representation, which in this case is the word embedding mathbf {e}_z of z, only in the beginning of decoding. However, many previous works observe that the influence of the added information will vanish over time BIBREF12, BIBREF21. Thus, after obtaining an attentional hidden state at each decoding step, we concatenate the representation mathbf {h}_z of the latent variable and the current hidden state to produce a final output in our generation network.Experimental Settings ::: DatasetWe conduct our experiments on a short-text conversation benchmark dataset BIBREF2 which contains about 4 million post-response pairs from the Sina Weibo , a Chinese social platforms. We employ the Jieba Chinese word segmenter to tokenize the queries and responses into sequences of Chinese words. We use a vocabulary of 50,000 words (a mixture of Chinese words and characters), which covers 99.98% of words in the dataset. All other words are replaced with <UNK>.Experimental Settings ::: Implementation DetailsWe use single-layer bi-directional GRU for the encoder in the prior/posterior/generation network, and one-layer GRU for the decoder in the generation network. The dimension of all hidden vectors is 1024. The cluster embedding dimension is 620. Except that the word embeddings are initialized by the word embedding corpus BIBREF29, all other parameters are initialized by sampling from a uniform distribution [-0.1,0.1]. The batch size is 128. We use Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. For the number of clusters K in our method, we evaluate four different values (5, 10, 100, 1000) using automatic metrics and set K to 10 which tops the four options empirically. It takes about one day for every two epochs of our model on a Tesla P40 GPU, and we train ten epochs in total. During testing, we use beam search with a beam size of 10.Experimental Settings ::: Compared MethodsIn our work, we focus on comparing various methods that model p(mathbf {y}|mathbf {x}) differently. We compare our proposed discrete CVAE (DCVAE) with the two-stage sampling approach to three categories of response generation models:Baselines: Seq2seq, the basic encoder-decoder model with soft attention mechanism BIBREF30 used in decoding and beam search used in testing; MMI-bidi BIBREF5, which uses the MMI to re-rank results from beam search.CVAE BIBREF14: We adjust the original work which is for multi-round conversation for our single-round setting. For a fair comparison, we utilize the same keywords used in our network pre-training as the knowledge-guided features in this model.Other enhanced encoder-decoder models: Hierarchical Gated Fusion Unit (HGFU) BIBREF12, which incorporates a cue word extracted using pointwise mutual information (PMI) into the decoder to generate meaningful responses; Mechanism-Aware Neural Machine (MANM) BIBREF13, which introduces latent embeddings to allow for multiple diverse response generation.Here, we do not compare RL/GAN-based methods because all our compared methods can replace their objectives with the use of reward functions in the RL-based methods or add a discriminator in the GAN-based methods to further improve the overall performance. However, these are not the contribution of our work, which we leave to future work to discuss the usefulness of our model as well as other enhanced generation models combined with the RL/GAN-based methods.Experimental Settings ::: EvaluationTo evaluate the responses generated by all compared methods, we compute the following automatic metrics on our test set:BLEU: BLEU-n measures the average n-gram precision on a set of reference responses. We report BLEU-n with n=1,2,3,4.Distinct-1 & distinct-2 BIBREF5: We count the numbers of distinct uni-grams and bi-grams in the generated responses and divide the numbers by the total number of generated uni-grams and bi-grams in the test set. These metrics can be regarded as an automatic metric to evaluate the diversity of the responses.Three annotators from a commercial annotation company are recruited to conduct our human evaluation. Responses from different models are shuffled for labeling. 300 test queries are randomly selected out, and annotators are asked to independently score the results of these queries with different points in terms of their quality: (1) Good (3 points): The response is grammatical, semantically relevant to the query, and more importantly informative and interesting; (2) Acceptable (2 points): The response is grammatical, semantically relevant to the query, but too trivial or generic (e.g.,âæä¸ç¥é(I don't know)\\", âæä¹æ¯(Me too)â, âæåæ¬¢(I like it)\\" etc.); (3) Failed (1 point): The response has grammar mistakes or irrelevant to the query.Experimental Results and AnalysisIn the following, we will present results of all compared methods and conduct a case study on such results. Then, we will perform further analysis of our proposed method by varying different settings of the components designed in our model.Experimental Results and Analysis ::: Different Sizes of the Latent SpaceWe vary the size of the latent space (i.e., sampled word space Z) used in our proposed DCVAE. Figure FIGREF32 shows the automatic and human evaluation results on the latent space setting to the top 10k, 20k, all words in the vocabulary. On the automatic evaluation results, if the sampled latent space is getting larger, the BLEU-4 score increases but the distinct ratios drop. We find out that though the DCVAE with a small latent space has a higher distinct-1/2 ratio, many generated sentences are grammatically incorrect. This is also why the BLEU-4 score decreases. On the human evaluation results, all metrics improve with the use of a larger latent space. This is consistent with our motivation that open-domain short-text conversation covers a wide range of topics and areas, and the top frequent words are not enough to capture the content of most training pairs. Thus a small latent space, i.e. the top frequent words only, is not feasible to model enough latent information and a large latent space is generally favored in our proposed model.ConclusionIn this paper, we have presented a novel response generation model for short-text conversation via a discrete CVAE. We replace the continuous latent variable in the standard CVAE by an interpretable discrete variable, which is set to a word in the vocabulary. The sampled latent word has an explicit semantic meaning, acting as a guide to the generation of informative and diverse responses. We also propose to use a two-stage sampling approach to enable efficient selection of diverse variables from a large latent space, which is very essential for our model. Experimental results show that our model outperforms various kinds of generation models under both automatic and human evaluations.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61751206, 61876120).Table 1: The automatic and human evaluation results of all compared methods.

The disease can manifest in both the upper airway (such as chronic rhinosinusitis, CRS) and lower airway (such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD) which greatly affect the patients' quality of life (Calus et al., 2012; Bao et al., 2015) . Treatment and management vary greatly in efficacy due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease. This is further complicated by the effect of episodic exacerbations of the disease, defined as worsening of disease symptoms including wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness (Xepapadaki and Papadopoulos, 2010) . Such exacerbations are due to the effect of enhanced acute airway inflammation impacting upon and worsening the symptoms of the existing disease (Hashimoto et al., 2008; Viniol and Vogelmeier, 2018) . These acute exacerbations are the main cause of morbidity and sometimes mortality in patients, as well as resulting in major economic burdens worldwide. However, due to the complex interactions between the host and the exacerbation agents, the mechanisms of exacerbation may vary considerably in different individuals under various triggers. Acute exacerbations are usually due to the presence of environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants, smoke, cold or dry air and pathogenic microbes in the airway (Gautier and Charpin, 2017; Viniol and Vogelmeier, 2018) . These agents elicit an immune response leading to infiltration of activated immune cells that further release inflammatory mediators that cause acute symptoms such as increased mucus production, cough, wheeze and shortness of breath. Among these agents, viral infection is one of the major drivers of asthma exacerbations accounting for up to 80-90% and 45-80% of exacerbations in children and adults respectively (Grissell et al., 2005; Xepapadaki and Papadopoulos, 2010; Jartti and Gern, 2017; Adeli et al., 2019) . Viral involvement in COPD exacerbation is also equally high, having been detected in 30-80% of acute COPD exacerbations (Kherad et al., 2010; Jafarinejad et al., 2017; Stolz et al., 2019) . Whilst the prevalence of viral exacerbations in CRS is still unclear, its prevalence is likely to be high due to the similar inflammatory nature of these diseases (Rowan et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2017) . One of the reasons for the involvement of respiratory viruses' in exacerbations is their ease of transmission and infection (Kutter et al., 2018) . In addition, the high diversity of the respiratory viruses may also contribute to exacerbations of different nature and severity (Busse et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2014; Jartti and Gern, 2017) . Hence, it is important to identify the exact mechanisms underpinning viral exacerbations in susceptible subjects in order to properly manage exacerbations via supplementary treatments that may alleviate the exacerbation symptoms or prevent severe exacerbations. While the lower airway is the site of dysregulated inflammation in most chronic airway inflammatory diseases, the upper airway remains the first point of contact with sources of exacerbation. Therefore, their interaction with the exacerbation agents may directly contribute to the subsequent responses in the lower airway, in line with the \\"United Airway\\" hypothesis. To elucidate the host airway interaction with viruses leading to exacerbations, we thus focus our review on recent findings of viral interaction with the upper airway. We compiled how viral induced changes to the upper airway may contribute to chronic airway inflammatory disease exacerbations, to provide a unified elucidation of the potential exacerbation mechanisms initiated from predominantly upper airway infections. Despite being a major cause of exacerbation, reports linking respiratory viruses to acute exacerbations only start to emerge in the late 1950s (Pattemore et al., 1992) ; with bacterial infections previously considered as the likely culprit for acute exacerbation (Stevens, 1953; Message and Johnston, 2002) . However, with the advent of PCR technology, more viruses were recovered during acute exacerbations events and reports implicating their role emerged in the late 1980s (Message and Johnston, 2002) . Rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the predominant viruses linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Jartti and Gern, 2017) . Other viruses such as parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV) and adenovirus (AdV) have also been implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent (Johnston et al., 2005; Oliver et al., 2014; Ko et al., 2019) . More recently, other viruses including bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), certain coronavirus (CoV) strains, a specific enterovirus (EV) strain EV-D68, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been reported as contributing to acute exacerbations . The common feature these viruses share is that they can infect both the upper and/or lower airway, further increasing the inflammatory conditions in the diseased airway (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Britto et al., 2017) . Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche (Busse et al., 2010) . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection (Vareille et al., 2011; Braciale et al., 2012) . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Britto et al., 2017; Linden et al., 2019) . This is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections, thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole (Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . Furthermore, due to the different replication cycles and response against the myriad of respiratory viruses, each respiratory virus may also contribute to exacerbations via different mechanisms that may alter their severity. Hence, this review will focus on compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases; as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease. The review will serve to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation. Such an approach may be clinically significant due to the current scarcity of antiviral drugs for the management of viral-induced exacerbations. This will improve the quality of life of patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Once the link between viral infection and acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory disease was established, there have been many reports on the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation induced by respiratory viral infection. Upon infecting the host, viruses evoke an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection. Generally, infected airway epithelial cells release type I (IFNÎ±/Î²) and type III (IFNÎ») interferons, cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1Î± (MIP-1Î±) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Matsukura et al., 2013) . These, in turn, enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNÎ³), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) . These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases. Additionally, in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP), viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2015; Dunican and Fahy, 2015) . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) . Viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation; worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating COPD, CRSsNP and even CRSwNP in certain cases (Wang et al., 2009; Tacon et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . An epithelial-centric alarmin pathway around IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and their interaction with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) has also recently been identified (Nagarkar et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2018; Allinne et al., 2019) . IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP are type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier (Gabryelska et al., 2019; Roan et al., 2019) . ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated (Scanlon and McKenzie, 2012; Li and Hendriks, 2013) . In the event of viral infection, cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier will also induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, with heighten expression in an inflamed airway (Allakhverdi et al., 2007; Goldsmith et al., 2012; Byers et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2013; Beale et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2014; Uller and Persson, 2018; Ravanetti et al., 2019) . These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation ( Camelo et al., 2017) . In the case of COPD, increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation (Silver et al., 2016) . Interestingly, these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 . As integration of the virology, microbiology and immunology of viral infection becomes more interlinked, additional factors and FIGURE 1 | Current understanding of viral induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Upon virus infection in the airway, antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway.Question: What happens when the 3 cytokines are expressed?","answer":"These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation ("},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Here we elucidate the basic rules of Aedes aegypti thermotaxis and test the function of candidate thermoreceptors in this important behavior. We show that host-seeking mosquitoes are maximally attracted to thermal stimuli approximating host body temperatures, seeking relative warmth while avoiding both relative cool and stimuli exceeding host body temperature. We found that the cation channel TRPA1, in addition to playing a conserved role in thermoregulation and chemosensation, is required for this specialized host-selective thermotaxis in mosquitoes. During host-seeking, AaegTRPA1-/- mutants failed to avoid stimuli exceeding host temperature, and were unable to discriminate between host-temperature and high-temperature stimuli. TRPA1-dependent tuning of thermotaxis is likely critical for mosquitoes host-seeking in a complex thermal environment in which humans are warmer than ambient air, but cooler than surrounding sun-warmed surfaces.Introduction:Thermotaxis is a sensory-motor behavior that guides animals toward a preferred temperature. This type of sensory navigation allows animals to avoid environments of noxious cold and heat, with the goal of remaining in physiologically suitable ambient temperatures. For ectotherms, such as most insects, thermotaxis behavior is the primary method of thermoregulation. Terrestrial invertebrates are vulnerable to temperature extremes, facing the risk of desiccation at elevated temperatures, and rapid hypothermia at low temperatures. Therefore, mechanisms to detect environmental temperatures and trigger appropriate approach or avoidance behaviors are extremely important for their survival. For instance, adult Caenorhabditis elegans worms migrate preferentially toward a specific thermal environment determined by the temperature of their cultivation( Hedgecock and Russell, 1975; Mori and Ohshima, 1995). Adult Drosophila melanogaster flies prefer a narrow range of air temperatures around 24â25Â°C( Sayeed and Benzer, 1996; Hamada et al., 2008) and rapidly avoid air temperatures of ~31Â°C( Ni et al., 2013). Interestingly, some hematophagous( blood-feeding) arthropods have evolved a specialized mode of thermotaxis to locate endothermic( warm-blooded) hosts. Such thermophilic behavior is seen in kissing bugs[Triatoma infestans( Flores and Lazzari, 1996) and Rhodnius prolixus( Schmitz et al., 2000)], the bedbug[Cimex lectularius( Rivnai, 1931)], the tick[Ixodes ricinus( Lees, 1948)], and many species of mosquito( Clements, 1999) including Ae. aegypti, a major tropical disease-vector( Bhatt et al., 2013). Female Ae. aegypti require a vertebrate blood meal for the production of eggs, and finding a suitable warm-blooded host is therefore an essential component of reproduction. Mosquitoes use a variety of physical and chemical senses to locate hosts in their environment( CardÃ©, 2015). When host-seeking, these animals become strongly attracted to inanimate warm objects, eagerly probing at them as if they were hosts( Howlett, 1910). In nature, mosquitoes thermotax in a complex thermal landscape in which ambient air temperature, host body temperature, and surrounding surface temperatures can vary widely. For mosquitoes such as Ae. aegypti, host-seeking behavior can be activated by an increase in ambient carbon dioxide( CO2)( Majeed et al., 2014). This activation elicits flight activity( Eiras and Jepson, 1991; McMeniman et al., 2014) and results in an array of behaviors including attraction to visual stimuli( van Breugel et al., 2015) and host olfactory cues( Dekker et al., 2005; McMeniman et al., 2014), and landing on warm objects( Burgess, 1959; Eiras and Jepson, 1994; KrÃ¶ber et al., 2010; Maekawa et al., 2011; McMeniman et al., 2014; van Breugel et al., 2015). Ae. aegypti flying in a wind tunnel can detect a warmed stimulus from a distance, eliciting attraction and thermotaxis( van Breugel et al., 2015). What are the mechanisms by which animals detect thermal stimuli, and how might these be adapted for the specialized needs of heat-seeking female mosquitoes? Thermotaxis is typically initiated by thermosensitive neurons that sample environmental temperature to inform navigational decision-making. Such neurons must be equipped with molecular thermosensors capable of detecting and transducing thermal stimuli. Diverse molecular thermoreceptors have been identified in the animal kingdom, many of which are members of the transient receptor potential( TRP) superfamily of ion channels( Barbagallo and Garrity, 2015; Palkar et al., 2015). Different thermosensitive TRPs show distinct tuning spanning the thermal spectrum from noxious cold to noxious heat. Among these is TRPA1, which is a heat sensor in multiple insects, including the vinegar fly D. melanogaster and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae( Hamada et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Neurons in thermosensitive sensilla( Gingl et al., 2005) of An. gambiae female antennae express TRPA1( Wang et al., 2009). In D. melanogaster, TRPA1 is expressed in internal thermosensors located in the brain, and DmelTRPA1-/- mutants fail to avoid high air temperature in a thermal gradient( Hamada et al., 2008). Interestingly, some snakes and vampire bats express thermosensitive TRP channels in organs used to sense infrared radiation from warm-blooded prey( Gracheva et al., 2010; 2011). This raises the possibility that AaegTRPA1 may be used by mosquitoes to find hosts. Recently, a structurally distinct insect thermosensor, Gr28b, was identified in D. melanogaster( Ni et al., 2013). Gr28b, a gustatory receptor paralog, is expressed in heat-sensitive neurons of D. melanogaster aristae and is an important component of thermotaxis during rapid avoidance of heat( Ni et al., 2013). It is also highly conserved among Drosophila species( McBride et al., 2007), and has a clear ortholog in Ae. aegypti, AaegGr19( Ni et al., 2013). A functional role for these thermosensors has never been investigated in the mosquito. Here, we use high-resolution quantitative assays to examine the behavioral strategies underlying mosquito heat-seeking behavior. Our results show that by seeking relative warmth and avoiding both relative cool and high temperatures, female mosquitoes selectively localized to thermal stimuli that approximate warm-blooded hosts. Using genome editing, we generated mutations in the candidate thermoreceptors, AaegTRPA1 and AaegGr19. We found that TRPA1 is required for tuning mosquito thermotaxis during host-seeking. AaegTRPA1-/-Â mutants lacked normal avoidance of thermal stimuli exceeding host body temperatures, resulting in a loss of preference for biologicallyÂ relevant thermal stimuli that resemble hosts. This work is important because it identifies a key mechanism by which mosquitoes tune their thermosensory systems toward human body temperatures.Discussion:We have elucidated the basic thermotaxis strategies used by mosquitoes, and revealed an important role for TRPA1 in regulating this behavior( Figure 4E). Using a quantitative thermotaxis assay, we modelled Ae. aegypti heat-seeking behavior in the laboratory. We found that mosquitoes can search for hosts in a wide range of ambient temperatures by seeking relative warmth and avoiding relative cool. Remarkably, these animals can detect a stimulus with thermal contrast as small as 2. 5Â°C. In an outdoor environment, however, hosts are often warmer than the surrounding air but cooler than sun-warmed soil, rocks, trees, and human-made objects( Figure 4F). For this reason, diurnal mosquitoes such as Ae. aegypti are poorly served by merely thermotaxing to the hottest object available. A more optimal strategy is to search specifically for biologically relevant stimuli, and to avoid thermal stimuli exceeding host temperature, as we have observed in our laboratory models of heat-seeking. Acquiring a blood meal is an essential component of reproduction for a female Ae. aegypti mosquito. To maximize her chances of success, a female mosquito should reject âdistractingâ stimuli that exceed host temperatures. Our results demonstrate that AaegTRPA1 is critical for this selective thermotaxis. Mosquito heat-seeking behavior represents an excellent model system for further study of the genetics( Kang et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2012), neuroscience( Frank et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015), and decision-making( Luo et al., 2010) underlying thermosensation and thermotaxis. Until now, mechanistic studies of thermosensation have been largely restricted to traditional laboratory model organisms, such as domestic mice and Drosophila melanogaster flies, whose thermotaxis consists mainly of moving away from suboptimal thermal environments. Mosquitoes too, must undergo such behavioral thermoregulation, as we have found in our thermal gradient assay. However, their repertoire of thermotactic behaviors is expanded by the evolution of a specialized and highly tuned mode of thermotaxis to locate warm-blooded hosts. It may also be that these two thermotactic drivesâhost-seeking and thermoregulationâinteract in mosquitoes. For instance, the avoidance of high-temperature stimuli during heat-seeking may be influenced by a nociceptive or thermoregulatory response independent of host-seeking behavior. It will be interesting to investigate the neural mechanisms that regulate divergent behavioral choices of thermoregulation and heat-seeking, and whether these systems are in behavioral conflict during mosquito host-seeking. Our work identifies TRPA1 as a gene regulating mosquito avoidance of high-temperature stimuli, which we have shown to be a major behavioral component of heat-seeking. However, because both AaegTRPA1-/- and AaegGr19-/-Â mutants retain normal attraction to warmth, this aspect of heat-seeking must rely on other thermoreceptors, still to be identified. Our study shows that this attraction must be mediated either by a single thermosensor that adapts to background temperature, or multiple thermosensors each tuned to a distinct absolute threshold. During interactions with a warm-blooded host or a 50Â°C Peltier, mosquitoes are likely experiencing a wide range of thermal fluctuations. For instance, there can be a 10Â°C thermal gradient in the air within 5 mm of a 37Â°C stimulus or human arm( van Breugel et al., 2015). This suggests that for a mosquito standing on a warmed Peltier, the antennae, brain, thorax, forelegs, and proboscis may all be experiencing different temperatures. The temperature of mosquito tissues will also be greatly influenced by their material and geometric properties, as well as thermal conduction due to contact with the Peltier. Furthermore, convective plumes forming in the air near a vertical heated plate can be highly dynamic and turbulent in their structure, with thermal air gradients differing considerably at the bottom and top of the plate( Bejan, 2013). These features of thermal stimuli may explain why mosquitoes in our assay often appear to be differentially attracted to the bottom and top of the Peltier. Future studies characterizing this complex thermal microenvironment, and identifying the relevant thermosensory neurons and receptors will be required to define the thermal fluctuations experienced by mosquitoes during heat-seeking. Understanding the behavioral and molecular basis of thermotaxis in mosquitoes and other disease vectors( Flores and Lazzari, 1996; Schmitz et al., 2000) is of great biomedical importance. Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are potent vectors of yellow fever, chikungunya, and dengue arboviruses, resulting annually in hundreds of millions of infections( Bhatt et al., 2013). Further study of mosquito heat-seeking behavior may aid in the design of next-generation traps, repellents, and control strategies.","answer":"Temperature can vary considerably in an environment . Living organisms have evolved sensory systems to detect and avoid excessive heat or cold: a behavior that is termed âthermotaxisâ . In rare cases , animals use this ability to locate food sources in their environment . One example of such an adaptation is the female mosquito of the species Aedes aegypti . When a mosquito needs blood to produce her eggs , she becomes attracted to the body heat of warm-blooded hosts . But the range of temperatures that these mosquitoes prefer and the genes required for this behavior had not been been defined . Now , Corfas and Vosshall have found that female Aedes aegypti are highly sensitive to differences in temperature , and are capable of heat-seeking in a range of environmental temperatures . Furthermore , by seeking out things that are warmer than their surroundings , while avoiding those that are cooler or much hotter than their hostâs body temperatures , these mosquitoes tune their thermotaxis toward targets that resemble a human to feed upon . Corfas and Vosshall also discovered that a protein called TRPA1 is required for this tuning of Aedes aegyptiâs heat-seeking behavior . This protein is known to allow insects to detect chemical signals and regulate their own temperature , but it was not previously known that this protein was involved in mosquito thermotaxis . Mutant mosquitoes without the gene for TRPA1 failed to avoid high temperatures , which meant that they could no longer tell the difference between an overly hot target and a warm one that resembled their hosts . Following on from this work , the next challenge will be to characterize all the genes , sensory organs , and neural circuits that drive mosquito heat-seeking behavior . These findings may in the future inform the design of the next generation of repellents and traps for the control of mosquito-borne diseases , such as dengue and yellow fever ."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

A randomized, controlled intervention trial of 146 military conscripts.Abstract 1:BACKGROUND Shock-absorbing and biomechanic shoe orthoses are frequently used in the prevention and treatment of back and lower extremity problems . One review concludes that the former is clinical ly effective in relation to prevention , whereas the latter has been tested in only 1 r and omized clinical trial , concluding that stress fractures could be prevented . OBJECTIVES To investigate if biomechanic shoe orthoses can prevent problems in the back and lower extremities and if reducing the number of days off-duty because of back or lower extremity problems is possible . DESIGN Prospect i ve , r and omized , controlled intervention trial . STUDY SUBJECTS One female and 145 male military conscripts ( aged 18 to 24 years ) , representing 25 % of all new conscripts in a Danish regiment . METHOD Health data were collected by question naires at initiation of the study and 3 months later . Custom-made biomechanic shoe orthoses to be worn in military boots were provided to all in the study group during the 3-month intervention period . No intervention was provided for the control group . Differences between the 2 groups were tested with the chi-square test , and statistical significance was accepted at P < .05 . Risk ratio ( RR ) , risk difference ( ARR ) , numbers needed to prevent ( NNP ) , and cost per successfully prevented case were calculated . OUTCOME VARIABLES Outcome variables included self-reported back and /or lower extremity problems ; specific problems in the back or knees or shin splints , Achilles tendonitis , sprained ankle , or other problems in the lower extremity ; number of subjects with at least 1 day off-duty because of back or lower extremity problems and total number of days off-duty within the first 3 months of military service because of back or lower extremity problems . RESULTS Results were significantly better in an actual-use analysis in the intervention group for total number of subjects with back or lower extremity problems ( RR 0.7 , ARR 19 % , NNP 5 , cost 98 US dollars ) ; number of subjects with shin splints ( RR 0.2 , ARR 19 % , NNP 5 , cost 101 US dollars ) ; number of off-duty days because of back or lower extremity problems ( RR 0.6 , ARR < 1 % , NNP 200 , cost 3750 US dollars ) . In an intention-to-treat analysis , a significant difference was found for only number of subjects with shin splints ( RR 0.3 , ARR 18 % , NNP 6 cost 105 US dollars ) , whereas a worst-case analysis revealed no significant differences between the study groups . CONCLUSIONS This study shows that it may be possible to prevent certain musculoskeletal problems in the back or lower extremities among military conscripts by using custom-made biomechanic shoe orthoses . However , because care-seeking for lower extremity problems is rare , using this method of prevention in military conscripts would be too costly . We also noted that the choice of statistical approach determined the outcomeTitle 2:A Controlled Randomized Study of the Effect of Training With Orthoses on the Incidence of Weight Bearing Induced Back Pain Among Infantry RecruitsAbstract 2:Study Design . R and omized controlled trial . Objectives . To determine if the use of custom shoe orthoses can lessen the incidence of weight bearing-induced back pain .  Summary of Background Data . The scientific basis for the use of orthoses to prevent back pain is based principally on studies that show that shoe orthoses can attenuate the shock wave generated at heel strike . The repetitive impulsive loading that occurs because of this shock wave can cause wear of the mechanical structures of the back . Previous r and omized studies showed mixed results in preventing back pain , were not blinded , and used orthoses for only short periods of time . Methods . A total of 404 eligible new infantry recruits without a history of prior back pain were r and omly assigned to received either custom soft , semirigid biomechanical , or simple shoe inserts without supportive or shock absorbing qualities . Recruits were review ed biweekly by an orthopaedist for back signs and symptoms during the course of 14 weeks of basic training Results . The overall incidence of back pain was 14 % . By intention-to treat and per- protocol analyses , there was no statistically significant difference between the incidence of either subjective or objective back pain among the 3 treatment groups . Significantly more recruits who received soft custom orthoses finished training in their assigned orthoses ( 67.5 % ) than those who received semirigid biomechanical orthoses ( 45.5 % ) or simple shoe inserts ( 48.6 % ) , P = 0.001 . Conclusions . The results of this study do not support the use of orthoses , either custom soft or semirigid biomechanical , as prophylactic treatment for weight bearing-induced back pain .  Custom soft orthoses had a higher utilization rate than the semirigid biomechanical or simple shoe inserts . The pretraining physical fitness and sports participation of recruits were not related to the incidence of weight bearing-induced back painTitle 3:Clinical importance of changes in chronic pain intensity measured on an 11-point numerical pain rating scaleAbstract 3:& NA ;  Pain intensity is frequently measured on an 11âpoint pain intensity numerical rating scale ( PIâNRS ) , where 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain . However , it is difficult to interpret the clinical importance of changes from baseline on this scale ( such as a 1â or 2âpoint change ) . To date , there are no data driven estimates for clinical ly important differences in pain intensity scales used for chronic pain studies . We have estimated a clinical ly important difference on this scale by relating it to global assessment s of change in multiple studies of chronic pain . Data on 2724 subjects from 10 recently completed placeboâcontrolled clinical trials of pregabalin in diabetic neuropathy , postherpetic neuralgia , chronic low back pain , fibromyalgia , and osteoarthritis were used . The studies had similar design s and measurement instruments , including the PIâNRS , collected in a daily diary , and the st and ard sevenâpoint patient global impression of change ( PGIC ) , collected at the endpoint . The changes in the PIâNRS from baseline to the endpoint were compared to the PGIC for each subject . Categories of â much improved â and â very much improved â were used as determinants of a clinical ly important difference and the relationship to the PIâNRS was explored using graphs , box plots , and sensitivity/specificity analyses . A consistent relationship between the change in PIâNRS and the PGIC was demonstrated regardless of study , disease type , age , sex , study result , or treatment group . On average , a reduction of approximately two points or a reduction of approximately 30 % in the PIâNRS represented a clinical ly important difference . The relationship between percent change and the PGIC was also consistent regardless of baseline pain , while higher baseline scores required larger raw changes to represent a clinical ly important difference . The application of these results to future studies may provide a st and ard definition of clinical ly important improvement in clinical trials of chronic pain therapies . Use of a st and ard outcome across chronic pain studies would greatly enhance the comparability , validity , and clinical applicability of these studiesTitle 4:The effect of insoles on the incidence and severity of low back pain among workers whose job involves long-distance walkingAbstract 4:The prevalence and incidence of low back pain in general society is high . Workers whose job involves walking long distances have an even higher tendency to suffer from low back pain . A positive effect of insoles in reducing low back pain was found in professional sports players . This was not examined on people whose job involves walking long distances . In this double blind prospect i ve study we examined the effectiveness of insoles constructed in a computerized method to placebo insoles in 58 employees whose work entailed extensive walking and who suffered from low back pain . The evaluation was performed by the MILLION question naire , which is considered as a valid question naire for evaluation of low back pain . We calculated the differences of the pain intensity before and after the intervention , in the employees using the insoles manufactured by computer  in comparison to the users of the  placebo insoles .  In each group , the analysis was performed in comparison to the baseline . A total of 81 % of the employees preferred the real insoles as effective and comfortable in comparison to 19 % of the users of the placebo insoles ( P<0.05 ) . The results of this study indicate a substantial improvement in the low back pain after the use of the true insoles . The average pain intensity according to the MILLION question naire before the use of the insoles was 5.46 . However , after the use of the real insoles and the placebo insoles , the average pain intensity decreased to 3.96 and 5.11 , respectively . The difference of the average pain intensity at the start of the study and after the use of the real insoles was significant : â1.49 ( P=0.0001 ) , whereas this difference after the use of the placebo insoles was not significant : â0.31 ( P=0.1189 ) . The reported severity of pain also decreased significantly : a level 5 pain and above was reported by 77 % of the subjects at the start of the study . After the use of the real insoles only 37.9 % of the subjects reported a similar degree of pain severity , and 50 % of the subjects did so after the use of the placebo insoles ( P < 0.05 ) . We did not find a link between low back pain and other variables such as gender , age , number of offspring , work seniority , smoking , previous use of insoles and previous medication . This study demonstrates that the low back pain decreased significantly after the use of real insoles compared to placebo onesTitle 5:Prevention of common overuse injuries by the use of shock absorbing insolesAbstract 5:Sedentary individuals , particularly new military recruits , who start a physical training program have a substantial risk of developing an overuse injury of the lower limb . In this study we investigated the effect of neoprene insoles on the incidence of overuse injuries during 9 weeks of basic military training . The experimental group consisted of 237 r and omly selected new recruits , while 1151 recruits were the control group . Insoles were given to the experimental group and compliance was monitored . A panel of doctors documented and classi fied all injuries occurring during the 9 week period . A total of 54 ( 22.8 % ) and 237 ( 31.9 % ) injuries were reported in the experimental and control groups , re spectively . In both groups , the majority of injuries were overuse ( experimental group , 90.7 % ; control group , 86.4 % ) . The mean weekly incidence of total overuse injuries and tibial stress syndrome was significantly lower ( P < 0.05 ) in the experimental group . The mean incidence of stress fractures was lower in the experimental group but not significantly so ( 0.05 < P < 0.1 ) . This study shows that the incidence of total overuse injuries and tibial stress syndrome during 9 weeks of basic military training can be reduced by wearing insolesTitle 6:Chronic low-back pain and its response to custom-made foot orthoses.Abstract 6:A new approach to treating chronic low-back pain with custom-made foot orthoses was investigated . The Quebec  Back Pain Disability Scale was used to objective ly assess the functional disability of 32 subjects at different times . Subjects in this prospect i ve study experienced more than twice the improvement in alleviation of pain , and for twice as long , compared with subjects in a study using traditional back-pain treatment . The authors believe that the findings of this study may provide a new method by which patients with chronic low-back pain can be evaluated and treatedTitle 7:Effect of viscoelastic insoles on pain.Abstract 7:The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of viscoelastic shoe inserts on  pain in nursing students . Students ( N = 100 ) were r and omly assigned to control and viscoelastic groups . The viscoelastic group used viscoelastic insoles in their work shoes for five weeks . A pain question naire was used to measure location and intensity of post-work pain . The question naire was administered as a pre-test and after five weeks . Post-test comparisons between groups indicated significant differences which were not present at pre-test . The viscoelastic group reported a significant peripheral shift in pain location from back to lower extremity ; the viscoelastic group also showed significant changes in duration of post-work pain and frequency of pain during the workday . The clinical efficacy of viscoelastic shoe inserts for modifying weight bearing-induced back pain is supported . Further clinical research into the therapeutic and prophylactic value of shock-attenuating shoe inserts for healthy as well as patient population s is advocated","answer":"There is strong evidence that the use of insoles does not prevent back pain .There is limited evidence that insoles alleviate back pain or adversely shift the pain to the lower extremities .There is strong evidence that insoles are not effective for the prevention of back pain ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Ginseng total saponins, ginsenosides Rb2, Rg1 and Rd administered intraperitoneally attenuated the immobilization stress-induced increase in plasma IL-6 level. But, intracerebroventricular injection of each ginsenoside did not affect plasma IL-6 level induced by immobilization stress. Ginsenosides Rb2, Rd and Rg1 significantly decreased norepinephrine and/or epinephrine-induced increase of IL-6 level in macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). Thus, it can be suggested that the inhibitory action of ginseng saponins against the immobilization stress-induced increase of plasma IL-6 level would be in periphery; at least in part, mediated by blocking norepinephrine- and/or epinephrine-induced increase of IL-6 level in macrophage rather than in the brain.

Tarsal coalition is a distinct feature of Muenke syndrome and has been reported since the initial description of the disorder in the 1990s.Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies.Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3(P250R) mutation is an autosomal dominant disorder mostly identified with coronal suture synostosis, but it also presents with other craniofacial phenotypes that include mild to moderate midface hypoplasia.Sensorineural hearing loss at lower frequencies was found only in patients with Muenke syndrome.Sensorineural hearing loss can occur in all 4 syndromes studied but is the primary cause of hearing loss in children and young adults with Muenke syndrome.The facial features of children with FGFR3Pro250Arg mutation (Muenke syndrome) differ from those with the other eponymous craniosynostotic disorders. We documented midfacial growth and position of the forehead after fronto-orbital advancement (FOA) in patients with the FGFR3 mutation.The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.Muenke syndrome is characterized by considerable phenotypic variability: features may include coronal synostosis (more often bilateral than unilateral); synostosis of other sutures, all sutures (pansynostosis), or no sutures; or macrocephaly. Bilateral coronal synostosis typically results in brachycephaly (broad skull), although turribrachycephaly (a \\"tower-shaped\\" skull) or a cloverleaf skull can be observed. Unilateral coronal synostosis results in anterior plagiocephaly (asymmetry of the skull and face). Other craniofacial findings typically include: ocular hypertelorism, ptosis or proptosis (usually mild), midface hypoplasia, temporal bossing, and a highly arched palate. Strabismus is common. Extracranial findings can include: hearing loss (in 33%-100% of affected individuals); developmental delay (~33%); intellectual disability; carpal bone and/or tarsal bone fusions; brachydactyly, broad toes, broad thumbs, and/or clinodactyly; and radiographic findings of thimble-like (short and broad) middle phalanges and/or cone-shaped epiphyses. Phenotypic variability is considerable even within the same family.Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.A majority of the patients (95%) demonstrated a mild-to-moderate, low frequency sensorineural hearing loss.Increased digital markings were more severe posteriorly in Muenke patients than in non-Muenke patients. The Muenke patients with unilateral coronal synostosis showed a somewhat more severe asymmetry in the anterior part of the skull than the non-Muenke patients.Muenke syndrome is a genetically determined craniosynostosis that involves one or both coronal sutures.

Muenke syndrome is characterized by coronal craniosynostosis (bilateral more often than unilateral), hearing loss, developmental delay, and carpal and/or tarsal bone coalition. Tarsal coalition is a distinct feature of Muenke syndrome and has been reported since the initial description of the disorder in the 1990s.    Muenke syndrome is characterized by considerable phenotypic variability: features may include coronal synostosis (more often bilateral than unilateral); synostosis of other sutures, all sutures (pansynostosis), or no sutures; or macrocephaly. Bilateral coronal synostosis typically results in brachycephaly (broad skull), although turribrachycephaly (a \\"tower-shaped\\" skull) or a cloverleaf skull can be observed. Unilateral coronal synostosis results in anterior plagiocephaly (asymmetry of the skull and face). Other craniofacial findings typically include: ocular hypertelorism, ptosis or proptosis (usually mild), midface hypoplasia, temporal bossing, and a highly arched palate. Strabismus is common. Extracranial findings can include: hearing loss (in 33%-100% of affected individuals); developmental delay (~33%); intellectual disability; carpal bone and/or tarsal bone fusions; brachydactyly, broad toes, broad thumbs, and/or clinodactyly; and radiographic findings of thimble-like (short and broad) middle phalanges and/or cone-shaped epiphyses.

Information regarding such documents can be accessed online in the Theses and Dissertations Catalog (TDC), which contains abstracts in Portuguese and English, and additional metadata. Thus, this database can be a potential source of parallel corpora for the Portuguese and English languages. In this article, we present the development of a parallel corpus from TDC, which is made available by CAPES under the open data initiative. Approximately 240,000 documents were collected and aligned using the Hunalign tool. We demonstrate the capability of our developed corpus by training Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for both language directions, followed by a comparison with Google Translate (GT). Both translation models presented better BLEU scores than GT, with NMT system being the most accurate one. Sentence alignment was also manually evaluated, presenting an average of 82.30% correctly aligned sentences. Our parallel corpus is freely available in TMX format, with complementary information regarding document metadataIntroductionThe availability of cross-language parallel corpora is one of the basis of current Statistical and Neural Machine Translation systems (e.g. SMT and NMT). Acquiring a high-quality parallel corpus that is large enough to train MT systems, specially NMT ones, is not a trivial task, since it usually demands human curating and correct alignment. In light of that, the automated creation of parallel corpora from freely available resources is extremely important in Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling the development of accurate MT solutions. Many parallel corpora are already available, some with bilingual alignment, while others are multilingually aligned, with 3 or more languages, such as Europarl BIBREF0 , from the European Parliament, JRC-Acquis BIBREF1 , from the European Commission, OpenSubtitles BIBREF2 , from movies subtitles.The extraction of parallel sentences from scientific writing can be a valuable language resource for MT and other NLP tasks. The development of parallel corpora from scientific texts has been researched by several authors, aiming at translation of biomedical articles BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , or named entity recognition of biomedical concepts BIBREF5 . Regarding Portuguese/English and English/Spanish language pairs, the FAPESP corpus BIBREF6 , from the Brazilian magazine revista pesquisa FAPESP, contains more than 150,000 aligned sentences per language pair, constituting an important language resource.In Brazil, the governmental body responsible for overseeing post-graduate programs across the country, called CAPES, tracks every enrolled student and scientific production. In addition, CAPES maintains a freely accessible database of theses and dissertations produced by the graduate students (i.e. Theses and Dissertations Catalog - TDC) since 1987, with abstracts available since 2013. Under recent governmental efforts in data sharing, CAPES made TDC available in CSV format, making it easily accessible for data mining tasks. Recent data files, from 2013 to 2016, contain valuable information for NLP purposes, such as abstracts in Portuguese and English, scientific categories, and keywords. Thus, TDC can be an important source of parallel Portuguese/English scientific abstracts.In this work, we developed a sentence aligned parallel corpus gathered from CAPES TDC comprised of abstracts in English and Portuguese spanning the years from 2013 to 2016. In addition, we included metadata regarding the respective theses and dissertations.Material and MethodsIn this section, we detail the information retrieved from CAPES website, the filtering process, the sentence alignment, and the evaluation experiments. An overview of the steps employed in this article is shown in Figure FIGREF1 .Document retrieval and parsingThe TDC datasets are available in the CAPES open data website divided by years, from 2013 to 2016 in CSV and XLSX formats. We downloaded all CSV files from the respective website and loaded them into an SQL database for better manipulation. The database was then filtered to remove documents without both Portuguese and English abstracts, and additional metadata selected.After the initial filtering, the resulting documents were processed for language checking to make sure that there was no misplacing of English abstracts in the Portuguese field, or the other way around, removing the documents that presented such inconsistency. We also performed a case folding to lower case letters, since the TDC datasets present all fields with uppercase letters. In addition, we also removed newline/carriage return characters (i.e n and r), as they would interfere with the sentence alignment tool.Sentence alignmentFor sentence alignment, we used the LF aligner tool, a wrapper around the Hunalign tool BIBREF7 , which provides an easy to use and complete solution for sentence alignment, including pre-loaded dictionaries for several languages.Hunalign uses Gale-Church sentence-length information to first automatically build a dictionary based on this alignment. Once the dictionary is built, the algorithm realigns the input text in a second iteration, this time combining sentence-length information with the dictionary. When a dictionary is supplied to the algorithm, the first step is skipped. A drawback of Hunalign is that it is not designed to handle large corpora (above 10 thousand sentences), causing large memory consumption. In these cases, the algorithm cuts the large corpus in smaller manageable chunks, which may affect dictionary building.The parallel abstracts were supplied to the aligner, which performed sentence segmentation followed by sentence alignment. A small modification in the sentence segmentation algorithm was performed to handle the fact that all words are in lowercase letters, which originally prevented segmentation. After sentence alignment, the following post-processing steps were performed: (i) removal of all non-aligned sentences; (ii) removal of all sentences with fewer than three characters, since they are likely to be noise.Machine translation evaluationTo evaluate the usefulness of our corpus for SMT purposes, we used it to train an automatic translator with Moses BIBREF8 . We also trained an NMT model using the OpenNMT system BIBREF9 , and used the Google Translate Toolkit to produce state-of-the-art comparison results. The produced translations were evaluated according to the BLEU score BIBREF10 .Manual evaluationAlthough the Hunalign tool usually presents a good alignment between sentences, we also conducted a manual validation to evaluate the quality of the aligned sentences. We randomly selected 400 pairs of sentences. If the pair was fully aligned, we marked it as \\"correct\\"; if the pair was incompletely aligned, due to segmentation errors, for instance, we marked it as \\"partial\\"; otherwise, when the pair was incorrectly aligned, we marked it as \\"no alignment\\".Results and DiscussionIn this section, we present the corpus' statistics and quality evaluation regarding SMT and NMT systems, as well as the manual evaluation of sentence alignment.Corpus statisticsTable TABREF12 shows the statistics (i.e. number of documents and sentences) for the aligned corpus according to the 9 main knowledge areas defined by CAPES. The dataset is available in TMX format BIBREF11 , since it is the standard format for translation memories. We also made available the aligned corpus in an SQLite database in order to facilitate future stratification according to knowledge area, for instance. In this database, we included the following metadata information: year, university, title in Portuguese, type of document (i.e. theses or dissertation), keywords in both languages, knowledge areas and subareas according to CAPES, and URL for the full-text PDF in Portuguese. An excerpt of the corpus is shown in Table TABREF13 Translation experimentsPrior to the MT experiments, sentences were randomly split in three disjoint datasets: training, development, and test. Approximately 13,000 sentences were allocated in the development and test sets, while the remaining was used for training. For the SMT experiment, we followed the instructions of Moses baseline system. For the NMT experiment, we used the Torch implementation to train a 2-layer LSTM model with 500 hidden units in both encoder and decoder, with 12 epochs. During translation, the option to replace UNK words by the word in the input language was used, since this is also the default in Moses.Table TABREF17 presents the BLEU scores for both translation directions with English and Portuguese on the development and test partitions for Moses and OpenNMT models. We also included the scores for Google Translate (GT) as a benchmark of a state-of-the-art system which is widely used.NMT model achieved better performance than the SMT one for EN INLINEFORM0 PT direction, with approximately 2.17 percentage points (pp) higher, while presenting almost the same score for PT INLINEFORM1 EN. When comparing our models to GT, both of them presented better BLEU scores, specially for the EN INLINEFORM2 PT direction, with values ranging from 1.27 pp to 4.30 pp higher than GT.We highlight that these results may be due to two main factors: corpus size, and domain. Our corpus is fairly large for both SMT and NMT approaches, comprised of almost 1.3M sentences, which enables the development of robust models. Regarding domain, GT is a generic tool not trained for a specific domain, thus it may produce lower results than a domain specific model such as ours. Scientific writing usually has a strict writing style, with less variation than novels or speeches, for instance, favoring the development of tailored MT systems.Below, we demonstrate some sentences translated by Moses and OpenNMT compared to the suggested human translation. One can notice that in fact NMT model tend to produce more fluent results, specially regarding verbal regency.Human translation: this paper presents a study of efficiency and power management in a packaging industry and plastic films.OpenNMT: this work presents a study of efficiency and electricity management in a packaging industry and plastic films.Moses: in this work presents a study of efficiency and power management in a packaging industry and plastic films.GT: this paper presents a study of the efficiency and management of electric power in a packaging and plastic film industry.Human translation: this fact corroborates the difficulty in modeling human behavior.OpenNMT: this fact corroborates the difficulty in modeling human behavior.Moses: this fact corroborated the difficulty in model the human behavior.GT: this fact corroborates the difficulty in modeling human behavior.Sentence alignment qualityWe manually validated the alignment quality for 400 sentences randomly selected from the parsed corpus and assigned quality labels according Section SECREF9 . From all the evaluated sentences, 82.30% were correctly aligned, while 13.33% were partially aligned, and 4.35% presented no alignment. The small percentage of no alignment is probably due to the use of Hunalign tool with the provided EN/PT dictionary.Regarding the partial alignment, most of the problems are result of segmentation issues previous to the alignment, which wrongly split the sentences. Since all words were case folded to lowercase letters, the segmenter lost an important source of information for the correct segmentation, generating malformed sentences. Some examples of partial alignment errors are shown in Table TABREF19 , where most senteces were truncated in the wrong part.Conclusion and future workWe developed a parallel corpus of theses and dissertations abstracts in Portuguese and English. Our corpus is based on the CAPES TDC dataset, which contains information regarding all theses and dissertations presented in Brazil from 2013 to 2016, including abstracts and other metadata.Our corpus was evaluated through SMT and NMT experiments with Moses and OpenNMT systems, presenting superior performance regarding BLEU score than Google Translate. The NMT model also presented superior results than the SMT one for the EN INLINEFORM0 PT translation direction. We also manually evaluated sentences regarding alignment quality, with average 82.30% of sentences correctly aligned.For future work, we foresee the use of the presented corpus in mono and cross-language text mining tasks, such as text classification and clustering. As we included several metadata, these tasks can be facilitated. Other machine translation approaches can also be tested, including the concatenation of this corpus with other multi-domain ones.Fig. 1.

Human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (hs mt LeuRS) achieves high aminoacylation fidelity without a functional editing active site, representing a rare example of a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) that does not proofread its products. Previous studies demonstrated that the enzyme achieves high selectivity by using a more specific synthetic active site that is not prone to errors under physiological conditions. Interestingly, the synthetic active site of hs mt LeuRS displays a high degree of homology with prokaryotic, lower eukaryotic, and other mitochondrial LeuRSs that are less specific. However, there is one residue that differs between hs mt and Escherichia coli LeuRSs located on a flexible closing loop near the signature KMSKS motif. Here we describe studies indicating that this particular residue (K600 in hs mt LeuRS and L570 in E. coli LeuRS) strongly impacts aminoacylation in two ways: it affects both amino acid discrimination and transfer RNA (tRNA) binding. While this residue may not be in direct contact with the amino acid or tRNA substrate, substitutions of this position in both enzymes lead to altered catalytic efficiency and perturbations to the discrimination of leucine and isoleucine. In addition, tRNA recognition and aminoacylation is affected. These findings indicate that the conformation of the synthetic active site, modulated by this residue, may be coupled to specificity and provide new insights into the origins of selectivity without editing.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We identified four proteins in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells which specifically bind to a scaffold attachment region (SAR) element from the human genome. Of these four proteins, SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A), shows the highest affinity for several homologous and heterologous SAR elements from vertebrate cells. SAF-A is an abundant nuclear protein and a constituent of the nuclear matrix and scaffold. The homogeneously purified protein is a novel double stranded DNA binding protein with an apparent molecular weight of 120 kDa. SAF-A binds at multiple sites to the human SAR element; competition studies with synthetic polynucleotides indicate that these sites most probably reside in the multitude of A/T-stretches which are distributed throughout this element.

Iron overload has recently been connected with bone mineral density in osteoporosis. However, to date, the effect of iron overload on osteoblasts remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to examine osteoblast biological activity under iron overload. The osteoblast cells (hFOB1.19) were cultured in a medium supplemented with different concentrations (50, 100, and 200 Â  Î¼M) of ferric ammonium citrate as a donor of ferric ion. Intracellular iron was measured with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluorophotometry. Osteoblast biological activities were evaluated by measuring the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mineralization function. Results indicated that iron overload could consequently increase intracellular iron concentration and intracellular ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, ALP activity was suppressed, and a decline in the number of mineralized nodules was observed in in vitro cultured osteoblast cells. According to these results, it seems that iron overload probably inhibits osteoblast function through higher oxidative stress following increased intracellular iron concentrations.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

In a 26 week, double blind, placebo controlled, phase III trial, 544 patients with RA were randomised to monotherapy with adalimumab 20 mg every other week, 20 mg weekly, 40 mg every other week, 40 mg weekly, or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was > or =20% improvement in the ACR core criteria (ACR20 response). Secondary efficacy end points included ACR50, ACR70, EULAR responses, and the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ DI).                After 26 weeks, patients treated with adalimumab 20 mg every other week, 20 mg weekly, 40 mg every other week, and 40 mg weekly had significantly better response rates than those treated with placebo: ACR20 (35.8%, 39.3%, 46.0%, 53.4%, respectively v 19.1%; p< or =0.01); ACR50 (18.9%, 20.5%, 22.1%, 35.0% v 8.2%; p< or =0.05); ACR70 (8.5%, 9.8%, 12.4%, 18.4% v 1.8%; p< or =0.05). Moderate EULAR response rates were significantly greater with adalimumab than with placebo (41.5%, 48.2%, 55.8%, 63.1% v 26.4%; p< or =0.05). Patients treated with adalimumab achieved better improvements in mean HAQ DI than those receiving placebo (-0.29, -0.39, -0.38, -0.49 v -0.07; p< or =0.01). No significant differences were found between adalimumab and placebo treated patients for serious adverse events, serious infections, or malignancies. Injection site reaction occurred in 10.6% and 0.9% of adalimumab and placebo treated patients, respectively (p< or =0.05).                Among patients with RA for whom previous DMARD treatment had failed, adalimumab monotherapy achieved significant, rapid, and sustained improvements in disease activity and improved physical function and was safe and well tolerated.Title 2:Rapid alleviation of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis with intravenous or subcutaneous administration of adalimumab in combination with methotrexate.Abstract 2:This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 1 study assessed the magnitude, onset, and duration of response with intravenous (i.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories) combined with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite previous MTX therapy.                Fifty-four patients were randomized to two injections of i.v. or s.c. adalimumab (1 mg/kg) or placebo while continuing on MTX (mean dose, 15.7 mg/week). Dosing intervals were determined by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria, and were allowed to range from 1 to 3 months. Efficacy was mainly assessed using the EULAR response criteria and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.                Moderate EULAR response was achieved at least once within 29 days after the first injection in 83% and 61% of patients receiving i.v. and s.c. adalimumab respectively, compared with 44% for placebo [probability (p) < or = 0.05 for i.v. adalimumab versus placebo]. A 20% improvement in disease activity according to the ACR criteria (ACR20 response) was achieved by 72% and 67% of patients receiving i.v. and s.c. adalimumab respectively, compared with 28% for placebo (p < or = 0.01 and p < or = 0.05, respectively, versus placebo). By Day 15 after the first and second injections, statistically significant moderate EULAR and ACR20 response rates were achieved with either i.v. or s.c. adalimumab compared with placebo (p < or = 0.05). The mean times to second injection for i.v. adalimumab, s.c. adalimumab, and placebo were 42.2 days (range: 27-84 days), 38.3 days (range: 26-85 days), and 28.4 days (range: 26-32 days), respectively (minimum time allowed by the protocol between the first and second injections was 4 weeks). Adalimumab in combination with MTX was well tolerated, with no patients being withdrawn because of adverse events.                Either i.v. or s.c. adalimumab added to MTX significantly improved the signs and symptoms of RA compared with MTX alone. Subcutaneously administered adalimumab appeared to provide a response that was as great, as rapid, and as enduring as that with i.v. adalimumab.Title 3:Adalimumab, a fully human anti tumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody, and concomitant standard antirheumatic therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: results of STAR (Safety Trial of Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis).Abstract 3:This study, known as STAR (Safety Trial of Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis), evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab (Humira), a fully human monoclonal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) antibody, when given with standard antirheumatic therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not adequately responding to such therapies. Standard antirheumatic therapy included traditional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD), low dose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), and/or analgesics.                In this 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 636 patients with RA were randomly assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously (sc) every other week (n = 318) or placebo (n = 318) while continuing standard antirheumatic therapy. The frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events, severe or life-threatening adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal, infection, or serious infection were the primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were determined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.                During the study, the majority of patients received concomitant traditional DMARD (83.5%) and/or corticosteroids, NSAID, and/or analgesics (97.3%). Overall, 56.0% of patients continued treatment with one, 23.6% with 2, and 3.9% with > or = 3 traditional DMARD. At 24 weeks, there were no statistically significant differences between the adalimumab and placebo groups in their respective rates of adverse events (86.5% vs 82.7%), serious adverse events (5.3% vs 6.9%), severe or life-threatening adverse events (11.9% vs 15.4%), or those leading to withdrawal (2.8% vs 2.2%). There were also no statistically significant differences in the rates of infections (52.2% vs 49.4%) or serious infections (1.3% vs 1.9%) between the groups. The incidence and types of adverse events did not vary between adalimumab- and placebo-treated patients by the number of concomitant traditional DMARD (0, 1, or 2). Adalimumab-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients achieved statistically superior ACR20 (52.8% vs 34.9%), ACR50 (28.9% vs 11.3%), and ACR70 (14.8% vs 3.5%) response rates at Week 24 (p < or = 0.001).                This study demonstrated that addition of adalimumab 40 mg given sc every other week to concomitant standard antirheumatic therapy is well tolerated and provides significant improvements in signs and symptoms of RA. The data indicate that adalimumab is a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients with active RA who have an inadequate response to standard antirheumatic therapy, including one or more traditional DMARD, corticosteroids, NSAID, and analgesics.Title 4:Radiographic, clinical, and functional outcomes of treatment with adalimumab (a human anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving concomitant methotrexate therapy: a randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial.Abstract 4:Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important proinflammatory cytokine that mediates inflammatory synovitis and articular matrix degradation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the ability of adalimumab, a human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, to inhibit the progression of structural joint damage, reduce the signs and symptoms, and improve physical function in patients with active RA receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX).                In this multicenter, 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 619 patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX were randomized to receive adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week (n = 207), adalimumab 20 mg subcutaneously every week (n = 212), or placebo (n = 200) plus concomitant MTX. The primary efficacy end points were radiographic progression at week 52 (total Sharp score by a modified method [TSS]), clinical response at week 24 (improvements of at least 20% in the American College of Rheumatology core criteria [ACR20]), and physical function at week 52 (disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]).                At week 52, there was statistically significantly less radiographic progression, as measured by the change in TSS, in the patients receiving adalimumab either 40 mg every other week (mean +/- SD change 0.1 +/- 4.8) or 20 mg weekly (0.8 +/- 4.9) as compared with that in the placebo group (2.7 +/- 6.8) (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). In addition, there were statistically significant changes in the components of the TSS. At week 24, ACR20 responses were achieved by 63% and 61% of patients in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly groups, respectively, versus 30% of patients in the placebo group (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, ACR20 responses were achieved by 59% and 55% of patients taking adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly, respectively, versus 24% of patients taking placebo (P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). At week 52, physical function as measured by the HAQ demonstrated statistically significant improvement with adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 20 mg weekly compared with placebo (mean change in HAQ score -0.59 and -0.61, respectively, versus -0.25; P < or = 0.001 for each comparison). A total of 467 patients (75.4%) completed 52 weeks of treatment. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated. Discontinuations occurred in 22.0% of adalimumab-treated patients and in 30.0% of placebo-treated patients. The rate of adverse events (both serious and nonserious) was comparable in the adalimumab and placebo groups, although the proportion of patients reporting serious infections was higher in patients receiving adalimumab (3.8%) than in those receiving placebo (0.5%) (P < or = 0.02), and was highest in the patients receiving 40 mg every other week.                In this 52-week trial, adalimumab was more effective than placebo at inhibiting the progression of structural joint damage, reducing the signs and symptoms, and improving physical function in patients with active RA who had demonstrated an incomplete response to MTX.","answer":"On the basis of the studies reviewed here, adalimumab in combination with methotrexate is efficacious and safe in the treatment of the rheumatoid arthritis. Adalimumab 40 mg sc e.o.w. and 20 mg e.w. slows the radiographic progression at 52 weeks. Adalimumab in combination with DMARDs other than methotrexate is also efficacious and safe, even though data from one only study are available and the number of patients in each group is low. Adalimumab in monotherapy is efficacious and safe in the treatment of the rheumatoid arthritis but the effect size is lower than with combined therapy."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

The association and prevalence of fatigue and FM was recorded in a group of patients with pSS and a control group of lupus patients, a subset of whom had secondary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (sSS).(METHODS) 74 patients with pSS and 216 patients with lupus were assessed with a questionnaire to identify the presence of fatigue and generalised pain. From the lupus group, in a subset of 117 lupus patients (from the Bloomsbury unit) those with sSS were identified. All patients were studied for the presence of FM.(RESULTS) 50 of 74 patients with pSS (68%) reported fatigue-a prevalence significantly higher than in the lupus group (108/216 (50%); p<0.0087). Fatigue was present in 7/13 (54%) patients with SLE/sSS. FM was present in 9/74 patients with pSS (12%), compared with 11/216 lupus patients (5%), and in none of the patients with SLE/sSS.

[34] Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR); RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); open reading frame 1a (ORF1a); Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); immunofluorescent assay (IFA); immunochromatographic test (ICT); nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA). With the emergence of 2019-nCoV, there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally (Table 3 ), in which a wide range of technology (such as messenger RNA, DNA-based, nanoparticle, synthetic and modified virus-like particle) was applied. It will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). However, the kit developed by the BGI have passed emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of China [40] . Of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-nCoV, SARS CoV or MERS-CoV vaccines screened, only four were eventually included in the review. Most studies on SARS and MERS vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models ( Figure 1 ). The four studies included in this review were Phase I clinical trials on SARS or MERS vaccines (Table 4 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] . There were no studies of any population type (cell, animal, human) on the 2019-nCoV at the point of screening. The published clinical trials were mostly done in United States except for one on the SARS vaccine done in China [44] . All vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS were reported to be safe, well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants. In addition, we highlight six ongoing Phase I clinical trials identified in the ClinicalTrials.gov register ( [48, 49] ); Table  S4 ) [50] [51] [52] . These trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective MERS-CoV vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet. The trials are projected to complete in December 2020 (two studies in Russia [50, 51] ) and December 2021 (in Germany [52] ). Existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-nCoV trials at the time of writing. Among 23 trials found from the systematic review (Table 5) , there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) for 2019-nCoV therapeutics [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . Of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol, mesenchymal stem cells, traditional Chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment. The remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals, interferon atomization, darunavir and cobicistat, arbidol, and remdesivir usage for 2019-nCoV patients (Table 5) . Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 86% and 94% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively, and was maintained in 79% participants up to study end at week 60. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 50% participants at one or more time points during the study, but only 3% maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. T-cell responses were detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60. [47] Molecules developed by the university scientists inhibit two coronavirus enzymes and prevent its replication. The discovered drug targets are said to be more than 95% similar to enzyme targets found on the SARS virus. Researchers note that identified drugs may not be available to address the ongoing outbreak but they hope to make it accessible for future outbreaks. [85] Besides the six completed randomized controlled trials (RCT) selected from the systematic review (Table 6) , there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at SARS therapeutics [92] . The studies found from ClinicalTrials.gov have not been updated since 2013. While many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin only, there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage. Three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the SARS epidemic-3 in China, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Hong Kong [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . The studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants, combination of western and Chinese treatment vs. Chinese treatment in 123 participants, integrative Chinese and Western treatment in 49 patients, usage of a specific Chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants. Another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir usage in 152 participants [98] . One randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and Chinese treatment during the SARS epidemic was excluded as it was a Chinese article [94] . There is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at MERS therapeutics [99] . It investigates the usage of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon Beta 1B. Likewise, many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir/ribavirin, interferon, and convalescent plasma usage. To date, only one trial has been completed. One phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin (SAB-301) was found in available literature [46] . The trial conducted in the United States in 2017 demonstrated SAB-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses. Another trial on MERS therapeutics was found on ClinicalTrials.gov-a phase 2/3 trial in the United States evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity on coadministered MERS-CoV antibodies REGN3048 & REGN3051 [100]. Rapid diagnostics plays an important role in disease and outbreak management. The fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures. Local transmission and clusters can be prevented or delayed by isolation of laboratory-confirmed cases and their close contacts quarantined and monitored at home. Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] . Laboratory diagnosis can be performed by: (a) detecting the genetic material of the virus, (b) detecting the antibodies that neutralize the viral particles of interest, (c) detecting the viral epitopes of interest with antibodies (serological testing), or (d) culture and isolation of viable virus particles. The key limitations of genetic material detection are the lack of knowledge of the presence of viable virus, the potential cross-reactivity with non-specific genetic regions and the short timeframe for accurate detection during the acute infection phase. The key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses. The limitation of virus culture and isolation is the long duration and the highly specialized skills required of the technicians to process the samples. All patients recovered. Significantly shorted time from the disease onset to the symptom improvement in treatment (5.10 Â± 2.83 days) compared to control group (7.62 Â± 2.27 days) (p < 0.05) No significant difference in blood routine improvement, pulmonary chest shadow in chest film improvement and corticosteroid usgae between the 2 groups. However, particularly in the respect of improving clinical symptoms, elevating quality of life, promoting immune function recovery, promoting absorption of pulmonary inflammation, reducing the dosage of cortisteroid and shortening the therapeutic course, treatment with integrative chinese and western medicine treatment had obvious superiority compared with using control treatment alone. Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants. [46] Where the biological samples are taken from also play a role in the sensitivity of these tests. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract such as sputum and tracheal aspirates have higher and more prolonged levels of viral RNA because of the tropism of the virus. MERS-CoV viral loads are also higher for severe cases and have longer viral shedding compared to mild cases. Although upper respiratory tract specimens such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs can be used, they have potentially lower viral loads and may have higher risk of false-negatives among the mild MERS and SARS cases [102, 103] , and likely among the 2019-nCoV cases. The existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include (a) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), (b) real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), (c) reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and (d) real-time RT-LAMP [104] . Nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are usually preferred as in the case of MERS-CoV diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection [102] . Chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-nCoV in the GenBank and in GISAID portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus [11] . Several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, as highlighted in WHO's interim guidance on nCoV laboratory testing of suspected cases. These include protocols from other countries such as Thailand, Japan and China [105] . The first validated diagnostic test was designed in Germany. Corman et al. had initially designed a candidate diagnostic RT-PCR assay based on the SARS or SARS-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was SARS-like. Upon the release of the sequence, assays were selected based on the match against 2019-nCoV upon inspection of the sequence alignment.  Two assays were used for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and E gene where E gene assay acts as the first-line screening tool and RdRp gene assay as the confirmatory testing. All assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses [11] . The Hong Kong University used two monoplex assays which were reactive with coronaviruses under the subgenus Sarbecovirus (consisting of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-like coronavirus). Viral RNA extracted from SARS-CoV can be used as the positive control for the suggested protocol assuming that SARS has been eradicated. It is proposed that the N gene RT-PCR can be used as a screening assay while the Orf1b assay acts as a confirmatory test. However, this protocol has only been evaluated with a panel of controls with the only positive control SARS-CoV RNA. Synthetic oligonucleotide positive control or 2019-nCoV have yet to be tested [106] . The US CDC shared the protocol on the real time RT-PCR assay for the detection of the 2019-nCoV with the primers and probes designed for the universal detection of SARS-like coronavirus and the specific detection of 2019-nCoV. However, the protocol has not been validated on other platforms or chemistries apart from the protocol described. There are some limitations for the assay. Analysts engaged have to be trained and familiar with the testing procedure and result interpretation. False negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection, transportation or handling. Also, RNA viruses may show substantial genetic variability. This could result in mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence which can diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results [107] . Point-of-care test kit can potentially minimize these limitations, which should be highly prioritized for research and development in the next few months. Serological testing such as ELISA, IIFT and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection, including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate. Compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods, serological testing detects antibodies and antigens. There would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset [108] . Furthermore, studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load. Hence, serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are not available or accessible [102] . Vaccines can prevent and protect against infection and disease occurrence when exposed to the specific pathogen of interest, especially in vulnerable populations who are more prone to severe outcomes. In the context of the current 2019-nCoV outbreak, vaccines will help control and reduce disease transmission by creating herd immunity in addition to protecting healthy individuals from infection. This decreases the effective R0 value of the disease. Nonetheless, there are social, clinical and economic hurdles for vaccine and vaccination programmes, including (a) the willingness of the public to undergo vaccination with a novel vaccine, (b) the side effects and severe adverse reactions of vaccination, (c) the potential difference and/or low efficacy of the vaccine in populations different from the clinical trials' populations and (d) the accessibility of the vaccines to a given population (including the cost and availability of the vaccine). Vaccines against the 2019-nCoV are currently in development and none are in testing (at the time of writing).Question: How were the assays selected ?","answer":"based on the match against 2019-nCoV upon inspection of the sequence alignment."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

However, the in vivo distribution and function of gap junctions remain poorly understood, partly due to the lack of non-invasive tools with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we developed PARIS( pairing actuators and receivers to optically isolate gap junctions), a new fully genetically encoded tool for measuring the cell-specific gap junctional coupling( GJC). PARIS successfully enabled monitoring of GJC in several cultured cell lines under physiologically relevant conditions and in distinct genetically defined neurons in Drosophila brain, with ~10 s temporal resolution and sub-cellular spatial resolution. These results demonstrate that PARIS is a robust, highly sensitive tool for mapping functional gap junctions and study their regulation in both health and disease.Introduction:Gap junctions are intercellular channels that are expressed in virtually all tissue types in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They allow direct transfer of small molecules such as ions, metabolites and second messengers between connected cells, thereby playing essential roles in various physiological processes, including embryo development, metabolic coordination of avascular organs, tissue homeostasis and synchronizing electrical activity in excitable tissues( Bennett and Zukin, 2004; Kumar and Gilula, 1996). Defects of gap junction function are linked with a wide array of diseases, including myocardial infarction, hearing loss and hypomyelinating disorder( Jongsma and Wilders, 2000; Laird, 2010; SÃ¶hl et al., 2005). Studying gap junction coupling( GJC) under physiological or disease conditions in complex systems such as the nervous system requires a non-invasive method with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Current methods used to monitor GJC include paired electrophysiological recordings( Bennett et al., 1963; Furshpan and Potter, 1959), dye microinjection( Stewart, 1978), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching( FRAP)( Wade et al., 1986), and local activation of molecular fluorescent probes( LAMP)( Dakin et al., 2005), all of which are either invasive and/or lack cell-type specificity, thus limiting their use in heterogeneous tissues. Recently, hybrid approaches have been developed in which genetically encoded hydrolytic enzymes or promiscuous transporters are used to introduce small molecule substrates or peptides tagged with a fluorescent label in specific cells( Qiao and Sanes, 2015; Tian et al., 2012). Although these methods might provide cell-type-specific investigation of GJC, the requirement of exogenous substrate and the background generated by endogenous enzymes or transporters still make them difficult to apply in vivo. In addition, dye diffusion is an irreversible process and thus these methods are difficult to be applied to examine the same gap junctions repeatedly in order to measure their dynamics, regulations and plasticity( Dong et al., 2018). To overcome these limitations, we developed an all-optical approach named PARIS( pairing actuators and receivers to optically isolate gap junctions) in which we express an opticallyÂ controlled actuator in one cell, to generate an electrochemical gradient of specific molecules between two connected cells, and a fluorescent receiver in the adjacent cell, to detect the movement of the molecules across the gap junctions. GJC between the actuator cell( i. e. expressing actuators) and the receiver cell( i. e. expressing receivers) is detected by a fluorescence increase in the receiver following the optical activation of the actuator( Figure 1A).Discussion:We initially screened three pairs of actuators/receivers, namely ArchT/pHluorin, BeCylOp/FlincG3 and CsChrimson/GCaMP6s. The latter two pairs failed to function in cis to generate receiver responses by activating the actuator( Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). For the cGMP based pair, we have also performed the cis experiments in the presence of PDE inhibitor IBMX that prevented the cGMP hydrolyzation and still observed no signal; meanwhile FlincG did response to exogenous application of cGMP( data not shown). Thus, one possible explanation for the absence of the autonomous signal is that light activation of BeCylOp generated limited cGMP that could not induce FlincG3( EC50Â =Â 0. 89 Î¼M)( Bhargava et al., 2013) response. For the pair with CsChrimson, a non-selective cation channel allows not only Ca2+ but also other cations to pass the channel( Klapoetke et al., 2014), we deduce the photoactivation induced Ca2+ influx in the CsChrimson expressing HEK293T cells was still under the detection limit of GCaMP6s. Indeed, we found CsChrimson/GCaMP6s could function in cis to generate cell autonomous signals in cultured hippocampus neurons that endogenously express voltage-gated Ca2+ channel to allow further Ca2+ influx( data not shown). First, PARIS relies solely on light and therefore is virtually non-invasive compared with existing methods including paired-recording( Bennett et al., 1963; Furshpan and Potter, 1959), dye microinjection( Stewart, 1978) and scrape loading( el-Fouly et al., 1987). In addition, given that the activation of the actuator can be specific to subcellular resolution, PARIS can provide spatial information of the functional gap junctions, as shown by our ability to functionally map gap junctions formed at dendrite-dendrite contacts in AL but not at axon-axon contacts in LH between ePNs and iPNs in the Drosophila olfactory system( Figure 5), while such resolution cannot be easily achieved by any of the previously existed method. With respect to those relatively non-invasive methods which rely on the diffusion of small fluorescent dyes across gap junctions such as FRAP( Wade et al., 1986) and LAMP( Dakin et al., 2005), a significant advantage of PARIS is that it is fully reversible and does not require the delivery of exogenous dyes. PARIS may serve as a robust tool for screening existing and newly developed gap junction blockers and/or modulators, including clinically relevant compounds such as inhibitors of PKC signaling. In addition, PARIS could possibly be applied to study the dynamic regulation of gap junctions in vivo, such as the formation and break of gap junction connections during brain development( Arumugam et al., 2005). Moreover, the actuator and receiver proteins in PARIS are both genetically encoded. Recently, several innovative hybrid approaches were developed to monitor gap junctions( Kang and Baker, 2016; Qiao and Sanes, 2015; Tian et al., 2012). Using a channel/transporter/enzyme-dependent step for the transfer of small molecules, these approaches can in principle achieve genetic specificity in terms of targeting defined cells. In practice, however, these methods require the addition of an exogenous substrate( Qiao and Sanes, 2015; Tian et al., 2012) or a patch electrode to establish an electrochemical gradient between connected cells( Kang and Baker, 2016), thereby limiting their application, particularly in vivo. In contrast, all the components in PARIS are genetically encoded by relatively small genes, vastly increasing the range of cell types in which they can be selectively expressed. For example, we show that the PARIS proteins can be introduced using transfection( Figures 1â3), virus-mediated expression( Figure 3), and ex vivo transgenic labeling( Figure 4 and 5). Given that similar transgenic tools are available for higher organisms, including mammals, PARIS can easily be adapted to other preparations and animal models, including the highly complex mammalian nervous system. In mammalian systems and model organisms in which transgenic techniques are currently unavailable or impractical, recombinant viruses such as lentiviruses, retroviruses, and adeno-associated viruses can be conveniently packaged with these genetic components and used to infect the appropriate target cells. In most animal cells, intracellular pH is believed to be tightly regulated for optimal biochemical reactions; thus, even a small change in intracellular pH is rapidly restored to a set point by buffers and proton exchangers/transporters located on the membrane of cells or intracellular organelles( Hoffmann and Simonsen, 1989). This robust system for maintaining pH homeostasis enabled us to repeatedly elicit a PARIS signal in both cultured cells and transgenic animals. One caveat to our approach may be the ability of pH to regulate gap junction activity during PARIS. The uncoupling effect of acidic intracellular pH on GJC has long been described across different Cx-consisted gap junctions in vertebrates( Peracchia, 2004; Turin and Warner, 1977) and different innexin-consisted gap junctions in invertebrates( Giaume et al., 1980; Obaid et al., 1983; Stergiopoulos et al., 1999), while alkalization was reported to increase the junctional conductance and the total number of opened channels in gap junction plagues( Palacios-Prado et al., 2010). For the mostly wide expressed Cx43 channels, it has a pKa ofÂ ~6. 7 in oocytes and fully closed when pH is under 6. 4 while fully open when pH is above 7. 2( Stergiopoulos et al., 1999), which enables PARIS measurement to reveal the GJC mediated by Cx43. However, there is one type of gap junctions that has been reported to be sensitive to alkalizationâCx36 consisted gap junctions( GonzÃ¡lez-Nieto et al., 2008). Based on the reported pH-conductance curve, the junctional conductance decreased to 50% when pH increased 0. 8 unit from 7. 2 to 8. As shown in Figure 1âfigure supplements 4 and 0. 1-unit pH increase from 7. 35 to 7. 45 was enough to induce PARIS signal. So PARIS is still possible in reporting Cx36 consisted GJC under proper activation of the actuator. Even though we conclude that PARIS induced pH fluctuation is controllable and transient, one should still be cautious to the possible modification towards gap junctions as well as cell physiology. For the long-time measurements, either reduce the power or shorten the time of laser illumination, meanwhile increase the interval between each measurement should be helpful to decrease the pH influence. An even more sensitive pH indicator could help to minimize the pH influence as well. As we have demonstrated, PARIS is powerful as a genetic tool to map gap junction connections between targeted neurons in the complex central nervous system( Figure 4 and 5). To map unknown gap junctions, firstly we need anatomic information about the two group of cells that we concern to make sure they are spatially contacted, which could be achieved by immunostaining or EM. As the intensive efforts have been or being made to create whole brain connectomes from C. elegans( Jarrell et al., 2012), Drosophila( FlyEM project, Janelia Campus Research) to zebra fish( Hildebrand et al., 2017) and mice( Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas), PARIS could utilize these information and databases and possibly help creating electrical connectome. PARIS requires the exclusive expression of the actuator and receiver in different cells. Such genetic tools specifically labeling two distinct groups of cells from different cell types or two subgroups from one cell type, might not be accessible in mammals. However, this limitation can be overcome by the intersectional non-overlapping expression of the actuator and receiver, for example using flp-out system. By fusing the receiver with a flippase, the frt sequence flanked actuator would not express in the presence of the receiver. Meanwhile the receiver and the actuator can both designed to be turned on in a cre-dependent manner. This design could make PARIS more versatile in detecting GJC between specific cells labeled by cre-lines without the contamination of the autonomous signal. Lastly, to protect against false negatives of PARIS, a control experiment in the cis configuration is recommended in different customized preparations and context to ensure the function of the actuators and help to optimize the expression level of actuators/receivers as well as the photostimulation parameters accordingly; Meanwhile, PARIS signals alone from cells connected by potential unknown gap junctions should not be interpreted as definitive without confirmation from pharmacology, genetic interventions or a complementary method. Future refinements to PARIS include the use of the new actuators we have screened combining a receiver with higher pH sensitivity, thereby increasing both the signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution, allowing for an even wider range of in vitro and in vivo applications. Finally, the use of additional spectrally non-overlapping pairs of proton-related actuators and receivers, as well as developing actuator-receiver pairs that transport and detect other gap junctionâpermeable small molecules, may provide the opportunity to detect gap junctions between multiple cell types and/or structures.","answer":"For the tissues and organs of our bodies to work properly , the cells within them need to communicate with each other .

Two different architectures are proposed to solve the problem. One is Feature Representation embedded Convolutional Neural Network (FR-CNN) with a single input channel, and the other is Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual network modules embedded Fully Convolutional Neural network (SE-Res-FCN) with multiple input channels. Both the tow architectures are stable and converged reliably in training and testing on GPUs. Accuracy analysis shows that SE-Res-FCN has a significantly smaller mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) than FR-CNN. Mean relative error (MRE) of the SE-Res-FCN model is about 0.25 with respect to the average ground truth. The validation results indicate that the SE-Res-FCN model can accurately predict the stress field. For stress field prediction, the hierarchical architecture becomes deeper within certain limits, and then its prediction becomes more accurate. Fully trained deep learning models have higher computational efficiency over conventional FEM models, so they have great foreground and potential in structural design and topology optimization.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The simulation of product behavior is a vital part in virtual product development, but currently there is no tool or method available that can examine the quality of FE simulations and decide automatically on whether a simulation is plausible or non-plausible. In the paper a method is presented that enables automatic plausibility checks on basis of empirical simulation datasets. Nodal simulation data is transformed to numerical arrays, of fixed size, using virtual spherical detector surfaces. Afterwards the arrays are used to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (AlexNet). The Neural Network can then be used for plausibility checks of FE simulations (structural mechanics). In a first application a Deep Convolutional Neural Network is trained with simulation data of a demonstrator part, the rail of speed inline skates. After the GPU training of the Neural Network, further simulations are evaluated with the net. These simulations were not part of the training data and are used to calculate the prediction quality of the Neural Network. This approach is to support development engineers during design accompanying FEA in virtual product development.[2]: In this research, we propose a deep learning based approach for speeding up the topology optimization methods. The problem we seek to solve is the layout problem. The main novelty of this work is to state the problem as an image segmentation task. We leverage the power of deep learning methods as the efficient pixel-wise image labeling technique to perform the topology optimization. We introduce convolutional encoder-decoder architecture and the overall approach of solving the above-described problem with high performance. The conducted experiments demonstrate the significant acceleration of the optimization process. The proposed approach has excellent generalization properties. We demonstrate the ability of the application of the proposed model to other problems. The successful results, as well as the drawbacks of the current method, are discussed.[3]: Structural finite-element analysis (FEA) has been widely used to study the biomechanics of human tissues and organs, as well as tissueâmedical device interactions, and treatment strategies. However, patient-specific FEA models usually require complex procedures to set up and long computing times to obtain final simulation results, preventing prompt feedback to clinicians in time-sensitive clinical applications. In this study, by using machine learning techniques, we developed a deep learning (DL) model to directly estimate the stress distributions of the aorta. The DL model was designed and trained to take the input of FEA and directly output the aortic wall stress distributions, bypassing the FEA calculation process. The trained DL model is capable of predicting the stress distributions with average errors of 0.492 and 0.891 in the Von Mises stress distribution and peak Von Mises stress, respectively. This study marks, to our knowledge, the first study that demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using the DL technique as a fast and accurate surrogate of FEA for stress analysis.[4]: Today, visual recognition systems are still rarely employed in robotics applications. Perhaps one of the main reasons for this is the lack of demanding benchmarks that mimic such scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of our autonomous driving platform to develop novel challenging benchmarks for the tasks of stereo, optical flow, visual odometry SLAM and 3D object detection. Our recording platform is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than 200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world.

However, significantly greater efficiency with the elimination of stoichiometric metal waste would be accomplished by the transition metal catalyzed direct addition of CâH bonds to aldehydes (eqn (2)). Despite these advantages, relatively few examples of this type of transformation have been reported,1,2 particularly when compared to other CâH bond functionalization processes.3 An inherent challenge is the reversible nature of this transformation with the alcohol products only favored when destabilized, highly electron deficient aldehydes are used.1b,c(1)(2)</p><p>To enable the direct addition of CâH bonds to aldehydes, strategies to overcome the reversibility of this transformation must be explored. Capture of alcohol products as silyl ethers has been accomplished for Ir-, Re-, and Mn-catalyzed additions of specific sp2 CâH bonds to aldehydes.1hâk More recently, Rh(iii)- and Pd-catalyzed additions of selected aromatic CâH bonds to aromatic aldehydes have been achieved by irreversible in situ oxidation of the alcohol products to ketones (eqn (3)).1a,d,e,g Herewe introduce a new conceptual strategy wherein the directing group for Rh(iii)-catalyzed CâH bond functionalization serves an auxiliary role of capturing the alcohol addition products to provide pharmaceutically relevant heterocycles that maintain the alcohol oxidation state (eqn (4)).4,5 This approach is specifically demonstrated using the previously unexplored imidate directing group to enable efficient and highly functional group compatible coupling of a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to give phthalides, which are present in a variety of bioactive natural products.6(3)(4)</p>Results and discussion<p>We initiated our investigation by testing the Rh(iii)-catalyzed addition of methyl benzoate (1) to aldehyde 2a because the ester group is the simplest functionality that might be capable of both directing CâH bond functionalization and accomplishing alcohol capture to give a lactone (Scheme 1). However, even with the very electron-deficient trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde (2a), no CâH functionalization product was observed, presumably due to the poor directing ability of the ester group.</p><p>We reasoned that it would be necessary to replace the ester group with a more strongly metal coordinating functionality having the ability to capture the alcohol product. The previously unexplored N-alkoxy imidate (see 3, Fig. 1) was therefore investigated because it maintains the ester oxidation state and leaving group functionality necessary for alcohol capture while also introducing an oxime directing group, which is particularly effective for Rh(iii)-catalyzed CâH functionalization.7 We envisioned that reversible addition of 3 to aldehyde 2 would provide alcohol 4, which would undergo irreversible cyclization in situ with elimination of the methoxy group to give 5. Hydrolysis would then afford the desired phthalide 6.</p><p>A variety of catalysts and reaction conditions were evaluated for coupling of benzimidate 3a with 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (2b) to afford the phthalide 6a (Table 1). The cationic rhodium complex, derived from [Cp*RhCl2]2 and AgSbF6, with DCE as solvent efficiently catalyzed the reaction to produce the desired product 6a in 77% yield (entry 1).8 AgBF4 proved to be as effective as AgSbF6 (entry 2). Other halide abstractors significantly decreased the yields or gave no desired product (entries 3â7), presumably because coordinating anions compete with the substrates for metal binding. The use of the preformed cationic Rh(iii) precursor [Cp*Rh(CH3CN)3](SbF6)2 also was less efficient (entry 8). Additionally, coordinating solvents such as THF resulted in reduced conversion (entry 9). Although t-BuOH had previously successfully been employed in Rh(iii)-catalyzed additions of 2-phenylpyridine to imines,2c when this solvent was employed for the preparation of phthalide 6a no product was observed (entry 10). The reaction is dependent on catalyst loading because the yield dropped to 59% when only 2.5 mol% of [Cp*RhCl2]2 was employed (entry 11).</p><p>Having established the effect of counter anions and solvents on this cascade reaction, we next explored the substrate scope with a diverse set of benzimidates and aromatic aldehydes (Table 2). The reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility, with aldehydes substituted with chloro, fluoro, nitro, ester, and methoxy functional groups all providing 3-aryl phthalides in high yields. While both electron-poor and -rich aromatic aldehydes are suitable for this transformation, the electron-deficient aldehydes afford the products in higher yields (6dâfvs.6c and 6i). Moreover, substitution at the ortho, meta, and para positions on aldehydes 2 are all well tolerated.</p><p>This reaction is sensitive to the electronic effect of substitution on benzimidates 3. Electron donating groups result in efficient coupling (6j, k, m and n). However, in contrast to the observation that electron-deficient aldehydes result in higher yields, placement of the electron-deficient CF3 group on the benzimidate reduced the yield to 27% even when the catalyst loading was doubled (6l). Importantly, the meta-methyl substituted benzimidate exclusively provided the product resulting from CâH activation at the less hindered CâH site (6o). Moreover, good yields are maintained even for benzimidates bearing functional groups at the ortho position (6m and 6n). The effectiveness of benzimidates with ortho-alkoxy substitution is particularly noteworthy, not only because it has previously been reported that an alkoxy group at the ortho position can inhibit CâH functionalization via chelation,2c but also because a wide range of phthalide natural products incorporate ortho-hydroxyl functionality.6</p><p>We next explored the possibility of extending the substrate scope to unactivated aliphatic aldehydes (Table 3). Rh(iii)-catalyzed additions to this class of aldehydes has not previously been demonstrated even with trapping of the alcohol addition products through oxidation. Conducting the reaction with cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde (2c) under the standard conditions afforded the expected phthalide 6q in only 32% yield (entry 1). Adding 0.5 equiv. of K2CO3 to the reaction mixture in an attempt to minimize acid catalyzed aldehyde self-condensation improved the yield to 54% (entry 2). After several failed attempts to further improve the yield, we turned our attention to structural variation of the imidate directing group, in particular, by introducing an N-aryl rather than the N-methoxy substituent (entries 3â6). The electronic properties of the N-aryl substituent had a considerable impact on the reaction yield, with more electron-deficient aryl groups providing the highest yields (entries 5 and 6). The N-3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl benzimidate (10a) proved to be optimal and provided phthalide 6q in 67% yield (entry 6). Given the success of coupling 10a with aliphatic aldehyde 2c, we also examined its coupling to aromatic aldehyde 2a, and while phthalide product 6d was obtained in 71% yield, this was slightly lower than that observed for the corresponding N-methoxy benzimidate 3a (6d, Table 2).</p><p>With an optimized imidate directing group identified for additions to aliphatic aldehyde 2c, a range of different aldehydes 2 was surveyed (Table 4). This transformation was found to be very general with linear and sterically hindered aldehydes providing phthalides in good yields (6t and 6s, respectively). Moreover, oxygen functionality could be placed at the Î±-position of the aldehyde to provide sites for additional synthetic transformations. Both N-methoxy benzimidate (3a) and N-3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl benzimidate (10a) were evaluated for each of the aliphatic aldehydes with benzimidate 10a providing higher yields for almost all of the aldehydes examined. The only exception was Î±-benzyloxyacetaldehyde for which benzimidate 3a provided phthalide 6u in a significantly higher yield.</p><p>The Rh(iii) catalyst used here is stable to air and water, and therefore, the feasibility of performing this novel transformation on the bench top was examined to enhance the practicality of the method (Scheme 2). Coupling reactions between benzimidate 3a and aldehyde 2a were carried out with set up on the bench top under an air and also under a N2 atmosphere (eqn (5)). Both reactions afforded the product 6d in comparable yields. Furthermore, these reactions proceeded in only slightly lower yield than when the reaction was set up using rigorous inert atmosphere techniques in a glovebox. The bench top reaction between 10a and the aliphatic aldehyde 2c under a N2 atmosphere was similarly successful (eqn (6)). However, a significant reduction in yield was observed when the reaction with the aliphatic aldehyde was carried out in air.</p>Conclusions<p>In summary, imidates are a novel and unexplored class of directing groups that not only enable the Rh(iii)-catalyzed activation of ortho CâH bonds of benzimidates but also serve to capture the alcohol intermediate formed upon reversible aldehyde addition to provide biologically important phthalides in a single step. The reaction shows broad scope with a high level of functional group compatibility and is applicable not only to aromatic aldehydes but also to aliphatic derivatives for which Rh(iii)-catalyzed additions have not previously been demonstrated. We are currently extending this new conceptual strategy for the reversible addition of CâH bonds with directing group capture to other substrate classes and directing group structures.</p><p>Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

Autoencoder neural networks learn to reconstruct normal images, and hence can classify those images as anomalies, where the reconstruction error exceeds some threshold. Here we analyze a fundamental problem of this approach when the training set is contaminated with a small fraction of outliers. We find that continued training of autoencoders inevitably reduces the reconstruction error of outliers, and hence degrades the anomaly detection performance. In order to counteract this effect, an adversarial autoencoder architecture is adapted, which imposes a prior distribution on the latent representation, typically placing anomalies into low likelihood-regions. Utilizing the likelihood model, potential anomalies can be identified and rejected already during training, which results in an anomaly detector that is significantly more robust to the presence of outliers during training.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful nonlinear architectures that are known to be robust to random perturbations of the input. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations--small input changes crafted explicitly to fool the model. In this paper, we ask whether a DNN can distinguish adversarial samples from their normal and noisy counterparts. We investigate model confidence on adversarial samples by looking at Bayesian uncertainty estimates, available in dropout neural networks, and by performing density estimation in the subspace of deep features learned by the model. The result is a method for implicit adversarial detection that is oblivious to the attack algorithm. We evaluate this method on a variety of standard datasets including MNIST and CIFAR-10 and show that it generalizes well across different architectures and attacks. Our findings report that 85-93 ROC-AUC can be achieved on a number of standard classification tasks with a negative class that consists of both normal and noisy samples.[2]: High-dimensional problem domains pose significant challenges for anomaly detection. The presence of irrelevant features can conceal the presence of anomalies. This problem, known as the 'curse of dimensionality', is an obstacle for many anomaly detection techniques. Building a robust anomaly detection model for use in high-dimensional spaces requires the combination of an unsupervised feature extractor and an anomaly detector. While one-class support vector machines are effective at producing decision surfaces from well-behaved feature vectors, they can be inefficient at modelling the variation in large, high-dimensional datasets. Architectures such as deep belief networks (DBNs) are a promising technique for learning robust features. We present a hybrid model where an unsupervised DBN is trained to extract generic underlying features, and a one-class SVM is trained from the features learned by the DBN. Since a linear kernel can be substituted for nonlinear ones in our hybrid model without loss of accuracy, our model is scalable and computationally efficient. The experimental results show that our proposed model yields comparable anomaly detection performance with a deep autoencoder, while reducing its training and testing time by a factor of 3 and 1000, respectively. HighlightsWe use a combination of a one-class SVM and deep learning.In our model linear kernels can be used rather than nonlinear ones.Our model delivers a comparable accuracy with a deep autoencoder.Our model executes 3times faster in training and 1000 faster than a deep autoencoder.[3]: Deep autoencoders, and other deep neural networks, have demonstrated their effectiveness in discovering non-linear features across many problem domains. However, in many real-world problems, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and one may not have access to clean training data as required by standard deep denoising autoencoders. Herein, we demonstrate novel extensions to deep autoencoders which not only maintain a deep autoencoders' ability to discover high quality, non-linear features but can also eliminate outliers and noise without access to any clean training data. Our model is inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis, and we split the input data X into two parts, @math , where @math can be effectively reconstructed by a deep autoencoder and @math contains the outliers and noise in the original data X. Since such splitting increases the robustness of standard deep autoencoders, we name our model a \\"Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA)\\". Further, we present generalizations of our results to grouped sparsity norms which allow one to distinguish random anomalies from other types of structured corruptions, such as a collection of features being corrupted across many instances or a collection of instances having more corruptions than their fellows. Such \\"Group Robust Deep Autoencoders (GRDA)\\" give rise to novel anomaly detection approaches whose superior performance we demonstrate on a selection of benchmark problems.","answer":"Almost all approaches for anomaly detection with autoencoders require the training data to consist of normal examples only, but this alone is no guarantee for anomalies to have large reconstruction errors. Robust deep autoencoders [3] address this issue by combining denoising autoencoders with robust PCA, thereby isolating noise and outliers from training of the reconstruction. The method achieves significantly better results in the presence of anomalies in the training set on MNIST. A combination of deep learning and kernel based methods for anomaly detection in high dimensional data was proposed by [2] , who combine a Deep Belief Network for feature extraction, and a 1-class SVM for anomaly detection in the compressed latent space. Their method can deal with anomalies in the training data, but does not use this information to refine the training set. When also considering adversarial detection, [1] have proposed density based measures in a ConvNet to identify data points that lie outside the data manifold as potential adversarial examples. They increase the robustness of their method by adding a Bayesian uncertainty estimate, which handles complementary situations."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

The beneficial or adverse effects of isolated phytochemicals are not always concordant with effects of the botanical dietary supplements from which they were derived. This disparity could be due to interactions between the various phytochemicals present in the whole plant. The phenolic acids, rosmarinic acid (RA), caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA) are widely present in foods and dietary supplements, and they are assumed to exert various beneficial biological effects. However, there is little data on the potential biological interactions of these three phenolic acids which commonly occur together and are linked metabolically. In the present study, liver toxicity of the three phenolic acids was assessed on the three compounds singly and in various binary and one ternary combinations. A series of in vitro endpoints relevant to liver toxicity were evaluated in both a human (HepG2/C3A) and rat (MH1C1) hepatocyte cell line. The Combination Index (CI) was calculated for each endpoint from both the concentration responses of the single compounds and the responses of the various binary and ternary mixtures. Both synergistic and antagonistic interactions were observed for some endpoints and some combinations of test agents. Interactions were most prevalent in measures of oxidative stress and cytochrome P450 activities in both cell types. There was only a 53% concordance between the rat and human cells which may be suggestive of species differences. The data suggest an approach for better characterizing the beneficial or adverse effects of complex botanical products through evaluation of interactions between individual phytochemical components.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Applications to the Design of Genosensors Chapter Title:  Electrochemical genosensors 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The interaction of anticancer herbal drug berberine with double-strand DNA (dsDNA) and single-strand DNA (ssDNA) in solution, dsDNA immobilized on the glassy carbon electrode prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett technique, were investigated by electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry) and UV spectroscopy. The presence of DNA results in a decrease of the currents and a negative shift of the electrode potentials from the DPV curves of berberine, indicating the dominance of electrostatic interactions. The spectroscopy data confirmed that the predominant interaction between berberine and DNA is electrostatic. The binding of berberine with DNA, when analyzed in terms of the cooperative Hill model, yields the binding constant K(a)=2.2(+/-0.2)x10(4) M(-1), corresponding to the dissociation equilibrium constant K(d)=4.6(+/-0.3)x10(-5) M, which in the range of the applied concentrations of DNA (bp) and berberine, and a Hill coefficient m=1.82(+/-0.08) in Britton-Robinson buffer solution (0.05 M, pH 5.72) at T=298 K (25 degrees C). Apparently, at least two molecules of berberine have to bind as a couple to cause, e.g., the \\"elementary event\\" of current change. The results are suggestive for further fruitful applications of this anticancer herbal drug and DNA-modified electrodes. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Abstract Carbon nanotubes are interesting materials for DNA electrochemical sensing due to their unique electric properties: high surface area, fast heterogeneous electron transfer, and electrochemical stability. In this work aligned Carbon NanoTube (CNT) thin films were designed and tested as candidate platforms for DNA immobilization and for the development of an electrochemical genosensor. The films were prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) using acetylene and ammonia as precursor gases and nickel particles as catalyst. A preliminary electrochemical characterization was performed using cyclic voltammetry since, so far, these films have been used only for gas sensing. The surfaces were then covalently functionalized with a DNA oligonucleotide probe, complementary to the sequence of the most common inserts in the GMOs: the Promoter 35S. The genosensor format involved the immobilization of the probe onto the sensor surface, the hybridization with the target-sequence and the electrochemical detection of the duplex formation. Careful attention was paid to the probe immobilization conditions in order to minimize the signal due to non-specifically adsorbed sequences. For the detection of the hybridization event both label-free and enzyme-labelled methods were investigated. In case of the enzyme-labelled method a target concentration at nanomolar level can be easily detected, with a linear response from 50 nM to 200 nM, whereas the label-free method showed a linear response between 0.5 Î¼M and 10 Î¼M. The reproducibility was 11% and 20% with the enzyme-labelled method and the label-free method, respectively. The batch-to-batch reproducibility of the different sensors was also evaluated. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  A rapid and sensitive method for the detection of food pathogenic bacteria is reported. In this approach, the bacteria are captured and preconcentrated from food samples with magnetic beads by immunological reaction with the specific antibody against Salmonella. After the lysis of the captured bacteria, further amplification of the genetic material by PCR with a double-tagging set of primers is performed to confirm the identity of the bacteria. Both steps are rapid alternatives to the time-consuming classical selective enrichment and biochemical/serological tests. The double-tagged amplicon is then detected by electrochemical magneto genosensing. The \\"IMS/double-tagging PCR/m-GEC electrochemical genosensing\\" approach is used for the first time for the sensitive detection of Salmonella artificially inoculated into skim milk samples. A limit of detection of 1 CFU mL(-1) was obtained in 3.5 h without any pretreatment, in LB broth and in milk diluted 1/10 in LB. If the skim milk is pre-enriched for 6 h, the method is able to feasibly detect as low as 0.04 CFU mL(-1) (1 CFU in 25 g of milk) with a signal-to-background ratio of 20. Moreover, the method is able to clearly distinguish between pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli. The features of this approach are discussed and compared with classical culture methods and PCR-based assay. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Nanomaterials are being increasingly used for the development of electrochemical DNA biosensors, due to the unique electrocatalytic properties found in nanoscale materials. They offer excellent prospects for interfacing biological recognition events with electronic signal transduction and for designing a new generation of bioelectronic devices exhibiting novel functions. In particular, nanomaterials such as noble metal nanoparticles (Au, Pt), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), magnetic nanoparticles, quantum dots and metal oxide nanoparticles have been actively investigated for their applications in DNA biosensors, which have become a new interdisciplinary frontier between biological detection and material science. In this article, we address some of the main advances in this field over the past few years, discussing the issues and challenges with the aim of stimulating a broader interest in developing nanomaterial-based biosensors and improving their applications in disease diagnosis and food safety examination.Literature Review:","answer":"DNA sensors are a class of electrochemical sensors in which the molecular recognition is achieved by using DNA oligomers. As the recognition is in charge of a biological molecule, they are classified as biosensors since the 1990 decade. The signal originated on the recognition surface is then transduced into an electrical signal. Both amperometric or potentiometric measurements can be carried out. In amperometric measurements, an external potential is applied to oxidize or reduce an electrochemically active compound at its intrinsic redox potential. The current produced in the process is monitored. In potentiometric methods, an equilibrium is reached on the sensor surface without the need of an external potential. The membrane potential (potential generated between the electrode and the measured solution) is then recorded. In amperometric measurements, the choice of the working potential provides some selectivity to the method, as the potential can be set at the specific redox value of the analyte of interest. Nevertheless, interferences in the sample can share the same potential value with the analyte. As this selectivity is not enough, the surface of the electrode needs to be functionalized. For amperometric studies, Cottrel's equation takes into account the mass transport restrictions in the solution, and if the system is kept under continuous stirring, the intensity of the current depends on the concentration of analyte as follows (Equation 4): Where A is the area of the electrode, D and C are the diffusion coefficient and concentration of the analyte and L is the thickness of the diffusion layer closest to the surface. This equation can be simplified as I = KC, and then it can be witnessed that the measured intensity is proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the solution. The electrode used as transducer element can be made up from different materials BIB001 . Platinum, gold, vitrified carbon or pyrolytic graphite are commonly employed. The use of composites (solid conductors dispersed into polymeric nonconducting matrices) is growing over the last years. As mentioned before, in electrochemical biosensors, the electrode is the transducer but a specific recognition step has been previously carried out by a biological macromolecule. Most extended electrochemical biosensors use enzimes or antibodies as recognizing molecules, but genosensors use DNA. DNA molecules afford two remarkable advantages over proteins: they are much more chemically stables and they can be easily synthesized with high purity. DNA can be immobilized on the electrode surface using different techniques. 1) Physical adsorption, 2) electrochemical adsorption, due to the phosphate backbone of DNA, 3) avidin (or streptavidin) / biotin to immobilize the DNA probes on the surface of the electrode, 4) covalent electrode-DNA binding. This method depends strongly on the nature of the electrode, 5) pyrrole or other monomers can be electropolymerized on the surface of an electrode. If this process is conducted in the presence of the DNA probe, the polymer constitutes a matrix that traps the DNA molecules binding them to the electrode. Once the DNA has been immobilized, the recognition step can take place. This event must result on an electrochemical phenomenon measurable by the electrode. Different strategies can be followed  . For the detection of electroactive DNA binding agents, non-specific double-stranded DNA can act as recognizing biomolecules. After the compound binds to the DNA, it can be oxidized or reduced at its redox potential and the current can be monitored. Any electroactive DNA binding molecule will be detected, the selectivity only determined by the different intrinsic redox potential of every substance. This method allows the estimation of drug-DNA binding mode and binding constants BIB002 . For the detection of a specific DNA sequence, the most common approach is to immobilize the single-stranded DNA complementary sequence on the electrode. Then, the hybridization of the target sequence to the probe on the electrode's surface can be monitored by two main ways. The most widely used is adding to the solution an electroactive substance which only binds to the hybrid dsDNA, but not to the ssDNA alone. Myriads of substances have been employed with this aim: cationic metal complexes like Co(phen) 3 3+ and Co(bpy) 3 3+ or intercalating organic molecules like antramines or daunomycin are only a few examples. Commercial systems exist based on this approach (Motorola's eSensor TM and Toshiba's Genelyzer TM ). The second method to detect the hybridization is label free and relies on the redox properties of guanine. The intrinsic redox potential of this base on ssDNA (+1.03 V) decreases when hybridization to form dsDNA happens. This change can be monitored to detect hybridization of the probe and the target sequence. Nevertheless, this change is small and hard to detect, so more complex techniques are required. Furthermore, this method cannot be applied if the probe sequence itself posses guanine bases that would be quickly oxidized. To bypass this problem, probes with inosine instead of guanine can be synthesized. Inosine peak can be easily distinguished from guanine. It is also possible to use other labelling methods to detect the binding to the DNA probes such as metal nanoparticles or enzimes, but their uses are less frequent, although growing. For the last years, the use of nanostructured materials is spreading in the field of nanosensors. This class of materials such as metal nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes possesses very attractive features. The high surface and very characteristic conducting properties make them of interest to achieve better response times, higher sensitivity and improved specificity BIB005 . Aligned carbon nanotubes were recently employed to detect a DNA sequence characteristic for genetically modified organisms with sensitivity in the nanomolar range BIB003 . A combination of magnetic beads for immunomagnetic separation and a later detection step using magnetic graphite-epoxy composite electrode has been recently employed for the detection of Salmonella in milk with limit of detection from 5 to 7.5 x 10 3 CFU mL -1 in a short time (50 minutes) BIB004 )."},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2006 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

In addition, due to bitter controversy over optimal methods for early detection, full compliance of patients with screening recommendations remains a major hindrance for diagnosis at the early stages of cancer development. Development of resistance to chemotherapy also represents a critical issue for which simultaneous treatment with various classes of therapeutics to reduce the resistance has yielded some success [3] . Moreover, the numerous side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on cancer patients, including hair loss, diarrhea, bleeding, and immunosuppression, have made the process 2The Scientific World Journal of treatment more complicated [4] . The highly regulated programmed cell death process of apoptosis is a matter of great interest in oncology and cancer therapy and represents a common molecular pathway for drug resistance and carcinogenesis [5] . Maintenance of a constant cell number in the colonic mucosa is highly regulated through the balance between apoptosis and cell proliferation. The perturbation in this balance leads to an escape from normal cell number homeostasis and is associated with the progression of cancer cells [6, 7] . Thus, suppression of proliferation and elevation of apoptosis in these aberrant cells are suggested to be the essential mechanism for the inhibition of colon cancer. Furthermore, apoptosis and the factors involved in its mechanism of action also present a window that can be exploited for the improvement of potential therapeutic agents with high effectiveness and less adverse side effects [8] . Hence, screening for novel compounds capable of inducing apoptosis in colon cancer cells that can be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs is a significant need and represents a critical challenge in medicinal chemistry. Metal complexes have been extensively utilized in clinics for centuries and have attracted numerous inorganic chemists to analyze them, with the main focus being medical applications [9, 10] . Copper, an essential trace element with an oxidative nature and bioessential activity in human metabolism, does not exist in an ionic form in biological systems. Thus, measurement of copper in the body is evaluated in the form of complexes with organic compounds [11] . Schiff bases are a critical class of compounds in medical chemistry that have demonstrated significant chemotherapeutic and antibacterial application [12, 13] . Schiff base Cu(II) complexes revealed great potential for antiproliferative, antibacterial, and gastroprotective activity [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . This study evaluated the anticancer potential of a copper (II) complex derived from N,N -dimethyl ethylene diamine and 2-hydroxyacetophenone Schiff base ligand, Cu(BrHAP) 2 . Furthermore, the possible apoptotic mechanism underlying this activity was also examined.

The cells were plated at a fitting density in tissue culture flasks (Corning, USA) according to each experimental scale. Cell viability was measured by a conventional MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] reduction assay. After 48 h exposure to six concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 , cells were treated with MTT solution (2 mg/mL) for 2 h. The dark formazan crystals formed in intact cells were dissolved in DMSO, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm and 650 nm as a background using a microplate reader (Hidex, Turku, Finland). The IC 50 value was determined as the concentration of Cu(BrHAP) 2 required to reduce the absorbance of treated cells to 50% of the DMSO-treated control cells. All samples were prepared in triplicates. Assay. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release is a biomarker for determining the cytotoxicity of a compound. Briefly, HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 and Triton X-100 (positive control) for 48 h, and the supernatants of the untreated and treated cells were transferred to a new 96-well plate for LDH activity analysis. Next, 100 L of LDH reaction solution was added to each well, the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the absorbance was read at 490 nm using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) microplate reader. The amount of formazan salt and intensity of red color in treated and untreated samples were represented as the LDH activity of cells. The LDH release level in cells treated with Cu(BrHAP) 2 was expressed as a percentage of the positive control. A propidium iodide (PI) and acridine orange (AO) double staining assay were carried out for detection of apoptosis in the treated cells using a fluorescent microscope (Leica attached with Q-Floro software) according to a standard procedure. HT-29 cells (5 Ã 10 4 cells/mL in a 25 mL culture flask) were plated, treated with Cu(BrHAP) 2 at the IC 50 concentration, and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h. After harvesting the cells, they were stained with fluorescent dyes and observed under a UV-fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51) within 30 min. In brief, HT-29 cells (1 Ã 10 4 cells/well in 96-well plate) were supplemented with Cu(BrHAP) 2 (2 g/mL) or DMSO (negative control) for 24 h. The live cells were then incubated with BrdU and Phospho-Histone H3 dyes for 30 min. After the cells were fixed and stained as described by the manufacturer's instructions, they were visualized and analyzed using the Cellomics ArrayScan HCS reader (Thermo Scientific). The fluorescence intensities of the dyes were measured using a target activation bioapplication module. To confirm the result of the fluorescence cell cycle analysis, HT-29 cells (5 Ã 10 4 cells/mL) were treated with Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 24, 48, and 72 h for flow cytometry analysis. After incubation, HT-29 cells were spun down at 1800 rpm for 5 min. Next, fixation of a cell population for flow cytometry analysis was carried out to restore integrity. In brief, the cell pellets were fixed by mixing them with 700 L of cold ethanol (90%) and were then kept at 4 â C overnight. Treated HT-29 cells were spun down, and the ethanol was discarded. After washing and suspending the cells in PBS, 25 L of RNase A (10 mg/mL) and 50 L of propidium iodide (PI) (1 mg/mL) were added to the fixed cells for 1 h at 37 â C. The added RNase A limited the ability of PI to bind to only DNA molecules. At the end, the DNA content of the cells was analyzed by a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto II). The oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) assay was carried out based on the protocols described in detail previously [19] . In brief, Cu(BrHAP) 2 at the concentration of 100 g/mL was used for this assay in a total reaction volume of 200 L. The experiment was performed in a black 96-well microplate with 25 L of compound, blank (solvent/PBS), standard (trolox), or positive control (quercetin). The plate was then supplemented with the working fluorescein solution (150 L), followed by a 5 min incubation at 37 â . The total volume of 200 L was made up by adding 25 L of AAPH working solution. Fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 538 nm every 2 min for 2 h. The result was quantified by calculating the differences of area under the fluorescence decay curve (AUC) of samples and blank. The values were Trolox equivalents (TE). In brief, HT-29 cells (1 Ã 10 4 cells/mL) were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 and DMSO (negative control) for 24 h. After 30 min treatment with dihydroethidium (DHE) dye, cells were fixed and washed with wash buffer as described by the manufacturer's instructions. In the presence of superoxides, DHE dye is oxidized to ethidium. The fluorescence intensity was determined by a fluorescent plate reader at an extension wavelength of 520 nm and an emission wavelength of 620 nm. The critical factors for monitoring the cell health, namely, cell loss, changes in cell permeability, cytochrome release, mitochondrial membrane potential changes, nuclear size, and morphological changes, were studied using a Cellomics Multiparameter Cytotoxicity 3 Kit as described in detail previously [20] . Plates with stained cells were analyzed using the ArrayScan HCS system (Cellomics, PA, USA). Caspases 3/7, -8, and 9 activities were determined using the commercial caspase-Glo 3/7, 8, and 9 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). HT-29 cells (1.0 Ã 10 4 cells/well) were seeded overnight in white-walled 96-well plates and treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 24 h. According to the manufacturer's protocol, the treated cells were supplemented with caspase-Glo reagent (100 L) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The active caspases from apoptotic cells caused the cleavage of aminoluciferin-labeled synthetic tetrapeptide, leading to the release of substrate for the luciferase enzyme. Caspase activities were analyzed using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) microplate reader. In brief, HT-29 cells (1.0 Ã 10 4 cells/well in a 96-well plate) were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 3 h, followed by stimulation with TNF-(1 ng/mL) for 30 min. After discarding the medium, cells were fixed and stained using a Cellomics nucleus factor-B (NF-B) activation kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, an Array Scan HCS Reader was used for evaluation of the plate. Cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-B intensity ratios were calculated using Cytoplasm to Nucleus Translocation Bioapplication software. The average intensity of 200 cells/well was determined. The ratios for untreated, treated, and TNF-stimulated cells were compared. All the experiments were performed at least three times independently. The results were presented as the mean Â± standard deviation (SD) of the number of experiments shown in the legends. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using the prism statistical package (GraphPad Software, USA). < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cells of the Colon. Initially, the cytotoxicity of Cu(BrHAP) 2 was tested on HT-29 and CCD 841 cell lines. The IC 50 values of the Schiff base compound were determined based on the result collected from three independent MTT experiments. As indicated in Table 1 , Cu(BrHAP) 2 elicited a significant cytotoxicity and cell inhibitory effect after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment on HT-29 cell. 2 -Induced LDH Release. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the medium is a marker that shows the loss of membrane integrity, apoptosis, or necrosis. The cytotoxicity of the Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound, as determined by the LDH release assay, was quantified on HT-29 cells treated with various concentrations of the Schiff base compound for 48 h. Cu(BrHAP) 2 induced a significant elevation in LDH release, demonstrating cytotoxicity at the 6.25 and 12.5 g/mL concentrations compared to the control cells ( Figure 2 ). Microscopy and AO/PI Double Staining. Morphological changes in HT-29 cells treated with Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound were observed under a fluorescent microscope at 24, 48, and 72 h. The cells were scored under a fluorescent microscope to analyze viable cells, early apoptosis, and late apoptosis. Early apoptosis, defined as intervening AO within the fragmented DNA, was observed under bright green fluorescence. At the same time, control cells were visualized with a green intact nuclear structure. After 24 and 48 h of treatment with Cu(BrHAP) 2 , moderate apoptosis was observed in the form of blebbing and nuclear chromatin condensation. Furthermore, in the late stage of apoptosis, changes, such as the presence of a reddish-orange color due to binding of PI to denatured DNA, were observed after 72 h of treatment ( Figure 3) . The results showed that the Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound induced morphological features of apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Figure 4 , demonstrated that there is no cell cycle arrest in the S/M phases. The lack of cell cycle arrest in the S/M phases suggested possible cell cycle arrest in the G 1 /G 2 phases. To determine the exact arrested phase, treated HT-29 cells were analyzed for cell cycle progression using flow cytometry. As expected, there was no significant arrest in the S/M phases. Meanwhile, significant cell cycle arrest in the G 1 phase was observed for HT-29 cells after 24 and 48 h of treatment ( Figure 5 ). Assay. Antioxidant capacity was measured by ORAC assay, which is the only assay that involves the use of peroxyl radical as a prooxidant and quantifies activity via the area under the curve (AUC) technique. In our experiment, quercetin was used as a positive control. The result demonstrated that Cu(BrHAP) 2 exhibited low to moderate antioxidant activity compared to quercetin ( Table 2) . Formation. HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP) 2 for 24 h and stained with DHE dye to determine the influence of the Schiff base compound on ROS production. The fluorescence intensities of DHE oxidization by ROS were quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader. As depicted in Figure 6 , exposure to the Schiff base compound caused a significant elevation in the ROS levels of treated HT-29 cells at the 6.25 g/mL concentration.Question: What is the 5-year survival rate for colorectal cancer patients?","answer":"64.3%"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

User generated content which forms the nature of social media, is noisy and contains grammatical and linguistic errors. This noisy content makes it much harder for tasks such as named entity recognition. However some applications like automatic journalism or information retrieval from social media, require more information about entities mentioned in groups of social media posts. Conventional methods applied to structured and well typed documents provide acceptable results while compared to new user generated media, these methods are not satisfactory. One valuable piece of information about an entity is the related image to the text. Combining this multimodal data reduces ambiguity and provides wider information about the entities mentioned. In order to address this issue, we propose a novel deep learning approach utilizing multimodal deep learning. Our solution is able to provide more accurate results on named entity recognition task. Experimental results, namely the precision, recall and F1 score metrics show the superiority of our work compared to other state-of-the-art NER solutions.IntroductionA common social media delivery system such as Twitter supports various media types like video, image and text. This media allows users to share their short posts called Tweets. Users are able to share their tweets with other users that are usually following the source user. Hovewer there are rules to protect the privacy of users from unauthorized access to their timeline BIBREF0. The very nature of user interactions in Twitter micro-blogging social media is oriented towards their daily life, first witness news-reporting and engaging in various events (sports, political stands etc.). According to studies, news in twitter is propagated and reported faster than conventional news media BIBREF1. Thus, extracting first hand news and entities occurring in this fast and versatile online media gives valuable information. However, abridged and noisy content of Tweets makes it even more difficult and challenging for tasks such as named entity recognition and information retrieval BIBREF2.The task of tracking and recovering information from social media posts is a concise definition of information retrieval in social media BIBREF3, BIBREF4. However many challenges are blocking useful solutions to this issue, namely, the noisy nature of user generated content and the perplexity of words used in short posts. Sometimes different entities are called exactly the same, for example \\"Micheal Jordan\\" refers to a basketball player and also a computer scientist in the field of artificial intelligence. The only thing that divides both of these is the context in which entity appeared. If the context refers to something related to AI, the reader can conclude \\"Micheal Jordan\\" is the scientist, and if the context is refers to sports and basketball then he is the basketball player. The task of distinguishing between different named entities that appear to have the same textual appearance is called named entity disambiguation. There is more useful data on the subject rather than on plain text. For example images and visual data are more descriptive than just text for tasks such as named entity recognition and disambiguation BIBREF5 while some methods only use the textual data BIBREF6.The provided extra information is closely related to the textual data. As a clear example, figure FIGREF1 shows a tweet containing an image. The combination of these multimodal data in order to achieve better performance in NLP related tasks is a promising alternative explored recently.An NLP task such as named entity recognition in social media is a most challenging task because users tend to invent, mistype and epitomize words. Sometimes these words correspond to named entities which makes the recognition task even more difficult BIBREF7. In some cases, the context that carries the entity (surrounding words and related image) is more descriptive than the entity word presentation BIBREF8.To find a solution to the issues at hand, and keeping multimodal data in mind, recognition of named entities from social media has become a research interest which utilizes image compared to NER task in a conventional text. Researchers in this field have tried to propose multimodal architectures based on deep neural networks with multimodal input that are capable of combining text and image BIBREF9, BIBREF8, BIBREF10.In this paper we draw a better solution in terms of performance by proposing a new novel method called CWI (Character-Word-Image model). We used multimodal deep neural network to overcome the NER task in micro-blogging social media.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section SECREF2 provides an insight view of previous methods; section SECREF3 describes the method we propose; section SECREF4 shows experimental evaluation and test results; finally, section SECREF5 concludes the whole article.Related WorkMany algorithms and methods have been proposed to detect, classify or extract information from single type of data such as audio, text, image etc. However, in the case of social media, data comes in a variety of types such as text, image, video or audio in a bounded style. Most of the time, it is very common to caption a video or image with textual information. This information about the video or image can refer to a person, location etc. From a multimodal learning perspective, jointly computing such data is considered to be more valuable in terms of representation and evaluation. Named entity recognition task, on the other hand, is the task of recognizing named entities from a sentence or group of sentences in a document format.Named entity is formally defined as a word or phrase that clearly identifies an item from set of other similar items BIBREF11, BIBREF12. Equation DISPLAY_FORM2 expresses a sequence of tokens.From this equation, the NER task is defined as recognition of tokens that correspond to interesting items. These items from natural language processing perspective are known as named entity categories; BIO2 proposes four major categories, namely, organization, person, location and miscellaneous BIBREF13. From the biomedical domain, gene, protein, drug and disease names are known as named entities BIBREF14, BIBREF15. Output of NER task is formulated in . I_sin [1,N] and I_ein [1,N] is the start and end indices of each named entity and t is named entity type BIBREF16.BIO2 tagging for named entity recognition is defined in equation . Table TABREF3 shows BIO2 tags and their respective meanings; B and I indicate beginning and inside of the entity respectively, while O shows the outside of it. Even though many tagging standards have been proposed for NER task, BIO is the foremost accepted by many real world applications BIBREF17.A named entity recognizer gets s as input and provides entity tags for each token. This sequential process requires information from the whole sentence rather than only tokens and for that reason, it is also considered to be a sequence tagging problem. Another analogous problem to this issue is part of speech tagging and some methods are capable of doing both. However, in cases where noise is present and input sequence has linguistic typos, many methods fail to overcome the problem. As an example, consider a sequence of tokens where a new token invented by social media users gets trended. This trending new word is misspelled and is used in a sequence along with other tokens in which the whole sequence does not follow known linguistic grammar. For this special case, classical methods and those which use engineered features do not perform well.Using the sequence s itself or adding more information to it divides two approaches to overcome this problem: unimodal and multimodal.Although many approaches for NER have been proposed and reviewing them is not in the scope of this article, we focus on foremost analogues classical and deep learning approaches for named entity recognition in two subsections. In subsection SECREF4 unimodal approaches for named entity recognition are presented while in subsection SECREF7 emerging multimodal solutions are described.Related Work ::: Multimodal Named Entity RecognitionMultimodal learning has become an emerging research interest and with the rise of deep learning techniques, it has become more visible in different research areas ranging from medical imaging to image segmentation and natural language processing BIBREF28, BIBREF29, BIBREF30, BIBREF31, BIBREF32, BIBREF33, BIBREF34, BIBREF35, BIBREF36, BIBREF9, BIBREF37, BIBREF38, BIBREF39, BIBREF40, BIBREF41, BIBREF42, BIBREF43, BIBREF44, BIBREF45. On the other hand, very little research has been focused on the extraction of named entities with joint image and textual data concerning short and noisy content BIBREF46, BIBREF47, BIBREF9, BIBREF8 while several studies have been explored in textual named entity recognition using neural models BIBREF48, BIBREF49, BIBREF24, BIBREF50, BIBREF27, BIBREF51, BIBREF10, BIBREF52.State-of-the-art methods have shown acceptable evaluation on structured and well formatted short texts. Techniques based on deep learning such as utilization of convolutional neural networks BIBREF52, BIBREF49, recurrent neural networks BIBREF50 and long short term memory neural networks BIBREF27, BIBREF24 are aimed to solve NER problem.The multimodal named entity recognizers can be categorized in two categories based on the tasks at hand, one tries to improve NER task with utilization of visual data BIBREF46, BIBREF8, BIBREF47, and the other tries to give further information about the task at hand such as disambiguation of named entities BIBREF9. We will refer to both of these tasks as MNER. To have a better understanding of MNER, equation DISPLAY_FORM9 formulates the available multimodal data while equations and are true for this task.i refers to image and the rest goes same as equation DISPLAY_FORM2 for word token sequence.In BIBREF47 pioneering research was conducted using feature extraction from both image and textual data. The extracted features were fed to decision trees in order to output the named entity classes. Researchers have used multiple datasets ranging from buildings to human face images to train their image feature extractor (object detector and k-means clustering) and a text classifier has been trained on texts acquired from DBPedia.Researchers in BIBREF46 proposed a MNER model with regards to triplet embedding of words, characters and image. Modality attention applied to this triplet indicates the importance of each embedding and their impact on the output while reducing the impact of irrelevant modals. Modality attention layer is applied to all embedding vectors for each modal, however the investigation of fine-grained attention mechanism is still unclear BIBREF53. The proposed method with Inception feature extraction BIBREF54 and pretrained GloVe word vectors shows good results on the dataset that the authors aggregated from Snapchat. This method shows around 0.5 for precision and F-measure for four entity types (person, location, organization and misc) while for segmentation tasks (distinguishing between a named entity and a non-named entity) it shows around 0.7 for the metrics mentioned.An adaptive co-attention neural network with four generations are proposed in BIBREF8. The adaptive co-attention part is similar to the multimodal attention proposed in BIBREF46 that enabled the authors to have better results over the dataset they collected from Twitter. In their main proposal, convolutional layers are used for word representation, BiLSTM is utilized to combine word and character embeddings and an attention layer combines the best of the triplet (word, character and image features). VGG-Net16 BIBREF55 is used as a feature extractor for image while the impact of other deep image feature extractors on the proposed solution is unclear, however the results show its superiority over related unimodal methods.Experimental Evaluation ::: DatasetIn BIBREF8 a refined collection of tweets gathered from twitter is presented. Their dataset which is labeled for named entity recognition task contains 8,257 tweets. There are 12,784 entities in total in this dataset. Table TABREF19 shows statistics related to each named entity in training, development and test sets.Experimental Evaluation ::: Experimental SetupIn order to obtain the best results in tab. TABREF20 for our first model (CWI), we have used the following setup in tables TABREF22, TABREF23, TABREF24 and TABREF25. For the second proposed method, the same parameter settings have been used with an additional attention layer. This additional layer has been added after layer 31 in table TABREF25 and before the final CRF layer, indexed as 32. Adam optimizer with 8times 10^{-5} has been used in training phase with 10 epochs.Table 1: BIO Tags and their respective meaningFigure 2: Proposed CWI Model: Character (left), Word (middle) and Image (right) feature extractors combined by bidirectional long-short term memory and the conditional random field at the endTable 2: Statistics of named entity types in train, development and test sets [9]Table 3: Evaluation results of different approaches compared to oursTable 6: Implementation details of our model (CWI): Image Feature ExtractorTable 8: Effect of different word embedding sizes on our proposed modelQuestion: Which social media platform is explored?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"twitter \\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"In BIBREF8 a refined collection of tweets gathered from twitter is presented.

Bland and Altman plots were used to compare the transformed DAS with the recorded DAS28 to ascertain levels of agreement.The subjective components of the Disease Activity Score 28-joints (DAS28) in rheumatoid arthritisTo determine the contribution of fibromyalgia (FM) to the subjective components of the Disease Activity Score 28-joints (DAS28) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to analyse the discriminatory performance of the derived DAS28 patient-reported components (DAS28-P) to identify patients with fibromyalgic RA.Analysis of disease activity scores (DAS28 [disease activity score based on the 28-joint count]) over time showed that, after the initial rapid improvement during the first 6 to 22 weeks of therapy, a further decrease in disease activity of 0.2 units in the DAS28 score per year was observed.ceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis allowed to obtain optimal cut-off predictors of a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) < or =2.85. TWe hypothesize that augmented pain processing, fibromyalgic features, poorer mental health, and patient-reported 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) components are associated in RA.ter 7 years, apart from routine clinical follow-up, treating rheumatologists were asked to complete a questionnaire designed specifically for the present study to evaluate the current therapy with infliximab, the level of disease activity (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28]) and the reasons for infliximab discontinuation.REdiographs of hands and feet, pain, and the modified 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28) were also assessed.REBACKGROUND: Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) is a scoring system to evaluate disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).OBJECTIVE: Antirheumatic treatment is frequently not appropriately modified, according to American College of Rheumatology guidelines, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as defined by a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) score greater thaOBJECTIVE: The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28) has been increasingly used in clinical practice and research studies of rheumatoid arthrOBJECTIVE: The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28) has been widely used in clinical practice and research studies of rheumatoid arthrOBJECTIVE: The Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), used to assess disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is a composite score comprising clinical, biochemical, and patient self-report meaOBJECTIVE: To determine whether using a reweighted disease activity score that better reflects joint synovitis, i.e., the 2-component Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) (based on swollen joint count and C-reactive protein level), produces more clinically relevant treatment outcome trajectories compared to the standard 4-componentOBJECTIVE: Ankle joints are frequently neglected in activity scoring systems, including the Disease Activity Score in 28 joinOBJECTIVE: The Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) is a key measure in clinical practice and clinicmost widely used one is the Disease Activity Score involving 28 joint counts (DAS28) for which cut-offs were proposed to help physicians classify patients. HowBACKGROUND: Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) is a scoring system to evaluate disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid arthMETHODS: Functional disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], disease activity [28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)], and radiographic joint damage [Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS)] were measured in 4 consecutive randomized controlled trials with increasingly intensive (tight control) treatment strategies.INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine a low disease activity threshold--a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) value--for the decision to maintain unchanged disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients, based on expert opinion.Comparison of Disease Activity Score in 28 joints with ESR (DAS28), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) & Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data with 3 measures (RAPID3) for assessing disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at initial presentation.We assessed achievement of remission as defined by Boolean criteria, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and 28-joint Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) and determined the components that limit patients in SDAI, CDAI, or DAS28(CRP) remission from achieving Boolean remission.METHODS: Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) scores, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) were calculated using data from tocilizumab trials in patients with RA in whom disease had remained active despite treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.OBJECTIVE: We used the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism SjÃ¶gren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) articular domain to assess the effect of rituximab (RTX) and abatacept (ABA) on articular involvement in primary SjÃ¶gren syndrome (pSS).METHOD: The clinical data of 189 consecutive RA patients, including RAPID3 questionnaire, Disease Activity Score based on 28-joint count (DAS28), clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and ultrasonography of hand and wrist joints were collected.Disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)-remission has not been included among American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism definitions, because of its association with significant residual disease activity, partly due to high weighting of acute-phase reactants (APR).OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of components of the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) [tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), patient's general health (GH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)] on the total DAS28 score, and overlapping of the 4 individual components in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with low, moderate, or high disease activity.This study investigates if, and to what extent, non-adherence to treatment would lead to a higher 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28) in the first year after diagnosis.Radiographs of hands and feet, pain, and the modified 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28) were also assessed.Tender-/swollen-joint count, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Disease Activity Score 28-ESR (DAS28-ESR), DAS28-CRP, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and DAS28-monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (DAS28-MCP-1) scores were obtained every 3 months.METHOD: All patients were naÃ¯ve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and in low or moderate Disease Activity Score of 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS)28-CRP).We compared RA disease activity using 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and its components, and EULAR response, between patients with and without AITD, using logistic regression.BACKGROUND: Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) is a scoring system to evaluate disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid artBACKGROUND: The 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) combines scores on a 28-tender and swollen joint count (TJC28 and SJC28), a patient-reported measure for general health (GH), and an inflammatory marker (either the erythrocyte

Indeed, the resulting levels of rate accelerations and mechanistic discrimination allow for the discovery of new chemical reactions between otherwise benign substrates. Our lab has recently applied the synergistic catalysis paradigm to the development of several new asymmetric bond formations that were previously elusive, namely, the enantioselective Î±-trifluoromethylation,2 Î±-arylation,3 Î±-alkenylation,4 and Î±-oxidation5 of aldehydes. As part of these ongoing efforts in dual catalysis, we recently sought to merge the broad utility of chiral enamine catalysis with the capacity of transition metals, specifically CuII, to undergo transmetalation with vinyl boronic acids to form highly electrophilic CuIIIâolefin intermediates (after a subsequent oxidation step). By targeting the merger of catalytic systems that presently enjoy widespread use, yet employ practical and economical substrates and catalysts, we presumed that these technologies would allow new operationally convenient bond-forming processes to be developed that could not be accessed using mono-catalysis mechanisms. Specifically, the enantioselective Î±-alkenylation of carbonyls has been a longstanding problem in chemical synthesis that has only recently begun to come to fruition.6â8 Herein, we describe a mild, room temperature protocol for the enantioselective Î±-alkenylation of aldehydes with boronic acids9 using readily available, bench-stable catalysts and reagents through the successful application of synergistic copper(II)-organocatalysis.</p><p></p>Design Plan<p>From the outset, we questioned whether a transient and highly electrophilic d8-organocopper(III) species, which have shown a remarkable propensity for reactions with Ï-nucleophiles,3â4,10 could undergo productive and enantioselective coupling with nucleophilic enamines generated through chiral amine catalysis. As outlined in Scheme 1, we proposed that an oxidase-style mechanism (as first delineated by Stahl11 for the ChanâEvansâLam reaction)12 could be employed to generate a transient electrophilic organocopper(III) species 4 from a simple boronic acid substrate (Scheme 1). More precisely, the transmetalation of copper(II) catalyst 1 with a boronic acid would furnish organocopper(II) 3 which, after oxidation by copper(II), would deliver the desired alkenylcopper(III) 4. Thereafter, the HOMO-activated enamine 6, generated through a concomitant organocatalytic cycle, would intercept organocopper(III) 4 to access the critical dual catalysis intermediate (enamine-organocopper(III) complex 7),13 which after reductive elimination, would furnish Î±-alkenyl iminium 8 and the corresponding copper(I) salt 9. Regeneration of each catalyst would be accomplished through hydrolysis of iminium 8 and single-electron oxidation of the copper(I) salt 9 under an oxygen atmosphere, while delivering the enantioenriched Î±-alkenyl aldehyde product. With respect to enantiocontrol, computational studies predict that the Si-face of this enamine will be shielded by the naphthyl ring of the imidazolidinone framework, leaving the Re-face accessible to electrophilic attack (see DFT-7). Importantly, we recognized that if such a synergistic mechanism could be realized then boronic acids, one of the most prevalent building blocks in organic chemistry, would become a viable and practical substrate for the enantioselective Î±-functionalization of simple aldehydes.</p>Results<p>As shown in Table 1, we were delighted to find that the proposed coupling of aldehydes and boronic acids under the simultaneous action of copper and aminocatalysis is indeed feasible. Furthermore, a survey of copper salts (entries 3â8) revealed that copper(II) acetate was the optimal metal catalyst in terms of reactivity and enantioselection when employed in concert with commercially available amine catalyst 10 (entry 8, 58% yield, 86% ee). Further improvements in reaction efficiency were realized via the use of higher copper loadings (30 mol%) in combination with the addition of methylboronic acid as a reaction supplement to deliver the desired Î±-vinyl adduct in 73% yield (entry 10, 86% ee). The success of methylboronic acid as a suitable additive for this protocol presumably arises from the in situ formation of mixed boronic anhydrides,14â18 a species from which boron to copper transmetalation is accelerated.18 Finally, an evaluation of 5â¢TFA, 10â¢TFA, and 11â¢TFA (entries 10â12) revealed that organocatalysts 5â¢TFA and 11â¢TFA provide superior levels of enantiocontrol (entries 11 and 12, 93% ee); however, the superior efficiencies demonstrated by amine 5â¢TFA in combination with Cu(OAc)2 defined this system as the optimal synergistic protocol for aldehyde vinylation.</p><p>As outlined in Table 2, we have found that a broad range of formyl components are suitable for this enantioselective coupling with boronic acids. Of particular importance is the facility with which propionaldehyde can be employed (entry 1, 72% yield, 93% ee), a substrate which enables modular access to diverse propionate motifs of utility in macrolide total syntheses. Additionally, arene functionality on the aldehydic component is well tolerated (entry 2, 74% yield, 90% ee). Sterically demanding Î²-branched products were also generated in high yield and excellent enantioselection (entries 3 and 4, 67â73% yield, 85â90% ee).19 Remarkably, given the context of a multi-catalytic system, diverse heteroatom-containing functionalities, including protected amines, alcohols, and esters, do not interfere with the reactivity of either the metal or organocatalyst (entries 4â7, 67â76% yield, 85â94% ee). Moreover, a variety of aldehydes containing pendent alkyne and alkene functional handles are excellent substrates for this coupling protocol (entries 8â10, 72â84% yield, 91â94% ee).</p><p>As shown in Table 3, a broad spectrum of alkenylboronic acids can be successfully employed as substrates in this enantioselective aldehyde Î±-alkenylation transformation. For example, alkyl substituted alkenylboronic acids were found to be excellent substrates (entries 1â4, 76â80% yield, 93â96% ee), tolerating 1Â°, 2Â°, and 3Â° substitution at the allylic position of the alkenylboronic acid. Notably, the 3-phenylpropenylboronic acid adduct (entry 4) did not undergo olefin isomerization to the corresponding enal or styrene regioisomers in the presence of the copper transition metal catalyst. The boronic acid component can also tolerate halide and heteroatom functionalities (entries 5 and 6), a chemoselectivity feature that will be important in the use of these synthons in complex molecule construction. Moreover, a wide range of electronically diverse styrenylboronic acids were found to be compatible with these synergistic catalysis conditions. For example, electron-poor styrene substrates proved to be excellent coupling partners, achieving and maintaining high levels of enantiopurity, despite the increased potential for these adducts to undergo in situ racemization (entries 7â9, 67â77% yield, 91â93% ee). Furthermore, electron-neutral and electron-rich styrenes20 were also found to furnish the Î±-vinyl formyl adducts with excellent levels of efficiency and enantiocontrol (entries 10â12, 70â73% yield, 92â94% ee). To demonstrate operational utility, we have executed our Î±-alkenylation reaction on a 10 mmol scale to prepare 1.7 g of (E)-2R-(2-phenyleth-1-en-1-yl)octan-1-ol in 72% yield and in 92% ee (cf. Table 3, entry 10, 73% yield, 93% ee).</p><p>To highlight the value of this new enantioselective vinylation reaction, we have demonstrated that this protocol can be used to accelerate the production of a diverse series of enantioenriched iodolactones,21 potentially valuable intermediates en route to natural products containing Î³-butyrolactone motifs (Scheme 2).21â22 These stereochemically rich heterocycles were prepared from their corresponding Î±-alkenyl aldehydes via a short two-step sequence involving aldehyde oxidation followed by iodo-lactonization23 without loss in enantiopurity. The rapid development of molecular complexity obtained via this straightforward procedure is further underscored by the value and convenience of employing bench-stable and readily available catalysts and starting materials. An epoxy-lactonization variant of the sequence is currently being employed for the total synthesis of blastmycinone.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated the capacity of amine and copper catalysis to be combined in a synergistic fashion to allow the enantioselective construction of Î±-vinyl aldehydes. The scope of this new dual catalysis transformation has been found to be extensive in both the aldehyde and vinyl boronic acid coupling partners. We previously described asymmetric, organocatalytic Î±-alkenylation protocols that employ either vinyl potassium trifluoroborate salts6a or vinyl iodonium salts4 as coupling partners. Importantly, the dual catalysis strategy described herein offers a major practical advantage over existing methods, as it has enabled boronic acids, one of the most pervasive building blocks in organic chemistry, to become a viable and practical substrate for electrophilic additions in the context of enamine catalysis. Application of this new methodology to the synthesis of stereochemically complex Î²-iodo-Î³-butyrolactones, has been accomplished in a concise three-step sequence.</p>","answer":"The enantioselective xcexb1-alkenylation of aldehydes has been accomplished using boronic acids via the synergistic combination of copper and chiral amine catalysis.

The genes associated with different diseases are unrelated and harbor a trinucleotide repeat in different functional regions; therefore, it is striking that many of these diseases have similar correlations between their genotype, namely the number of inherited repeats and age of onset and progression phenotype. These correlations remain unexplained despite more than a decade of research. Although mechanisms have been proposed for several trinucleotide diseases, none of the proposals, being disease-specific, can account for the commonalities among these diseases. Here, we propose a universal mechanism in which length-dependent somatic repeat expansion occurs during the patient's lifetime toward a pathological threshold. Our mechanism uniformly explains for the first time to our knowledge the genotypeâphenotype correlations common to trinucleotide disease and is well-supported by both experimental and clinical data. In addition, mathematical analysis of the mechanism provides simple explanations to a wide range of phenomena such as the exponential decrease of the age-of-onset curve, similar onset but faster progression in patients with Huntington disease with homozygous versus heterozygous mutation, and correlation of age of onset with length of the short allele but not with the long allele in Friedreich ataxia. If our proposed universal mechanism proves to be the core component of the actual mechanisms of specific trinucleotide diseases, it would open the search for a uniform treatment for all these diseases, possibly by delaying the somatic expansion process.Introduction:Trinucleotide diseases are hereditary disorders in which a gene that harbors a trinucleotide repeat is inherited with a number of repeats that exceeds a disease-specific threshold[1, 2]. In the so-called polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington disease( HD)[3], spinocerebellar ataxia( SCA) of various types[4], and others, the expanded repeat CAG codes for glutamine in a gene's coding region. Polyglutamine diseases are manifested by neuronal symptoms[1]. In other diseases, the repeat is located in noncoding regions: in the muscle disease myotonic dystrophy type 1( DM1)[1, 5] the CTG repeat is located in the 3â² untranslated region( UTR) of the gene DMPK, and in Friedreich ataxia[1, 5, 6]( FRDA) a GAA repeat is located within the first intron of the gene FRDA. The genes associated with the various diseases are structurally and functionally unrelated. Despite their differences, many of the trinucleotide diseases share intriguing phenotype characteristics[2, 7]. The disease has no symptoms for many years until a sudden onset at an age that is inversely correlated with the number of inherited repeats[2, 4, 8â11]. For example, in HD, the median onset age may change from 67 y for patients with 39 repeats to 27 y for patients with 50 repeats[11]. When the number of repeats exceeds 70, the disease has juvenile onset; there are also cases of childhood onset for even longer repeats[12, 13]. These relations of onset age and the number of repeats are similar in other diseases, and are typically characterized by an exponential curve in which the change in the age of onset as a result of additional inherited repeat reduces with the number of repeats[4, 8, 14]. A larger number of repeats also directly correlates with the severity and the rate of symptom progression of the disease[12, 15, 16]. In addition, many diseases show genetic anticipation, where the number of inherited repeats increases significantly from generation to generation, usually via paternal transmission, thus causing earlier onset and faster progression[1, 2, 7]. The mechanism, which leads to such genetically encoded delay in disease onset, is yet unknown. For polyglutamine diseases, it is currently assumed that the extended polyglutamine has a gain of a toxic function which leads to cumulative damage in the affected cells, possibly in the form of glutamine aggregate formation[1, 17â19]. It is assumed that the level of toxicity depends on the number of repeats, such that longer repeats are more toxic and lead to a faster damage and earlier cell death, implying that both disease and delay in onset are governed by the same mechanism[1, 17â19]. This suggested mechanism of cumulative damage has several shortcomings and is unlikely to explain the strong correlations of onset and repeat length. First, the strong correlations of repeat length and age of onset are also apparent in nonpolyglutamine diseases such as DM1 and FRDA, suggesting a mechanism that is unrelated to the specific gene function or expression level. Second, in the rare case of patients with homozygous mutation( two expanded alleles), the cumulative damage mechanism would predict a significant decrease in age of onset, which is in contradiction with recent clinical findings that homozygousity does not result in earlier onset[20â22]. Unlike onset, disease progression after onset was found to be notably faster in homozygote patients with HD, leading to the suggestion that two different mechanisms account for the delayed onset and the disease pathology[20]. Furthermore, aggregate accumulation mechanism is highly sensitive to differences in expression level and thus unlikely to show such precise correlations. Finally, it is unclear how such a mechanism would result in the exponential onset curve often seen in polyglutamine diseases. Several previous studies in trinucleotide diseases animal models, including mouse[23â25] and fruit fly[26], have highlighted the fact that trinucleotide repeats present significant somatic instability, which is specifically significant in the disease-affected tissues. Somatic length instability was also shown in lymphoblastoid cell lines of HD subjects with intermediate length[27]. This somatic instability is a result of either slippage mutation or a mishybridization of the two DNA strands due to the high complementarities of the repeating sequence followed by a DNA repair process[2, 26, 28]. This process was shown to have strong bias toward expansion[23â26]. The repeat instability increases with the number of repeats[29, 30], as the likelihood of mishybridization grows with repeat length. Thus, as the disease allele somatically expands within a cell, its probability for further expansion increases, leading to an accelerated expansion process. Understanding the mechanism by which the number of inherited repeats affects the onset age and disease progression is highly desirable, as it may open new treatment opportunities. Here, we propose that a universal mechanism of length-dependent somatic mutation underlies trinucleotide diseases and accounts for these striking genotypeâphenotype correlations.Discussion:We suggest that a length-dependent somatic expansion mechanism underlies the genetically encoded delayed onset of trinucleotide diseases. According to the mechanism, the inherited disease allele has no toxic implications on the disease-related cells before it expands beyond a disease-specific pathological threshold, leading to cell pathology. Several clinical and experimental findings provide support for this mechanism. First, it provides a simple explanation to the correlation between age of onset and number of inherited repeats uniformly for both polyglutamine and nonpolyglutamine diseases. In addition, the disease dynamics implied by our mechanism explains the exponential shape of the onset curves, the faster progression associated with juvenile onset, the correlation with the short allele only in the recessive disease FRDA, and the similar onset but faster progression for patients with HD with homozygous mutations. The commonly assumed mechanism of cumulative damage or slow aggregate formation does not seem to be able to explain most of these disease-related phenomena. Our mechanism does not contradict studies in mouse models, which are focused on understanding the pathology of the different diseases, showing that this pathology occurs only when the number of repeats is sufficiently long. Thus, it provides explanation to the large repeat number that is required for symptomatic mouse models. The universal mechanism suggested in this work may apply to many trinucleotide diseases. Nevertheless, it provides several predictions that may be subject to further experimental validation in a disease-specific context, possibly by the use of animal models. One challenge is to identify for each disease which group of cells triggers disease onset. Our mechanism predicts that the somatic expansion in this group of cells would be particularly high. Another prediction is that somatic repeat expansion is expected to progress with the age of an affected animal even prior to disease onset. Finally, the model predicts that the rate of repeat expansion increases with time, and that at any time is a function of the repeat length at that time. Newly available technologies that facilitate the amplification and measurement of the repeat length at a single-cell resolution may characterize and accurately measure the mutation progress rate for various cell populations in the affected organ of mouse models for various diseases. Our mechanism suggests that the disease gene is not toxic for many years and that the time to onset is counted by a silent expansion of the repeat with no physiological implication on the cell. This may have significant clinical implications on the effort to find therapies for these cureless inherited diseases. Rather than addressing direct causes of pathology such as polyglutamine aggregates, therapeutic effort may focus on delaying the onset by slowing the somatic expansion process, which is known to be mediated by DNA repair mechanisms[26, 28]. Our mechanism predicts that an ability to slow this expansion process may provide a common therapy to patients of most trinucleotide disease, as it addresses the universal component of the mechanism rather than the disease-specific component.","answer":"Trinucleotide diseases are a broad family of hereditary diseases characterized genetically by an expanded DNA region consisting of a repeated three-letter code .

Evoked hind limb digital extensor tension (hoof twitch) was maintained at 40% of baseline for 1 h by atracurium infusion in 7 horses anaesthetised with halothane. After 1 h, atracurium was discontinued and hoof twitch allowed to recover to 75%. Atracurium was again given by infusion to maintain 40% twitch for a second hour, then 2 mg gentamycin/kg bwt were given i.v. Atracurium infusion was continued for a third hour, and then hoof twitch was again allowed to recover spontaneously to 75%. Gentamycin reduced twitch strength from 40 +/- 1% (mean +/- sem) to 29 +/- 4% within 7.0 +/- 1.5 min (P = 0.02). Twitch gradually returned to pre-gentamycin strength over the course of the next hour. Recovery of hoof twitch from 50% to 75% took 7.7 +/- 0.7 min for atracurium alone and 11.5 +/- 2.7 min for atracurium plus gentamycin (P = 0.03). Recovery from 50% twitch to 75% fade recovery took 13.8 +/- 0.8 min for atracurium alone and 13.7 +/- 1.2 min for atracurium plus gentamycin. At 75% recovery of fade, hoof twitch was 87 +/- 3% for atracurium alone and 82 +/- 4% for atracurium plus gentamycin. Reversal of the block with edrophonium and subsequent recovery of the horses from anaesthesia were uneventful. It was concluded that, although gentamycin did augment the neuromuscular blockade of atracurium, the effect was minimal.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"edrophonium\\", \\"halothane\\", \\"Gentamycin\\", \\"gentamycin\\", \\"atracurium\\", \\"Atracurium\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Feature representations of the observed raw data play a crucial role in the success of machine learning algorithms.Effective representations should be able to capture the underlying (abstract or high-level) latent generative factors that are relevant for the end task while ignoring the inconsequential or nuisance factors.Disentangled feature representations have the property that the generative factors are revealed in disjoint subsets of the feature dimensions, such that a change in a single generative factor causes a highly sparse change in the representation.Disentangled representations offer several advantages -(i) Invariance: it is easier to derive representations that are invariant to nuisance factors by simply marginalizing over the corresponding dimensions, (ii) Transferability: they are arguably more suitable for transfer learning as most of the key underlying generative factors appear segregated along feature dimensions,(iii) Interpretability: a human expert may be able to assign meanings to the dimensions,(iv) Conditioning and intervention: they allow for interpretable conditioning and/or intervention over a subset of the latents and observe the effects on other nodes in the graph.Indeed, the importance of learning disentangled representations has been argued in several recent works BID5 BID37 BID50 .Recognizingthe significance of disentangled representations, several attempts have been made in this direction in the past BID50 . Much of theearlier work assumes some sort of supervision in terms of: (i) partialor full access to the generative factors per instance BID48 BID58 BID35 BID33 , (ii) knowledgeabout the nature of generative factors (e.g, translation, rotation, etc.) BID29 BID11 , (iii) knowledgeabout the changes in the generative factors across observations (e.g., sparse changes in consecutive frames of a Video) BID25 BID57 BID21 BID14 BID32 , (iv) knowledgeof a complementary signal to infer representations that are conditionally independent of it 1 BID10 BID41 BID53 . However, in mostreal scenarios, we only have access to raw observations without any supervision about the generative factors. It is a challengingproblem and many of the earlier attempts have not been able to scale well for realistic settings BID51 BID15 BID13 ) (see also, ).Recently, BID9 proposedan approach to learn a generative model with disentangled factors based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) BID24 , however implicit generative models like GANs lack an effective inference mechanism 2 , which hinders its applicability to the problem of learning disentangled representations. More recently, proposedan approach based on Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) BID34 for inferring disentangled factors. The inferred latents usingtheir method (termed as Î²-VAE ) are empirically shown to have better disentangling properties, however the method deviates from the basic principles of variational inference, creating increased tension between observed data likelihood and disentanglement. This in turn leads to poorquality of generated samples as observed in .In this work, we propose aprincipled approach for inference of disentangled latent factors based on the popular and scalable framework of amortized variational inference BID34 BID55 BID23 BID49 powered by stochastic optimization BID30 BID34 BID49 . Disentanglement is encouragedby introducing a regularizer over the induced inferred prior. Unlike Î²-VAE , our approach doesnot introduce any extra conflict between disentanglement of the latents and the observed data likelihood, which is reflected in the overall quality of the generated samples that matches the VAE and is much better than Î²-VAE. This does not come at the cost ofhigher entanglement and our approach also outperforms Î²-VAE in disentangling the latents as measured by various quantitative metrics. We also propose a new disentanglementmetric, called Separated Attribute Predictability or SAP, which is better aligned with the qualitative disentanglement observed in the decoder's output compared to the existing metrics.","answer":"We propose a variational inference based approach for encouraging the inference of disentangled latents.

The mechanisms underlying rapid information rerouting between such microcircuits are still unknown. It has been proposed that changing patterns of coherence between local gamma rhythms support flexible information rerouting. The stochastic and transient nature of gamma oscillations in vivo, however, is hard to reconcile with such a function. Here we show that models of cortical circuits near the onset of oscillatory synchrony selectively route input signals despite the short duration of gamma bursts and the irregularity of neuronal firing. In canonical multiarea circuits, we find that gamma bursts spontaneously arise with matched timing and frequency and that they organize information flow by large-scale routing states. Specific self-organized routing states can be induced by minor modulations of background activity.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"canonical multiarea circuits\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"local gamma rhythms\\", \\"cognition\\", \\"Perception\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"synchrony\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"cortical regions\\", \\"in vivo\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

In murine models of accelerated aging, genetic deficiency and targeted inhibition of PAI-1 protect against aging-like pathology and prolong life span. However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclearOur study indicates a causal effect of PAI-1 on human longevity, which may be mediated by alterations in metabolismPAI-1 4G/4G genotype appeared to be associated with lower non-cardiovascular mortality in men, but with greater cardiovascular mortality in women.However, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life. Homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its association with impaired fibrinolysis, is compatible with successful aging.","answer":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been shown to be a key component of the senescence-related secretome and a direct mediator of cellular senescence.

However, most entity recognition systems in the music domain have concentrated on formal texts (e.g. artists' biographies, encyclopedic articles, etc.), ignoring rich and noisy user-generated content. In this work, we present a novel method to recognize musical entities in Twitter content generated by users following a classical music radio channel. Our approach takes advantage of both formal radio schedule and users' tweets to improve entity recognition. We instantiate several machine learning algorithms to perform entity recognition combining task-specific and corpus-based features. We also show how to improve recognition results by jointly considering formal and user-generated contentRelated WorkNamed Entity Recognition (NER), or alternatively Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC), is the task of detecting entities in an input text and to assign them to a specific class. It starts to be defined in the early '80, and over the years several approaches have been proposed BIBREF2 . Early systems were based on handcrafted rule-based algorithms, while recently several contributions by Machine Learning scientists have helped in integrating probabilistic models into NER systems.In particular, new developments in neural architectures have become an important resource for this task. Their main advantages are that they do not need language-specific knowledge resources BIBREF3 , and they are robust to the noisy and short nature of social media messages BIBREF4 . Indeed, according to a performance analysis of several Named Entity Recognition and Linking systems presented in BIBREF5 , it has been found that poor capitalization is one of the main issues when dealing with microblog content. Apart from that, typographic errors and the ubiquitous occurrence of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words also cause drops in NER recall and precision, together with shortenings and slang, particularly pronounced in tweets.Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is an interdisciplinary field which borrows tools of several disciplines, such as signal processing, musicology, machine learning, psychology and many others, for extracting knowledge from musical objects (be them audio, texts, etc.) BIBREF6 . In the last decade, several MIR tasks have benefited from NLP, such as sound and music recommendation BIBREF7 , automatic summary of song review BIBREF8 , artist similarity BIBREF9 and genre classification BIBREF10 .In the field of IE, a first approach for detecting musical named entities from raw text, based on Hidden Markov Models, has been proposed in BIBREF11 . In BIBREF12 , the authors combine state-of-the-art Entity Linking (EL) systems to tackle the problem of detecting musical entities from raw texts. The method proposed relies on the argumentum ad populum intuition, so if two or more different EL systems perform the same prediction in linking a named entity mention, the more likely this prediction is to be correct. In detail, the off-the-shelf systems used are: DBpedia Spotlight BIBREF13 , TagMe BIBREF14 , Babelfy BIBREF15 . Moreover, a first Musical Entity Linking, MEL has been presented in BIBREF16 which combines different state-of-the-art NLP libraries and SimpleBrainz, an RDF knowledge base created from MusicBrainz after a simplification process.Furthermore, Twitter has also been at the center of many studies done by the MIR community. As example, for building a music recommender system BIBREF17 analyzes tweets containing keywords like nowplaying or listeningto. In BIBREF9 , a similar dataset it is used for discovering cultural listening patterns. Publicly available Twitter corpora built for MIR investigations have been created, among others the Million Musical Tweets dataset BIBREF18 and the #nowplaying dataset BIBREF19 .MethodologyWe propose a hybrid method which recognizes musical entities in UGC using both contextual and linguistic information. We focus on detecting two types of entities: Contributor: person who is related to a musical work (composer, performer, conductor, etc). Musical Work: musical composition or recording (symphony, concerto, overture, etc).As case study, we have chosen to analyze tweets extracted from the channel of a classical music radio, BBC Radio 3. The choice to focus on classical music has been mostly motivated by the particular discrepancy between the informal language used in the social platform and the formal nomenclature of contributors and musical works. Indeed, users when referring to a musician or to a classical piece in a tweet, rarely use the full name of the person or of the work, as shown in Table 2.We extract information from the radio schedule for recreating the musical context to analyze user-generated tweets, detecting when they are referring to a specific work or contributor recently played. We manage to associate to every track broadcasted a list of entities, thanks to the tweets automatically posted by the BBC Radio3 Music Bot, where it is described the track actually on air in the radio. In Table 3, examples of bot-generated tweets are shown.Afterwards, we detect the entities on the user-generated content by means of two methods: on one side, we use the entities extracted from the radio schedule for generating candidates entities in the user-generated tweets, thanks to a matching algorithm based on time proximity and string similarity. On the other side, we create a statistical model capable of detecting entities directly from the UGC, aimed to model the informal language of the raw texts. In Figure 1, an overview of the system proposed is presented.DatasetIn May 2018, we crawled Twitter using the Python library Tweepy, creating two datasets on which Contributor and Musical Work entities have been manually annotated, using IOB tags.The first set contains user-generated tweets related to the BBC Radio 3 channel. It represents the source of user-generated content on which we aim to predict the named entities. We create it filtering the messages containing hashtags related to BBC Radio 3, such as #BBCRadio3 or #BBCR3. We obtain a set of 2,225 unique user-generated tweets. The second set consists of the messages automatically generated by the BBC Radio 3 Music Bot. This set contains 5,093 automatically generated tweets, thanks to which we have recreated the schedule.In Table 4, the amount of tokens and relative entities annotated are reported for the two datasets. For evaluation purposes, both sets are split in a training part (80%) and two test sets (10% each one) randomly chosen. Within the user-generated corpora, entities annotated are only about 5% of the whole amount of tokens. In the case of the automatically generated tweets, the percentage is significantly greater and entities represent about the 50%.NER systemAccording to the literature reviewed, state-of-the-art NER systems proposed by the NLP community are not tailored to detect musical entities in user-generated content. Consequently, our first objective has been to understand how to adapt existing systems for achieving significant results in this task.In the following sections, we describe separately the features, the word embeddings and the models considered. All the resources used are publicy available.We define a set of features for characterizing the text at the token level. We mix standard linguistic features, such as Part-Of-Speech (POS) and chunk tag, together with several gazetteers specifically built for classical music, and a series of features representing tokens' left and right context. For extracting the POS and the chunk tag we use the Python library twitter_nlp, presented in BIBREF1 .In total, we define 26 features for describing each token: 1)POS tag; 2)Chunk tag; 3)Position of the token within the text, normalized between 0 and 1; 4)If the token starts with a capital letter; 5)If the token is a digit. Gazetteers: 6)Contributor first names; 7)Contributor last names; 8)Contributor types (\\"soprano\\", \\"violinist\\", etc.); 9)Classical work types (\\"symphony\\", \\"overture\\", etc.); 10)Musical instruments; 11)Opus forms (\\"op\\", \\"opus\\"); 12)Work number forms (\\"no\\", \\"number\\"); 13)Work keys (\\"C\\", \\"D\\", \\"E\\", \\"F\\" , \\"G\\" , \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"flat\\", \\"sharp\\"); 14)Work Modes (\\"major\\", \\"minor\\", \\"m\\"). Finally, we complete the tokens' description including as token's features the surface form, the POS and the chunk tag of the previous and the following two tokens (12 features).We consider two sets of GloVe word embeddings BIBREF20 for training the neural architecture, one pre-trained with 2B of tweets, publicy downloadable, one trained with a corpora of 300K tweets collected during the 2014-2017 BBC Proms Festivals and disjoint from the data used in our experiments.The first model considered for this task has been the John Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm for training a support vector classifier BIBREF21 , implemented in WEKA BIBREF22 . Indeed, in BIBREF23 results shown that SVM outperforms other machine learning models, such as Decision Trees and Naive Bayes, obtaining the best accuracy when detecting named entities from the user-generated tweets.However, recent advances in Deep Learning techniques have shown that the NER task can benefit from the use of neural architectures, such as biLSTM-networks BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . We use the implementation proposed in BIBREF24 for conducting three different experiments. In the first, we train the model using only the word embeddings as feature. In the second, together with the word embeddings we use the POS and chunk tag. In the third, all the features previously defined are included, in addition to the word embeddings. For every experiment, we use both the pre-trained embeddings and the ones that we created with our Twitter corpora. In section 4, results obtained from the several experiments are reported.Schedule matchingThe bot-generated tweets present a predefined structure and a formal language, which facilitates the entities detection. In this dataset, our goal is to assign to each track played on the radio, represented by a tweet, a list of entities extracted from the tweet raw text. For achieving that, we experiment with the algorithms and features presented previously, obtaining an high level of accuracy, as presented in section 4. The hypothesis considered is that when a radio listener posts a tweet, it is possible that she is referring to a track which has been played a relatively short time before. In this cases, we want to show that knowing the radio schedule can help improving the results when detecting entities.Once assigned a list of entities to each track, we perform two types of matching. Firstly, within the tracks we identify the ones which have been played in a fixed range of time (t) before and after the generation of the user's tweet. Using the resulting tracks, we create a list of candidates entities on which performing string similarity. The score of the matching based on string similarity is computed as the ratio of the number of tokens in common between an entity and the input tweet, and the total number of token of the entity: DISPLAYFORM0 In order to exclude trivial matches, tokens within a list of stop words are not considered while performing string matching. The final score is a weighted combination of the string matching score and the time proximity of the track, aimed to enhance matches from tracks played closer to the time when the user is posting the tweet.The performance of the algorithm depends, apart from the time proximity threshold t, also on other two thresholds related to the string matching, one for the Musical Work (w) and one for the Contributor (c) entities. It has been necessary for avoiding to include candidate entities matched against the schedule with a low score, often source of false positives or negatives. Consequently, as last step Contributor and Musical Work candidates entities with respectively a string matching score lower than c and w, are filtered out. In Figure 2, an example of Musical Work entity recognized in an user-generated tweet using the schedule information is presented.The entities recognized from the schedule matching are joined with the ones obtained directly from the statistical models. In the joined results, the criteria is to give priority to the entities recognized from the machine learning techniques. If they do not return any entities, the entities predicted by the schedule matching are considered. Our strategy is justified by the poorer results obtained by the NER based only on the schedule matching, compared to the other models used in the experiments, to be presented in the next section.ResultsThe performances of the NER experiments are reported separately for three different parts of the system proposed.Table 6 presents the comparison of the various methods while performing NER on the bot-generated corpora and the user-generated corpora. Results shown that, in the first case, in the training set the F1 score is always greater than 97%, with a maximum of 99.65%. With both test sets performances decrease, varying between 94-97%. In the case of UGC, comparing the F1 score we can observe how performances significantly decrease. It can be considered a natural consequence of the complex nature of the users' informal language in comparison to the structured message created by the bot.In Table 7, results of the schedule matching are reported. We can observe how the quality of the linking performed by the algorithm is correlated to the choice of the three thresholds. Indeed, the Precision score increase when the time threshold decrease, admitting less candidates as entities during the matching, and when the string similarity thresholds increase, accepting only candidates with an higher degree of similarity. The behaviour of the Recall score is inverted.Finally, we test the impact of using the schedule matching together with a biLSTM-CRF network. In this experiment, we consider the network trained using all the features proposed, and the embeddings not pre-trained. Table 8 reports the results obtained. We can observe how generally the system benefits from the use of the schedule information. Especially in the testing part, where the neural network recognizes with less accuracy, the explicit information contained in the schedule can be exploited for identifying the entities at which users are referring while listening to the radio and posting the tweets.Table 2.

Many newly reported cases of COVID-19 during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose different risks to community spread. We have developed an \\"easy-to-use\\" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the cumulative number of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproduction number R0 = 2.92 and incubation period tau = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through an intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and global spread of COVID-19 in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Here, we address this question in the context of action selection. We focused on activity in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus( PPTg), a mesencephalic region that provides input to several nuclei in the action selection network, in well-trained mice selecting actions based on sensory cues and recent trial history. We found that, at the time of action selection, the activity of many PPTg neurons reflected the action on the previous trial and its outcome, and the strength of this activity predicted the upcoming choice. Further, inactivating the PPTg predictably decreased the influence of recent experience on action selection. These findings suggest that PPTg input to downstream motor regions, where it can be integrated with other relevant information, provides a simple mechanism for incorporating recent experience into the computations underlying action selection.Introduction:Selecting actions in a dynamic environment should take into account both sensory input and internally-generated estimates of action value. Integrating these sources of information is well-described by a Bayesian framework in which estimates of action value are continually updated by incoming sensory information in order to select the most valuable action( KÃ¶rding and Wolpert, 2006; Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Kim and Basso, 2010). This updating of action values, based on experiencing the outcomes associated with past actions, is thought to be mediated primarily by striatal circuits( Lau and Glimcher, 2007, 2008; Histed et al., 2009; Tai et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). These action values can be maintained in striatal activity and ultimately used to bias activity in downstream motor centers such that the most valuable actions are more likely to be selected( Hikosaka et al., 2006, 2014). This system is capable of flexibly encoding action value estimates in arbitrarily complex and dynamic contexts over a range of time-scales. However, in environments in which only the recent past is relevant to action value, which is often the case in the real world, a simpler complementary mechanism would be to maintain short-term representations of the most recent actions and their outcomes that directly modulate the action selection process. We studied this possibility by examining behavior and neural activity in well-trained mice performing a task requiring them to select an action based on the dominant component of an odor mixture( Uchida and Mainen, 2003). We have previously shown that the superior colliculus( SC) plays a critical role in selecting the action â a leftward or rightward orienting movement â required by this task( Felsen and Mainen, 2008, 2012; Stubblefield et al., 2013), consistent with its role in selecting orienting movements in other species( Glimcher and Sparks, 1992; Horwitz and Newsome, 2001; Bergeron et al., 2003; Krauzlis et al., 2004; Song et al., 2011; Wolf et al., 2015). In this study, we asked whether the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus( PPTg), a mesencephalic sensorimotor hub that provides direct input to the SC( Graybiel, 1978; Beninato and Spencer, 1986; Stubblefield et al., 2015), encodes information about recent actions and their outcomes by recording from individual neurons in behaving mice. While numerous regions provide input to the SC( Sparks and Hartwich-Young, 1989), many of which may modulate its processing underlying action selection( Wolf et al., 2015), the PPTg holds particular interest because it is engaged by sensorimotor tasks across species( Matsumura et al., 1997; Dormont et al., 1998; Kobayashi and Isa, 2002; Kobayashi et al., 2002; Okada and Kobayashi, 2009; Norton et al., 2011; Thompson and Felsen, 2013; Lau et al., 2015). We found that actions in this task are influenced by actions and outcomes in the recent past. Further, at the time of action selection and even throughout much of the trial, most PPTg neurons represented the choice( left or right movement), outcome( rewarded or non-rewarded), or both, on the previous trial. Furthermore, we found that these representations influenced action selection: the probability of particular upcoming choices was predictably related to the firing rates of neurons selective for choice on the previous trial, and pharmacological inactivation of the PPTg causally affected behavior, in part by decreasing the influence of recent choices on upcoming choices. Our results suggest a novel mechanism, subserved by the PPTg, for efficiently modulating action selection based on the recent history of actions and their outcomes.Discussion:This study examined the neural basis by which action selection is influenced by recent experience. We first found that behavior in a stimulus-cued spatial-choice task can be accounted for by a Bayesian framework( among others) in which choices are influenced by both recent trial history and the sensory stimulus( Figure 1), consistent with previous studies( Gold et al., 2008; Busse et al., 2011; Akaishi et al., 2014). We then found that activity of a subpopulation of PPTg neurons reflects choices and outcomes in the recent past( Figures 2 and 3) and correlated with upcoming choice( Figure 4), suggesting a role in mediating the influence of recent experience on behavior. Furthermore, inactivating PPTg decreased the influence of recent experience on behavior( Figure 5C). Together, our results demonstrate that the PPTg encodes representations of recent experience that can contribute to action selection. Below, we consider our findings in light of the evolving view of the role of the PPTg within the interconnected network of brain regions involved in integrating priors with sensory evidence in order to select and control motor output( Mena-Segovia et al., 2004; Gold and Shadlen, 2007). The motor-related role of the PPTg has traditionally been considered in the context of central pattern generation( Garcia-Rill, 1991). More recent studies in behaving animals have found that PPTg activity encodes specific actions and reflects their outcomes( Matsumura et al., 1997; Dormont et al., 1998; Okada and Kobayashi, 2009; Norton et al., 2011; Maclaren et al., 2013; Thompson and Felsen, 2013) and have suggested that the PPTg may be involved in attention and other cognitive processes( Steckler et al., 1994; Winn, 2008). The results described here are consistent with these findings and suggest that PPTg output may play a role in providing information about recent actions and their outcomes that can be used to guide the selection of actions mediated by downstream motor circuits. However, downstream circuits do not necessarily utilize this information, given that it is represented in PPTg activity even in mice that do not exhibit a behavioral dependence on previous choice( Figure 1D). To where might PPTg representations of recent experience be conveyed in order to modulate action selection? While the PPTg projects to several motor-related regions including other brainstem nuclei and the striatum( Beninato and Spencer, 1987; Inglis and Winn, 1995), and the current study cannot rule out the involvement of these regions, an attractive candidate is the SC. Cholinergic PPTg neurons project to and excite neurons in the SC responsible for motor output( Beninato and Spencer, 1986; Sooksawate et al., 2008; Stubblefield et al., 2015), and nicotinic signaling in the SC has been shown to modulate orienting behavior( Weldon et al., 1983; Aizawa et al., 1999; Watanabe et al., 2005). The SC is thought to integrate a wide range of inputs in order to select orienting actions( Kobayashi and Isa, 2002; Krauzlis et al., 2004; Grossberg et al., 2015; Wolf et al., 2015) and is thus well-positioned to combine â possibly additively â incoming sensory information with prior representations of action value( provided before, during, or even after the onset of sensory input; Figure 3B, C) in order to select the most valuable action( Trappenberg et al., 2001; Dorris et al., 2007; Kim and Basso, 2010). Our results suggest that the source of these prior representations may be the PPTg, which could complement other SC inputs â such as inhibition from the basal ganglia( Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983; Chevalier et al., 1985) â in biasing action selection by modulating SC processing according to recently-experienced action-value associations( Kobayashi and Isa, 2002; Hikosaka et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2015). While we have found it useful to think of the input from the PPTg to the SC as representing priors, in a Bayesian sense, accepting this framework â which may be imperfect given that choices in our task should not depend on previous trials â is not necessary for interpreting our results. Given the importance of trial history for action selection, it is not surprising that representations of trial history similar to that shown here have been observed in several brain areas, including the striatum( Lau and Glimcher, 2007, 2008; Histed et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2013), prefrontal cortex( Histed et al., 2009) and premotor cortex( Marcos et al., 2013). Activity in these regions typically reflects information from several previous trials, while PPTg activity was primarily associated with the immediately preceding trial( Figure 2). While this difference may be due to different task demands( recall that tracking past trials conferred no behavioral benefit in our task), the representations in the PPTg that we observed suggest a complementary mechanism to the more computationallyÂ expensive processing in these other regions for integrating internal representations of experience with sensory evidence: Specifically, that PPTg directly influences the circuits underlying action selection based on recent experience, which may be well-suited to the relevant dynamics of some real-world situations. Future studies can expand upon our findings by recording from specific types of neurons( e. g., cholinergic) in the PPTg( Lima et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 2012; Roseberry et al., 2016), as well as by examining how associations between stimuli and reward location are initially learned, in order to further elucidate the function of the PPTg in selecting actions.","answer":"The decisions we make are influenced by recent experience , yet it is not known how this experience is represented in the brain . For decisions about when , where and how to move , researchers have hypothesized that recent experience might influence activity in a region of the brainstem â the central trunk of the brain â that is known to be involved in movement . When deciding when , where and how to move , several areas of the brain are involved in selecting the optimal action . Recent studies suggest that groups of neurons known as locomotor brainstem nuclei may also contribute to making decisions about movements . Thompson et al . investigated whether a brainstem locomotor area called the pedunculopontine tegmental ( PPTg ) nucleus in mice might contribute to decision making rather than just conveying the selected response . The mice were trained to recognize particular odors and move to either the left or right to collect a food reward . While the mice were selecting an action , the activity of neurons in the PPTg nucleus reflected the action they had chosen on a previous experience and the outcome of that choice ( i . e . whether they received a reward ) . These representations of past experiences influenced the upcoming decision the mice were about to take . The findings of Thompson et al . suggest that the PPTg nucleus might play a critical role in the process of selecting the optimal action . Future work will examine what kinds of information about the environment or recent experience have the biggest effect on the activity of this region ."},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

As at 21 February, nine European countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42 years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clustersâ index cases delayed isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases. Text: In the WHO European Region, COVID-19 surveillance was implemented 27 January 2020. We detail the first European cases. As at 21 February, nine European countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42 years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clusters' index cases delayed isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases. A cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] . On 12 January 2020, Chinese authorities shared the sequence of a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from some clustered cases [2] . Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) . As at 21 February 2020, the virus had spread rapidly mostly within China but also to 28 other countries, including in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [3] [4] [5] . Here we describe the epidemiology of the first cases of COVID-19 in this region, excluding cases reported in the United Kingdom (UK), as at 21 February 2020. The study includes a comparison between cases detected among travellers from China and cases whose infection was acquired due to subsequent local transmission. On 27 January 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe asked countries to complete a WHO standard COVID-19 case report form for all confirmed and probable cases according to WHO criteria [6] [7] [8] . The overall aim of surveillance at this time was to support the global strategy of containment of COVID-19 with rapid identification and follow-up of cases linked to affected countries in order to minimise onward transmission. The surveillance objectives were to: describe the key epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected in Europe; inform country preparedness; and improve further case detection and management. Data collected included demographics, history of recent travel to affected areas, close contact with a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, underlying conditions, signs and symptoms of disease at onset, type of specimens from which the virus was detected, and clinical outcome. The WHO case definition was adopted for surveillance: a confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ECDC recommended two separate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests), irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive or positive using a pan-coronavirus assay [8] . By 31 January 2020, 47 laboratories in 31 countries, including 38 laboratories in 24 European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, had diagnostic capability for SARS-CoV-2 available (close to 60% of countries in the WHO European Region), with cross-border shipment arrangements in place for many of those lacking domestic testing capacity. The remaining six EU/EEA countries were expected to have diagnostic testing available by mid-February [9] . As at 09:00 on 21 February 2020, 47 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in the WHO European Region and one of these cases had died [4] . Data on 38 of these cases (i.e. all except the nine reported in the UK) are included in this analysis. The first three cases detected were reported in France on 24 January 2020 and had onset of symptoms on 17, 19 and 23 January respectively [10] . The first death was reported on 15 February in France. As at 21 February, nine countries had reported cases ( Figure) : Belgium (1), Finland (1), France (12), Germany (16), Italy (3), Russia (2), Spain (2), Sweden (1) and the UK (9 -not included further). The place of infection (assessed at national level based on an incubation period presumed to be up to 14 days [ 11] , travel history and contact with probable or confirmed cases as per the case definition) was reported for 35 cases (missing for three cases), of whom 14 were infected in China (Hubei province: 10 cases; Shandong province: one case; province not reported for three cases). The remaining 21 cases were infected in Europe. Of these, 14 were linked to a cluster in Bavaria, Germany, and seven to a cluster in Haute-Savoie, France [12, 13] . Cases from the Bavarian cluster were reported from Germany and Spain, whereas cases from the Haute-Savoie cluster were reported from France All but two cases were hospitalised (35 of 37 where information on hospitalisation was reported), although it is likely that most were hospitalised to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease. The time from onset of symptoms to hospitalisation (and isolation) ranged between 0 and 10 days with a mean of 3.7 days (reported for 29 cases). The mean number of days to hospitalisation was 2.5 days for cases imported from China, but 4.6 days for those infected in Europe. This was mostly a result of delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany. In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six took only a mean of 2 days to be hospitalised. Symptoms at the point of diagnosis were reported for 31 cases. Two cases were asymptomatic and remained so until tested negative. The asymptomatic cases were tested as part of screening following repatriation and during contact tracing respectively. Of the remaining 29, 20 reported fever, 14 reported cough and eight reported weakness. Additional symptoms reported included headaches (6 cases), sore throat (2), rhinorrhoea (2), shortness of breath (2), myalgia (1), diarrhoea (1) and nausea (1). Fever was reported as the sole symptom for nine cases. In 16 of 29 symptomatic cases, the symptoms at diagnosis were consistent with the case definition for acute respiratory infection [16] , although it is possible that cases presented additional symptoms after diagnosis and these were not reported. Data on pre-existing conditions were reported for seven cases; five had no pre-existing conditions while one was reported to be obese and one had pre-existing cardiac disease. No data on clinical signs e.g. dyspnea etc. were reported for any of the 38 cases. All hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four, two reported in Italy and two reported in France, all of whom developed viral pneumonia. All three cases who were aged 65 years or over were admitted to intensive care and required respiratory support and one French case died. The case who died was hospitalised for 21 days and required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 19 days. The duration of hospitalisation was reported for 16 cases with a median of 13 days (range: 8-23 days). As at 21 February 2020, four cases were still hospitalised. All cases were confirmed according to specific assays targeting at least two separate genes (envelope (E) gene as a screening test and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or nucleoprotein (N) gene for confirmation) [8, 17] . The specimen types tested were reported for 27 cases: 15 had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, nine had positive throat swabs, three cases had positive sputum, two had a positive nasal swab, one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and one a positive endotracheal aspirate. As at 09:00 on 21 February, few COVID-19 cases had been detected in Europe compared with Asia. However the situation is rapidly developing, with a large outbreak recently identified in northern Italy, with transmission in several municipalities and at least two deaths [18] . As at 5 March 2020, there are 4,250 cases including 113 deaths reported among 38 countries in the WHO European region [19] . In our analysis of early cases, we observed transmission in two broad contexts: sporadic cases among travellers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases). Our analysis shows that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases. People returning from affected areas are likely to have a low threshold to seek care and be tested when symptomatic, however delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany meant that locally acquired cases took longer to be detected and isolated. Once the exposure is determined and contacts identified and quarantined (171 contacts in France and 200 in Germany for the clusters in Haute-Savoie and Bavaria, respectively), further cases are likely to be rapidly detected and isolated when they develop symptoms [15, 20] . In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six were hospitalised after a mean of 2 days. Locally acquired cases require significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission's European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection. All of the imported cases had a history of travel to China. This was consistent with the epidemiological situation in Asia, and supported the recommendation for testing of suspected cases with travel history to China and potentially other areas of presumed ongoing community transmission. The situation has evolved rapidly since then, however, and the number of countries reporting COVID-19 transmission increased rapidly, notably with a large outbreak in northern Italy with 3,089 cases reported as at 5 March [18, 19] . Testing of suspected cases based on geographical risk of importation needs to be complemented with additional approaches to ensure early detection of local circulation of COVID-19, including through testing of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals irrespectively of travel history as recommended in the WHO case definition updated on 27 February 2020 [21] . The clinical presentation observed in the cases in Europe is that of an acute respiratory infection. However, of the 31 cases with information on symptoms, 20 cases presented with fever and nine cases presented only with fever and no other symptoms. These findings, which are consistent with other published case series, have prompted ECDC to include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition. Three cases were aged 65 years or over. All required admission to intensive care and were tourists (imported cases). These findings could reflect the average older age of the tourist population compared with the local contacts exposed to infection in Europe and do not allow us to draw any conclusion on the proportion of severe cases that we could expect in the general population of Europe. Despite this, the finding of older individuals being at higher risk of a severe clinical course is consistent with the evidence from Chinese case series published so far although the majority of infections in China have been mild [22, 23] . This preliminary analysis is based on the first reported cases of COVID-19 cases in the WHO European Region. Given the small sample size, and limited completeness for some variables, all the results presented should be interpreted with caution. With increasing numbers of cases in Europe, data from surveillance and investigations in the region can build on the evidence from countries in Asia experiencing more widespread transmission particularly on disease spectrum and the proportion of infections with severe outcome [22] . Understanding the infection-severity is critical to help plan for the impact on the healthcare system and the wider population. Serological studies are vital to understand the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic. Hospital-based surveillance could help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death. Established hospital surveillance systems that are in place for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded for this purpose. In addition, a number of countries in Europe are adapting and, in some cases, already using existing sentinel primary care based surveillance systems for influenza to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This approach will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity of disease transmission, trends and its geographical spread. Additional research is needed to complement surveillance data to build knowledge on the infectious period, modes of transmission, basic and effective reproduction numbers, and effectiveness of prevention and case management options also in settings outside of China. Such special studies are being conducted globally, including a cohort study on citizens repatriated from China to Europe, with the aim to extrapolate disease incidence and risk factors for infection in areas with community transmission. Countries together with ECDC and WHO, should use all opportunities to address these questions in a coordinated fashion at the European and global level. provided input to the outline, multiple versions of the manuscript and gave approval to the final draft.Question: What is the presumed incubation period?","answer":"up to 14 days ["},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

However, it poorly captures the both temporal and structural nature of interactions, that calls for a dedicated formalism. In this paper, we generalize graph concepts in order to cope with both aspects in a consistent way. We start with elementary concepts like density, clusters, or paths, and derive from them more advanced concepts like cliques, degrees, clustering coefficients, or connected components. We obtain a language to directly deal with interactions over time, similar to the language provided by graphs to deal with relations. This formalism is self-consistent: usual relations between different concepts are preserved. It is also consistent with graph theory: graph concepts are special cases of the ones we introduce. This makes it easy to generalize higher-level objects such as quotient graphs, line graphs, k-cores, and centralities. This paper also considers discrete versus continuous time assumptions, instantaneous links, and extensions to more complex cases.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Graph-based models form a fundamental aspect of data representation in Data Sciences and play a key role in modeling complex networked systems. In particular, recently there is an ever-increasing interest in modeling dynamic complex networks, i.e. networks in which the topological structure (nodes and edges) may vary over time. In this context, we propose a novel model for representing finite discrete Time-Varying Graphs (TVGs), which are typically used to model dynamic complex networked systems. We analyze the data structures built from our proposed model and demonstrate that, for most practical cases, the asymptotic memory complexity of our model is in the order of the cardinality of the set of edges. Further, we show that our proposal is an unifying model that can represent several previous (classes of) models for dynamic networks found in the recent literature, which in general are unable to represent each other. In contrast to previous models, our proposal is also able to intrinsically model cyclic (i.e. periodic) behavior in dynamic networks. These representation capabilities attest the expressive power of our proposed unifying model for TVGs. We thus believe our unifying model for TVGs is a step forward in the theoretical foundations for data analysis of complex networked systems.[2]: Structure of real networked systems, such as social relationship, can be modeled as temporal networks in which each edge appears only at the prescribed time. Understanding the structure of temporal networks requires quantifying the importance of a temporal vertex, which is a pair of vertex index and time. In this paper, we define two centrality measures of a temporal vertex based on the fastest temporal paths which use the temporal vertex. The definition is free from parameters and robust against the change in time scale on which we focus. In addition, we can efficiently compute these centrality values for all temporal vertices. Using the two centrality measures, we reveal that distributions of these centrality values of real-world temporal networks are heterogeneous. For various datasets, we also demonstrate that a majority of the highly central temporal vertices are located within a narrow time window around a particular time. In other words, there is a bottleneck time at which most information sent in the temporal network passes through a small number of temporal vertices, which suggests an important role of these temporal vertices in spreading phenomena.[3]: [4]: Real complex systems are inherently time-varying. Thanks to new communication systems and novel technologies, today it is possible to produce and analyze social and biological networks with detailed information on the time of occurrence and duration of each link. However, standard graph metrics introduced so far in complex network theory are mainly suited for static graphs, i.e., graphs in which the links do not change over time, or graphs built from time-varying systems by aggregating all the links as if they were concurrent in time. In this paper, we extend the notion of connectedness, and the definitions of node and graph components, to the case of time-varying graphs, which are represented as time-ordered sequences of graphs defined over a fixed set of nodes. We show that the problem of finding strongly connected components in a time-varying graph can be mapped into the problem of discovering the maximal-cliques in an opportunely constructed static graph, which we name the affine graph. It is, therefore, an NP-complete problem. As a practical example, we have performed a temporal component analysis of time-varying graphs constructed from three data sets of human interactions. The results show that taking time into account in the definition of graph components allows to capture important features of real systems. In particular, we observe a large variability in the size of node temporal in- and out-components. This is due to intrinsic fluctuations in the activity patterns of individuals, which cannot be detected by static graph analysis.[5]: A is, informally speaking, a graph that changes with time. When time is discrete and only the relationships between the participating entities may change and not the entities themselves, a temporal graph may be viewed as a sequence @math of static graphs over the same (static) set of nodes @math . Though static graphs have been extensively studied, for their temporal generalization we are still far from having a concrete set of structural and algorithmic principles. Recent research shows that many graph properties and problems become radically different and usually substantially more difficult when an extra time dimension in added to them. Moreover, there is already a rich and rapidly growing set of modern systems and applications that can be naturally modeled and studied via temporal graphs. This, further motivates the need for the development of a temporal extension of graph theory. We survey here recent results on temporal graphs and temporal graph problems that have appeared in the Computer Science community.[6]: While a natural fit for modeling and understanding mobile networks, time-varying graphs remain poorly understood. Indeed, many of the usual concepts of static graphs have no obvious counterpart in time-varying ones. In this paper, we introduce the notion of temporal reachability graphs. A (tau,delta)-reachability graph is a time-varying directed graph derived from an existing connectivity graph. An edge exists from one node to another in the reachability graph at time t if there exists a journey (i.e., a spatiotemporal path) in the connectivity graph from the first node to the second, leaving after t, with a positive edge traversal time tau, and arriving within a maximum delay delta. We make three contributions. First, we develop the theoretical framework around temporal reachability graphs. Second, we harness our theoretical findings to propose an algorithm for their efficient computation. Finally, we demonstrate the analytic power of the temporal reachability graph concept by applying it to synthetic and real-life datasets. On top of defining clear upper bounds on communication capabilities, reachability graphs highlight asymmetric communication opportunities and offloading potential.[7]: In a temporal network, the presence and activity of nodes and links can change through time. To describe temporal networks we introduce the notion of temporal quantities. We define the addition and multiplication of temporal quantities in a way that can be used for the definition of addition and multiplication of temporal networks. The corresponding algebraic structures are semirings. The usual approach to (data) analysis of temporal networks is to transform the network into a sequence of time slicesâstatic networks corresponding to selected time intervals and analyze each of them using standard methods to produce a sequence of results. The approach proposed in this paper enables us to compute these results directly. We developed fast algorithms for the proposed operations. They are available as an open source Python library TQ (Temporal Quantities) and a program Ianus. The proposed approach enables us to treat as temporal quantities also other network characteristics such as degrees, connectivity components, centrality measures, Pathfinder skeleton, etc. To illustrate the developed tools we present some results from the analysis of Franzosiâs violence network and Cormanâs Reuters terror news network.[8]: [9]:","answer":"To avoid these issues, several authors propose to encode the full information into various kinds of augmented graphs. In [8] [7] [9] for instance, authors consider the graph of all nodes and links occurring within the data, and label each node and link with its presence times. In [1] [3] [5] [2] , the authors duplicate each node into as many copies as its number of occurrences (they assume discrete time steps); then, an interaction between two nodes at a given time is encoded by a link between the copies of these nodes at this time, and each copy of a node is connected to its copy at the next time step. In [6] [4] and others, the authors build reachability graphs: two nodes are linked together if they can reach each other in the stream. With such encodings, some key properties of the stream are equivalent to properties of the obtained graph, and so studying this graph sheds light on the original data. However, concepts like density or clusters make little sense on such objects, and authors then resort to the time slicing approach [9] ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The effects of epinephrine-free and epinephrine-containing local anesthetic solutions on plasma potassium and blood glucose concentrations were investigated in 20 patients undergoing oral surgery with intravenous midazolam sedation . Ten patients were randomly assigned to receive 4.4 mL of 2 % lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine as a local anesthetic and 10 were given 4.4 mL of 3 % prilocaine with 0.03 IU/mL felypressin . There were significant changes from baseline potassium and glucose concentrations both within and between treatments in the early postinjection period . The epinephrine-containing local anesthetic significantly reduced the plasma potassium concentration 10 min after injection , by 0.16 +/- 0.20 mmol/L ( mean +/- SD ) , and increased the blood glucose concentration at 10 , 20 , and 30 min ( by 0.46 +/- 0.37 , 0.63 +/- 0.45 , and 0.56 +/- 0.28 mmol/L , respectively ) . Conversely , plasma potassium increased and blood glucose decreased 10 , 20 , and 30 min following the administration of the epinephrine-free solution . At 30 min potassium was increased by 0.24 +/- 0.16 mmol/L , and glucose was decreased by 0.23 +/- 0.16 mmol/L .

One of these, social (S) motility is powered by the extension and retraction of type IV pili and requires the presence of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by neighboring cells. As a result, S motility requires close cell-to-cell proximity and isolated cells do not translocate. Previous studies measuring S motility by observing the colony expansion of cells deposited on agar have shown that the expansion rate increases with initial cell density, but the biophysical mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. To understand the dynamics of S motility -driven colony expansion, we developed a reaction - diffusion model describing the effects of cell density, EPS deposition and nutrient exposure on the expansion rate. Our results show that at steady state the population expands as a traveling wave with a speed determined by the interplay of cell motility and growth, a well-known characteristic of Fisher's equation. The model explains the density - dependence of the colony expansion by demonstrating the presence of a lag phase -a transient period of very slow expansion with a duration dependent on the initial cell density. We propose that at a low initial density, more time is required for the cells to accumulate enough EPS to activate S-motility resulting in a longer lag period. Furthermore, our model makes the novel prediction that following the lag phase the population expands at a constant rate independent of the cell density. These predictions were confirmed by S motility experiments capturing long-term expansion dynamics.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"cell-to-cell\\", \\"colony\\", \\"Cells\\", \\"Colony\\", \\"cells\\", \\"type IV pili\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"bacteria\\", \\"Myxococcus xanthus\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"To understand\\", \\"social (S) motility\\", \\"Motility\\", \\"multicellular behavior\\", \\"motility\\", \\"S motility\\", \\"translocate\\", \\"cell motility\\", \\"Socially Motile\\", \\"Growth\\", \\"expansion\\", \\"S-motility\\", \\"Expansion\\", \\"growth\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"biophysical\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"agar\\", \\"duration\\", \\"EPS\\", \\"Exopolysaccharide\\", \\"exopolysaccharides\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"accumulate\\", \\"retraction\\", \\"very slow\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"Fisheru0027s equation\\", \\"model\\", \\"Previous studies\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"population\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"studies\\", \\"experiments\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"neighboring\\", \\"expands\\", \\"surfaces\\", \\"proximity\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

And we have totally tested it, trust us! We have results, and numbers, really big numbers. The best numbers ever! Oh, and analysis, absolutely top notch analysis. Interested? Come read the shocking truth about fake news and click-bait in the Bulgarian cyber space. You won't believe what we have found!IntroductionFake news are written and published with the intent to mislead in order to gain financially or politically, often targeting specific user groups. Another type of harmful content on the Internet are the so-called click-baits, which are distinguished by their sensational, exaggerated, or deliberately false headlines that grab attention and deceive the user into clicking an article with questionable content.While the motives behind these two types of fake news are different, they constitute a growing problem as they constitute a sizable fraction of the online news that users encounter on a daily basis. With the recent boom of Internet, mobile, and social networks, the spread of fake news increases exponentially. Using on-line methods for spreading harmful content makes the task of keeping the Internet clean significantly harder as it is very easy to publish an article and there is no easy way to verify its veracity. Currently, domains that consistently spread misinformation are being banned from various platforms, but this is a rather inefficient way to deal with fake news as websites that specialize in spreading misinformation are reappearing with different domain names. That is why our method is based purely on text analysis, without taking into account the domain name or website's reliability as a source of information. Our work is focused on exploring various stylistic and lexical features in order to detect misleading content, and on experiments with neural network architectures in order to evaluate how deep learning can be used for detecting fake news. Moreover, we created various language-specific resources that could be used in future work on fake news and clickbait detection for Bulgarian, including task-specific word embeddings and various lexicons and dictionaries extracted from the training data.Related WorkTrustworthiness and veracity analytics of on-line statements is an emerging research direction BIBREF0 . This includes predicting credibility of information shared in social media BIBREF1 , stance classification BIBREF2 and contradiction detection in rumours BIBREF3 . For example, Castillo:2011:ICT:1963405.1963500 studied the problem of finding false information about a newsworthy event. They compiled their own dataset, focusing on tweets using a variety of features including user reputation, author writing style, and various time-based features. Canini:2011 analysed the interaction of content and social network structure, and Morris:2012:TBU:2145204.2145274 studied how Twitter users judge truthfulness. They found that this is hard to do based on content alone, and instead users are influenced by heuristics such as user name.Rumour detection in social media represents yet another angle of information credibility. zubiaga2015analysing studied how people handle rumours in social media. They found that users with higher reputation are more trusted, and thus can spread rumours among other users without raising suspicions about the credibility of the news or of its source. lukasik-cohn-bontcheva:2015:ACL-IJCNLP and Ma:2015:DRU used temporal patterns to detect rumours and to predict their frequency, PlosONE:2016 focused on conversational threads, and RANLP2017:factchecking:external used deep learning to verify claims using the Web as a corpus.Veracity of information has been also studied in the context of online personal blogs BIBREF4 , community question answering forums BIBREF5 , and political debates BIBREF6 .Astroturfing and misinformation detection represent another relevant research direction. Their importance is motivated by the strong interest from political science, and research methods are driven by the presence of massive streams of micro-blogging data, e.g., on Twitter BIBREF7 . While astroturfing has been primarily studied in microblogs such as Twitter, here we focus on on-line news and click-baits instead.Identification of malicious accounts in social networks is another related research direction. This includes detecting spam accounts BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , fake accounts BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , compromised accounts and phishing accounts BIBREF12 . Fake profile detection has also been studied in the context of cyber-bullying BIBREF13 . A related problem is that of Web spam detection, which was addressed as a text classification problem BIBREF14 , e.g., using spam keyword spotting BIBREF15 , lexical affinity of arbitrary words to spam content BIBREF16 , frequency of punctuation and word co-occurrence BIBREF17 .Fake news detection is most closely related to the present work. While social media have been seen for years as the main vehicle for spreading information of questionable veracity, recently there has been a proliferation of fake news, often spread on social media, but also published in specialized websites. This has attracted research attention recently. For example, there has been work on studying credibility, trust, and expertise in news communities BIBREF18 . The credibility of the information published in on-line news portals has been questioned by a number of researchers BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 . As timing is crucial when it comes to publishing breaking news, it is simply not possible to double-check the facts and the sources, as is usually standard in respectable printed newspapers and magazines. This is one of the biggest concerns about on-line news media that journalists have BIBREF22 . Finally, conroy2015automatic review various methods for detecting fake news, e.g., using linguistic analysis, discourse, linked data, and social network features.All the above work was for English. The only work on fact checking for Bulgarian is that of BIBREF23 , but they focused on distinguishing serious news from humorous ones. In contrast, here we are interested in finding news that are not designed to sound funny, but to make the reader believe they are real. Unlike them, we use a deep learning approach.MethodWe propose a general framework for finding fake news focusing on the text only. We first create some resources, e.g., dictionaries of words strongly correlated with fake news, which are needed for feature extraction. Then, we design features that model a number of interesting aspects about an article, e.g., style, intent, etc. Moreover, we use a deep neural network to learn task-specific representations of the articles, which includes an attention mechanism that can focus on the most discriminative sentences and words.Some Features that we IgnoredAs we mentioned above, our method is purely text-based. Thus, we ignored the publishing date of the article. In future work, it could be explored as a useful piece of information about the credibility of the article, as there is interesting research in this direction BIBREF24 . We also disregarded the article source (the URL) because websites that specialize in producing and distributing fake content are often banned and then later reappear under another name. We recognize that the credibility of a specific website could be a very informative feature, but, for the sake of creating a robust method for fake news detection, our system relies only on the text when predicting whether the target article is likely to be fake. We describe our features in more detail below.ModelOur framework for fake news detection is comprised of two components, which are used one after the other. First, we have an attention-based deep neural network model, which focuses on the segments of the text that are most indicative of the target class identification, and as a side effect learns task-specific representations of the news articles. We extract these representations from the last hidden layer in the network, and we feed it to the SVM classifier together with the hand-crafted features.The attention network BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 is a powerful mechanism, inspired by the human ability to spot important sections in images or text. We adopt the approach used in BIBREF33 and employ an attention neural networks to build attention over the text of a piece of news with respect to the title it has. As far as it is in the nature of click-baits to have titles that are different from the text of the news, the attentional layers of the neural network should spot when the two texts talk about the same thing and when they are not corresponding or accurate. We implemented the attention mechanism using Keras BIBREF34 with the Tensorflow back-end BIBREF35 .The architecture of the network with attention layers is shown in Figure FIGREF16 . Our neural model is based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). GRUs are gating mechanism in RNNs which provide the ability to learn long-term dependencies and were first introduced in BIBREF36 . Given the document embedding, the GRUs build representations using input and forget gates, which help storing the valuable information through time. They build embeddings of the title and the text of the news, where at each step the unit has information only about the output from the previous step. This can be considered as a drawback, as far as we would considerably benefit if each step could construct its decision based not only on the previous step's output, but on all of the words that were processed so far. To improve this, the attention layer, for each step in the text sequence, uses the output of the steps in the title sequence. Thus, the layer learns weights, designating the strength of the relatedness between each word in the title and each word in the content.For the neural network, we take the first 50 symbols of the title and the content of the news, which we choose after experiments. We train the neural network for 20 epochs and the final classification is derived with sigmoid activation. The optimizer used for the training is Adam optimizer. We feed the neural network with the embedding of the words we built earlier with word2vec.As we will see below, the neural network is inferior in terms of performance to a feature-rich SVM (even though it performs well above the baseline). This is because it only has access to word embeddings, and does not use the manually-crafted features. Yet, its hidden layer represents a 128-dimensional task-specific embedding of the input article, and it turns out that using it as a list of 128 features in the SVM classifier yields even further great improvement, as we will see below. In this way, we combine a deep neural network with an attention mechanism with kernel-based SVM.We feed the above-described hand-crafted features together with the task-specific embeddings learned by the deep neural neural network (a total of 1,892 attributes combined) into a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier BIBREF37 . SVMs have proven to perform well in different classification settings, including in the case of small and noisy datasets.Experiments and EvaluationWe trained on the 2,815 training examples, and we tested on the 761 testing ones. The test dataset was provided apart from the training one, thus we didn't have to partition the original dataset to receive a testing one. The validation of the models was performed on a randomly chosen subset of sentences - one fifth of the original set. We scaled each feature individually by its maximum absolute value to end up with each feature having values in the [0;1] interval. We used an RBF kernel for the SVM, and we tuned the values of INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 using cross-validation. We trained the neural network using RMSProp BIBREF38 with a learning rate of 0.001 and mini-batches of size 32, chosen by performing experiments with cross-validation . We evaluated the model after each epoch and we kept the one that performed best on the development dataset.Table TABREF17 shows the performance of the features in groups as described in Section SECREF7 . We can see that, among the hand-crafted features, the lexical features yield the best results, i.e., words are the most indicative features. The good results of the stylometric features indicate that the intricacies of language use are highly discriminative. The next group is the one with the grammatical features, which shows good performance in terms of Precision. The last one are the embedding features, which although having low individual performance, contribute to the overall performance of the system as shown in next paragraph.Evaluating the final model, we set as a baseline the prediction of the majority class, i.e., the fake news class. This baseline has an F1 of 41.59% and accuracy of 71.22%. The performance of the built models can be seen in Table TABREF19 . Another stable baseline, apart from just taking the majority class, is the TF.IDF bag-of-words approach, which sets a high bar for the general model score. We then observe how much the attention mechanism embeddings improve the score (AttNN). Finally, we add the hand-crafted features (Feats), which further improve the performance. From the results, we can conclude that both the attention-based task-specific embeddings and the manual features are important for the task of finding fake news.Conclusion and Future WorkWe have presented the first attempt to solve the fake news problem for Bulgarian. Our method is purely text-based, and ignores the publication date and the source of the article. It combines task-specific embeddings, produced by a two-level attention-based deep neural network model, with manually crafted features (stylometric, lexical, grammatical, and semantic), into a kernel-based SVM classifier. We further produced and shared a number of relevant language resources for Bulgarian, which we created for solving the task.The evaluation results are encouraging and suggest the potential applicability of our approach in a real-world scenario. They further show the potential of combining attention-based task-specific embeddings with manually crafted features. An important advantage of the attention-based neural networks is that the produced representations can be easily visualized and potentially interpreted as shown in BIBREF31 . We consider the implementation of such visualization as an important future work on the task.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Lachezar Bozhkov, who was part of our team in the Hack the Fake News hackathon, for his insight.

Among the damaged DNA bases, 8-oxo-2â²-deoxyguanosine (OdG), which arises from the reaction between 2â²-deoxyguanosine (dG) and reactive oxygen species, is well studied since it is both prominent in aerobic cells 1, 2 and is promutagenic due to its possible pairing with 2â²-deoxyadenosine (dA). 3 OdG differs from dG only within the imidazole ring: dG contains a hydrogen bond accepting N7, where in OdG, the presence of the C8-oxygen leads to a hydrogen bond donating N7.4 Additionally, the added steric bulk off C8 in OdG reorients the glycosidic bond to the syn conformation from the more standard anti conformation (Fig. 1A).5 Cells have evolved several repair enzymes in efforts to limit the deleterious effects of OdG; in Escherichia coli, three enzymes (MutM, MutY, and MutT) are used, which together are referred to as the GO pathway.6, 7 MutM (also known as Fpg) removes the 8-oxoguanine base from OdG:dC base pairs,8 MutY removes the adenine base from OdG:dA base pairs,9 and MutT hydrolyzes the 5â²-triphosphate derivative of OdG (OdGTP) to the corresponding monophosphate (OdGMP),10, 11 thereby preventing its insertion into DNA.</p><p>Due to its capacity to promote mutations, both the replication and repair of OdG have been extensively studied when it is within an oligonucleotide. Recently, there has been much additional interest in the free nucleotide, OdGTP, due to its ability to cause mutation13, 14 and the role it might play during antibiotic initiated bacterial cell death. Though controversial,15â18 it has been postulated that some bactericidal agents, like Î²-lactams and quinolones, initiate cell death through double-strand DNA breaks caused by incomplete repair of closely spaced OdG lesions. Through knockout and overexpression studies, it was shown that the incorporation of OdGTP plays a major role in this lethal pathway.16 Thus, OdGTP may be important not only to genetic mutation, but also to the potency of some antibiotics. For these reasons, studies into the ability of MutT to remove OdGTP from the nucleotide pool are of even greater interest.</p><p>MutT belongs to the Nudix hydrolase family, which have a 23 residue highly conserved signature sequence, GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U is a bulky hydrophobic residue and X is any amino acid.19, 20 Previous studies have shown that while OdGTP is a significantly better substrate for MutT than dGTP,10 other modified nucleotides, like 8-Bromo-dGTP (BrdGTP) can also have significant activity.21 Consistent with these results, crystal structure studies of a binary MutT complex containing OdGMP (Fig. 1B) indicated i) the presence of a hydrogen bond between OÎ´ of Asn119 and the N7-hydrogen of OdG, an interaction not possible with dGTP, and ii) that the 8-oxoguanine base is held in the syn conformation, which is preferred when large atoms, like oxygen and bromine, are present off C8.5 The structural studies also revealed interactions between the enzyme and the C6-oxygen and C2-exocyclic amine, 12 which are both standard to all dGTP based substrates.</p><p>Though the structural studies provide much insight into MutT substrate recognition, they are not able to discern the relative importance of each distinct interaction or property. In general, there has been surprisingly little research on MutT substrate flexibility and there has been no systematic study on the degree to which individual substrate properties contribute to MutT activity. Previously, we have used OdG analogues to establish structure-activity relationships of OdG with repair enzymes and various polymerases.22â24 In this study, nine OdGTP analogues were used to investigate the contribution of three sites to MutT activity. Those sites include i) C8, where a large atom can promote the syn N-glycosidic bond conformation5, 25 that is observed in the active site of the binary MutT:OdGMP structure, ii) N7, where the presence of a hydrogen can lead to a stabilizing interaction with Asn119, and iii) C2, where the exocyclic amine can form both a direct hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Phe35 and a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Gly37 (Fig. 1B).12</p><p>The nine analogues used in this study, illustrated in Figure 2, include i) 8-chloro-dGTP (CldGTP) and BrdGTP, which both mimic dGTP, but with the addition of a large atom off C8, ii) 7-deaza-dGTP (AdGTP), which contains a carbon at position 7, removing any hydrogen bonding ability at that site, iii) 9-deaza-dGTP (CdGTP) and 8-thio-dGTP (SdGTP), which both contain an N7-hydrogen, but vary from OdGTP at the C8 position, and iv) the 5â²-triphosphate derivative of 2â²-deoxyinosine (dITP), as well as 8-Bromo-dITP (BrdITP), 8-oxo-dITP (OdITP), and 8-thio-dITP (SdITP), which all lack the C2-exocyclic amine. By testing the activity of each of these analogues, it is possible to gain a more nuanced understanding of MutT substrate recognition at the three sites (C8, N7, and C2).</p><p>dGTP, BrdGTP, OdGTP, AdGTP, and dITP are all commercially available, OdITP has been reported previously,26 and the mononucleosides of three of the other analogues (CldGTP, CdGTP, BrdITP) have been reported previously by our lab or others.25, 27, 28 We used standard reaction and purification methods to convert the CldG, CdG, and BrdI monomers to their corresponding 5â²-triphosphate derivatives (Fig. 3A). Though we have previously incorporated 8-thio-2â²-deoxyinosine (SdI) into oligonucleotides using phosphoramidite chemistry, this study necessitated the mononucleoside, which we had not previously synthesized. Therefore, we first obtained SdI monomer from our previously characterized 8-thio protected SdI monomer23 through deprotection using tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF); we then synthesized SdITP using salicyl chlorophosphite (2-chloro-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphorin-4-one) and tributylammonium pyrophosphate (Fig. 3B). 29 Synthesis to SdGTP required protection of the 3â²-hydroxyl and C2-exocyclic amine. As shown in Figure 3C, using the 8-thio protected SdG monomer,30 we protected the C2-exocylic amine, 5â²-hydroxyl, and 3â²-hydroxyl with dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethoxytrityl (DMTr), and acetyl (Ac) groups, respectively, using standard chemistry. The 5â²-hydroxy and 8-thio protecting groups were then removed with trifluoroacetic acid and TBAF, respectively, before salicyl chlorophosphite and tributylammonium pyrophosphate were once again used to add the 5â²-triphosphate.</p><p>dGTP, OdGTP, and the nine analogues were tested for their overall activity with MutT using steady-state Michaelis-Menten conditions. Reverse phase HPLC was used to separate the triphosphate substrates from the monophosphate products. Similar to previous results with MutT, 31 reactions with OdGTP were roughly 150-fold more efficient than with dGTP (Fig. 4). All of the analogues had quantifiable activity except dITP, which showed little (< 5%) reaction even after incubation for up to an hour with ten times the normal enzyme concentration (data not shown). BrdITP and AdGTP were 2.6- and 13-fold more efficient substrates than dGTP, respectively, while the rest of the analogues had activities that were all within 0.5 to 1.5-fold of OdGTP. Interestingly, the six analogues with high activity varied in the size of the atom off C8, the presence of the N7-hydrogen, or the presence of the C2-exocyclic amine. Thus, while the crystal structure suggests an important role for each of these sites during substrate recognition, none of them are absolutely required for significant steady-state activity with MutT.</p><p>Our data instead suggests that, at minimum, two of the three factors are required. For example, CldGTP and BrdGTP both contain a large atom off C8 and the C2-exocyclic amine, but no N7-hydrogen; CdGTP contains both the N7-hydrogen and the C2-exocyclic amine, but no large atom off C8; OdITP and SdITP contain both a large atom off C8 and the N7-hydrogen, but no C2-exocyclic amine. When only one of these three properties is present, as in dGTP (only the C2-exocyclic amine) or BrdITP (only a large atom off C8), a roughly 100-fold drop in activity is observed. If none of the three properties is present, as in dITP, then the reaction is so poor as to not allow for accurate quantification. Analyzing the data for AdGTP provides even greater insight into the N7 position. While the presence of the N7-hydrogen in OdGTP allows for a stabilizing hydrogen bond to OÎ´ of Asn119, the N7-lone pair of dGTP would have a repulsive interaction with the same atom. AdGTP contains neither a stabilizing N7-hydrogen nor a repulsive N7-lone pair (though it does have the C2-exocyclic amine) and has intermediate activity in our assays. Thus, it is possible Asn119 is used not only to promote hydrolysis of the damaged nucleotide OdGTP, but also discourage hydrolysis of the undamaged nucleotide dGTP. Additionally, AdGTP is a better steric mimic of OdGTP than dGTP at the N7 position, which may also contribute to its intermediate activity.</p><p>Interestingly, the OdG repair enzyme MutM appears to use a similar discriminatory system at N7. While also holding the 8-oxoguanine base in the syn-conformation, MutM uses the main chain carbonyl of Ser200 to form a stabilizing hydrogen bond to the N7-hydrogen of 8-oxoguanine when excising it from OdG:dC base pairs.32 That same carbonyl can also clash with the N7-lone pair in dG, rendering dG:dC base pairs inactive.33 Similar to the biochemical results with AdGTP reported herein, AdG:dC base pairs are only 10-fold less active with MutM than OdG:dC base pairs.22 Expanding to the other two sites, MutM, like MutT, is tolerant to the loss of the C2-exocyclic amine from OdG; previous experiments have shown that the 8-oxohypoxanthine base is removed from OdI:dC pairs with higher efficiency as compared to 8-oxoguanine removal from OdG:dC pairs.34 Finally, MutM appears to be more sensitive than MutT at the C8 position; dissimilar to the results herein, SdG:dC pairs were significantly less active with MutM than OdG:dC pairs.22</p><p>In conclusion, we have used nine analogues of dGTP and OdGTP to investigate the importance of the C8, N7, and C2 positions to the overall reaction efficiency of the MutT repair enzyme. We have found that no one site is critically important to activity, but rather it is the combination of at least two of the interactions and/or properties that affords significant activity. It may be useful to study the activities of the analogues with MutT using pre-steady state (single-turnover) kinetic experiments in which the individual steps of nucleotide hydrolysis can be analyzed. Detailed kinetic studies have shown that while the chemistry step is partially rate limiting with poor substrates, such as dGTP, in highly active substrates, such as OdGTP, product release and/or an enzyme conformational change are likely rate limiting.31</p>","answer":"The bacterial repair enzyme MutT hydrolyzes the damaged nucleotide OdGTP (the 5xe2x80xb2-triphosphate derivative of 8-oxo-2xe2x80xb2-deoxyguanosine; OdG), which is a known mutagen and has been linked to antibacterial action. Previous work has indicated important roles for the C8-oxygen, N7-hydrogen, and C2-exocyclic amine during OdGTP recognition by MutT. In order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the contribution of these three sites to the overall activity of MutT, we determined the reaction parameters for dGTP, OdGTP, and nine of their analogues using steady state kinetics. Our results indicate that overall high reaction efficiencies can be achieved despite altering any one of these sites. However, altering two or more sites leads to a significant decrease in efficiency. The data also suggest that, similar to another bacterial OdG repair enzyme, MutM, a specific carbonyl in the enzyme can not only promote activity by forming an active site hydrogen bond with the N7-hydrogen of OdGTP, but can also hinder activity through electrostatic repulsion with the N7-lone pair of dGTP."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

However, our understanding of how histone modifications directly affect chromatin function remains limited. In this study, we investigate acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 64( H3K64ac), a previously uncharacterized acetylation on the lateral surface of the histone octamer. We show that H3K64ac regulates nucleosome stability and facilitates nucleosome eviction and hence gene expression in vivo. In line with this, we demonstrate that H3K64ac is enriched in vivo at the transcriptional start sites of active genes and it defines transcriptionally active chromatin. Moreover, we find that the p300 co-activator acetylates H3K64, and consistent with a transcriptional activation function, H3K64ac opposes its repressive counterpart H3K64me3. Our findings reveal an important role for a histone modification within the nucleosome core as a regulator of chromatin function and they demonstrate that lateral surface modifications can define functionally opposing chromatin states.Introduction:Histone modifications are central to the regulation of all chromatin-based processes. Four core histonesâH3, H4, H2A, and H2Bâcomprise the nucleosomal core particle, and each may be decorated with multiple covalent modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination( Kouzarides, 2007). To date, most attention has focused on modifications within the flexible N-terminal tails of histones, which extend from their own nucleosome. Due to their accessibility, âreaderâ or effector proteins selectively bind to modified sites in the tails to mediate downstream effects. In this way âreadersâ can provide a relatively simple mechanism enabling cells to decipher the so-called âhistone-codeâ, to facilitate the regulation of biological processes such as transcription, DNA replication, and damage repair. Interestingly, covalent modifications also occur within the globular domain of histones( Garcia, 2009), especially at positions that are in close contact with the nucleosomal DNA wrapped around each octamer. In particular, modifications on the outer surface of the histone octamer, the so-called lateral surface, have the potential to directly influence chromatin structure by altering histoneâhistone or histoneâDNA interactions( Cosgrove, 2007; Tropberger and Schneider, 2010; Tropberger et al., 2013). Because of their structurally important position close to the DNA, one can directly address the mechanism( s) by which these lateral surface modifications impact on nucleosome dynamics and chromatin function. This is in contrast to tail modifications that play a mainly indirect role in chromatin regulation through recruitment of effector proteins. Understanding how histone modifications ultimately impact on chromatin function is still an open challenge and this has not been helped by the fact that the repertoire of known modifications is far from complete( Tan et al., 2011). Here, we have investigated the functional mechanism of an uncharacterized acetylation site, lysine 64 of histone H3( H3K64ac), which lies within the H3 globular domain. We demonstrate that this lateral surface modification can directly influence nucleosomal stability and dynamics, which consequently affects transcriptional regulation.Discussion:We have identified and functionally characterized a novel histone modification located on the octamerâs lateral surface in close proximity to the DNA backbone of the inner gyre. The main chain atoms of H3K64 are in direct contact with the DNA phosphate backbone and this places the H3K64 side chain close enough to potentially contact the DNA, with the average H3K64 side-chain nitrogen-to-DNA distance approximately 6. 1 Ã( Figure 5âfigure supplement 5A, B). Lysine acetylation results in increased bulk and charge neutralization of the lysine side-chain, and it is likely that acetylation of lateral surface lysines( e. g., H3K64) could interfere with histoneâDNA interactions. Interestingly, in the high-resolution crystal structure of the nucleosome( PDB 1KX5; Davey et al., 2002) H3K64 is found to be involved in an extensive network of water-mediated hydrogen bonds that link numerous water molecules, histone side- and main-chain atoms and the DNA( Figure 5âfigure supplement 5C). Acetylation of H3K64 would be predicted to disrupt this hydrogen bond network. Davey et al. estimate from their crystallographic analysis that water-bridged interactions between histones and DNA are as important to nucleosome stability as the direct histoneâDNA contacts( Davey et al., 2002). These water-bridges provide a plasticity that allows the histone core to adapt to myriad variations in the DNA sequence and conformation. They postulate that disruption of even a single waterâbridge interaction( e. g., acetylation of H3K64) has the potential to significantly affect nucleosome stability. This is indeed fully supported by our findingsâwe demonstrate that H3K64ac exerts a direct effect on nucleosome stability and facilitates histone eviction. H3K64 acetylation could cause the reduced FRET signal we observed in the salt-dependent dissociation assay in multiple ways. A pre-requisite for the loss of histones from the nucleosome is the dissociation of DNA from the surface of the histone octamer. Given the proximity of H3K64ac to DNA it is likely that it may facilitate this dissociation. This loss of histoneâDNA contacts caused by H3K64ac may aid the loss of H2AâH2B dimers, contributing to the observed change in FRET signal. Alternatively, following the loss of H2AâH2B dimers H3K64ac may favour dissociation of DNA from histones H3 and H4, or H3K64ac may affect water-mediated hydrogen bonds that directly influence the association of H2AâH2B dimers. These modes of action are not mutually exclusive and they are consistent with the observed effects of H3K64ac in chromatin assembly in vitro. They also all have the potential to influence chromatin organization during cycles of assembly/disassembly at gene regulatory elements. We detect an approximately 60 mM decrease in the salt-dependent stability between H3K64ac and unmodified/H3K9ac nucleosomes. This difference in salt stability of H3K64ac appears to be in a range consistent with the observed changes in nucleosome dynamics. Gansen et al.( 2013) showed that simultaneous acetylation of all sites in H3 results in a decrease in nucleosome salt stability of approximately 100â130 mM NaCl. Furthermore, a fundamental change in the histone content of the nucleosome via incorporation of the histone H2A variant H2A. Z, increases salt stability by up to â¼70 mM( Park et al., 2004). Moreover, the observed enrichment of H3K64ac at active gene promoters and during chromatin reorganization in spermiogenesis argues for a role of H3K64ac in creating an open, permissive chromatin state. Indeed, this is supported by increased histone eviction and the finding that a mutation mimicking constitutive acetylation, H3K64 to Q, can promote transcription of at least certain genes. We consider a twofold higher transcription due to a single histone mutation as biologically important. Additional lysines on the octamerâs lateral surface have been found to be acetylated, such as H3K56, which is located closer to the ends of the nucleosomal DNA. Interestingly, these acetylations can mediate distinct effects on nucleosomes( this work and Neumann et al., 2009; Tropberger et al., 2013). Thus, specificity exists in the way that the biomechanical properties of nucleosomes are affected differentially by acetylation at different sites within the globular domain of H3. Despite considerable efforts, we have so far been unable to detect specific readers, or binders of H3K64ac. Consequently, we prefer a model in which it acts via direct effects. However, H3K64ac may also function by preventing H3K64me3 from being laid down at key genomic regions. We have previously suggested that methylation of H3K64 is involved in the creation of repressive chromatin states( Daujat et al., 2009; Lange et al., 2013). Thus, H3K64ac might serve to prevent the nucleosome from adopting a repressive conformation, thereby maintaining chromatin in a transcriptionally competent state. Our working model( Figure 7) proposes that opposing chromatin states can be defined via the mutually exclusive presence of H3K64ac or H3K64me3. This model is reinforced by the observed distinct and largely mutually exclusive genomic distribution patterns of these two H3K64 modifications. 10. 7554/eLife. 01632. 025Figure 7. Schematic model for H3K64ac function. H3K64ac( bottom) helps to create an open, permissive chromatin environment. In contrast to this H3K64me3 could lock the nucleosomes in a stable, repressive conformation( top), resulting in an inactive chromatin environment. H3K64ac can directly act by affecting nucleosome dynamics, but also indirectly by blocking methylation of the same residue.

They also extend our understanding of chromatin regulation and provide mechanistic insights into how chromatin organization is spatially and temporally controlled by globular domain modifications. The identification of novel pathways regulating chromatin function has also the potential to highlight druggable targets for diseases in which chromatin states have been distorted.","answer":"DNA is a very long molecule , so it needs to be packaged carefully to fit into the nucleus of a cell .

It has been suspected for some time that histone modifications can also influence gene expression more directly , but there has been little evidence for this idea . Now Di Cerbo et al . have studied what happens when acetyl or methyl groups are added to a specific site within a histone called H3K64 , which is close to where the DNA wraps around this histone . These experiments showed that this site tends to be acetylated when a nearby gene is active , and to be unmodified or methylated when this gene is not active . It appears that the addition of the acetyl group makes this region of the chromatin less stable: this , in turn , makes it easier for the chromatin to be unpacked , thus giving access to the enzymes that transcribe the DNA and allowing transcription to take place . The work of Di Cerbo et al . shows that methylation and acetylation at the same site within a histone can define two opposing states of chromatin and DNA: an active state and a repressive state ."},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Thus, we converted urea group in known sEH inhibitors into imidazolidine-2,4,5-trione or pirimidine-2,4,6-trione, because additional HBAs should enhance water solubility and prevent intermolecular interactions between urea molecules.</p><p>To synthesize imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones, the reaction of ureas with oxalyl chloride. Reaction was carried out in anhydrous THF for 2h with reflux (Scheme 1).14,15</p><p>In most cases imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones are significantly less active than the corresponding ureas, with loss of potency between 2.3 and 6,000 folds, except for compound 1c, which is as potent as the corresponding urea (Table 1). Imidazolidine-2,4,5-trione 1k (8.4 Î¼M, 700-folds less active than the preceding urea) is the least active among compounds 1a-k. Presence of 5 HBAs in the molecule probably prevents it from entering the active site of the sEH. However, for compound 1c its activity equals activity of corresponding urea.</p><p>As expected, in most cases, the triones yielded more water soluble than the corresponding urea. Compound 1b is 40-fold more soluble than its corresponding urea (t-TUCB). However, in some cases (1c and 1k) triones were less soluble than its preceding ureas. In addition, melting points of triones were up to 101Â°C less then those for the corresponding ureas except for compounds 1a and 1b. Because in some conditions, triones can degrade back to the original ureas, the better physical properties of triones can enhanced their formulation as pro-drugs of urea-based sEHI.</p><p>It was previously showed that diureas, which contain two urea groups linked with aliphatic spacer are very potent sEHI.9 Molecular docking suggests that the high potency of these compounds is due to the binding of the second urea group with Ser374 of the sEH. We used diureas with various linkers between adamantane and urea fragments to synthesize corresponding di-imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones 2a-g and tri-imidazolidine-2,4,5-trione 2h (Scheme 2).</p><p>Data (Table 2) shows that the di-imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones 2a-h possess significantly lower melting points than those for corresponding ureas. Compounds 2f and 2g are liquid at room temperature, which suggests that their melting points are at least 193 and 167Â°C lower. The ureas are known to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds resulting in a brick wall fashion crystalline lattice. Thus, the strong decreased in melting point observed, coupled with the higher molecular weight of the imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones, illustrates a lower number of intermolecular interactions in the trione crystals. Therefore, the up to 115-fold decrease in inhibitory activity (except of compound 2d which is 2.2-fold more active than its preceding urea) of imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones is somewhat not surprising. As observed for the single triones (Table 1), the di-triones are also 16- and 9-fold more soluble in water than their corresponding diureas.</p><p>To rationalize the activity and solubility trends in the current data sets of sEH inhibitors we performed a classic QSAR study based on fragment descriptors and regularized linear regression. The obtained model is satisfactory and can explain some features of the data set and the calculated F-statistics values confirmed the significance of the constructed models and the quality of the constructed models is satisfactory. The fragment descriptors which showed non-zero coefficients in the descriptor selection procedure are shown at Fig. 1 (A) (activity). The only descriptors which demonstrates suitable significance level in a t-test are frag7 (p = 0.07) and frag10 (p = 0.002). Their influence may be interpreted in the following way: frag7 can be found in compounds which contain N-adamantylurea fragments which is easily accommodated in the sEH active site and form hydrogen bonds with Asp335 and Tyr383, while unsubstituted N-adamantyl-imidazolidine-trione containing compounds contain frag10 and, according to the docking results, have an alternative binding mode to the enzyme. Asp335 can exist in two different conformations in sEH active site: the most stable is highlighted by red color (Fig 2 (A)) it forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of Trp336 and Gly266 and the other one is shown at Fig 2 (A) with ordinary color scheme. The latter one is observed for the binding mode of compounds 2a where one of carbonyl oxygens forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of Trp336 and Gly266 substituting Asp335 side chain. Thus, the number of hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the ligand are roughly the same for 2a and its urea derivative 2a*. The urea derivative forms two hydrogen bonds with Asp335 while one of the carbonyl oxygens of 2a forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide groups of Trp336 and Phe267.</p><p>Finally, we synthesized two pirimidine-2,4,6-triones 3a and 3b (Scheme 3) by substituting oxalyl chloride with malonyl chloride in the above described reaction.</p><p>Compound 3a is more active than compound 3b (Table 3), confirming that a single methylene spacer between the adamantane and the primary pharmacophore lead to increase of the inhibitory activity.9 Both pirimidine-2,4,6-triones 3a and 3b show higher inhibitory activity against sEH when compared to the corresponding imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones 1e and 1d (Table 1), but they are up to 100-fold less active than the corresponding ureas. Pirimidine-2,4,6-triones 3a and 3b are 21 and 10-fold more soluble than the ureas and approximately 4-fold more soluble than the corresponding imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones 1d and 1e. Because, like the imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones in some conditions, the pirimidine-2,4,6-triones can degrade back to the original ureas, the better physical properties of the triones can enhanced their formulation as pro-drugs of urea-based sEHI.</p><p>Series of imidazolidine-2,4,5-triones and primidine-2,4,6-triones were synthesized and investigated for their inhibitory activity against sEH as well as their physical properties. Synthesized compounds are less active than its preceding ureas but possess higher water solubility and lower melting point. Molecular docking with the new compounds highlights possible new bonds with the enzyme that could be used to increase potency. In addition, the new pharmacophore yield molecules that should easier to formulate, and that could be used as pro-drugs for urea-based inhibitor of sEH.</p>","answer":"A series of inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) containing imidazolidine-2,4,5-trione or pirimidine-2,4,6-trione has been synthesized.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  A main challenge in the application of service robotics is safe and reliable navigation of robots in human everyday environments. Supermarkets, which are chosen here as an example, pose a challenging scenario because they usually have a cluttered and nested character. The robot has to avoid collisions with static and even with moving obstacles while interacting with nearby humans or a dedicated user respectively. This paper presents a hierarchical approach for the proactive avoidance of moving objects as it is used on the robot shopping trolley InBOT. The behavior-based control (bbc) of InBOT is extended by a reflex and a reactive behavior to ensure adequate reaction times when confronted with a possible collision. On top of the bbc a spatio-temporal planner is situated which is able to predict environmental changes and therefore can generate a safe movement sequence accordingly. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  An autonomous mobile robot returns back to a reference (home) position using just the visual information in the visual homing task. Challenges in this autonomous task involve efficient information extraction from images and executing motion based on this information. This paper aims to develop visual homing technique by extracting coarse location information with respect to the reference position using a novel bit encoding approach. Coarse information is used in probabilistic framework to build stronger beliefs on the robot's location with successive movement of the robot. The changes in visual information due to the presence of dynamic obstacles are accounted in likelihood information using bit encoding. Novel information encoding and proposed probability distribution develop sensor model. The action model aims for building stronger beliefs with successive movement, when limited number of commands are used. Experiments are performed using Fire Bird XI robot equipped with a multiple camera system for capturing panoramic view at the robot's location. Multiple experiments show that the robot reaches the reference position without the knowledge of initial location and changing environment conditions. This paper also reports experimental results in the presence of dynamic obstacles.Literature Review:","answer":"Orientation and locomotion are profound collaborators in 'interest' during an interaction among humans.

Weconsider the task of composing two input object images into a joint image that captures their joint interaction in natural images. Forinstance, given an image of a chair and a table, our formulation should be able to generate an image containing the same chair-table pair interacting naturally. Fora model to be able to capture the composition correctly, it needs to have the knowledge of occlusion ordering, i.e., a table comes in front of chair, and spatial layout, i.e., a chair slides inside table. Tothe best of our knowledge, we are among the first to solve this problem in the image conditional space without any prior explicit information about the objects' layout.Our key insight is to reformulate the problem of composition of two objects into first composing the given object images to generate the joint combined image which models the object interaction, and then decomposing the joint image back to obtain individual ones. Thisreformulation enforces a selfconsistency constraint ) through a composition-decomposition network. However, in some scenarios, one does not have access to the paired examples of same object instances with their combined compositional image, for instance, to generate the joint image from the image of a given table and a chair, we might not have any example of that particular chair besides that particular table while we might have images of other chairs and other tables together. We addan inpainting network to our composition-decomposition layers to handle the unpaired case as well.Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we evaluate our proposed Compositional-GAN approach in two training scenarios: (a) paired: when we have access to paired examples of individual object images with their corresponding composed image, (b) unpaired: when we have a dataset from the joint distribution without being paired with any of the images from the marginal distributions.In this paper, we proposed a novel Compositional GAN model addressing the problem of object composition in conditional image generation.Our model captures the relative linear and viewpoint transformations needed to be applied on each input object (in addition to their spatial layout and occlusions) to generate a realistic joint image.To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to solve the compositionality problem without having any explicit prior information about object's layout.We evaluated our compositional GAN through multiple qualitative experiments and user evaluations for two cases of paired versus unpaired training data.In the future, we plan to extend this work toward generating images composed of multiple (more than two) and/or non-rigid objects.","answer":"We develop a novel approach to model object compositionality in images in a GAN framework."},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Detecting overlapping communities is especially challenging, and remains an open problem.  Motivated by the success of graph-based  deep  learning  in  other  graph-related  tasks,  we  study  the  applicability  of this framework for overlapping community detection. We propose a probabilistic model for overlapping community detection based on the graph neural network architecture.  Despite its simplicity, our model outperforms the existing approaches in the community recovery task by a large margin.  Moreover, due to the inductive formulation, the proposed model is able to perform out-of-sample community detection for nodes that were not present at training timeGraphs provide a natural way of representing complex real-world systems.For understanding the structure and behavior of these systems, community detection methods are an essential tool.Detecting communities allows us to analyze social networks BID9 , to detect fraud BID24 , to discover functional units of the brain BID8 , and to predict functions of proteins BID26 .Over the last decades, this problem has attracted significant attention of the research community and numerous models and algorithms have been proposed BID32 .In particular, it is a well known fact that communities in real graphs are in fact overlapping BID34 , thus, requiring the development of advanced models to capture this complex structure.In this regard, the advent of deep learning methods for graph-structured data opens new possibilities for designing more accurate and more scalable algorithms.Indeed, deep learning on graphs has already shown state-of-the-art results in s for various graph-related tasks such as semi-supervised node classification and link prediction BID2 .Likewise, a few deep learning methods for community detection in graphs have been proposed BID36 BID4 .However, they all have one drawback in common: they only focus on the special case of disjoint (non-overlapping) communities.Handling overlapping communities, is a requirement not yet met by existing deep learning approaches to community detection.In this paper we propose an end-to-end deep probabilistic model for overlapping community detection in graphs.Our core idea lies in predicting the community affiliations using a graph neural network.Despite its simplicity, our model achieves state-of-the art results in community recovery and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.Moreover, our model is able to perform out-of-sample (inductive) community detection for nodes that were not seen at training time.To summarize, our main contributions are:â¢ We propose the Deep Overlapping Community detection (DOC) model -a simple, yet effective deep learning model for overlapping community detection in graphs.DOC is one of few methods is able to perform community detection both transductively and inductively.â¢We introduce 5 new datasets for overlapping community detection, which can act as a benchmark to stimulate future work in this research area.â¢We perform a thorough experimental evaluation of our model, and show its superior performance when comparing with established methods for overlapping community detection.In this work we have proposed and studied two deep models for overlapping community detection: DOC-BP, based on the Bernoulli-Poisson link, and DOC-Sigmoid, that relies on the sigmoid link function.The two variants of our model achieve state-of-the-art results and convincingly outperfom existing techniques in transductive and inductive community detection tasks.Using stochastic training, both approaches are highly efficient and scale to large graphs.Among the two proposed models, DOC-BP one average performs better than the DOC-Sigmoid variant.We leave to future work to investigate the properties of communities detected by these two methods.To summarize, the results obtained in our experimental evaluation provide strong evidence that deep learning for graphs deserves more attention as a framework for overlapping community detection.","answer":"Detecting overlapping communities in graphs using graph neural networks"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Therefore, using a pulse model that closely mimics the in vivo pharmacokinetics of platinum therapy, we profiled cisplatin-induced signalling, DNA-damage and apoptotic responses across a panel of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. By coupling this data to real-time, single-cell imaging of cell cycle and apoptosis we provide a fine-grained stratification of response, where a P70S6K-mediated signalling axis promotes resistance on a TP53 wildtype or null background, but not a mutant TP53 background. This finding highlights the value of in vitro models that match the physiological pharmacokinetics of drug exposure. Furthermore, it also demonstrates the importance of a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between somatic mutations and the signalling networks that govern drug response for the implementation of any consistently effective, patient-specific therapy.Introduction:Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Lung adenocarcinoma is typically diagnosed late, meaning that most patients require systemic chemotherapy( Chen et al., 2014). Platinum-based chemotherapy is likely to remain an important treatment modality for these patients due to the emergence of resistance to targeted therapies in EGFR, ALK or ROS mutant tumours( Lindeman et al., 2018), and the fact that most patients do not respond to single agent immunotherapy( Kim et al., 2019; Doroshow et al., 2019). Despite the use of platinum-based chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma for over four decades, response rates remain below 30% due to the prevalence of innate resistance( Pilkington et al., 2015; Bonanno et al., 2014). In addition, dose-related nephrotoxicity remains a challenge in many patients( Pabla and Dong, 2008). Strategies to improve platinum efficacy could therefore significantly improve outcomes for lung adenocarcinoma patients. However, unravelling platinum resistance in lung adenocarcinoma has proven challenging, as over 147 mechanisms of resistance have been proposed( Stewart, 2007), yet there remains a lack of viable clinical options to improve response rates. From an experimental viewpoint, discordance between the in vivo pharmacokinetics of platinum chemotherapies and their use within in vitro assays has likely contributed to the identification of putative resistance mechanisms and drug targets that have not ultimately translated to the clinic. Traditionally, in vitro methods for the investigation of drug response have involved culturing cancer cells in the continuous presence of high-dose chemotherapy over several days. This contrasts with pharmacokinetic studies in humans and rodents demonstrating that both cisplatin and carboplatin are rapidly cleared from the circulation, and the tumour, within 2â3 hr following administration( Andersson et al., 1996; Johansen et al., 2002). Therefore, in this study we have utilised a cisplatin pulse model, which more closely recapitulates these physiological pharmacokinetics, aiming to maintain the fidelity of the apoptotic mechanism mediated by cisplatin in vivo. We have previously shown that predictive computational models of drug-induced apoptotic signalling dynamics can be used as a prognostic indicator of neuroblastoma patient survival( Fey et al., 2015). To move towards a similar concept to platinum resistance in lung adenocarcinoma, we now present an in-depth analysis of the dynamic signalling response to a pulse of platinum chemotherapy, describing the relationship between a number of key signalling nodes, the DNA damage response and platinum sensitivity. Importantly, we also propose a therapeutic strategy targeting P70S6K using the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor dactolisib, with the potential to improve the efficacy of current platinum-based treatment regimens.Discussion:A number of studies have been performed investigating the potential mechanisms of resistance to platinum-based chemotherapies( Stewart, 2007), although this has yet to result in the identification of clinically successful combination therapies for lung adenocarcinoma. One potential explanation for the high number of in vitro findings that have not translated to the clinic is the use of experimental techniques that do not replicate the in vivo pharmacokinetics of platinum therapies( Shen et al., 2012). To date, most in vitro approaches have involved continuously culturing cell lines in the presence of high doses of platinum chemotherapy for multiple days, potentially allowing for more extensive DNA damage and off-target effects that would not be seen in vivo. Here we have utilised a pulse model that more accurately models both the concentration and timing of cisplatin that would be observed clinically. This is an important consideration, as platinum therapies are known to act via the formation of DNA adducts, although they are also capable of bonding with proteins and RNA( Jamieson and Lippard, 1999). It is likely that the continuous culturing of cells in the presence of high doses of these drugs in vitro would result in the accumulation of numerous off-target adducts and the activation of a stress response incongruent with the actual in vivo apoptotic mechanism. Indeed, this effect may be apparent in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D/2, where p38 activity is induced by the continuous exposure model, but not by the pulse model. A number of previous studies have implicated the activity of p38 in mediating resistance to cisplatin( Sarin et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2013; Galan-Moya et al., 2011; HernÃ¡ndez Losa et al., 2003), however we did not observe highly elevated p38 signalling in any cell line following the cisplatin pulse( Figure 1D), nor a correlation between p38 activity and the apoptotic response( Figure 2). Instead, through the use of this pulse model, and by overlaying real-time apoptosis data onto a multivariate signalling analysis across a panel of lung adenocarcinoma lines, we have now identified elevated P70S6K activity as an effector of inherent platinum chemoresistance. High levels of P70S6K expression have previously been associated with aggressive tumour behaviour in lung cancer( Chen et al., 2017), as well as other cancer types such as breast( Holz, 2012), colorectal( Nozawa et al., 2007) and liver( Sahin et al., 2004) cancers. This is also supported by our analysis of P70S6K expression patient samples( Figure 4), where high mRNA and protein levels were both associated with poor overall survival, and P70S6K protein expression was significantly elevated in relapsed tumours. Importantly, we also propose that combination therapy with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor dactolisib can sensitise lung adenocarcinomas to platinum chemotherapy, although only in the context TP53 WT or TP53 null tumours. This detailed mechanistic understanding is especially important given that P70S6K amplification can occur on a background of either mutant or wildtype TP53( Figure 4A). Functionally, dactolisib will result in the inhibition of a number of substrates downstream of PI3K and mTOR. However, as the specific knockdown of P70S6K with siRNA recapitulated the effects of dactolisib on p63, p21, Î³H2A. X, cleaved caspase 3 and apoptosis, it is likely that the elevated expression and activity of P70S6K in resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells is the functional target of dactolisib and a causal effector of platinum resistance in these cells. Further supporting this central role of P70S6K, previous research has demonstrated that P70S6K can regulate cell cycle progression via the enhanced translation of p21 mRNA( GuÃ©gan et al., 2014), although our data also suggest that P70S6K may also play a role in the enhanced expression of both p53 and p63 in this context. The combination of cisplatin and dactolisib has also previously been proposed for osteosarcoma( Huang et al., 2018), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma( Hsu et al., 2018) and bladder cancer( Moon et al., 2014). However, our finding that this combination therapy is effective in TP53 WT and null, but not TP53 mutant tumours, has significant implications for the clinical application of these drugs and the design of potential clinical trials. This fine grained stratification of response is an important finding, as the failure of many clinical trials is frequently attributed to the lack of suitable biomarkers to stratify the patient cohort( Hay et al., 2014), highlighting the value of our approach that is capable of dissecting the mechanism of variable drug response across differing genetic backgrounds. The inability of dactolisib to regulate p21 expression in TP53 mutant tumour cells following cisplatin treatment likely underlies the inability of dactolisib to sensitise these cells to cisplatin. Therefore, within the context of a potential clinical trial for this drug combination, the TP53 mutation status of each patient tumour would be a central consideration for identification of the most effective treatment strategy and an understanding of individual patient response. However, this finding is also widely applicable to the understanding of how cancer-related signalling networks govern drug response and chemoresistance, and how a thorough characterisation of these dynamics will be necessary for the proper design and implementation of any consistently effective, patient-specific therapy.","answer":"Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer , and it emerges because of a variety of harmful genetic changes , or mutations .

Both poikilotherms and homeotherms live longer at lower body temperatures, highlighting a general role of temperature reduction in lifespan extension. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One prominent model is that cold temperatures reduce the rate of chemical reactions, thereby slowing the rate of aging. This view suggests that cold-dependent lifespan extension is simply a passive thermodynamic process. Here, we challenge this view in C. elegans by showing that genetic programs actively promote longevity at cold temperatures. We find that TRPA-1, a cold-sensitive TRP channel, detects temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan. This effect requires cold-induced, TRPA-1-mediated calcium influx and a calcium-sensitive PKC that signals to the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Human TRPA1 can functionally substitute for worm TRPA-1 in promoting longevity. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized function for TRP channels, link calcium signaling to longevity, and, importantly, demonstrate that genetic programs contribute to lifespan extension at cold temperatures.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

The earliest and most developed methods involve the reaction of C-M (M = Li, B, Mg, Si, Sn, Zn) with C-X (X = halide, triflate, tosylate, or aryliodide (as Ar 2 I + )) using Pd-based catalysts. These methods achieve coupling of aryl C-C bonds with high activity and selectivity; however, the reactants are quite expensive and there is significant opportunity to improve the atom efficiency. Additionally, there is impetus to utilize less expensive metal catalysts or even metal-free reactions. Recently, there has been rapid progress toward the use of C-H bonds as a reactive functional group [6]. While it would be highly desirable to utilize C-H/C-H coupling reactions [7], low reactivity and selectivity are significant obstacles. The use of directing groups can improve the selectivity, but could contribute additional reaction steps and expense. Therefore, C-X/C-H (X = halogen) direct arylations are an important avenue of investigation that may represent a balance between cost, activity, and selectivity [8][9][10][11][12][13].</p><p>The C-X/C-H direct arylation reaction can be achieved with X = halogen, triflate, tosylate [14], B(OH) 2 [15][16][17][18][19][20], SnR 3 [21], Si(OR) 3 [22], or with the use of aryliodonium salts [23]; wherein halogen atoms represent the most cost-effective and atom-efficient functional group. The reactions typically utilize expensive transition metal catalysts (Pd, Rh, Ir) at high loadings (typically 10 mol %), and require a large amount of strong base (typically 3 equivalents KO(t-Bu)). There has been some success using inexpensive first-row transition metals (Fe [24,25], Co [26][27][28], Ni [29][30][31][32][33], and Cu [34][35][36][37]) or an aluminum-based metal-organic framework [38], and there are several reports of metal-free direct arylation reactions in which the reaction is promoted with 2-3 equivalents KO(t-Bu) and (typically) 10-30 mol % of an additive [39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48].</p><p>The use of ambiphilic molecules as ligands for transition metals has given rise to an important new class of catalysts [49]. In previous work from our laboratory, we prepared the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair 8-quinolyldimesitylborane (1) and its complexes with Cu(I), Ag(I), and Pd(II) [50]. Recently, we reported the Pd(II) complex catalyzed Heck-type C-C coupling [51]. The observation may implicate reductive elimination and oxidative addition can cycle repeatedly on the palladium center coordinated to 1. With this in mind, we sought to utilize the Cu(I) complex, chloro[8-(dimesitylboryl)quinoline-ÎºN]copper(I) (2, Scheme 1), and investigate its performance as a catalyst for direct arylation reactions. We note that compound 2 consists of the ambiphilic ligand 1 coordinated to Cu(I) via nitrogen atom coordination and an Î· 3 -BCC interaction [52].</p><p>Herein we report the use of the preformed catalyst 2 and demonstrate good activity for C-X/C-H direct arylation reactions.</p><p>Scheme 1: Coordination of Cu(I) with the ambiphilic ligand 1 to form the catalyst 2.</p>Results and Discussion<p>The results of direct arylation catalysis are summarized in Table 1. We performed the reaction of iodobenzene with benzene/DMF (10:1 v/v) at 80 Â°C using a catalyst loading of 2 mol % of 2 and 30 equivalents KO(t-Bu) (Table 1, entry 1). After 10 hours the yield of biphenyl was 94% according to GC-MS analysis. A control reaction (Table 1, entry 4) of iodobenzene with benzene/DMF (10:1 v/v) using 2 mol % Cu(I)Br and 30 equivalents KO(t-Bu) gave 5% yield of biphenyl after 10 hours. Reactions performed in the absence of catalyst, using 3 or 30 equivalents KO(t-Bu) gave no reaction (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). While the high yield of the direct arylation suggests that the product cannot be exclusively obtained from homocoupling of iodobenzene, we performed additional experiments to demonstrate a heterocoupling pathway. The coupling of benzene with p-iodoanisole at 2 mol % loading of catalyst 2 was evaluated (Table 1, entry 2). We were pleased to find that the reaction yielded 4-methoxybiphenyl according to GC-MS analysis, and the isolated yield after flash column chromatography was 77%. Encouraged by these findings, we attempted the reaction with lower catalyst loadings and 3 equivalents KO(t-Bu). The reaction of iodobenzene with benzene with catalyst loading of 0.5 mol % gave biphenyl in isolated yield of 85% ( ). The yields of 3-methylbiphenyl and 3-chlorobiphenyl at catalyst loading of 0.3 mol % and 3 equivalents KO(t-Bu) were 8% and 4%, respectively. In all of the reactions, we note that metallic precipitates did not form, and the solutions did not become dark.</p><p>Activation of the sp 2 C-H bonds in naphthalene was possible as well. The reaction of iodobenzene in neat naphthalene at 85 Â°C using 0.2 mol % catalyst and 3 equivalents KO(t-Bu) gave a â2:1 ratio of 1-phenylnaphthalene and 2-phenylnaphthalene in a total yield of 43% (Table 1, entry 18). The observed substitution ratio is typical of substitutions on naphthalene under kinetic control that tend to favor the alpha C-H bonds due better resonance stabilization effects [53]. Importantly, we note the alpha protons are slightly more acidic than the beta protons [54].</p><p>The mechanism of Cu catalyzed coupling reactions and, more specifically, direct arylation have been the subject of intense interest. Mechanistic models appear to diverge along those favoring oxidative addition/reductive elimination via Cu(I)/ Cu(III) versus proposals favoring a single electron transfer (SET) pathway [55,56].</p><p>In the base-promoted SET mechanism [57], electron donation to ArI leads to a short-lived radical anion ArI â¢â that decomposes to I â and Ar â¢ . The Ar radical undergoes homolytic aromatic substitution with benzene to form a biaryl radical, and deprotonation gives a biaryl radical anion that transfers one electron to ArI to begin the cycle anew. The mechanism explains the metal-free direct arylation catalysis, but there has been some question about the initiation step. As KO(t-Bu) does not have sufficient reducing power to generate ArI â¢â , it has been proposed that initiation could arise from the reaction of ArI and KO(t-Bu) to form benzyne or that organic electron donors form in situ with suitable additives under the basic conditions of the reaction [58][59][60]. For example, observation of faster direct arylation in the presence of DMF led to proposals of deprotonated DMF as one electron donor [61] or forming a dibasic -enediol in situ as an electron donor [62].</p><p>While the SET mechanism has drawn much interest, our observation of large rate enhancement upon addition of the preformed catalyst 2 may be better described with a metalation-deprotonation step followed by oxidative addition/reductive elimination (Scheme 2) [63]. Thus, t-BuO â substitutes the halogen ligand on 2, followed by deprotonation-metalation of benzene, followed by oxidative addition of the arylhalide, and finally reductive elimination of the biaryl. The molecule 2 may be uniquely suited for this pathway. The electron-rich Cu(I) in the (L-Z)Cu(OR) intermediate may be well-stabilized by boron as a Z-type ligand, and the mesityl groups surrounding boron may favor the association of arenes for the deprotonation-metalation and the oxidative addition steps. Wang et al. proposed concerted metalation-deprotonation via a sigma bond metathesis involving a cyclic 4-membered transition state, followed by oxidative addition of ArI to Cu(I) [63]. Oxidative addition of arylhalide to Cu(I) produces Cu(III) intermediates, for which there is substantial evidence [64][65][66][67]. However, under catalytic conditions, there is no requirement that the copper catalyst pass through an intermediate with a formal oxidation state of +3, which may undoubtedly have a large activation energy. Rather, a concerted pathway through a 4-membered transition state will have less localization of charge. A concerted process for coupling of nucleophiles with arylhalides on copper centers have been proposed by Bacon [68] and were elaborated by Litvak [69] who proposed SET within the 4-membered transition state. It is noteworthy that modern DFT calculations [63] also produce cyclic transition states.</p>Conclusion<p>In conclusion, we observe direct arylation reactions (C-X/C-H; X = halogen) catalyzed by a Cu(I) center stabilized by an ambiphilic ligand. The activation of stable sp 2 C-H bonds in benzene and naphthalene occurs as a result of the catalysis. We favor a mechanism involving 4-membered cyclic transition states for metalation-deprotonation followed by concerted oxidative addition/reductive elimination. The scope of reactivity, including functional group tolerance on the reactants, types of C-H bonds that can be activated, selectivity of C-H bond acti- vation, further optimization studies, and new catalyst design will be topics for further study. The initial results are very encouraging in that an inexpensive copper catalyst at low loading exhibited good activity for the reaction. The observation of high activity using a preformed copper catalyst may assist in the development of new catalysts.</p>Experimental<p>General.

Two oral fluoropyrimidine therapies have been introduced for metastatic colorectal cancer. One is a 5-fluorouracil pro-drug, capecitabine; the other is a combination of tegafur and uracil administered together with leucovorin. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these oral therapies against standard intravenous 5-fluorouracil regimens. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness of the therapies and costs were calculated from the UK National Health Service perspective for drug acquisition, drug administration, and the treatment of adverse events. A cost-minimisation analysis was used; this assumes that the treatments are of equal efficacy, although direct randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparisons of the oral therapies with infusional 5-fluorouracil schedules were not available. The cost-minimisation analysis showed that treatment costs for a 12-week course of capecitabine ( Pounds 2132 ) and tegafur with uracil ( Pounds 3385 ) were lower than costs for the intravenous Mayo regimen ( Pounds 3593 ) and infusional regimens on the de Gramont ( Pounds 6255 ) and Modified de Gramont ( Pounds 3485 ) schedules over the same treatment period .

Among a myriad of biological activities described for xanthone derivatives, the anticancer activity is quite remarkable, but the molecular mechanism is not clearly resolved. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic mechanism of 3,6-di(2,3-epoxypropoxy)xanthone (EPOX), a novel Mcl-1 targeting drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To evaluate the antiangiogenic activity of EPOX, we did cell viability, cell cycle, tube formation assay in vitro, and Matrigel plug assay in vivo. To evaluate the effect of EPOX on the endothelial signaling pathway, we did immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence analysis. Intracellular glutathione levels were determined with the use of monochlorobimane, a glutathione-specific probe. RESULTS: EPOX induced endothelial cell apoptosis in association with proteasome-dependent Mcl-1 degradation. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 resulted in an increase in Mcl-1-free Bim, activation of Bax, and then signaling of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, glutathione depletion and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inactivation was observed in EPOX-treated cells. Glutathione supplementation reversed the inhibitory effects of EPOX on ERK, which increases the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at T(163.) Overexpression of mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) partially reversed the effect of EPOX on Mcl-1 dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, further implicating ERK in the regulation of Mcl-1 stability. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that EPOX induces glutathione depletion, ERK inactivation, and Mcl-1 degradation on endothelial cells, which leads to inhibition of angiogenesis. Our results suggest that EPOX is a novel antiangiogenic agent, making it a promising lead compound for further development in the treatment of angiogenesis-related pathologies.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"mitochondria\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"cancer\\", \\"cell\\", \\"endothelial cell\\", \\"endothelial cells\\", \\"tube\\", \\"endothelial\\", \\"cells\\", \\"Intracellular\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

We consider the problem of human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers and deep learning paradigms. This paper shows that deep activity recognition models (a) provide better recognition accuracy of human activities, (b) avoid the expensive design of handcrafted features in existing systems, and (c) utilize the massive unlabeled acceleration samples for unsupervised feature extraction. Moreover, a hybrid approach of deep learning and hidden Markov models (DL-HMM) is presented for sequential activity recognition. This hybrid approach integrates the hierarchical representations of deep activity recognition models with the stochastic modeling of temporal sequences in the hidden Markov models. We show substantial recognition improvement on real world datasets over state-of-the-art methods of human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the latest generation of smart cell phones now incorporates many diverse and powerful sensors. These sensors include GPS sensors, vision sensors (i.e., cameras), audio sensors (i.e., microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (i.e., magnetic compasses), and acceleration sensors (i.e., accelerometers). The availability of these sensors in mass-marketed communication devices creates exciting new opportunities for data mining and data mining applications. In this paper we describe and evaluate a system that uses phone-based accelerometers to perform activity recognition, a task which involves identifying the physical activity a user is performing. To implement our system we collected labeled accelerometer data from twenty-nine users as they performed daily activities such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing, and then aggregated this time series data into examples that summarize the user activity over 10- second intervals. We then used the resulting training data to induce a predictive model for activity recognition. This work is significant because the activity recognition model permits us to gain useful knowledge about the habits of millions of users passively---just by having them carry cell phones in their pockets. Our work has a wide range of applications, including automatic customization of the mobile device's behavior based upon a user's activity (e.g., sending calls directly to voicemail if a user is jogging) and generating a daily weekly activity profile to determine if a user (perhaps an obese child) is performing a healthy amount of exercise.[2]: [3]: Automatic classification of everyday activities can be used for promotion of health-enhancing physical activities and a healthier lifestyle. In this paper, methods used for classification of everyday activities like walking, running, and cycling are described. The aim of the study was to find out how to recognize activities, which sensors are useful and what kind of signal processing and classification is required. A large and realistic data library of sensor data was collected. Sixteen test persons took part in the data collection, resulting in approximately 31 h of annotated, 35-channel data recorded in an everyday environment. The test persons carried a set of wearable sensors while performing several activities during the 2-h measurement session. Classification results of three classifiers are shown: custom decision tree, automatically generated decision tree, and artificial neural network. The classification accuracies using leave-one-subject-out cross validation range from 58 to 97 for custom decision tree classifier, from 56 to 97 for automatically generated decision tree, and from 22 to 96 for artificial neural network. Total classification accuracy is 82 for custom decision tree classifier, 86 for automatically generated decision tree, and 82 for artificial neural network[4]: Physical-activity recognition via wearable sensors can provide valuable information regarding an individual's degree of functional ability and lifestyle. In this paper, we present an accelerometer sensor-based approach for human-activity recognition. Our proposed recognition method uses a hierarchical scheme. At the lower level, the state to which an activity belongs, i.e., static, transition, or dynamic, is recognized by means of statistical signal features and artificial-neural nets (ANNs). The upper level recognition uses the autoregressive (AR) modeling of the acceleration signals, thus, incorporating the derived AR-coefficients along with the signal-magnitude area and tilt angle to form an augmented-feature vector. The resulting feature vector is further processed by the linear-discriminant analysis and ANNs to recognize a particular human activity. Our proposed activity-recognition method recognizes three states and 15 activities with an average accuracy of 97.9 using only a single triaxial accelerometer attached to the subject's chest.[5]: We describe a new learning procedure, back-propagation, for networks of neurone-like units. The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal âhiddenâ units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.[6]: Smart phones have become a powerful platform for wearable context recognition. We present a service-based recognition architecture which creates an evolving classification system using feedback from the user community. The approach utilizes classifiers based on fuzzy inference systems which use live annotation to personalize the classifier instance on the device. Our recognition system is designed for everyday use: it allows flexible placement of the device (no assumed or fixed position), requires only minimal personalization effort from the user (1â3 minutes per activity) and is capable of detecting a high number of activities. The components of the service are shown in an evaluation scenario, in which recognition rates up to 97 can be achieved for ten activity classes.","answer":"Machine learning algorithms have been used for a wide range of activity recognition applications [3] [4] [2] [1] , allowing the mapping between feature sets and various human activities. The classification of accelerometer samples into static and dynamic activities using MLPs is presented in [4] . Conventional neural networks, including MLPs, often stuck in local optima [5] which leads to poor performance of activity recognition systems. Moreover, training MLPs using backpropagation [5] only hinders the addition of many hidden layers due to the vanishing gradient problem. The authors in [3] used decision trees and MLPs to classify daily human activities. [6] , a fuzzy inference system is designed to detect human activities. [1] compared the recognition accuracy of decision tree (C4.5), logistic regression, and MLPs, where MLPs are found to outperform the other methods. In this paper, we show significant recognition accuracy improvement on real world datasets over state-of-the-art methods for human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers. Additionally, even though some previous works have purportedly reported promising results of activity recognition accuracy, they still require a degree of handcrafted features as discussed below."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Many high-income countries currently experience large outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles despite the availability of highly effective vaccines. This phenomenon lacks an explanation in countries where vaccination rates are rising on an already high level. Here, we build on the growing evidence that belief systems, rather than access to vaccines, are the primary barrier to vaccination in high-income countries, and show how a simple opinion formation process can lead to clusters of unvaccinated individuals, leading to a dramatic increase in disease outbreak probability. In particular, the effect of clustering on outbreak probabilities is strongest when the vaccination coverage is close to the level required to provide herd immunity under the assumption of random mixing. Our results based on computer simulations suggest that the current estimates of vaccination coverage necessary to avoid outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases might be too low. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Since November 2006, Switzerland has been experiencing the largest measles outbreak registered in the country since the introduction of mandatory notification for this disease in 1999. The first eight months of this outbreak have already been described in this journal [1]. From November 2006 to 13 February 2008, 1,405 measles cases were reported by physicians or laboratories in Switzerland (1,106 of them in 2007). Of these, 976 cases (69%) occurred in the cantons of Lucerne (29% of the total), Basel-Land (16%), Zurich (11%) Bern (7%), and Aargau (7%). The incidence for the whole country and all ages, calculated for this 15-month period, was 19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (15 cases per 100,000 for the year 2007). For children under the age of 16 years living in the canton of Lucerne, it was 500 per 100,000. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  If we can lower the number of people needed to vaccinate for a community to be immune against contagious diseases, we can save resources and life. A key to reach such a lower threshold of immunization is to find and vaccinate people who, through their behavior, are more likely to become infected and effective to spread the disease than the average. Fortunately, the very behavior that makes these people important to vaccinate can help us finding them. People you have met recently are more likely to be socially active and thus central in the contact pattern, and important to vaccinate. We propose two immunization schemes exploiting temporal contact patterns. Both of these rely only on obtainable, local information and could implemented in practice. We show that these schemes outperform benchmark protocols in four real data sets under various epidemic scenarios. The data sets are dynamic, which enables us to make more realistic evaluations than other studies - we use information only about the past to perform the vaccination and the future to simulate disease outbreaks. We also use models to elucidate the mechanisms behind how the temporal structures make our immunization protocols efficient. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  The structure of social contact networks strongly influences the dynamics of epidemic diseases. In particular the scale-free structure of real-world social networks allows unlikely diseases with low infection rates to spread and become endemic. However, in particular for potentially fatal diseases, also the impact of the disease on the social structure cannot be neglected, leading to a complex interplay. Here, we consider the growth of a network by preferential attachment from which nodes are simultaneously removed due to an SIR epidemic. We show that increased infectiousness increases the prevalence of the disease and simultaneously causes a transition from scale-free to exponential topology. Although a transition to a degree distribution with finite variance takes place, the network still exhibits no epidemic threshold in the thermodynamic limit. We illustrate these results using agent-based simulations and analytically tractable approximation schemes. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  Most studies on adaptive networks concentrate on the properties of steady state, but neglect transient dynamics. In this study, we pay attention to the emergence of community structure in the transient process and the effects of community-based control strategies on epidemic spreading. First, by normalizing the modularity, we investigate the evolution of community structure during the transient process, and find that a strong community structure is induced by the rewiring mechanism in the early stage of epidemic dynamics, which, remarkably, delays the outbreak of disease. We then study the effects of control strategies started at different stages on the prevalence. Both immunization and quarantine strategies indicate that it is not âthe earlier, the betterâ for the implementation of control measures. And the optimal control effect is obtained if control measures can be efficiently implemented in the period of a strong community structure. For the immunization strategy, immunizing the susceptible nodes on susceptibleâinfected links and immunizing susceptible nodes randomly have similar control effects. However, for the quarantine strategy, quarantining the infected nodes on susceptibleâinfected links can yield a far better result than quarantining infected nodes randomly. More significantly, the community-based quarantine strategy performs better than the community-based immunization strategy. This study may shed new light on the forecast and the prevention of epidemics among humans. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Schools are known to play a significant role in the spread of influenza. High vaccination coverage can reduce infectious disease spread within schools and the wider community through vaccine-induced immunity in vaccinated individuals and through the indirect effects afforded by herd immunity. In general, herd immunity is greatest when vaccination coverage is highest, but clusters of unvaccinated individuals can reduce herd immunity. Here, we empirically assess the extent of such clustering by measuring whether vaccinated individuals are randomly distributed or demonstrate positive assortativity across a United States high school contact network. Using computational models based on these empirical measurements, we further assess the impact of assortativity on influenza disease dynamics. We found that the contact network was positively assortative with respect to influenza vaccination: unvaccinated individuals tended to be in contact more often with other unvaccinated individuals than with vaccinated individuals, and these effects were most pronounced when we analyzed contact data collected over multiple days. Of note, unvaccinated males contributed substantially more than unvaccinated females towards the measured positive vaccination assortativity. Influenza simulation models using a positively assortative network resulted in larger average outbreak size, and outbreaks were more likely, compared to an otherwise identical network where vaccinated individuals were not clustered. These findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing heterogeneities in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake for prevention of large, protracted school-based outbreaks of influenza, in addition to continued efforts to increase overall vaccine coverage. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  The spread of disease through a physical-contact network and the spread of information about the disease on a communication network are two intimately related dynamical processes. We investigate the asymmetrical interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics, each occurring on its own layer, by focusing on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process: epidemic threshold and the final infection ratio. We find that an epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak on the communication layer, and information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold. When structural correlation exists between the two layers, the information threshold remains unchanged but the epidemic threshold can be enhanced, making the contact layer more resilient to epidemic outbreak. We develop a physical theory to understand the intricate interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics. 8. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB008):  Abstract In previous epidemiological studies that address adaptive vaccination decisions, individuals generally act within a single network, which models the population structure. However, in reality, people are typically members of multiplex networks, which have various community structures. For example, a disease transmission network, which directly transmits infectious diseases, does not necessarily correspond with an information propagation network, in which individuals directly or indirectly exchange information concerning health conditions and vaccination strategies. The latter network may also be used for strategic interaction (strategy adaptation) concerning vaccination. Therefore, in order to reflect this feature, we consider the vaccination dynamics of structured populations whose members simultaneously belong to two types of networks: disease transmission and information propagation. Applying intensive numerical calculations, we determine that if the disease transmission network is modeled using a regular graph, such as a lattice population or random regular graph containing individuals of equivalent degrees, individuals should base their vaccination decisions on a different type of network. However, if the disease transmission network is a degree-heterogeneous graph, such as the BarabasiâAlbert scale-free network, which has a heterogeneous degree according to power low, then using the same network for information propagation more effectively prevents the spread of epidemics. Furthermore, our conclusions are unaffected by the relative cost of vaccination.Literature Review:","answer":"Some research uses networks derived from empirical data in order to examine disease-behavior dynamics. We discuss these models in this subsection. Dynamics on different topologies. Heterogeneous contact topology is ubiquitous in reality. To test its potential impact on disease spreading, Martial et al. recently integrated a behavior epidemiology model with decision-making process into three archetypical realistic networks: Poisson Network, Urban Network and Power Law Network  . Under these contact networks, an agent can make decision either based purely on payoff maximization or via imitating the vaccination behavior of its neighbor (as suggest by Eq. (6) ), which is controlled by the fraction of imitators . By means of numerous simulations, they displayed the diploid effect of imitation behavior: it enhances vaccination coverage for low vaccination cost, but impedes vaccination campaign at relatively high cost, which is depicted by Fig. 8 . Surprisingly, in spite of high vaccination coverage, imitation can generate the clusters of non-vaccinating, susceptible agents, which in turn accelerate the large-scale outbreak of infectious disease (namely, imitation behavior, to some extent, impedes the eradication of infectious diseases). This point helps to explain why outbreaks of measles have recently occurred in many countries with high overall vaccination coverage BIB002  BIB003 . With the same social networks, Ref. BIB001 explored the impact of heterogeneous contact patterns on disease outbreak in the compartmental model of SARS. It is interesting that, compared with the prediction of well-mixed population, the same set of basic reproductive number may lead to completely epidemiological outcomes in any two processes, which sheds light to the heterogeneity of SARS around the world. Impact of network mixing patterns. As Ref.  discovered, high vaccination coverage can guarantee herd immunity, which, however, is dramatically affected and even destroyed by clusters of unvaccinated individuals. To evaluate how much influence such clusters possess, a recent work explored the distribution of vaccinated agents during seasonal influenza vaccination through a United States high school contact network BIB007 .

insulator transition  @xcite , and of the conversion from an atomic to a molecular gas  @xcite followed .many of the present - day studies take advantage of the tunability of the atom - atom scattering length in the vicinity of a so - called fano - feshbach resonance  @xcite . as an external magnetic fieldis tuned through its resonance value , the sign of the scattering length changes  @xcite .exactly on resonance , the scattering length is infinitely large , allowing for the study of strongly - correlated systems .experimentally , the speed of the magnetic field ramp can be changed , allowing adiabatic ramps , for example , and the ramp itself can be reversed .it is this versatility that made possible the experimental study of the bcs - bec crossover , using ultracold atomic fermi gases trapped in two different hyperfine states  @xcite .    using present - day technology , the realization of degenerate multi - component atomic fermi gases appears possible in principle .the occupation of more than two different hyperfine states of the same species requires , neglecting for the moment possible losses , only moderate changes of current set - ups .a particularly promising candidate appears to be @xmath1li  @xcite , and the coexistence of three hyperfine states has already been demonstrated for @xmath2k  @xcite .alternatively , a number of goups are presently pursuing the simultaneous trapping of three different atomic species  @xcite . in the former scenario ,the atomic masses of all components are equal , whereas in the latter scenario , the atomic masses of the different components differ . in either of these realizations of multi - component fermi gases , all or some of the interspecies scattering lengths may be tunable thanks to the possible existence of magnetic or optical fano - feshbach resonances .this may open the possibility to experimentally investigate the stability and to study , provided an extended stable regime exists , the behaviors of multi - component fermi gases as a function of the @xmath0-wave scatterig length .    using two different theoretical frameworks, this paper considers three- and four - component fermi gases , and compares their behaviors with those of two - component fermi gases .in particular , we ask how the stability of two - component fermi gases changes when a third or fourth component are added .it is now well established that trapped two - component fermi gases are stable even when the interspecies @xmath0-wave scattering length is negative and its magnitude is infinitely large  @xcite .the stability of inhomogeneous as well as of homogeneous two - component fermi gases with attractive short - range interactions and arbitrary interspecies scattering length can be attributed to the pauli exclusion principle ( also referred to as fermi pressure ) , which introduces effective repulsive intraspecies interactions that more than compensate the attractive interspecies interactions .in contrast , homogeneous bose gases with negative scattering lengths are unstable ; they can , however , be stabilized by an external confining potential as long as the product of the number of bosons and the @xmath0-wave scattering length is less negative than a certain critical value  @xcite .section  [ sec_system ] introduces the hamiltonian of trapped multi - component fermi gases as well as a simple \`\` counting argument '' that turns out to be quite useful in understanding the stability of multi - component fermi gases .section  [ sec_hyper ] investigates the stability of three- and four - component equal - mass fermi gases within a hyperspherical framework , focussing on the large and small particle number limits .the physical picture emerging from the hyperspherical treatment is further investigated in sec .[ sec_mc ] , which solves the many - body schrdinger equation for short - range interactions using monte carlo techniques .finally , sec .[ sec_conclusion ] summarizes and connects our results with those available in the literature  @xcite .the hamiltonian @xmath3 for an atomic fermi gas with @xmath4 components under external spherically symmetric harmonic confinement is given by @xmath5 here , the number of atoms of the @xmath6th component is denoted by @xmath7 , and the total number of atoms is given by @xmath8 , @xmath9 . in eq .( [ eq_ham ] ) , @xmath10 denotes the position vector of the @xmath11th atom of the @xmath6th component , measured with respect to the center of the trap , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively the atomic mass and the angular frequency of the @xmath6th component .the potential @xmath14 describes the interaction between an atom of the @xmath6th and an atom of the @xmath15th component .this work considers a zero - range potential ( see towards the end of this section and sec .[ sec_hyper ] ) and a purely attractive short - range potential ( see sec .[ sec_mc ] ) . in both cases , we characterize the strengths of the @xmath14 by the @xmath0-wave scattering lengths @xmath16 . we assume that the two - body interactions are independent of spin , implying that the number of atoms in each spin state is conserved . throughout this work ,like atoms are taken to be non - interacting , implying @xmath17 for @xmath18 .    in the most general case , the hamiltonian given in eq .( [ eq_ham ] ) has @xmath4 different @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath7 ( @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 different @xmath14 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , resulting in a tremendously large parameter space . to reduce the parameter space ,we first consider the case where all @xmath12 , all @xmath13 , all @xmath7 , and all @xmath16 ( @xmath22 ) are equal .a four - component gas of this type could , e.g. , be realized by equally populating and trapping the four spin states of a fermionic atom whose ground state has vanishing total electronic angular momentum @xmath23 but a non - vanishing nuclear spin @xmath24 of @xmath25 . in this case, the scattering lengths between the different spin substates are equal and @xmath0-wave scattering between two atoms in the same spin substate are forbidden by symmetry .    before solving the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian given in eq .( [ eq_ham ] ) , we present a simple counting analysis . the number @xmath26 of attractive pair interactions @xmath14 , where again @xmath22 , is given by @xmath27 and the number @xmath28 of effectively repulsive interactions , i.e. , the number of like fermion pairs , by @xmath29 table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the values of @xmath26 ,    .[tab1 ] number @xmath26 of attractive interactions , number @xmath28 of effectively repulsive interactions and ratio @xmath30 for finite and infinite @xmath8 for a @xmath4-component fermi gas ( @xmath31 through @xmath32 ) in which all interspecies interactions are equal ( or resonant ) .[ cols=\\"<,^,^,^\\",options=\\"header \\" , ]     this paper investigates the stability of trapped @xmath4-component fermi gases interacting through short -

component fermi systems , @xmath33 , emerges within two different theoretical frameworks : a hyperspherical many - body treatment that employs either the bare or a density - dependent zero - range interaction  @xcite , and a many - body monte carlo treatment , which includes both vmc and fn - dmc calculation and employs finite - range two - body interactions with a range @xmath34 chosen so that the first three - particle state with negative energy appears for @xmath35 much less negative than @xmath36 .both the hyperspherical and the monte carlo frameworks parameterize the nodal surface of the anti - symmetric many - body wave function by the ideal gas nodal surface . in the limit of vanishing confinement and periodic boundary conditions, this corresponds to a wave function that describes a normal state .this paper does not investigate wave functions that include pairing physics or the possibility of phase separation from the outset . for three - component systems , for instance , a bcs mean - field framework predicts the existence of a pairing mechanism in which the atoms of species one and two pair ( forming a superfluid ) while the atoms of species three are in a normal state  @xcite .this pairing mechanism has also been investigated within other theoretical frameworks  @xcite .although the parameter combinations considered in the above cited references is different from those considered in the present paper , we believe that future monte carlo studies of multi - component fermi gases with more than two components should investigate the implications of a many - body wave function that has pairing physics build in from the outset .in particular , it would be interesting to address the question whether a state that contains pairing physics would be stable against the collapse investigated in the present study .if such a stabilizing mechanism existed this would have important consequences for on - going cold atom experiments .    to observe the predicted collapse of multi - component fermi gases with all - resonant interactions , we imagine the following experiment .first , a stable @xmath4-component fermi gas ( @xmath37 ) with vanishing interspecies scattering lengths is prepared .we then imagine that all interspecies scattering lengths be suddenly tuned to the same large negative value .the time scale for this ramp should be fast compared to the time scale at which phase separation might occur and also fast compared to the time scale at which losses due to spin - flip collisions might occur .the attraction between particles would then produce an implosion and collapse of the system .following the implosion , we anticipate that recombination into molecules and clusters will immediately follow once the system reaches high density , and the resulting energy release should detonate a ferminova akin to the bosenova that has been observed experimentally and discussed theoretically  @xcite .the rich dynamics of soliton formation , akin to that observed for bosonic atoms in ref .@xcite could also conceivably ensue .    a second main finding of our work concerns three - component fermi systems with two resonant and one non - resonant interspecies scattering lengths .the behavior of these systems depends strongly on the range @xmath34 of the underlying two - body potential . for very small@xmath34 , an instability similar to that for the three - component system with all - resonant interactions appears to arise , although at much more negative @xmath35 . for larger @xmath34, the many - body system may be made up of weakly - bound trimers and may be stable all the way up to unitarity .we note that the importance of the range parameter , or a three - body parameter , was already pointed out in earlier work  @xcite .future studies should investigate in more detail whether a fermi system consisting of weakly- or strongly - bound trimers could be realized experimentally .finally , we note that multi - component fermi gases have recently also been investigated in one - dimensional space  @xcite .assuming zero - range interactions , many properties of the multi - component system can be obtained analytically through the exact bethe ansatz . for negative coupling constant ,the ground state of @xmath4-component fermi gases contains clusters that consist of @xmath4-atoms ( one of each species ) .it is suggested that one - dimensional three - component fermi gases undergo a phase transition that is analogous to the quark color superconductor state  @xcite . in the future , it would be interesting to investigate whether such a transition also exists in three - dimensional three - component fermi gases .clearly , more work is needed to better understand the behavior of three - dimensional multi - component fermi gases , including the implications of different two - body ranges and different nodal surfaces of the guiding function employed in the monte carlo study .this work investigated the behavior of multi - component fermi gases for different scattering lengths and two - body ranges . in cases where three - body states with negative energy exist, it will be important to determine if the range of the two - body parameter is indeed the relavant parameter ; it may be that the trimer binding energy is a more natural quantity .","answer":"two - component equal - mass fermi gases , in which unlike atoms interact through a short - range two - body potential and like atoms do not interact , are stable even when the interspecies @xmath0-wave scattering length becomes infinitely large . solving the many - body schrdinger equation within a hyperspherical framework and by monte carlo techniques ,  this paper investigates how the properties of trapped two - component gases change if a third or fourth component are added .  if all interspecies scattering lengths are equal and negative , our calculations suggest that both three- and four - component fermi gases become unstable for a certain critical set of parameters . the relevant length scale associated with the collapse  is set by the interspecies scattering length and we argue that the collapse is , similar to the collapse of an attractive trapped bose gas , a many - body phenomenon . furthermore , we consider a three - component fermi gas in which two interspecies scattering lengths are negative while the other interspecies scattering length is zero . in this case , the stability of the fermi system is predicted to depend appreciably on the range of the underlying two -

BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a devastating disease with an overall poor prognosis. Despite the recent advances in targeted molecular therapies, there is a clear and urgent need for the identification of novel mesothelioma targets for the development of highly efficacious therapeutics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we report that the expression of Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SphK1) protein was preferentially elevated in MPM tumor tissues (49 epithelioid and 13 sarcomatoid) compared to normal tissue (nâ=â13). In addition, we also observed significantly elevated levels of SphK1 and SphK2 mRNA and SphK1 protein expression in MPM cell lines such as H2691, H513 and H2461 compared to the non-malignant mesothelial Met5 cells. The underlying mechanism appears to be mediated by SphK1 induced upregulation of select gene transcription programs such as that of CBP/p300 and PCAF, two histone acetyl transferases (HAT), and the down regulation of cell cycle dependent kinase inhibitor genes such as p27Kip1 and p21Cip1. In addition, using immunoprecipitates of anti-acetylated histone antibody from SphK inhibitor, SphK-I2 treated Met5A and H2691 cell lysates, we also showed activation of other cell proliferation related genes, such as Top2A (DNA replication), AKB (chromosome remodeling and mitotic spindle formation), and suppression of p21 CIP1 and p27KIP1. The CDK2, HAT1 and MYST2 were, however, unaffected in the above study. Using SphK inhibitor and specific siRNA targeting either SphK1 or SphK2, we also unequivocally established that SphK1, but not SphK2, promotes H2691 mesothelioma cell proliferation. Using a multi-walled carbon nanotubes induced peritoneal mesothelioma mouse model, we showed that the SphK1-/- null mice exhibited significantly less inflammation and granulamatous nodules compared to their wild type counterparts. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The lipid kinase SphK1 plays a positive and essential role in the growth and development of malignant mesothelioma and is therefore a likely therapeutic target.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"HAT\\", \\"p27KIP1\\", \\"HAT1\\", \\"CDK2\\", \\"CBP\\", \\"MYST2\\", \\"SphK\\", \\"SphK2\\", \\"Top2A\\", \\"cell cycle dependent kinase inhibitor\\", \\"p27Kip1\\", \\"Sphingosine kinase 1\\", \\"AKB\\", \\"histone acetyl transferases\\", \\"PCAF\\", \\"Sphingosine Kinase 1\\", \\"histone\\", \\"lipid kinase\\", \\"p21Cip1\\", \\"p300\\", \\"SphK1\\", \\"CBP/p300\\", \\"p21 CIP1\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

After bootstraping, we used an ANOVA model to compare mean cumulative incidence proportions between pandemic phases, within each age group. We used an alternating logistic regression model (ALR) with an exchangeable log Odds Ratio (OR) to test the intra-household correlation-adjusted association between factors and the seroconversion outcome. Data were analysed with respect to subject age. Initially, four age groups were considered: the children and adolescents (,20 yrs), young adults (20-39 yrs), middle-age adults (40-59 yrs), and elderly adults (60 yrs). As the cumulative incidence of infection of the second and third groups were very close, both groups were merged into one adults group (20-59 yrs). Therefore we refer further in our study to three age groups: children and adolescents (,20 yrs), adults (20-59 yrs), elderly (60 yrs). A total of 2,164 individuals from 772 households were enrolled between weeks 30 and 44 in the CoPanFlu-RUN cohort, allowing the collection of 1,932 sera at inclusion (sample 1). During this period, 136 households (17.7% of households) containing 464 individuals (21.4% of individuals) reported at least one case of ILI. Sixty subjects among the 464 individuals (12.9%, belonging to 33 households [24.3%]) were qRT-PCR positive, which documented the pH1N1/2009v infection. No positive qRT-PCR could be detected after week 37 and no ILI was reported after week 40, the end of the epidemic wave. The second follow up serum sample (sample 2) was obtained for 1,759 subjects at least five weeks after the end of the epidemic wave (weeks 45-52) which allowed the constitution of a serobank of 1,687 paired-sera. The profile of the cohort and the major outcomes are displayed in Figure 1 . Details on inclusions and serum sample timing with respect to the circulation of pH1N1/2009v over the island are provided in figure 2 . The socio-demographic and space-time characteristics of the cohort are detailed in Table 1 . Compared to the community of Reunion Island, the sample of 1,687 individuals for whom pairedsera were available, was older (,20 yrs: 27% vs 35%, and 60 yrs: 17,9% vs 11,3%) and composed of a slight excess of females (54.1% vs 51.5%). The imbalance was due to a deficit in subjects aged under 40 years, reflecting men at work and the fact that parents declined the second serum for children younger than five. Baseline-proxy (,pre-epidemic) HIA titers to the pH1N1/ 2009v were measured on sample 1 ( Table 2) , obtained from 249 subjects (103 households) recruited at the very beginning of the investigation during weeks 30 and 31 (phase A, Figure 2 ), when the epidemic activity in the cohort was still very low. Age distribution in this group was similar to that of the whole cohort (data not shown). The overall, the baseline-proxy seroprevalence rate (HIA 1/40), over all ages, was 43.4% (95%CI: 37.4%-49.6%). However the majority of positive sera had low antibody titers, at the cut off value for confirmation (i.e. = 1/40). The proportions of sera with HIA titer .1/40 were 0%, 3.0% and 24.6% in the young, middle-aged and older age groups respectively. These results indicate that pre-epidemic baseline antibody cross reactivity was stronger in the elderly (60 yrs) and weaker in children and adolescents (,20 yrs) and adults (20-59 yrs), with highly significant differences between age groups (P,0.0001). The reverse cumulative distribution curves of HIA titers are displayed for each age group and for the whole cohort on Figure 3 . The proportion of seropositive sera (HI 1/40) steadily increased during the epidemic unfolding (phase B, W32-39) and in immediate post epidemic period (phase C, W40-44) when it reached its maximum level, then declined in the late post epidemic period (phase D, W45-52). This decline was significant enough to return the reverse cumulative distribution curve to baseline levels in the elderly. The cumulative incidence rates, obtained after subtraction of the age-specific baseline-proxy seroprevalence from the raw seroprevalence at each phase of the epidemic are shown in Table 2 (note that the cumulative incidence rates of infection represented for the group ''all ages'' were standardized according to age structure of the community). The cumulative incidence rates were much higher in children and adolescents (,20 yrs), indicating very active transmission of infection within this age group. As mentioned earlier, cumulative incidence rates peaked in phase C (W40-44), and then declined indicating some lability of the humoral immune response against the pH1N1/2009v. The age-related difference observed in the incidence rates was highly statistically significant (P,0.0001). To estimate more appropriately the decline of antibody titers occurring after the peak of the humoral response to the pH1N1/ 2009v, we considered paired-sera from the group of 264 subjects for whom the first serum sample (sample 1) was obtained just after the epidemic wave (phase C, W40-44), and the corresponding second sample was collected at the end of the survey (phase D, W45-52). Seronegation rates were 27.0% (61/226) for all age groups, 17.4% (12/69) in children and adolescents (,20 yrs), 32.3% (41/127) in adults (20-59 yrs) and 26.7% (8/30) in the elderly (60 yrs). Differences between the seronegation rates according to age were statistically weakly significant (P = 0.0671). We then considered the 1687 individuals for whom paired sera were available and we measured the seroconversion rates according to age and to the time of first serum sample collection (phase A, B or C). Criteria of seroconversion were defined in the method section. As shown in table 3, there was a sharp decline in seroconversion rates across all the age groups, depending on whether participants were enrolled during phase A, phase B, or phase C (P,0.0001). To interpret these data, one should remember that antibodies at seroprotective levels (HIA 1/40), in serum samples 1 collected during the per epidemic phase B or early post epidemic phase C could represent either base line cross reactive antibodies or rising pH1N1/2009 specific antibodies due to a recent or ongoing infection. This ambiguity could lead to underestimation of the seroconversion rate for subjects enrolled in phases B and C. In order to solve this ambiguity, we specifically considered the group of 249 subjects in whom cross reactive antibodies were detected at the time of phase A (W30-31). The seroconversion rate of this group is the most indicative of the exposure of individuals to the whole epidemic wave. It was the highest (63,2%, P,0.0001) in children and adolescents (,20 yrs), and still significantly high in adults (39.4%, P,0.0001). We then tested in this particular group, the impact of (baseline) pre-epidemic cross reactive antibodies on the rate of seroconversion to pH1N1/2009 (Table 4) . No subject with HIA titer superior to 1/40 had evidence of seroconversion to pH1N1/2009. The seroconversion rate in individuals with a HIA titer equal to 1/40 was linked with age, being more important in children and adolescents (,20 yrs). The highest seroconversion rate (.56%) was registered in subjects with HIA titers inferior to 1/40, particularly for the under 20 years where it reached 85%. Hence, the risk of seroconversion decreased when pre-epidemic HIA titer was high after controlling for age (P,0.0001) (Figure 4) . The multivariate adjusted odds ratio for seroconversion were 0.15 (95%CI: 0.06-0.37, P,0.0001) per two-fold increase in baseline titer, 1.79 (95%CI: 1.23-2.59, P,0.003) per other household members who seroconverted, 5.33 (95%CI: 1.56-19.27, P,0.008) Figure 1 . The cohort profile and major outcomes. Figure 1 details the three phases of the protocol: i) inclusion (weeks 30-44) and serum samples S1 collection; ii) follow up for detection of ILI in households, qRT-PCR on nasal swabs and estimation of cumulative seroincidence rates; iii) end of the study (weeks 45-52) and samples S2 collection. HIA on paired sera (S1+S2) allowed estimating seroconversion rates. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025738.g001 Bp (baseline-proxy) seroprevalence rates were estimated on weeks 30-31 in each age group. b Cumulative incidence rates measured the raise between raw seroprevalence rates and age-specific baseline-proxy seroprevalence rate. In the group ''All ages'', cumulative incidence rates were standardized according to age structure of the community. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025738.t002 Data are numbers, percentages (95% confidence intervals) and ALR parameter test P value for comparison of seroconversion proportions according to time of first sample (S1) collection at inclusion, in each age group, after controlling for household selection. In the group ''All ages'', rates of seroconversion were standardized according to age structure of the community. NA: not assessed. Seroconversion was defined as a shift from seronegative at inclusion (i.e. HIA titer ,1/40) to seropositive on follow-up sample, or as a 4-fold increase of reciprocal HIA titer between first and second paired samples for sera tested seropositive on inclusion (i.e. HIA titer 1/40). for age ,20 years (vs age 60 years) and 11.35 (95%CI: 0.41-4.47, P = 0.62) for age 20-60 years (vs age 60 years). The observed and predicted seroconversion rates according to age and baseline HIA titer are displayed Figure 4 . Finally, we considered the 46 subjects who had been infected by the pandemic virus over the course of the study, verified by a positive qRT-PCR nasal swab, and for whom paired sera were available. Initial HIA antibody titers in this group were ,1/40, The CoPanFlu-RUN cohort was set up to conduct a prospective population-based study investigating the herd immunity induced by the 2009 pandemic influenza virus and identifying risk factors for pH1N1/2009v infection from paired sera collected in an entire community. Most works published to date have used either extensive cross-sectional serosurveys on pre-and post-epidemic independent serum samples, the baseline immunity being assessed from stored frozen samples [5, 7, 8] , or non representative adult cohorts (military, health care workers, long-stay patients). Antibody titers were measured by HIA using a cut-off value set at 1/40 as classically recommended. This HIA titer at 1/40 is considered protective, i.e. conferring 50% protection against a viral challenge [20] . Our assay has introduced some changes in the experimental protocol compared to the classic one. The use of a non-inactivated viral antigen, i.e. a native virus, with nondenatured epitopes probably allows detection of antibodies to epitopes of the hemagglutinin not detected in the classic HIA test. This can induce slight differences in the sensitivity of detection of cross-reacting antibodies, but this does not modify the kinetics of Ab and the epidemiological evolution of seroprevalence and does not jeopardize the global comparability of serological results. This is confirmed by the fact that our HI assay detected seroprotective antibody titers in 93.5% and gave evidence seroconversion in 73.9% of qRT-PCR confirmed pH1N1/2009 influenza, all figures close to those reported in the literature [5, 21] . We considered that titers of .1/40, in sera collected from individuals enrolled during weeks 30 and 31 were cross reactive antibodies and not de novo antibodies triggered by the pandemic virus and hence used them as a proxy for baseline pre epidemic immunity. Several arguments support this assumption: i) the first case indicating autochthonous transmission in Reunion Island was reported by the epidemiological surveillance department of La RÃ©union on 21st July (week 30), i.e. the same day when inclusion started in our study cohort; ii) 7 to 15 days are required to develop an antibody response after viral infection; iii) On weeks 30 and 31, the epidemic activity due to the pandemic virus was very low in our study cohort and it became significant only after week 32. Hence, during weeks 30-31, 103 households were recruited and only 2 households reported ILI cases. Nasal swabs collected from these 2 individuals were tested qRT-PCR negative to the pandemic virus whereas one had evidence of coronavirus and rhinovirus using a multiplex RT-PCR to respiratory viruses (H. Pascalis, manuscript in preparation). In contrast, during weeks 32 to 39, 199 individuals belonging to 99 households reported ILI, among whom 60 individuals had documented infection by the pandemic virus. Our study shows that a substantial proportion of Reunion Island's population had pre-existing immunity to 2009 pandemic influenza virus with the highest baseline-proxy seroprevalence rate observed among adults aged of 60 years or more. Other studies from all continents had also reported high pre-epidemic seropositivity rates among the elderly [5, 6, 8, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , though large variations do exist between countries [10, 11, 23, 27, 28] .

Please answer the question.

Finally, we design a novel mechanism that intuitively models a polyphonic structure of piano performance. In particular, we insert intermediate steps for chordwise encoding and decoding of the piano performance to our encoder-decoder architecture, where a chord denotes a group of simultaneous notes. Our approach has several contributions as follows:1) Our system aims to control musical expression while maintaining any characteristics induced by a given musical structure;2) We use self-supervised learning where new supervisory signals are involved in regularizing the latent representations effectively;3) Our system aims to control multiple expressive attributes independently of each other;4) Lastly, we leverage an intermediate step that projects a notewise representation into the chordwise in the middle of our system to intuitively model the polyphonic structure of piano performance. Inspired by previous studies [4, 8, 9, 32], we build a twostep encoder and decoder: An encoder models both notewise and chordwise dependencies of the inputs, and a decoder reconstructs the notewise dependency from the chordwise representation and the notewise condition. We denote a chord as a group of notes that are hit simultaneously, regardless of the staff, so that they sound together at an instant time [33]. Thus, learning the chordwise dependency is analogous to direct modeling of the temporal progression of the piano performance. Let M 2 RCâN be a matrix that aligns serialized notes to their polyphonic structure, where C and N are the number of chords and the number of notes, respectively. Within the encoder, theQuestion: Why didn't the authors intend a \\"chord\\" to represent a more meaningful unit in music, such as a beat?","answer":"The authors intend a \\"chord\\" to represent simultaneous notes to intuitively models a polyphonic structure of piano performance that is defined by its temporal progression.
