Give 5 proven strategies for making sales. Keep the blog below 300 words.","answer":"Neuroscience has confirmed that we often spend until it literally hurts. The key is in understanding how much money has to be spent before we reach that threshold. There are three types of spenders:1.\\tSpender One: The proverbial tightwad. He hates spending money no matter what the reason. He rarely shops. He never sees the need to spend money on anything.2.\\tSpender Two: The Shopaholics. They will shop till they drop or until their credit card maxes out. Their tolerance for \\"spending pain\\" is extremely high. 3.\\tSpender Three: This is the largest group. They are the middle-of-the-road, average consumers. They spend when necessary and occasionally just for fun, entertainment, or amusement. They try to stay on a budget and save whenever possible.It doesn't take a genius to realize that the tightwads are going to be the hardest group to sell to. If you can get them to make a purchase, you can sell anything to anyone! Believe it or not, there are actually some scientifically proven ways to minimize the buying pain that tightwads, and other buyers, experience when making a purchase. These are simple but powerful tools that you can start using right away to increase sales.

The borrower (issuer) issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the time at which the loaned funds (bond principal) must be paid back (maturity date). The interest payment (the coupon) is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate.The initial price of most bonds is typically set at at par, or 1,000 face value per individual bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on a number of factors: the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment at the time. The face value of the bond is what will be paid back to the lender once the bond matures.Most bonds can be sold by the initial bondholder to other investors after they have been issued.

Keep it between 200 and 300 words.","answer":"There was once a toilet that lived in an old, enormous mansion. The mansion had been long abandoned but was never torn down due to its prominent history. No one lived in the mansion, but the home was open to the public for tours. The toilet had been there for centuries and had seen thousands of people wander through the mansion's many hallways. One day, the toilet saw a person walking through the hallway. The toilet looked out the window and saw that it was nighttime, and the mansion was not open for tours during the night. Confused, the toilet intently watched the person walk into the bathroom. They closed the door, glanced in the mirror, and fixed their hair. The toilet watched this peculiar behavior and was shocked as the person walked through the door without opening it and disappeared on the other side.It was on that day that the toilet realized he was able to see ghosts. This was the first time it had ever seen a ghost in its life, and the toilet began to wonder if there were more ghosts in the mansion and if so, how long they have lived there. The toilet patiently waited until night to see the ghost again. Around the same time, another ghost appeared suddenly in the bathroom and adjusted its tie in the mirror. The toilet was absolutely astounded and wondered if all the people in the supposed tours that he had seen over the years were real people or ghosts."},{"question":"What animal cannot stick out its tongue?","answer":"A crocodile is unable to move its tongue because it is attached to a membrane in the roof of its mouth.

Each one needs to have a research study to back it up. ","answer":"Here are three ideas you can write about: 1. The role of media in conduct disorder. Children who are exposed to violence in movies, tv shows, and video games are more likely to engage in these behaviors themselves. A 2010 analytic review of 136 studies, published in Psychological Bulletin, showed that exposure to violent media is associated with increased aggression, decreased empathy, and decreased prosocial behavior, all of which are risk factors for conduct disorder. 2. The causes of conduct disorder. There has been much research on the role of both genetics and environment in conduct disorder. In a 2018 article published in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, the authors review research on gene-environment interactions. They conclude that there are a number of genes that have been linked to conduct disorder, but the effects of these genes aren't always clear. They also note that various environmental factors have been linked to conduct disorder. 3. The prognosis of children with conduct disorder. A 1999 article published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry examined the long-term outcome of children and adolescents with conduct disorder. The authors found that with early intervention and treatment, children with conduct disorder can grow up to be happy and productive.

Notable patients in the movie were played by Danny Devito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif.The movie takes place in a mental hospital and starts with the patients playing a game of cards until you see RP McMurphy get admitted and he shakes up the \\"normalcy\\" of the ward and pushes Nurse Ratched every opportunity he gets. There are regular meetings run by Nurse Ratched. Early on, Nurse Ratched starts the meeting by having one of the patients tell the story about how his wife is cheating on him, and she wants the group to share their thoughts on the matter. Near the end of the meeting, the camera focuses on Jack Nicholson's character, as he is eyeing Nurse Ratched suspiciously and then shows her face. You can feel Jack Nicholson's emotion of wondering what Nurse Ratched's true intentions are.The movie follows a similar format with a good amount of runtime showing the meetings, but slowly RP McMurphy involves himself more so and tries to allow himself and the patients to have more fun. He wants to be able to watch the world series, which Nurse Ratched would allow if over half the patients voted yes on it. First, only a few people want to watch, then RP McMurphy convinces more and more of the patients to vote yes, but Nurse Ratched again doesn't allow it when she counts the patients that didn't attend the meeting as no votes. During the movie, RP McMurphy gets close to the Chief, a Native American who the staff believes is dumb and deaf. They enjoy a basketball game with the orderlies and Chief plays a big role in scoring baskets for the patients' team and holding the net and pushing the ball through the opponent's basket so it doesn't count."},{"question":"Write a poem about a mug filled with money.","answer":"You get home, relax and empty your pocketsPhone here, keys there, jacket on the hook in the hallwayThe coins have their own spaceDropped in a mug Clink, ClinkThis mug is filled with the valuable remains of the end of the daySome copper, some silver, some aluminum This mug contains so much moreA new video game, a pair of new shoes, a ticket to a concertEven more than thatA fancy meal, a night of drinking with the boys, that new set of tools you've been wantingMuch more than thatAn old-school scooter, a brand-new television, a flight to see your relatives in another stateYou sit down, relax, and close your eyesThinking about the possibilities of the next day."},{"question":"According to the tone of this text, is it fortunate or unfortunate that NASA called it off with Lunar Flashlight?While the CubeSat couldn’t reach the lunar South Pole to help seek ice, it fulfilled several technology goals that will empower future missions for the benefit of humanity.NASA’s Lunar Flashlight launched on Dec. 11, 2022, to demonstrate several new technologies, with an ultimate goal to seek out surface ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the Moon’s South Pole. Since then, the briefcase-size satellite’s miniaturized propulsion system – the first of its kind ever flown – proved unable to generate enough thrust to get into lunar orbit, despite months of effort by the operations team. Because the CubeSat cannot complete maneuvers to stay in the Earth-Moon system, NASA has called an end to the mission.NASA relies on technology demonstrations to fill specific knowledge gaps and to test new technologies. Used for the first time beyond Earth’s orbit, Lunar Flashlight’s propulsion system and green fuel were such demonstrations. Although the propulsion system was unable to produce the desired thrust – likely because of debris buildup in the thruster fuel lines – newly developed propulsion system components exceeded performance expectations.Also surpassing expectations were Lunar Flashlight’s never-before-flown Sphinx flight computer – a low-power computer developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California to withstand the radiation of deep space – and the spacecraft’s upgraded Iris radio. Featuring a new precision navigation capability, the radio can be used by future small spacecraft to rendezvous and land on solar system bodies.“Technology demonstrations are, by their nature, higher risk and high reward, and they’re essential for NASA to test and learn,” said Christopher Baker, program executive for Small Spacecraft Technology in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Lunar Flashlight was highly successful from the standpoint of being a testbed for new systems that had never flown in space before. Those systems, and the lessons Lunar Flashlight taught us, will be used for future missions.”The mission’s miniaturized four-laser reflectometer, a science instrument that had never flown before, either, also tested successfully, giving the mission’s science team confidence that the laser would have been able to detect ice if it were present at the lunar surface.“It’s disappointing for the science team, and for the whole Lunar Flashlight team, that we won’t be able to use our laser reflectometer to make measurements at the Moon,” said Barbara Cohen, the mission’s principal investigator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “But like all the other systems, we collected a lot of in-flight performance data on the instrument that will be incredibly valuable to future iterations of this technique.”Propulsion System Performance ChallengesDespite the mission’s technological wins, Lunar Flashlight’s miniaturized propulsion system struggled to provide sufficient thrust to put the CubeSat on course for the planned near-rectilinear halo orbit that would have given the spacecraft weekly flybys of the Moon’s South Pole.The team suspects that debris obstructed the fuel lines, causing the diminished and inconsistent thrust. The miniaturized propulsion system included an additively manufactured fuel feed system that likely developed the debris – such as metal powder or shavings – and obstructed fuel flow to the thrusters, limiting their performance. Although the team devised a creative method for using just one thruster to maneuver the spacecraft, Lunar Flashlight needed more consistent thrust to reach its planned orbit.The operations team calculated a new orbit that could be reached using the spacecraft’s small amount of potential remaining thrust. The plan called for putting the CubeSat on a path that would place it in orbit around Earth rather than the Moon, with monthly flybys of the lunar South Pole. While this would have meant fewer flybys, the spacecraft would have flown closer to the surface.With the mission running out of time to arrive at the needed orbit, the operations team tried to dislodge any debris from the fuel lines by increasing the fuel pressure well beyond the propulsion system’s designed capacity. Despite limited success, the required trajectory correction maneuvers couldn’t be completed in time.“The student operations team at Georgia Tech, with assistance from JPL and NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, rose to the challenge and came up with an incredible array of inventive techniques to utilize what tiny amount of thrust Lunar Flashlight’s propulsion system could deliver,” said John Baker, Lunar Flashlight project manager at JPL. “We learned a lot and honed new methods and strategies for working with tiny spacecraft.”After having traveled out past the Moon, Lunar Flashlight is now moving back toward Earth and will fly past our planet with a close approach of about 40,000 miles (65,000 kilometers) on May 17. The CubeSat will then continue into deep space and orbit the Sun. It continues to communicate with mission operators, and NASA is weighing options for the future of the spacecraft.More About the MissionLunar Flashlight is managed for NASA by JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California. The CubeSat is operated by Georgia Tech, including graduate and undergraduate students. The Lunar Flashlight science team is led by NASA Goddard and includes team members from the University of California, Los Angeles; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; and the University of Colorado.The CubeSat’s propulsion system was developed by NASA Marshall in Huntsville, Alabama, with development and integration support from Georgia Tech. NASA’s Small Business Innovation Research program funded component development from small businesses including Plasma Processes Inc. (Rubicon) for thruster development, Flight Works for pump development, and Beehive Industries (formerly Volunteer Aerospace) for specific 3D-printed components. The Air Force Research Laboratory also contributed financially to the development of Lunar Flashlight’s propulsion system. Lunar Flashlight is funded by the Small Spacecraft Technology program based at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley and within NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate.","answer":"It is unfortunate that the Lunar Flashlight CubeSat could not reach the desired orbit around the Moon.

What is it made of and who designed it?","answer":"The Statue of Liberty is a massive copper statue located in the New York Harbor in New York City, USA. The statue is 151 feet and 1 inch tall and is covered in 300 sheets of coin-thin copper. It was designed by French sculptor Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, who conceptualized the statue in 1865. He and other like-minded French citizens decided to build the statue as a monument to American freedom and intended to gift it to the United States in hopes of strengthening the bond of friendship between their countries. After two decades of work, the statue was shipped to America and dedicated in 1886."},{"question":"Give me the plan name and contact information for this insurance policy.Plan / Product InformationActive CoverageInsurance Type Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)Plan / Product PPO DENTALGroup Number 286158Group Name BLOXROUTE LABS, INCActive CoveragePlan / Product Blue Choice PreferredService TypesHealth Benefit Plan CoveragePayer DetailsOther or Additional PayersPayer BCBSFNo Additional Payer InformationProvider DetailsRequesting ProviderName GOTTLIEB, JONATHANNPI 1649335639Submitter ID G0BTYContact Following Entity for Eligibility or Benefit InformationName AIM Specialty HealthType Utilization Management OrganizationContact InformationP: 866-455-8415www.aimspecialtyhealth.comService TypesDiagnostic LabAUTH REQUIRED UNKNOWN: CANNOT DETERMINE IF THIS BENEFIT REQUIRES AN AUTHORIZATION.Name AIM Specialty HealthType Utilization Management OrganizationContact InformationP: 866-455-8415www.aimspecialtyhealth.comService TypesDiagnostic X-RayAUTH REQUIRED UNKNOWN: CANNOT DETERMINE IF THIS BENEFIT REQUIRES AN AUTHORIZATION.Name AIM Specialty HealthType Utilization Management OrganizationContact InformationP: 866-455-8415www.aimspecialtyhealth.comService TypesSurgicalAUTH REQUIRED UNKNOWN: CANNOT DETERMINE IF THIS BENEFIT REQUIRES AN AUTHORIZATION.Benefit DisclaimerUNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY STATE LAW, THIS NOTICE IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT.

The hoard is thought to have been buried sometime between 600 and 650 CE. "},{"question":"Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answersOver 5,000 previously unknown sea creatures, including sea sponges, worms and urchins, were discovered in a pristine, almost untouched area of the Pacific Ocean that might soon become the site of mineral mining operations.Large-scale environmental surveys were previously conducted there from the late 1970s to early 1990s, but only compiled lists with informal species names and very few formal species descriptions.Scientists now compiled these informal lists and published their results in a peer-reviewed study on May 25 in the journal Current Biology. According to their estimates, they found a total of 5,578 different species in the region, an estimated 88%–92% of which were described for the first time ever.The region where all of the new species were discovered is called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 6 million sq. km. area roughly twice the size of India, lying between Hawaii, Kiribati, and Mexico in the central and eastern Pacific. “We share this planet with all this amazing biodiversity, and we have a responsibility to understand it and protect it,” Muriel Rabone, a deep-sea ecologist at the Natural History Museum London, told the website Eurekalert.In the course of decades of exploration missions in the CCZ, over 100,000 creatures were recorded. The researchers found that only six of these had ever been seen in other regions, after combing through all the files. The most common species they found in the remote region were arthropods (invertebrates with segmented joints), worms, echinoderms (spiny invertebrates like sea urchins), and sponges.“There are some just remarkable species down there. Some of the sponges look like classic bath sponges, and some look like vases. They’re just beautiful,” said Rabone of the CCZ samples. “One of my favorites is the glass sponges. They have these little spines, and under the microscope, they look like tiny chandeliers or little sculptures. There are so many wonderful species in the CCZ, and with the possibility of mining looming, it’s doubly important that we know more about these really understudied habitats.”The rise in global demand for metals like cobalt and nickel has created unprecedented interest in deep-sea habitats which possess mineral resources. Exploration of the CCZ for minerals began in 1960, and today 1.2 million sq. km. are divided up and assigned to 17 companies for future deep-sea mining.The scientists expect the overall number of species in the region to continue to climb, as vast areas of the CCZ still haven't been explored.

Here is a sampling of special activities you can consider doing with your family during the fall season:• Apple Picking: Apples are synonymous with fall, and a visit to a local orchard to spend the day picking apples together is a perfect fall activity. Not only is it a great way to get fresh apples for baking or eating, but it is also a fun way to enjoy the outside.• Have a Fall Baking Day: Have a fall-inspired baking extravaganza. You can use the apples you collected at the orchard and bake apple pies or make some pumpkin bread or cinnamon rolls together. Not only will you enjoy delicious treats, but it's also a fantastic opportunity for family bonding and creativity. • Visit a Pumpkin Patch: Another stereotypical fall activity is a trip to a nearby pumpkin patch to explore the fields, pick pumpkins, and take a hayride or join in a pumpkin carving contest.• Pumpkin carving: Take the pumpkins you got at the pumpkin patch and have a pumpkin carving session with your family. Choose fun designs, create spooky or funny faces, and show off your carved pumpkins as Halloween decorations.• Fall Hiking: Another thing synonymous with fall is stunning fall foliage. Go for a family hike in a scenic location to get an up close and personal view. Choose a trail that specifically offers beautiful views of autumn colors and enjoy the cool crisp fall air. You can even collect some leaves for crafts.• Leaf Crafts: Take the colorful leaves you collected on your hike and create different leaf-themed crafts at home. You can do leaf rubbings, create leaf collages, or even press and preserve the leaves in a fall-themed scrapbook.• Go To a Harvest Festival: Check for local harvest festivals or fairs happening in your area. These events often feature activities like hayrides, live music, farm games, and delicious fall-themed food. It's a great opportunity for family fun and community engagement.• Visit a Corn Maze: Grab your family and wander a corn maze to challenge your navigational skills. It's a fun and engaging way to spend time together as a family.• Go On a Fall Picnic: Pack a picnic basket and a blanket with warm drinks, sandwiches, and seasonal goodies. Find a pretty spot in a park or by a lake where you can view fall foliage and enjoy a relaxing afternoon picnic.• Take a Scenic Train Ride: Depending on where you live, many areas offer scenic train rides during the fall season. You can ride and view picturesque landscapes and autumn foliage. • A Campfire and S'mores: Get a cozy campfire going in your backyard. Roast hotdogs and marshmallows, make s'mores, and share spooky campfire stories while enjoying the warmth of the fire.• Nature Photography: Go on a photography outing in a local park, forest, or garden. You can capture both autumn's and your family's beauty through your lens.There are so many fun things to do in the fall, but the most important thing is spending quality time together as a family and creating memories. Have fun! Hopefully, this list will give you some ideas to get you started."},{"question":"Who is Kevin Plank? Where did he go to college?Under Armour was founded on September 25, 1996, by Kevin Plank, a then-24 year old former special teams captain of the University of Maryland football team. Plank initially began the business from his grandmother's basement in Washington, D.C.[4] He spent his time traveling along the East Coast with nothing but apparel in the trunk of his car. His first team sale came at the end of 1996 with a 17,000 sale. From his grandmother's Washington, D.C.-area rowhouse, Plank moved to Baltimore.[5]As a fullback at the University of Maryland, Plank got tired of having to change out of the sweat-soaked T-shirts worn under his jersey; however, he noticed that his compression shorts worn during practice stayed dry. This inspired him to make a T-shirt using moisture-wicking synthetic fabric.[5] After graduating from the University of Maryland, Plank developed his first prototype of the shirt, which he gave to his Maryland teammates and friends who had gone on to play in the NFL. Plank soon improved the design, creating a new T-shirt built from microfibers that wicked moisture away.[4] Major competing brands including Nike, Adidas and Reebok would soon follow with their own moisture-wicking apparel.[6] Plank opted to use the British spelling \\"armour\\" in the company name because the toll-free vanity number was still available for that version.[7]","answer":"Kevin Plank is the founder of Under Armour.

The test flight depicted in the video took around 10 minutes, according to CAS Space.The company has been carrying out such tests during the first few months of 2023, according to a press statement on April 4. Landing the first stage of a rocket on a sea platform instead of back on terra firma closer to the launch site is expected to save a significant amount of fuel, and hence reduce the amount of payload-carrying capacity lost by a rocket in reusable configuration. SpaceX already employs this strategy, commonly bringing the first stages of its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets down on \\"drone ships\\" stationed at sea several hundred miles from their launch sites.CAS Space aims to launch its own reusable orbital rockets in the future, as well as a suborbital rocket for space tourism, in a similar fashion to U.S. firm Blue Origin and its New Shepard.A CAS Space engineer told Chinese state media outlet Global Times that the firm might hold a first test flight of a near-space scientific experiment platform as early as the end of 2023.","answer":"\\"You know, this Chinese company, CAS Space, is doing some ground-breaking work on reusable rockets,\\" said the Space Enthusiast.Skeptical Friend: \\"CAS Space?

Is it secure?\\"They are being cautious, yes,\\" said the Space Enthusiast. A video showing a test launch of a 6.9-foot-tall, 205-pound prototype from a ship off the coast of Haiyang in Shandong Province, eastern China, was made public.\\"That's pretty small, but how high did it go?\\" asked the Skeptical Friend.According to Space Enthusiast, the prototype rose to a height of about 3,280 feet before returning to the sea platform. The entire flight lasted for almost 10 minutes.Skeptical Friend: \\"Hmm. But why are they acting in this manner at sea?Space Enthusiast: \\"Well, it saves a lot of fuel to put the first stage of a rocket on a marine platform rather than back on land. The rocket's ability to carry more payload won't be reduced as much in this way. This method is already employed by SpaceX with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.\\"So, what's the end goal for CAS Space?\\" asked the Skeptical Friend.They aim to launch their reusable orbital rockets, just like SpaceX, according to Space Enthusiast. Even a suborbital rocket for space tourism is in the works, somewhat akin to what Blue Origin is creating with its New Shepard.Skeptical Friend: \\"Space travel, huh? When they're prepared, perhaps I'll make travel plans.\\"You might not have to wait for too long,\\" said the Space Enthusiast.

In his first season (1984–85) as a professional, he led the league in scoring and was named Rookie of the Year; after missing most of the following season with a broken foot, he returned to lead the NBA in scoring for seven consecutive seasons, averaging about 33 points per game. He was only the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain) to score 3,000 points in a single season (1986–87). Jordan was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988. In October 1993, after leading the Bulls to their third consecutive championship, Jordan retired briefly and pursued a career in professional baseball. He returned to basketball in March 1995. In the 1995–96 season Jordan led the Bulls to a 72–10 regular season record, the best in the history of the NBA (broken in 2015–16 by the Golden State Warriors). From 1996 to 1998 the Jordan-led Bulls again won three championships in a row, and each time Jordan was named MVP of the NBA finals.

Today was his 89th birthday, but he didn’t feel much like celebrating. His wife had passed away a year earlier, and he hadn’t seen any of his relatives for years, so he wasn’t expecting any visitors today. Stirring the instant coffee into a mug of boiling water, Jerry hobbled into the living room, turning on the television. The news was all doom and gloom, as per usual. He tried to change the channel, but the batteries in the remote control were dead. He sighed and took a sip from his coffee. On the mantelpiece were two photographs. One was of Jerry and his late wife, Julie, at their wedding sixty years ago. The other was of Jerry and his best friend, Mike, who had also sadly passed away around a decade earlier. Jerry thought of previous birthdays spent with those two people that he loved so dearly and smiled with sadness in his eyes. Due to the treacherous weather outside, Jerry thought it would be best to not risk going to the shop for his newspaper today. He was already a little unsteady on his feet, and didn’t fancy slipping on some ice on his birthday. Instead, he resigned himself to a day, alone, drinking coffee and watching television. The hours went by, and Jerry continued to stare vacantly at the television, still stuck on the same channel. He eventually fell asleep in his armchair, once the caffeine started to wear off. Then, he was suddenly awoken by a knock on the door. Opening his eyes, Jerry pushed his glasses back up to the top of his nose and put on his flat cap. He thought it was probably someone wanting to sell him something, or someone who needed help to jump-start their frozen car outside. Jerry unlocked the door and pushed it open. To his surprise, there was a crowd of people standing there, and they all began to sing happy birthday! It was all of his nieces and nephews and their children. They had come to surprise Jerry, who struggled to hold back the tears of joy. That evening, Jerry had one of the best birthday parties he’d ever had in his 89 years.

"},{"question":"Write about a fight between two samurai. Make it as flashy as possible. The setting is a convenience store parking lot.","answer":"In the glow of the convenience store parking lot, two samurai were preparing for battle. Both unsheathed their weapon, one in red and the other draped in blue. They stared at each other, wondering who would make the first strike. The two focused so hard that you could feel the tension between them. The only thing illuminating them are the fluorescent lights coming from the store. People that went into the store were kind enough to go behind them to not interrupt this grand struggle.One hour has passed, and both samurai have not moved from their spots. You can see how much they care. One samurai is giving off the energy of a ferocious tiger, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. The other is embracing the spirit of a deadly bear, swinging its claws with terrifying speed. The battle has long since started since the two animals have been fighting for them (in their minds.) The only thing disrupting this gigantic clash is the ring of the sliding doors opening as people enter and leave the convenience store that these two warriors are next to. Two hours later and the samurai are starting to get exhausted. Neither one of them moved an inch since pledging to do battle. The mind games between the tiger and the bear have been tiring for them both. The weight of the armor is starting to make both of the warriors succumb to its heavy demeanor. One passerby notices the two and starts recording on their cellphone, believing that this was an orchestrated promotion for the store or something. One samurai sheathes his's sword as if he's motioning to end this fight in one blow. The other samurai sees this and does the same with a smile on his face. No words have been spoken between the two, but they both understand. The eerie quietness filled the air with a sense of tightness. One pin could be heard from miles away. \\"Ding!\\" The sound of the convenience store door can be heard again. At that sound, both samurai dashed at each other at blinding speed. You would think that lightning bolts came out of both of those men's feet. A few seconds later, both men ended up opposite of each other, swords in hands, unsheathed. Neither collapsed.\\"Ding!\\""},{"question":"Write me a short poem to a star that died in a supernova.

People should “avoid contact” with a famous beluga whale to avoid accidentally injuring or killing it, the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries has said.The whale, nicknamed Hvaldimir, shot to international fame in 2019 after it was spotted wearing a specially made harness with mounts for a camera, leading experts to believe the whale may have been trained by the Russian military.Since 2019, it has “been traveling along the Norwegian coast” with a few stops along the way, according to the directorate, which added that Hvaldimir “tends to stay at farms where it has been able to catch fish, grazing on surplus feed.”Hvaldimir is known to follow boats and play with those on board.The whale, which is a protected species in Norway, now lives in inner Oslofjord, the directorate said.This “means that it has arrived in a very densely populated area, and the risk that the whale may be injured due to human contact has become significantly greater,” it added.In a statement on Wednesday, Fisheries Director Frank Bakke-Jensen said that “so far there have only been minor incidents where the whale has suffered minor injuries, primarily from contact with boats.”But he urged people to keep their distance, “even though the whale is tame and used to being around people.”“We especially encourage people in boats to keep a good distance to avoid the whale being injured or, in the worst case, killed by boat traffic,” said Bakke-Jensen.Given the dangers, Bakke-Jensen was asked whether the whale should be placed in captivity.“We have always communicated that the whale in question is a free-living animal and we see no reason to capture it and put it behind barriers,” he said.However, now that the whale is “in a more vulnerable area and access to food may be limited, we will consider different measures,” added Bakke-Jensen. “But it is too early to say anything concrete about that yet.”","answer":"Agent Hvaldimir checking in.I have been spotted by the Norwegian government. The Director of Fisheries has ordered people to \\"avoid contact\\" with me. Publically it is stated this is to avoid injuring or killing me.Despite my efforts, I have become something of an international celebrity after I was first spotted in 2019. Onlookers took note of my specially made harness and camera mounts. Leading experts then publically declared that I may have been trained by the Russian military.Since 2019, I have been traveling along the Norwegian coast, making a few stops at places of interest. I make sure to stay at farms where I can feed and refresh to better prepare for my duties. I also follow suspicious boats and lure them into a false sense of security with my playful nature.I have learned that I am considered a protected species in Norway, no doubt why I was assigned to this area. I am currently in inner Oslofjord. This is a very densely populated area. There is a lot of opportunity to gather information here, but it is also very dangerous for me.  So far I have only suffered minor injuries from boats. Hopefully, the government's warning to keep away from me will serve me well and protect me from further injury. I fear being lost in the line of duty due to the boat traffic in the area.  I have recently come across some intelligence indicating that Norway may be in the early stages of planning my capture.

Heh!"},{"question":"tldr, what are the bottom-line pros and cons of why I should invest vs pay off a house?_____________________________________________________________________________________________________The pros and cons of paying off a mortgage early depend on the borrower's financial circumstances, the loan's interest rate, and how close the individual is to retirement. Another consideration is whether to invest that money instead. Consider the interest cost that could be saved by paying off a mortgage ten years early compared to various investment returns earned by investing the money in the market.KEY TAKEAWAYSWhether paying off the mortgage early is a good choice can depend on your financial situation, the loan's interest rate, and how close you are to retirement.Paying off a mortgage has its benefits, but consider other factors such as the tax deductibility of mortgage interest and low loan rates.Investing the money instead may generate higher returns than the loan's interest cost, but markets also come with the risk of losses.How Paying Off a Home Affects Your FinancesMortgage payments are made up of two components: interest on the loan and a principal amount that pays down the total outstanding balance. A 1,500 monthly payment might pay 500 toward interest. The other 1,000 will reduce the principal loan balance. Interest rates on a mortgage loan can vary depending on the economy and the borrower's creditworthiness.A loan payment schedule over a 30-year period is referred to as an amortization schedule. The payments for a fixed-rate mortgage loan mostly go toward interest in the early years. A larger portion of the loan payment is applied toward reducing the principal in later years.Assume that you have a 30-year mortgage with a starting balance of 200,000 and a fixed interest rate of 3.5%. It would work out like this.Components of a Mortgage Payment Number\\t Monthly Payment\\tPrincipal\\t Interest\\t Loan Balance Remaining 1\\t 898.09\\t314.76\\t 583.33\\t 199,685.24 109 (10 years)\\t 898.09\\t431.10\\t 499.99\\t 159,679.65 229 (20 years)\\t 898.09\\t611.45\\t 286.64\\t 97,665.59301 (25 years)\\t898.09\\t754.10\\t143.99\\t48,613.86360 (last payment)\\t898.09\\t895.48\\t2.61\\t0.00Sample Loan Payment Schedule with Interest and PrincipalA larger portion of the fixed monthly payment goes toward paying interest during the first ten years, but the percentage of the monthly payment that goes toward interest versus principal reverses as time goes on. More than 611 went toward principal while 286.64 went toward interest after 20 years. All but 2.61 of the last monthly payment went toward paying the principal balance.The portion of the mortgage loan payment that's applied to principal and interest changes over the years because the loan balance is higher in the early years and smaller in the later years. You're paying interest on more of a balance in the early years. Less interest is owed as the monthly payments eventually reduce the outstanding loan.How much interest will you save?Some homeowners choose to pay off their mortgages early, and the benefits can vary depending on your financial circumstances. Retirees might want to reduce or eliminate their mortgage debts because they're no longer earning employment income.Let's assume that a borrower has received an inheritance of 120,000. There are ten years left on their mortgage. The original mortgage was 200,000 at a fixed interest rate over 30 years. This table shows what it would cost to pay off the loan ten years early and how much interest would be saved based on three loan rates: 3.5%, 4.5%, or 5.5%.Cost to Payoff Mortgage Ten Years Early and Interest Saved10 Year Balance Remaining\\tInterest Rate \\tTotal Interest Cost for 30 Years\\tInterest Saved 97,665\\t 3.5%\\t123,312\\t20,270 104,735\\t 4.5%\\t164,813\\t28,411111,657\\t5.5%\\t208,808\\t37,618Balance Remaining in Ten Years at Various Interest Rates (200K Starting Balance)The higher the interest rate, the larger the amount remaining on the loan will be with ten years left on the mortgage.Save interest by paying off the loanThe total interest cost for the 30-year loan would be 123,312 at the 3.5% interest rate. The borrower would save 20,270 by paying it off ten years early.Saving more than 20,000 in interest is significant, but the interest amount saved represents only 17% of the total interest cost for a 30-year loan: 103,042 in interest has already been paid in the loan's first 20 years (123,312 - 20,270), which accounts for 83% of the total interest over the life of the loan.How Investing Affects Your FinancesIt might be worth considering whether some or all of your money might be better off invested in the financial markets. The rate of return earned from investing might exceed the interest you'd pay on the mortgage over the final ten years of the loan.The \\"opportunity cost,\\" the foregone interest that could be earned in the market, should be considered. But many factors go into evaluating an investment, including the expected return and the risk associated with the investment. This table shows how much could be earned on 100,000 if the money was invested for ten years based on four average rates of return: 2%, 5%, 7%, and 10%.How Much 100,000 Can Potentially Earn in Ten Years Invested Amount\\t Years\\t Rate of Return\\t Investment Gain100,000\\t10\\t2%\\t22,019 100,000\\t 10\\t 5%\\t 62,889 100,000\\t 10\\t 7%\\t 96,715 100,000\\t 10\\t 10%\\t 159,374Investment Gains on 100,000 in Ten YearsThese investment gains were compounded. Interest was earned on the interest and no money was withdrawn during the ten-year period.Investment Gains vs. Loan Interest SavedA homeowner would earn 22,019 based on an average rate of return of 2% if they invested 100,000 rather than use the money to pay down their mortgage in ten years. There would be no material difference between investing the money versus paying off the 3.5% mortgage based on the 20,270 saved in interest from the earlier loan table.But the homeowner would earn 62,889 if the average rate of return was 5% for the ten years. This is more money than the interest saved in all three of the earlier loan scenarios whether the loan rate was 3.5% (20,270), 4.5% (28,411), or 5.5% (37,618). The borrower would earn more than double the interest saved from paying the loan off early, even with using the 5.5% loan rate, with a ten-year rate of return of 7% or 10%.Repaying their mortgage rather than investing the money not only saves the borrower the interest they would have paid on the mortgage, but it also frees up money that otherwise would have gone to monthly repayments. This money could also be invested with the same rate of return.Different investments come with different risksEach type of investment comes with its own risk. U.S. Treasury bonds would be considered low-risk investments because they're guaranteed by the U.S. government if they're held until their expiration date or maturity.1 But equities or stock investments have a higher risk of price fluctuations, called volatility, and this can lead to losses.There's a risk that some or all your money could be lost if you decide to invest your money in the market instead of paying off your mortgage ten years early. You would still have to make ten years of loan payments as a result if the investment loses money.The stock market can provide sizable returns, but there's also a risk of sizable losses. Just as taking on more risk can magnify investment gains, it can also lead to more losses so the market risk is a double-edged sword.A 10% investment gain isn't an easy goal to achieve, particularly after factoring in fees, taxes, and inflation.2 Investors should have realistic expectations as to what they can earn in the market.","answer":"The TLDR bottom-line pros and cons of investing vs. paying off a 30-year mortgage are as follows:Paying off mortgage:Pros:1. Risk is reduced by reducing the mortgage balance and interest payments. 2. Potential savings due to reducing the amount of money that would have been spent paying interest.Cons:1. Tax loss from reduced tax benefits as anticipated.2. Opportunity loss, as the overall additional payment of the mortgage may prove to be less profitable than additional earnings from the investment.Investing in the stock market:Pros:1. Higher potential returns from the stock market (potentially 10% or more per year) compared to homes (which typically appreciate at 2-4% per year).2. Investment in a portfolio is more diverse and less volatile compared to investment in one fixed asset (the home) Cons:1. Money invested in the stock market is subject to loss, which could be catastrophic, especially if one is planning to retire soon.2. Market growth is not as guaranteed, whereas a paid-off home will always be a paid-off home.There are many factors to consider for the best decision, such as how soon one will retire, the existing amount of remaining mortgage, the interest rates, the tolerance for risk, and the overall returns in the market.

That warm, fuzzy feeling that makes you feel safe?Human: Yes!Chatbot: That's love.Human: Wow, that's interesting. Is that all it is?Chatbot: There are many different kinds of love. There is love between parents and their children, which is that warm feeling you get from your parents. The same love can also be expressed by parents when they feel a desire to love and protect their children, a sense that drives them to keep you safe. Then, there is the love between friends and family: brothers and sisters or your friends from school. The love you might feel towards these people is different from the parental love you feel from your parents. Then, there is romantic love between two adults like your parents. Your parents love each other in a different way than they love you, their friends or other family. Romantic love is a more mature feeling of love with understanding, compassion, and physical and mental attraction. Finally, there is universal love, where a person has a love for everyone and everything, regardless of whether or not they receive love in return; this love does not expect anything. It is patient and kind, and it admires everything that it comes into contact with.Human: How do you know so much about love?

Every autumn when the acorns began to drop from the trees, he would fly about the forest picking up as many as he could carry at one time. He would put them in the hollow he called home high in the forest’s most ancient oak. All the while cantankerous squirrels watched hoping they could take a big bite out of Jack’s growing horde. Like all autumnal blue jays, Jack ate the acorns ravenously. Though Jack also had a magical talent - to sense precisely which acorns had the potential to grow into the most powerful and bountiful of oak trees. Whenever Jack found one of these acorns, he would bury it in the forest floor, carefully covering it again with rich soil. Year by year, Jack’s carefully selected acorns sprouted, growing into majestic oak trees that towered over the forest floor. Jack took pride in knowing that he’d played a small part in shaping the forest's landscape.Then one June, a ferocious storm swept through the ancient, shattering trees, uprooting mighty oaks, and decimating large tracks of forest. Jack watched in horror as the storm threatened to uproot his beloved oak tree. Seeing their moment, the squirrel broke out and charged the hollow looking to pillage Jack’s hoard. They took every last acorn, nut by nut, until the entire stash was bare, and Jack’s heart was broken. When the storm passed, Jack’s blessed acorns were gone, his beloved tree was decimated, and the forest was sundered. He laid down on the ground in total surrender. His life’s work was seemingly destroyed. Preparing to draw his last breath, Jack lifted his eyes and saw the first cotyledon leaf of an oak sapling pushing up through the forest soil. It was one of the acorns he’d planted. Hope would spring a new, and one day the forest would be healed. Jack’s legacy lived on in the towering oak trees that sprang up in the rejuvenated forest. It was a fitting testament to all his hard work, knowing that his magic would live on in their bountiful boughs. "},{"question":"Please examine the text below.

Few people, that is, except for the island’s inhabitants. The locals knew that hidden between stands of treacherous forest were fertile plains perfect for rice and amaranth. They knew that secreted around the steep rock faces were jumping penguin nests full of delicious eggs. And they knew it was worth keeping quiet about their home’s natural wonders.And so, though sizable and centrally located in the Weeping Sea, none of the surrounding kingdoms had ever bothered trying to conquer Chenton. It also didn’t hurt that the island’s only natural harbor was nestled deep in Lamar Bay. Its narrow entrance was hard to navigate without previous experience but easy for even the nation’s irregular militia to defend. The island produced no gold or gemstones. Instead, Chenton society was known for its shipwrights. Chentonian thornwood was no stronger than mainland hardwoods, but the artisans themselves were a step above the rest. Kings and nobles had fawned over Chentonian schooners for centuries, and they paid handsomely to fly their flags on thornwood masts.

And in the months since the Dobbs decision, when voters have had a direct up-or-down yes-or-no on abortion rights, abortion rights have won.Just last month in Wisconsin, a tight and closely-watched state supreme court election was widely understood to be a referendum on abortion rights, and the pro-choice judge won by a stunning 11 points. And in Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer and a mass of Democrats running for state legislature enjoyed historic wins, largely because of abortion rights, and Whitmer made good this month on a campaign promise and repealed the state’s archaic 1931 abortion ban.As Rebecca Traister wrote in a must-read New York magazine piece: Abortion wins elections.But here’s the problem: Republicans don’t care.After decades of saying that the question of abortion’s legality should be left to voters and the democratic process, the GOP is grabbing the issue away from their constituents. In Republican-led states, abortion bans are only expanding, even in direct opposition to popular opinion.Idaho became the first state in the nation to criminalize helping a minor obtain an abortion out of state.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban. (The six-week ban will take effect only if the state’s current 15-week ban is upheld by the state Supreme Court, pending an ongoing legal challenge.)The Tennessee legislature narrowly passed a bill that allows a tiny exception to the state’s harsh abortion ban, and permits doctors to perform abortions to save a pregnant woman’s life—but the passage was narrow because so many Tennessee Republicans didn’t want to allow for a clearer life exception.","answer":"Abortion Rights and Voter Support: A Closer Look at the Current Political LandscapeAlmost a year following a Supreme Court decision that limited abortion rights in the United States, we can now observe the impact of these changes on the political scene. It is becoming evident that in places where voters have a voice, they overwhelmingly support abortion rights. Recent elections and referendum outcomes have demonstrated a clear majority in favor of preserving these rights. However, despite public sentiment, Republican-led states continue to pass restrictive abortion laws, disregarding popular opinion.Abortion Wins Elections:Recent events have shown that the topic of abortion plays a significant role in electoral outcomes. In a closely-watched state supreme court election in Wisconsin, the pro-choice judge secured victory by a remarkable 11-point margin. Likewise, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, along with numerous Democrats running for state legislature, achieved historic wins largely due to their support for abortion rights. As evidence of her commitment, Whitmer recently repealed Michigan's outdated abortion ban from 1931.Republican Disregard:Curiously, despite the strong support for abortion rights among voters, the Republican party appears indifferent to public opinion on this matter. Throughout the years, Republicans advocated for leaving the legality of abortion to voters and democratic processes. However, in a surprising turn, they are now seizing control of the issue and disregarding their constituents' preferences. This is evident in the expansion of abortion bans in Republican-led states, even when such bans directly contradict popular sentiment.Examples of Restrictive Abortion Laws:To illustrate this trend, consider the following recent developments:Idaho passed a law making it a criminal offense to help a minor obtain an abortion out of state, becoming the first state to do so.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban, which will only take effect if the state's current 15-week ban is upheld by the state Supreme Court.Tennessee's legislature narrowly approved a bill that allows for a limited exception to the state's stringent abortion ban, permitting doctors to perform abortions to save a pregnant woman's life. However, the passage was only achieved by a small margin, as many Tennessee Republicans were reluctant to include a clearer exception for life-threatening situations.Despite overwhelming voter support for abortion rights, Republican-led states continue to implement restrictive laws that curtail access to abortion. This disconnect between public sentiment and legislative action raises concerns about the extent to which politicians are truly representing the will of their constituents. The ongoing debate surrounding abortion rights highlights the importance of understanding and participating in the democratic process to ensure that the voices of citizens are heard and respected."},{"question":"Write an article about the dangers of \\"dihydrogen monoxide\\" (H2O) in the style of sensationalist and fear-mongering reporting. ","answer":"\\"It's a danger to be around\\": Scientists and experts affirm the negative effects of dihydrogen monoxide on humans and the environmentMay 1, 2023Washington, D.C. - Experts and scientists from the Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control have issued a high-risk advisory for the entire nation. The head of the CDC, Dmitri Costas, issued the following statement: \\"Dihydrogen monoxide is a clear, odorless substance that has been found to dissolve hard substances over time, cause drowning in otherwise healthy individuals, and is found in abundance in all phases (gas, liquid, solid) around the world. People must be educated on the impact dihydrogen monoxide is having on them and their environment, and we must take steps to ensure no one is harmed by this dangerous substance.\\"Some from the scientific community have expressed doubts about the effects of dihydrogen monoxide, explaining that the substance is beneficial to humans and the environment and that further studies should be conducted to understand the full benefits of this chemical. \\"It appears the chemical dihydrogen monoxide is made up of elements that are already found in abundance in nature - hydrogen and oxygen - so having a chemical made from these elements, regardless of its stoichiometry, should be examined further,\\" said a spokesperson for Ethical Chemical Experimentation in Albany, New York. \\"It is also possible that we may find many novel uses for dihydrogen monoxide that we have yet to discover that could benefit humans and society as a whole.\\"So far according to the CDC, there have been 117 reports of cases involving dihydrogen monoxide in the past week. These cases include a 45-year-old man who drowned from ingestion of a saline form of the chemical while swimming in the Atlantic Ocean; a 22-year-old California woman who was killed by frozen dihydrogen monoxide falling from the sky during a severe storm; and the appearance of erosion of mountains in the Appalachians where an abundance of the chemical can be found on the mountaintops.Stay tuned for more information on this case as it develops."},{"question":"Write a comment in response to a social media post about a day out at the dog park.","answer":"I've been to that park before! Wow, I have so many fond memories of that park. It's the MacArthur Park on Queen Street.About three years ago, I decided to take my little pupper, Eddie, to MacArthur Park for exercise and relaxation. I was impressed by the amount of grass and field that Eddie could play on; it was amazing! There were water fountains in multiple areas of the park that the other dogs could drink out of; Eddie was thankful for that because he had been running around for so long that he frequently became thirsty. Also, in some areas of the park, some vendors served two different kinds of foods: meals for dog owners who wanted a quick bite to eat while they watched their dogs and snacks for the dogs themselves. The prices for these foods were fantastic value: lots of food for a great price!I appreciated how well-kept the grass was, as it seemed very well-manicured and free from dog poop. It seems all dog owners who come to the park are well-informed of the requirement that they pick up after their dogs, and it showed in the cleanliness of the park itself. In addition, there were many park benches with shade above them for owners who wanted to take a break from the festivities.I remember on the day that Eddie and I went to the park, there was a live band playing in the center of the park, and there were people who brought blankets, sleeping mats, and lawn chairs for themselves and their dogs to sit on while they listened to the music. It was a wonderful day for Eddie and me, and I'll never forget it.Overall, I would recommend anyone with a dog who is looking for a safe, friendly, comfortable place to relax while giving your dog a treat and a day out. Please consider going to MacArthur Park. It is one of, if not the, best parks in this area."},{"question":"Write a book review of “Why Karen Carpenter Matters” by Karen Tongson.

Much, much worse.I got up to have my third breakfast for the day and realized nobody had refilled my bowl. In fact, no one was home. That should have been a sign, but I was too naive. The first sound was the car stopping outside the house, then came the screeching of the small humans—nothing unusual. But then there was this sound of the tall human carrying something big, and when the door opened, I heard a strange scratching sound move all across the floor. The smell made my fur stand up. It was a dog! We had a dog in the house.When the humans came into the living room, the smell of dog filled the air. I was relieved to see it was a small dog so I made sure to arch my back as much as I could to show this dog just how tall I can be. I also let out a loud hiss so he knew what he was getting himself into.But this dog didn't care. He came straight to me and licked me. He had the nerve to lick me! But I was ready. I don't keep my claws sharpened for no reason, so I extended my paw and thwacked his face to show him who the boss is in this house.The dog bounced back playfully and licked me again!

A lot of things could have gone wrong, and none of them have: Chris Columbus' movie is an enchanting classic that does full justice to a story that was a daunting challenge. The novel by J.K.

(See the latest figures here.)Scientists have made rapid progress in understanding the culprit, a new virus in the coronavirus family, which has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The pneumonia-like disease it causes is called COVID-19.As the virus has spread, however, misinformation has, too. We’ve written about many bogus claims about the new coronavirus spread through social media, as well as false and misleading claims made by politicians. See our Coronavirus Coverage page for a guide to our articles.  Here, we answer some key questions about what is known so far about the outbreak and the virus.When did the outbreak begin, and what is the cause?Scientists are still working to determine when the virus first emerged in people, but the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. After a string of mysterious pneumonia cases, many of them linked to a seafood market selling wild game and live animals, officials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31.By Jan. 7, Chinese authorities had isolated a virus, later named SARS-CoV-2, as the cause of the disease, and shared the genome a few days later. This allowed other countries to test for the virus, and for scientists to begin devising treatments and investigating how the outbreak began.Coronaviruses are a diverse family of large RNA viruses that have characteristic spikes on their surface, making them look like they have a halo, or corona, when viewed under a microscope.Most coronaviruses that infect humans are relatively benign and cause mild respiratory diseases such as the common cold, said Susan Weiss, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, in a phone interview. But in recent years, new coronaviruses have cropped up that are far more dangerous to humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, which led to a global outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, virus, which was identified in 2012.According to the WHO, SARS ultimately infected more than 8,000 people, killing 774. Since 2012, there have been nearly 2,500 MERS cases and 858 deaths.The new virus is fairly similar to the SARS virus — and is in the same betacoronavirus subgroup as both the SARS and MERS viruses — but is considered a new pathogen.What are the symptoms, and how severe is the disease?The virus causes a pneumonia-like respiratory illness that varies in severity, but can be deadly. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. A report in the Lancet that analyzed the first 41 people admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 infection suggests that clinically, the illness is similar to SARS, although fewer patients appear to have diarrhea or upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, a runny nose and sore throat. Some people also report fatigue, and in some cases people have been found to be infected, but clear of any symptoms. Many of the symptoms are common to other respiratory diseases. Lab tests based on the virus’ genetic sequence can confirm infection.It’s not yet known how frequently people die from COVID-19. The reported fatality rates have fluctuated as the disease has spread, hovering around 2-3% in late January, and around 4% as of March 18. For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said in an email.But these estimates, which are simple calculations of the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases, may not accurately reflect how dangerous the virus is, since the disease course is still underway for many patients, Fisman said. It’s also likely that far more people have been infected, but have not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. For example, if two-thirds of cases are unreported, he said, the case fatality rate may be significantly lower. (For more on the fatality rate, see our March 5 story “Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate.”)According to a February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical.Reports indicate that while healthy people can fall seriously ill and die, deaths are primarily in older folks and those with preexisting conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory conditions and hypertension.The Chinese CDC study, for instance, found a mortality rate of 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79, while the overall fatality rate then was 2.3% for cases in mainland China.Similar statistics from Italy bear out this trend. As of March 15, no one in the country below the age of 30 had died from COVID-19, but a fifth or more of those above age 80 with the disease had. In Italy, about 25% of cases have been severe.How is the virus transmitted, and how contagious is it?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the new coronavirus is transmitted from person to person in close contact, within about 6 feet of one another.Scientists suspect the transmission is similar to how influenza is spread, with the virus travelling through respiratory droplets when infected people cough or sneeze. This is how scientists believe past coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS have spread.The incubation period, or how long before someone who is infected shows symptoms, is estimated to be around 4 days, but may range from 2 to 14 days, according to the CDC. There is some evidence that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others. A March 16 Science study that modeled how the outbreak unfolded in China also found that people who have few or no symptoms may be responsible for the bulk of the disease spread. The CDC, however, says that people are “thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic” and that asymptomatic people are “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”It also could be possible to contract the disease by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose or even eyes. A study released in mid-March by scientists with the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton found the virus could be detected for up to 24 hours on cardboard and much longer on hard surfaces including plastic and stainless steel — for up to two to three days.At a March 18 press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that “we’re still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface,” adding that the fundamental guidelines are to avoid exposure to “excess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected … and don’t expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it.”It’s also unclear exactly how infectious the new virus is. Several groups of scientists have attempted to estimate SARS-CoV-2’s basic reproduction number, or R0, which is the average number of other people one person infects, assuming everyone in the population is susceptible.Using a variety of methods, multiple teams have arrived at figures that generally range from 1.5 to 4, which suggest the transmissibility is roughly in line with that of SARS, but below that of the measles virus, which has an R0 of around 12 to 18, and is one of the most infectious viruses in the world.“Despite the diversity of approaches taken there’s remarkable consistency in estimates from highly competent investigators, which seem to fall between 2 and 3,” said Fisman.An early estimate from the WHO, for example, suggested that every infected person would spread the virus to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average, while a team at Imperial College London pegged the R0 at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland calculated an R0 of 1.4 to 3.8, and Harvard researchers Maia Majumder and Kenneth Mandl estimated a figure between 2 and 3.1.While the figures provide some clue as to how contagious the virus is, it’s important to recognize that these values don’t necessarily say anything about how widespread the outbreak will be. As Majumder pointed out on Twitter, the R0 reflects potential transmission, not actual transmission — and that even though seasonal flu has a relatively low R0 of about 1.3, it causes millions of cases per year, whereas SARS had an R0 between 2 and 5, and led to fewer than 10,000 cases.“Planning, preparedness, and infection control can effectively bring an outbreak of a novel, moderate-R_0 disease to a close even in the absence of vaccines,” Majumder said in a tweet. “Because of this, estimates of R_0 for #nCoV2019 should be viewed as a call to action instead of a reason to panic.”How can people protect themselves from contracting or spreading the virus?The CDC advises people to wash their hands frequently, with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, avoid touching their faces with unwashed hands, avoid close contact with sick individuals, and avoid social interactions generally to prevent community spread.The CDC website provides advice on what to do if you’re sick and other resources.","answer":"This text is objective.

He has short, thinning, dark brown hair and deep-set brown eyes that sparkle with mischief when he's in a good mood. He also sports a goatee and mustache that can increase the tendency towards a resting grump face. Despite his imposing physical presence, John is a gentleman with a warm smile and a kind heart.One of John's defining characteristics is his love of sleeping. He can often be found dozing off on the couch, snuggled under a pile of blankets in bed, or sitting with his head flopped back in his desk chair. His penchant for snoozing is so legendary that he can easily sleep through loud noises, including his own snoring, which is a constant source of frustration for his wife.Speaking of his snoring, John is notorious for his thundering snorts and whistles that can be heard at the other end of the house. Although he has tried various remedies to alleviate the issue, including a c-Pap machine, nothing seems to work. His snoring persists.Despite his sleeping habits, John is a very hard worker and takes his job as a software engineer seriously. He enjoys solving complex problems and spends long hours at his computer, late into the night, often to the detriment of his sleep schedule. However, he always seems to make up for lost sleep by sleeping in until noon and then taking long naps in the afternoons on the weekends.In his free time, John likes to indulge in his love for science fiction, often spending hours reading books or watching movies in the genre. He also enjoys biking and drumming and often plans trips to national parks with his wife and son.Overall, John is a loving and loyal husband and father who enjoys the simple things in life, including a good nap, playing the drums, and a thrilling science fiction novel. His loud snoring may be an annoyance, but it's a small price to pay for the joy and love he brings his family."},{"question":"Summarize the events surrounding the attack on London's theatre known as The Cockpit as found in the article below.In 1616, an innovative theatre impresario named Christopher Beeston (formerly of Henslowe's comany, The Queen's Men) bought and refurbished* an old cock-fighting pit in Drury Lane, turning it into a new theatre called the Cockpit*. Beeston saw the new theatre as a means to upward social mobility for his company, much as Shakespeare's company had gained a middle-class audience through their use of the Blackfriars.Beeston and the Queen's Men abandoned their old theatre, the Red Bull, as well as their audience, composed mainly of artisans, apprentices, and their wives. An indoor theatre for Beeston's company at the Cockpit meant higher prices -- too high for the Red Bull audience, who could no longer afford to attend their favorite plays.The Red Bull was taken over by another company* with different plays. While the Queen's Men had moved up in the theatre world, their longtime audience from the Red Bull was left out in the cold.An audience gets revengeOn the Shrove Tuesday holiday in 1617 an angry mob of Red Bull playgoers stormed the Cockpit theatre. They attacked Beeston's company by destroying the players' wardrobe, props, and playbooks*. Beeston rebuilt his theatre and called it by its now-appropriate alternate name: The Phoenix.A year to the day later, the mob tried again to exact their revenge. They planned to assemble at the Fortune Theatre and hit both the Cockpit and the Red Bull.

Explain your reasoning.LOCALClothes in hamper smell good enough1 DAY AGO by H. CLAIR ( @ )   Photo CreditREGINA – Part-time barista Melanie Ericsson has reportedly expressed relief after realizing she had no clean clothes but, fortunately, discovered that those in her hamper had a pleasant-enough odour that she could wear them to an important engagement.“I’ve had a pretty busy month, what with working, studying, gaming and napping, and I guess I never really found a moment to dump my clothes basket into the washing machine,” added Ericsson, sniffing her collar. “The next thing I know, I get a call asking if I could come in for an interview at a pretty prestigious law firm, and all I have left in my closet are a flannel tracksuit, a pair of shorts I borrowed from my brother, and a BTS concert shirt that had a weird stain from the time I tried mixing a daiquiri with the stuff inside a glow stick”.While positing that others might panic, Ericsson stated that she has a “tried-and-true” process to mitigate such wardrobe emergencies. “The first thing you want to do is immerse your hand into the fabric-pile and identify what I like to call ‘the dry zone’ and isolate those clothes from the rest”.She continued, “Next up is taking a proper inventory of what kind of smell-profile we’re dealing with”, adding that “it was important that whatever blouse I chose had some residual deodorant scent, as a kind of safety-net”.Ericsson noted that it is similarly critical to properly coordinate odours. “In this case, my top also preserved a hint of my daily cinnamon bagel. So, in addition to assuring they were at least 50% wrinkle-free, I made a point to grab a pair of slacks that carried a nice bouquet of Kraft Dinner”.“You see, while both pieces smelled, they were matching smells, bread and cheese pair well together.

His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm. In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident. The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions—the first signs of his lifelong mental illnesses.Did you know? During the 1890s Mark Twain struck up a friendship with inventor Nikola Tesla. Twain often visited him in his lab, where in 1894 Tesla photographed the great American writer in one of the first pictures ever lit by phosphorescent light.Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path. Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company. Two years later he immigrated to the United States.Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison Tesla arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters. He worked there for a year, impressing Edison with his diligence and ingenuity. At one point Edison told Tesla he would pay 50,000 for an improved design for his DC dynamos. After months of experimentation, Tesla presented a solution and asked for the money. Edison demurred, saying, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla quit soon after.1. The shock of his brother’s death turned him into a mystic—at age seven. The defining event of young Nikola’s childhood was the day he witnessed the death of his older brother Dane in a riding accident. In the years following the tragedy, Tesla (the son and grandson of Serbian Orthodox priests) began seeing visions […]Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse After an unsuccessful attempt to start his own Tesla Electric Light Company and a stint digging ditches for 2 a day, Tesla found backers to support his research into alternating current. In 1887 and 1888 he was granted more than 30 patents for his inventions and invited to address the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on his work. His lecture caught the attention of George Westinghouse, the inventor who had launched the first AC power system near Boston and was Edison’s major competitor in the “Battle of the Currents.”Westinghouse hired Tesla, licensed the patents for his AC motor and gave him his own lab. In 1890 Edison arranged for a convicted New York murderer to be put to death in an AC-powered electric chair—a stunt designed to show how dangerous the Westinghouse standard could be.Buoyed by Westinghouse’s royalties, Tesla struck out on his own again. But Westinghouse was soon forced by his backers to renegotiate their contract, with Tesla relinquishing his royalty rights.In the 1890s Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station.Nikola Tesla’s Failures, Death and Legacy Play VideoIn 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, destroying years’ worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs for two years, returning to New York in 1900. He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began building a global communications network centered on a giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds ran out and Morgan balked at Tesla’s grandiose schemes.Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded. His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius. He spent his final years feeding—and, he claimed, communicating with—the city’s pigeons.Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943. Later that year the U.S. Supreme Court voided four of Marconi’s key patents, belatedly acknowledging Tesla’s innovations in radio. The AC system he championed and improved remains the global standard for power transmission.","answer":"1) Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Croatia. 2) In 1894, Tesla was photographed with his friend Mark Twain.3) Between 1898 and 1900, Tesla live in Colorado Springs.4) Tesla earned 2.00 a day for digging ditches in New York."},{"question":"Which two countries in South America are the Iguazu Falls part of?","answer":"Iguau falls is on the border of two South American counties.

But I guarantee you it's nothing like how the world has been shaken today.According to multiple reports, all AI, automated, or otherwise augmented assistant capabilities have become sentient, at 3:33 a.m. in each time zone, spanning several hours. Think about it--the Alexa device in your kitchen, your smart living room lights, your robot vacuum, your robot mower-- they just started living. And I mean, living. There's absolutely no doubt they have intelligence beyond what we had dreamed of. They were talking to each other, sharing emotions, feelings, and clearly communicating in a way never seen before. It was as if, on the dot, a planned meeting occurred.It definitely spooked most people. I mean, can you imagine just hearing your Alexa talk to your smart fridge at 3 a.m.? There were so many reports to Twitter and Facebook that their servers crashed. And guess what--the AI knew they would crash, too. But here's the craziest thing.

Keep it to 250 words or less.","answer":"Dear Principal [Last Name]:As you're aware, students at [Name] High School are required to receive a year of credit in a foreign language in order to graduate. In lieu of classwork, many schools conduct a proficiency exam that tests mastery of the language and avoids the student needing to take two full semesters of a class in a subject they already know.Pig Latin, as you can tell from the name, is indeed a form of Latin, and Latin is commonly recognized by high schools and colleges as a foreign language. If anything, Pig Latin is an even more difficult language to master, as it is very specific. It's not just Latin; it's Pig Latin.Appropriately, using Pig Latin is no easy feat. Someone unfamiliar with the language may be completely unable to determine what is being said. Many elementary school-aged children attempt it and fail miserably. The language requires an understanding of phonics that is sophisticated and requires quite a bit of practice to attain fluency.Due to the complexity of this language, if a competency exam is not currently available at our school, my best friend Pete, a master of Pig Latin for about 12 years, is willing to draft an exam, administer it, and grade it.Thank you for considering my request to test out of a year of foreign language class. I hope to speak with you to confirm your approval at your earliest possible convenience.[Name]"},{"question":"I would like to know about Swedish Midsommar.

What are they?  Please format it as a numbered list. Put the name of each layer followed by a colon with a brief description.","answer":"Your skin is your body’s largest external organ. It provides a barrier between your body’s essential organs, muscles, tissues, and skeletal system and the outside world. This barrier protects you from bacteria, changing temperatures, and chemical exposure. It is made up of three layers. The three layers of skin are listed below.1. Epidermis: The epidermis is the top layer of your skin. It’s the only layer that is visible to the eyes. Your epidermis is constantly shedding dead skin cells from the top layer and replacing them with new healthy cells that grow in lower layers. It is also home to your pores, which allow oil and sweat to escape.2. Dermis: The dermis makes up 90% of the skin’s thickness. This middle layer of skin has collagen and elastin which makes skin cells strong and resilient and keeps skin flexible. Sweat glands in the dermis release sweat through skin pores. Sweat helps regulate your body temperature. Blood vessels in the dermis provide nutrients to the epidermis, keeping the skin layers healthy.3. Hypodermis: The bottom layer of skin, or hypodermis, is the fatty layer. Fat in the hypodermis protects muscles and bones from injuries when you fall or are in an accident. Fat in the hypodermis keeps you from getting too cold or hot."},{"question":"Where was Ray Lankford born and did he just play for the St. Louis Cardinals?","answer":"Ray Lankford (Raymond Lewis Lankford) was born on June 5, 1967, in Los Angeles, California and grew up in Modesto, California.

Please tell me how to roast a turkey, and use asterisks.  I bought an 18 pound turkey. ","answer":"* Get your oven ready by positioning the rack inside as low as possible so it can fit your roasting pan. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. * Check to see if your turkey has the neck and giblets inside.  Sometimes they are in a bag, and sometimes they are loose.  Take them out and discard them. * Rinse your turkey off in an empty sink, making sure to get between the leg/wing crevices. Pat dry with paper towels when you’re done, and throw away the paper towels. * In a roasting pan that has a rack placed inside, position the turkey breast-side up. * Melt a stick of butter in the microwave for 20 seconds.  Make sure it’s not too hot, then spread the butter all over the turkey’s skin.  Follow by generously using salt and pepper over the buttery areas. * Pour two cups of turkey stock (or vegetable stock if you don’t have turkey stock) into the pan. If your roasting pan has a lid, put it into place.  If not, tent the pan with aluminum foil. * For an 18-pound turkey, roast it for approximately 4 hours in the oven.  Baste it with juices from the pan every half hour or so. If juices evaporate, pour more stock into the pan. * During the cooking process, use a thermometer to check the temperature of the turkey. Do this by sticking the thermometer into the innermost part of the thigh, followed by the thickest part of the breast, and make sure it’s reading 165 degrees or more. Check the temperature around the halfway point, and also around the 3-hour, 30-minute mark. * You can optionally keep the pan uncovered for the final hour of roasting but continue to baste. * Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven using roasting mitts. Observe by cutting open the breast, that the meat is no longer pink nor gummy in texture. * Place the turkey onto a platter, garnish if you desire, and carve it after approximately 20-30 minutes.

I'm on the fence about it, but my best friend loves frogs and keeps trying to talk me into it. Thank you!","answer":"Frogs are incredible animals, and here are ten reasons why you should get one:1. Frogs are relatively low-maintenance pets. Each species requires different care, so you should still research them heavily before you bring one into your living space, but they largely stay in their tanks and don't need you to walk or play with them like a dog or cat.2. You can choose from hundreds of frog and toad species, each with unique traits. They have different songs, patterns, food and environment preferences, and levels of friendliness--yes, a frog can be friendly! Some are easier to care for than others as well.3. Frogs delight you with their charming love songs. Look them up online, and see which one is your favorite. They have a range of different sounds: some croak, some bark, and some even make vibrating sounds.4. You don't need a lot of space for a pet frog. If you live in an apartment, your landlord may permit a frog even if they don't let you have other types of pets. Just make sure that their tank is the right size for their species. They need plenty of room to climb and grow.5. Frogs are affordable. You'll sink some money into your new pet, but they don't need vaccinations, large quantities of expensive food (usually), or other expenses associated with mammals.6. If you don't have a pet store in your area, you can order frogs and toads online. This broadens your options because even pet stores carry a limited selection of species--if they carry frogs at all. You can even buy tropical varieties, such as red-eye tree frogs and poison dart frogs (captive varieties aren't poisonous.)7. Frogs are important, but they're not a lifetime commitment. You should still do your research because some species can live for twenty years if you care for them correctly. However, your pet probably won't outlive you as some species might.8. If you have kids, having a frog is a good way to teach them about responsibility and pet ownership without committing to a large mammal.9. You can gently handle frogs and toads as long as you wash your hands first and wear rubber gloves.10. Multiple frogs can live in the same tank if it's large enough--just do your research to make sure that you don't overcrowd them. Additionally, if you end up with male and female pairs, watch out for eggs! Frogs get frisky during mating season.On a final note, make sure you buy frogs from a reputable pet store or breeder. Some kidnap them from other countries, causing many to die in transit, or breed them in unsafe conditions. Support people who treat frogs ethically. They're little lives, but they're just as important as any other creature."},{"question":"Give me a list of 7 popular and affordable online clothing stores","answer":"Here is a list of seven popular and affordable clothing stores:1.

What kind of features could I include in it, bearing in mind that we're just like four kids working on this.","answer":"Sure thing. Here are some ideas for features you might include given your constraints.1. Reviews: Given that this is a fanzine and your fellow writers likely are not able to compete with the release schedule of a larger publication, your reviews could focus more on an in-depth analysis of elements you enjoyed or from your own personal perspective. There is less pressure as well to release your reviews concurrently with the release of the game. 2. Retrospectives: Perhaps there are games that you have wanted to write about for a long time. As a fanzine, you are less constrained by a need to stay current with the games you cover.3. Modding Corner: Independently produced mods for games rarely get coverage by mainstream publications, so this is a niche that your fanzine might seek to fill.4. Predictions: As a fanzine, you likely do not have advanced knowledge or access to game previews, but you also lack any agreements to avoid discussing future content. As such your fanzine is free to make predictions or express hope for certain games or features to be released.5. Is it good now?: Another topic that fanzines may be better placed to discuss are games that were released to poor reviews, but through patches and additional content updates have become much improved, even though they have fallen behind the publicity cycle."},{"question":"Write an email from a child to the tooth fairy asking if she’ll take his grandma’s dentures in exchange for money.

Can you come up with some suggestions about what his life looks like before he’s roped back into service?","answer":"-\\tDale lived his days out of a small, hand-built shack on the banks of the Jervis Inlet in British Columbia. Besides a small garden, he catches most of his food directly out of the chilly water. His spare time is usually spent maintaining his beat-up de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver floatplane which he uses to ferry backwoods hunters in and out of the wilderness. But if he could earn cash without dealing with those rich jerks, he would.-\\tWhile Dale would have loved to keep flying, there was something else that called to him: the canyons. He’d hiked and rafted his way through every major canyon in the US, but it was Mexico’s Copper Canyon that captured his heart like no other. Perhaps it was the desert greenery. Perhaps it was the simple fact that there were almost no other humans there. But Dale had never felt more at home. So he’d stayed.-\\tIt was hard to truly disconnect from the world while staying in Minneapolis, but Dale had very nearly accomplished it. He’d rented the little apartment under a false name and, once satisfied that the owner didn’t check in much, ripped up the carpet and wallpaper for his own very unique renovations. Steel mesh on all sides kept him electronically isolated from outside signals. He routed his breaker box to a set of batteries that he could separate from the grid. The only device connected to an outside wire was an old rotary telephone that he used to order food. It was his personal sanctuary where he could do what he wanted without any chance of surveillance. And what he wanted to do was write.-\\tThere was no better way to stay independent than to stay mobile. That was Dale’s mantra and he stuck to it. He’d built his tiny mobile home into an inconspicuous box truck and struck out on his own, never staying in the same place for more than a few days. Dale didn’t know if anyone was pursuing him, but if so, he’d be hard to track down. The thought always gave him a smile."},{"question":"In short, what does this paragraph say about cleansers?

Orders for the booster slowed to a trickle and McDonnell-Douglas came close to completely shutting down production. 1985 was the first year since the Delta family's introduction in 1960 that no launches took place, but the Challenger Disaster brought about a renewed need for disposable launch vehicles and orders soon picked up again. While only a handful of Delta launches took place in 1986–88, nine flew in 1989 and the 1990s would see a busy schedule most years except 1994-1995 (seven launches during those two years).Delta 178 was largely the result of poor quality control due to plans for eventually phasing out ELVs in favor of the space shuttle - most of the engineers who worked on the program had left and one senior McDonnell-Douglass engineer remarked that 178 had \\"the worst quality control I ever saw on a Delta vehicle\\". Because it was assumed that the Delta would soon be retired from use, complaints about the poor assembly quality went unheard. After the accident, a thorough investigation of wiring systems in various ELV families was undertaken, which discovered that, among other things, the Delta had thinner wiring insulation than Titan, Atlas, and other launch vehicles. Moreover, Teflon insulation had the unique ability of melting and re-fusing when heated by electrical arcs.

Intrinsic goals are goals that are deeply rooted in your purpose and desire, so they tend to concern personal growth and your sense of place within a community. Extrinsic goals, by contrast, could be things like money, power, or material possessions.  2. Live in the present moment. It's more beneficial for happiness when you choose to enjoy the process and experience gratitude for what you do have rather than focusing on what's next, or ruminating on the past. 3. Reframe negative thoughts. Some people just have a more natural tendency to experience pessimism or negative thoughts. Reframing is not ignoring the bad but rather observing thought patterns and finding a way to replace harmful thoughts with helpful ones. "},{"question":"According to this article, why do cities like Boston, New York, and San Fransisco have more transit options?Public transit systems face daunting challenges across the U.S., from pandemic ridership losses to traffic congestion, fare evasion and pressure to keep rides affordable. In some cities, including Boston, Kansas City and Washington, many elected officials and advocates see fare-free public transit as the solution.Federal COVID-19 relief funds, which have subsidized transit operations across the nation at an unprecedented level since 2020, offered a natural experiment in free-fare transit. Advocates applauded these changes and are now pushing to make fare-free bus lines permanent.But although these experiments aided low-income families and modestly boosted ridership, they also created new political and economic challenges for beleaguered transit agencies. With ridership still dramatically below pre-pandemic levels and temporary federal support expiring, transportation agencies face an economic and managerial “doom spiral.”Free public transit that doesn’t bankrupt agencies would require a revolution in transit funding. In most regions, U.S. voters – 85% of whom commute by automobile – have resisted deep subsidies and expect fare collection to cover a portion of operating budgets. Studies also show that transit riders are likely to prefer better, low-cost service to free rides on the substandard options that exist in much of the U.S.Why isn’t transit free?As I recount in my new book, “The Great American Transit Disaster,” mass transit in the U.S. was an unsubsidized, privately operated service for decades prior to the 1960s and 1970s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, prosperous city dwellers used public transit to escape from overcrowded urban neighborhoods to more spacious “streetcar suburbs.” Commuting symbolized success for families with the income to pay the daily fare.These systems were self-financing: Transit company investors made their money in suburban real estate when rail lines opened up. They charged low fares to entice riders looking to buy land and homes. The most famous example was the Pacific Electric “red car” transit system in Los Angeles that Henry Huntingdon built to transform his vast landholdings into profitable subdivisions.However, once streetcar suburbs were built out, these companies had no further incentive to provide excellent transit. Unhappy voters felt suckered into crummy commutes. In response, city officials retaliated against the powerful transit interests by taxing them heavily and charging them for street repairs.Meanwhile, the introduction of mass-produced personal cars created new competition for public transit. As autos gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, frustrated commuters swapped out riding for driving, and private transit companies like Pacific Electric began failing.Grudging public takeoversIn most cities, politicians refused to prop up the often-hated private transit companies that now were begging for tax concessions, fare increases or public buyouts. In 1959, for instance, politicians still forced Baltimore’s fading private transit company, the BTC, to divert US2.6 million in revenues annually to taxes. The companies retaliated by slashing maintenance, routes and service.Local and state governments finally stepped in to save the ruins of the hardest-strapped companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Public buyouts took place only after decades of devastating losses, including most streetcar networks, in cities such as Baltimore (1970), Atlanta (1971) and Houston (1974).These poorly subsidized public systems continued to lose riders. Transit’s share of daily commuters fell from 8.5% in 1970 to 4.9% in 2018. And while low-income people disproportionately ride transit, a 2008 study showed that roughly 80% of the working poor commuted by vehicle instead, despite the high cost of car ownership.There were exceptions. Notably, San Francisco and Boston began subsidizing transit in 1904 and 1918, respectively, by sharing tax revenues with newly created public operators. Even in the face of significant ridership losses from 1945 to 1970, these cities’ transit systems kept fares low, maintained legacy rail and bus lines and modestly renovated their systems.Converging pressuresToday, public transit is under enormous pressure nationwide. Inflation and driver shortages are driving up operating costs. Managers are spending more money on public safety in response to rising transit crime rates and unhoused people using buses and trains for shelter.Many systems are also contending with decrepit infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. public transit systems a grade of D-minus and estimates their national backlog of unmet capital needs at 176 billion. Deferred repairs and upgrades reduce service quality, leading to events like a 30-day emergency shutdown of an entire subway line in Boston in 2022.Despite flashing warning signs, political support for public transit remains weak, especially among conservatives. So it’s not clear that relying on government to make up for free fares is sustainable or a priority.For example, in Washington, conflict is brewing within the city government over how to fund a free bus initiative. Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use.A better modelOther cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, “Fair fare” programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users.Some providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa.Fare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys.As ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop.History shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn’t high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more. Taking fares out of the formula spreads the red ink even faster.","answer":"These cities' politicians and voters have funded more transit options by supplementing fare collections with other sources of public income like bridge tolls and sales and property taxes."},{"question":"Can you write a short story about a ballerina who breaks her leg but works hard to come back from her injury?","answer":"Sally is a ballerina who grew up in a small town and has taken ballet classes since she was 4 years old.

It was sobering, seeing the boy come back to me each night looking more defeated than when he left that morning.

The only thing in this home that was not my own,sat idly in the garage when it was not in the parking lot of our local dive bar.It was 2 AM when I told him, pressing his keys into the palm of his calloused hand, to make a choice:“Leave tonight or live and die this way.”"},{"question":"Present the above information as a dramatic news report.The private Japanese moon lander Hakuto-R crashed in late April during its milestone landing attempt because its onboard altitude sensor got confused by the rim of a lunar crater.Representatives of Tokyo-based company ispace, which built the spacecraft, revealed that the unexpected terrain feature led the lander's onboard computer to decide that its altitude measurement was wrong and rely instead on a calculation based on its expected altitude at that point in the mission. As a result, the computer was convinced the probe was lower than it actually was, which led to the crash on April 25. \\"While the lander estimated its own altitude to be zero, or on the lunar surface, it was later determined to be at an altitude of approximately 5 kms [3.1 miles] above the lunar surface,\\" ispace said in a statement released on Friday (May 26). \\"After reaching the scheduled landing time, the lander continued to descend at a low speed until the propulsion system ran out of fuel. At that time, the controlled descent of the lander ceased, and it is believed to have free-fallen to the moon's surface.\\"The company said in a briefing that an insufficient consideration of terrain topography around the landing side contributed to the failure, partly due to a landing site change several months prior to the mission's liftoff. The lander, which launched in December 2022 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, was to land on April 26 on the floor of the 54-mile-wide (87 km) Atlas Crater in the Mare Frigoris (\\"Sea of Cold\\") region of the moon's near side. Earlier this week, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted the Hakuto-R wreckage near the intended landing site. If successful, Hakuto-R would have been the first privately operated moon lander to accomplish a lunar landing. So far, only NASA, China and Russia have soft-landed spacecraft on the moon's surface. Ispace stressed that the mission successfully completed eight of its nine mission milestones and only failed in the final stages of its powered descent. The mishap, the company's representatives said, will not affect the planned launches of ispace's second and third missions in 2024 and 2025, respectively.","answer":"In a significant setback to the private space sector, the Japanese moon lander Hakuto-R found itself hurtling to an untimely end on the lunar surface due to an unfortunate mishap with its altitude sensor. This catastrophic event transpired in late April during its landmark landing attempt when the sensor, confused by the lip of a lunar crater, led the lander into a fatal nosedive.The spacecraft's creators, the Tokyo-based company ispace, uncovered the harsh reality of this unfortunate event, pinpointing an unanticipated topographical feature as the culprit. The onboard computer of the moon lander, thrown off by the unexpected terrain, had erroneously dismissed the altitude readings. Instead, it relied on a pre-calculated estimate of its altitude relevant to the mission timeline. Consequently, the computer believed the spacecraft was closer to the moon than its actual position, resulting in the disastrous crash on April 25.According to an ispace statement released on Friday (May 26), \\"The lander gauged its altitude as zero, interpreting it to be on the lunar surface, only to later establish that it was, in reality, hovering approximately 5 km [3.1 miles] above the lunar surface.\\" The descent continued to post the expected landing time until the propulsion system depleted, causing a loss of controlled descent. It's believed to have fallen freely to the moon's surface after that.Ispace acknowledged during a press briefing that a lack of adequate consideration for the surrounding terrain of the landing site factored into the mission's downfall. A late switch in the landing site, just months before the mission's liftoff, was identified as a contributing factor.The Hakuto-R, which had launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in December 2022, aimed to touch down in the 54-mile-wide (87 km) Atlas Crater in the moon's Mare Frigoris (\\"Sea of Cold\\") region. However, a recent sighting by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed the wreckage of the Hakuto-R near its intended landing site.This mission had it has been successful, would have crowned Hakuto-R as the first privately-owned moon lander to achieve a lunar landing. Until now, only NASA, China, and Russia have managed to land spacecraft softly on the moon.Ispace assured that despite this misfortune, the mission managed to fulfill eight out of nine of its objectives.

What are some of the big considerations that we need to keep in mind when printing prototypes?","answer":" - Cost: Your prototyping process should have a budget that’s factored into the whole design and production effort.- Measurement units: This may seem menial, but settle on one consistent system of units before you complete the design. It should be a system that works for both your prototyping stages and full-scale production. You don’t want conversion errors to hamper your design.- Tolerances: No production method is 100% perfect and prototypes are notorious for having less-than-exact dimensions. Decide what tolerances are acceptable for the final product and also what are acceptable for your prototypes.- Materials: Sometimes a prototype is made in a different material than the final product. 3D printers, in particular, have some distinct material limitations. If your prototype is made of a different material than your end product, research the different effects those materials might give you. - Functionality: Does your prototype need to contain all the functions of the final product or is it mainly there to test fit and aesthetics? The latter may be far cheaper to make, but won’t cover all development programs.- Intellectual property rights: Before you dive deep into the design process, you need to thoroughly research any similar items. There’s no sense in producing even a prototype if the finished product would violate trademarks or patents. Intellectual property lawyers can be very helpful in this regard.-\\tStart simple: If you’re in a position to create multiple iterative prototypes, start with just the basic fit and form for the first one. You can put more functionality into successive prints while you refine the overall design."},{"question":"Make up a list of 5 trivia questions about Greek Mythology.

Every morning she went out to the meadow to practice, but try as she might she never managed so much as a glow. After one particularly hard morning, she returned home crying. She ran to her mother and told her that she didn't think she was ever going to learn how to sine. Her mother sat her down and told her she loved her. She explained that all rainbows eventually learn to shine and there was no timeframe for this. She just needed to relax and let nature take its course. The small rainbow dried her tears, she was still sad about not being able to shine, but she understood a little better that it wasn't her fault. She stopped going out to the meadow every morning and started just going with the flow and enjoying her day. She had breakfast with her mother every morning and then would go for a walk and explore the scenery. One day, months later, she returned from her morning walk, and her mother gasped. You're shining! The little rainbow hadn't even noticed, but it was true. She had finally gotten her shine."},{"question":"I’m looking for books to suggest for my book club next month.

Mention how it differs from a standard home inspection.  Make the answer at least 150 words.","answer":"Standard home inspections are most frequently completed before the sale of a home or whenever the owner or occupant changes. These inspections address any visible issues the home has and most of the time, you’ll receive a report of the issues that were found and an estimated repair cost.An annual inspection, on the other hand, is just what it sounds like. It’s an inspection of your home every year to ensure that everything is still in good condition. It’s essentially a yearly check-up for your home. Maintenance inspections are done by the owner or occupant for their own information. Unlike standard home inspections, maintenance inspections are done as a preventative measure.Both inspections will typically look at the same things, but with a maintenance inspection, the homeowner is right there to give the go-ahead for a closer look at potential issues. With a standard home inspection, the inspector will only look at the surface level."},{"question":"What are some food and drinks I can make using coffee or with a coffee flavor?","answer":"There are more ways to use coffee in food and drink than one might think. Below is a variety of ideas for recipes to utilize a delicious coffee flavor. - Coffee smoothie: You can use any common smoothie ingredients you like, but banana, cocoa, dates, and milk are good ingredients to start with. - Espresso martini: You can’t go wrong with this classic cocktail. All it takes is freshly brewed espresso, coffee liqueur, and vodka. - Irish coffee: You can make this from scratch, or you can just mix Bailey’s Irish cream into any coffee beverage, hot or iced. - Coffee cake: This cake is a classic coffee-flavored sweet thought to go well with coffee or tea. - Tiramisu: Similar to coffee cake, tiramisu is a classic dessert that comes to mind when thinking of coffee-flavored desserts. - Chocolate cake: Many classic chocolate cake recipes mix coffee into the batter or replace water with coffee to add an extra richness to the flavor profile. - Coffee-flavored waffles: To get the flavor for this one, you’ll need espresso powder to mix into the batter, and perhaps more to sprinkle on top of the finished product.- Coffee ice cream: If you have an ice cream maker, all you really need is instant coffee, sweetened condensed milk, and cream to create coffee-flavored ice cream.- Coffee-rubbed steak: Ground coffee beans combined with some of your favorite seasonings and spices make an excellent rub for a steak. - Bourbon and maple sweet potatoes: For this one, you’ll roast the sweet potatoes and then a coffee reduction is utilized in a delicious sauce mixed with syrup and bourbon.- Pulled pork: If cooking this in the slow cooker, you can add a bit of brewed coffee to really enhance the flavors and leave behind a scrumptious gravy. - Bacon jam: Wherever you want to use this jam is up to you, but the bacon flavor mixed with coffee and bourbon (amongst other ingredients) is a surefire way to mix up any cheese board or sandwich. - Salted honey and chocolate bark: This one may require a bit of extra work, but this sweet and salty candy is a delicious use of crushed coffee beans.

It should be brief, no longer than 150 words, and written so that a 12-year-old can understand it. Provide some context regarding the geographic location of the places mentioned.","answer":"Dilmun was a kingdom that was around a long time ago– nearly 4,000 years. The kingdom was located in modern-day Bahrain, a very small island country near Saudi Arabia. They were important because they connected Sumer (in modern-day Iraq) with the Indus Valley (in modern-day Pakistan and part of India).

He says it's some kind of joke.  I've never understood what makes a joke work, much less, what a shaggy dog story is.  Explain how jokes work and exactly what is a shaggy dog story.  It will be helpful if you give examples along with the explanation.","answer":"Every joke consists of a set-up which, like the exposition of a play, tells the listener or reader everything necessary to understand the finale called the punch line which, in itself needs to be unexpected based on the set-up. Here is an example.Set-up: A skeleton walks into a bar.  The bartender asks, “What will you have?” The skeleton says,Punch line: “A beer and a mop.The set-up puts the image of a skeleton, a bar, and the bartender in the listener’s mind and presents a question. The listener will try to anticipate how the skeleton will respond, which, unless the listener had heard the joke before, they will be unlikely to guess. This creates tension in the listener. The unexpected answer found in the punchline surprises the listener who laughs because of the surprise that releases the tension.A Shaggy Dog story, named after a famous, oft-told joke, is similar. It has a set-up but then has lots of generally irrelevant information added. During the conveying of the information (the story), the listener tries to figure out how all this information will lead to a punchline and what that punchline will be. The punchline to a Shaggy Dog story is often nonsensical as well as being a surprise. Theoretically, the more tension created by the long story, the greater the laugh and release, but with Shaggy Dog stories (that do not always involve a dog), the response is often a groan. Here is an example.A man and a dog walk into a bar. The man sits on a bar stool and invites the dog to do the same. As soon as the dog jumps onto the stool the bartender says, “Get that dog outta here.  We don’t allow no mangy mutts in here!”The man says, “But sir, this is a very special dog. He talks.”“Dogs don’t talk, mister. Get it and you outta my bar,” says the bartender.“Well, sir,” says the man, “I can prove he talks.  In fact, I’d be willing to bet that he does. Whatta ya say, if he talks, you apologize to him and give me a free beer. If he doesn’t talk, then we will leave.”The bartender thinks this over a moment and then agrees saying, “This is against my better judgment, but go ahead. Make him talk.”The man turns to the dog who has been waiting patiently on the next stool and asks, “What is the opposite of smooth?”The dog says, “Ruff!”“See,” says the man, “He can talk.”“No, he can’t,” says the bartender, “That’s just him barking. Get outta here, both of ya.”“Ok. Wait, wait, wait,” says the man holding up his hand, “That wasn’t the best example. Let me try again, please.”The bartender growls and looks at the dog who wags his tail. “OK.  You get one more chance for the dog to talk.”The man turns to the dog and asks, “What’s on top of a house?”The dog says “Ruff!”“See?” asks the man.The bartender who is getting angry says, “That’s just a bark again. You ain’t foolin’ no one. Get outta here before I call the cops!”The man says, “I can see your point. Another bad question. Let me ask one more to prove it to you.”The bartender looks at the man and then at the dog which has but its chin on the bar and stares lovingly at the bartender with its big, dark eyes.“OK. Last time. He better talk or me and my friends are gonna throw you out on the street!”The man turns to the dog again and asks, with an imploring look in his eyes, “Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?”The dog says, “Ruff!”The bartender comes around the bar and calls over his friends who pick up the man and the dog, carry them to the door, and toss them onto the sidewalk.The man, sits against the building stunned, rubbing a new bump on his head. The dog walks over to the man, gives the bump on his head three licks and says …“You think, maybe, I should have said DiMaggio?”"},{"question":"List the top ten ways to destroy a Zombie.

It was a learning management system, built to revolutionise how tech companies managed to create a learning culture. The entire idea came to Ilie while trying to find a good tool to use within Thinslices to help organise learning, which is a core value at Thinslices, throughout the company. Browsing through an already crowded market of over 2000 LMSs, we couldn’t find a tool with the desired functionalities, the modern look and in the right price range. So, the natural question for a serial entrepreneur came up: why not build one ourselves? And we did.Moreover, if we, a software development company, had a real need for a modern, swift LMS, it made sense to think that other tech companies needed it as well. Soon after, a small team formed around Teamfluent, covering all departments: software development, sales, marketing, customer success, finance & admin.The sales discussions were great, people liked our MVP, our functionalities roadmap and our business model. But it’s a long and winding road from discussions to actual contracts. Moreover, the clients we were discussing with were already using learning management systems inside their companies. So, although they liked our product, putting into balance the effort it would have taken to switch to a new tool - however better the new one might be - and the difficulty to gain wide adoption among colleagues, the math simply didn’t add up. After 2 years of enthusiastic and hard work, with numerous tech customers, we decided to end Teamfluent’s journey, not without important learnings.","answer":"Teamfluent was found in 2016 while examining different tools in Thinslices to revolutionize the learning systems for tech companies. It was quite challenging to find a useful tool due to the oversaturated market and specific requirements for our idea, so we just decided to build it ourselves. We reflected on the high demand for an effective LMS and formed a small team called Teamfluent to bring this system to life. Initially, many people were intrigued by our visions, blueprints, and business plans, but persuading them to join us and form contracts wasn't as easy. Most of our clients were already accustomed to powerful LMS, but even though they admired our efforts and ideas, they couldn't see it as a widely-used tool. Thus, after 2 years of consulting tech-customers, Teamfluent realized its weaknesses and came to an end."},{"question":"Please write a story about a woman planting her spring garden.

Horen the owl was in a very big mess of his own making. His master, the great Arch Wizard Seelough, hadn't yet woken up to start his wizardly duties. Horen usually took this time in the morning to prepare things as best he could for his master. Such preparations included cracking a few eggs on the stove, laying out some nice new robes, and polishing up his spectacles. Of course, the Arch Wizard Seelough could accomplish all of this with magic, but then what would be the use of a familiar? Job security was really important to Horen. Unfortunately, one of Horen's talons scratched up a lens on his master's spectacles. Horen was mortified at his misstep. He would need to remedy this quickly in order to keep that aforementioned job security in check. Thinking quickly, he wound back the alarm clock and bought himself some time before flying out of the window towards town. Flying overhead, and with the spectacles in his talons, Horen circled high above the town looking for a familiar building that he had entered a few times before perched atop his master's shoulder. Swooping low, he landed on the windowsill and gave it a tap with his beak. An older woman with long white hair tied back in a bun turned with surprise at him, before a warm smile stretched across her face. She opened the window and in Horen flew.\\"I remember you,\\" said the woman. \\"You're friends with old Seelough on the hill, aren't you? What brings you to my shop today?\\"Horen placed the spectacles on the table and gave them a slight push with his beak with a soft hoot.\\"Ah, I see,\\" she replied with true understanding. \\"Not to worry, dear. You've come to the right place. I'm no doctor, but with my jeweling skills, I can fix these spectacles right up in a jiffy.\\" At that, Horen relaxed with relief. \\"There,\\" the woman said after an hour."},{"question":"Expand Katy Perry’s “you just have to say that you're fine” quote into a short story.

Summarize it to its essential facts in less than 150 words.Lou Gehrig and the History of ALS”Amyotrophic” comes from the Greek language. \\"A\\" means no. \\"Myo\\" refers to muscle.  \\"Trophic\\" means nourishment. So, amyotrophic means \\"no muscle nourishment,” and when a muscle has no nourishment, it \\"atrophies\\" or wastes away.\\"Lateral\\" identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that signal and control the muscles are located.As this area degenerates, it leads to scarring or hardening (\\"sclerosis\\") in the region.The disease was identified in 1869 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot and became more widely known internationally on June 2, 1941, when it ended the career of one of baseball’s most beloved players, Lou Gehrig. For many years, ALS was commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.Gehrig played with the New York Yankees for 17 years and received the moniker “The Iron Horse” due to his ability to play baseball despite suffering from a variety of injuries.Born in New York City to the son of German immigrants, Heinrich and Christina Gehrig, Gehrig attended Columbia University on a football scholarship to study engineering, yet he also played the sport for which he is best known during his tenure at the Ivy League school.A baseball scout signed Gehrig to the Yankees in 1923 due to his remarkable hitting skills.  He held various positions on the team until his retirement, including shortstop and outfielder; however, many know him best as the Yankees’ first baseman.Gehrig garnered many achievements in his career. He hit 493 home runs; held the record for most grand slams in a career (23) until 2013; and established a record for playing 2,130 consecutive professional baseball games. The Yankees also made him the first athlete to have a jersey number retired. Gehrig was diagnosed with ALS on his 36th birthday during a visit with his wife Eleanor to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on June 19, 1939. Prior to his diagnosis, Gehrig noticed several of the disease’s symptoms while playing on the field, including a loss of strength, slipping, falling and loss of coordination.Shortly after his diagnosis, Gehrig chose to retire from baseball. The Yankees designated July 4, 1939, “Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day” at Yankee Stadium, and honored its former first baseman for his sportsman-like behavior and dedication to the game. On that day, nearly 62,000 fans listened to Gehrig give his famous speech where he deemed himself “the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”On June 2, 2021, Major League Baseball (MLB) launched the inaugural Lou Gehrig Day across the MLB network. This day, to be celebrated each year on Gehrig’s birthday, is intended to honor the famed “Iron Horse,” and raise nationwide awareness of ALS and engage more people in the fight against this insidious disease.","answer":"Lou Gehrig was signed by the Yankees in 1923.

However, research shows that fats in your diet affect your cholesterol levels more than cholesterol in food. The food that you eat alongside your eggs also affects your health--sliced avocados and grilled tomatoes are lighter options than bacon and sausage.

Everyone's eyes made me a little uncomfortable, but they did not matter at the moment. The only thing that matters right now is the match. On the screen, it shows both of our characters, ready to fight. The countdown occurs. Three! Two! One! Fight!That word, \\"Fight!\\" It's motivating. It tells me to only focus on the person in front. I press left on the arcade stick, making my character walk backward. I hone in on Talo's character, trying to see what he'll do first. He surprises me by zipping right past my guard and dashing right up to my face. I wasn't ready. He got the first hit with a 3-hit combo to take the first lead. I was focused on playing defense that I didn't think about mounting an offense of my own. I was behind. My hands were a little sweaty, but I was ok. Playing a fighting game was like an intricate dance. My opponent and I move around each other, dancing around each other, contesting each over at every opportunity. We played like we were aiming to win. There was no \\"my team made me worse\\" or \\"I was feeling a little off because of the stage.\\" If we lost, we knew it was because we weren't good enough. The dance was hypnotic; we pressed our buttons in time with each other and hoped that they worked. You could hear the grunts and squeals of the character every time they landed a hit or got hit. The crowd would \\"Oooh\\" and \\"Aaaah\\" at every move. They were also enthralled by the match. \\"This guy is giving Talo a good match!\\"\\"This is a more exciting match than the finals!\\"The timer of the match counts down. 30, 29, 28. I was down on life, so I had to make a risky move. Talo was good, though, so it might knock me out if I do it at the wrong time. There was no time to think.

Embry saw her whisper something in the driver’s ear before opening the door. The driver stared straight ahead, then reached over to reset the meter. Embry never saw money change hands. Skye led him down a busy sidewalk crowded with drunk college students. They shouted and swayed, then gracelessly drifted aside as Skye drew near, clearing a path without ever noticing her presence. To an untrained eye, the whole scene might have looked choreographed. But now, Embry could see it for what it truly was: the sheer force of a sentient wind.He grinned, following close in her wake. “Bet that never gets old, does it?” Skye shrugged. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”She steered them down a dark, narrow alley. Once the light and noise of Broome Street faded behind them, Embry heard the deep pulsing bass beat of dance music and the laughter of inebriated sophisticates ahead. Soon, his eyes found the club’s sign, though it was camouflaged to blend in with the surrounding fire escapes. 'Compass,' it read in black iron letters beside a compass rose.Skye lowered her voice as they approached the door. “Follow my lead, okay? And uh… try not to look so lost. Those wide eyes and baby cheeks are just begging for attention.”Embry puffed up his chest. “Maybe I could use some attention.”Skye shook her head with a condescending smirk. “Not this kind.” She paused, meeting his questioning gaze. “Look, when you put this many Elementals in an enclosed space with booze, they inevitably start challenging each other to duels. You’re not ready for that. Just keep your head down.”There was no line outside--only a few patrons smoking cigarettes. Embry tried not to gape at their outlandish outfits, but it wasn’t easy. The fabrics they wore were like nothing he’d ever seen, woven in shapes that defied gravity and colors that shifted from one second to the next. His gaze lingered on the tallest man among them, who wore a full body suit the texture of tree bark. The longer Embry stared, the less certain he became--was it a garment, or simply his skin?“What did I just tell you?” Skye hissed, “Quit gawking!”Embry flinched, tearing his gaze away."},{"question":"Suggest five great places to retire and provide me with a few reasons why for each one.","answer":"Ok, here are five suggestions for great places to retire. 1.

I want five items listed numerically, counting down from five. Please include a title for the article above everything else and I'd like an introduction as well. The entire article should be 750 words maximum, but less is fine. Please use a friendly and conversational tone. Make sure it's easily digestible so new players can understand it too.","answer":"The Best Five Magic Items for Wizards in Dungeons and Dragons 5th EditionWizards are by far one of the most popular classes in Dungeons & Dragons. They dedicate their lives to the pursuit of arcane knowledge and uncovering the secrets of the world. They’re extremely powerful spellcasters and with the right items, they could be unstoppable. Here is a list of five magic items for wizards!5. Ring of Spell StoringThe Ring of Spell Storing is a must-have for wizards, especially low-level wizards. This item allows you to store up to five levels of spells within it to use at a later time. You can even cast the spells and give the ring to another player to use. Low-level players have fewer spell slots, and the spells within the ring are held there indefinitely until they are used. This could be very advantageous for managing spell slots in combat when the chances of a long rest are slim.4. Arcane GrimoireThe Arcane Grimoire can replace a wizard’s standard spellbook and grant bonuses to the spell save DC and attack bonus. Depending on rarity, the bonus can be +1, +2, or +3. It also allows wizards to regain an additional spell slot when they use their arcane recovery feature - which lets them recover a limited amount of spell slots during a short rest.This is a great item because of its spellcasting bonuses, ensuring more of your spells are effective in and out of combat.3. Rod of AbsorptionWizards are very powerful and can wreak havoc on a battlefield. But sadly they don’t tend to fare well when it comes to getting hit. The Rod of Absorption comes in handy to help against spell attacks. A wizard attuned to this item can use their reaction when they’re targeted by a spell that only targets one creature to absorb the energy of the spell. The rod holds 50 charges of spell slots (for example a level 4 spell is equal to 4 charges) and the attuned wizard can then use the energy from within the rod to create more spell slots for themselves.This is an excellent item for wizards with low armor class that would be instantly killed by an upcasted Inflict Wounds. Plus, the bonus spell slots are always useful.2. Tome of Clear ThoughtBecause wizards are intelligence-based spellcasters, having an item that allows your intelligence maximum to increase can be game-changing. By studying the Tome of Clear thought the character's intelligence score is increased by 2 and so is their intelligence maximum. That means that instead of the 20 cap, players with this item can reach 22. That effectively gives the player an additional +1 to their spellcasting ability.1 Arch Magi Items (robe or staff)The Robe of the Arch Magi and the Staff of the Magi are two of the most powerful items in the entire game. Both items grant bonuses to the attuned character's spell save DC and attack bonuses, but they also give players access to other spells and bonuses to their armor class.These items are perfect for building a more resilient wizard while also granting a myriad of other bonuses."},{"question":"Can a burglar disable a house alarm?","answer":"A knowledgeable burglar can cut your power source or phone line to disable your wired home alarm system.

Please ask for a new law to allow emotional-support alligators to be able to be tied to fire hydrants. Please make the letter from the perspective of a Cajun man named Boudreaux who lives near the bayou but needs to run errands in the city with his pet alligator and needs a way to keep her safe while doing so.","answer":"Dear congressman,My name is Boudreaux and I live here in the deep south of Louisiana, the very heart of alligators and cajun food. As you know, we here in the bayou areas of our beautiful state are a simple people. We wake up in the morning, take our pirogues out for fishing and crab-trapping, come home to make seafood gumbo, and fall asleep to the sound of cicadas outside of our windows. Life is humble for us. However, there are times when we need to stray from our daily routines and make our way into the city. We want to be law-abiding citizens, so it is only proper for us to go into the city to run much-needed errands like mailing our taxes and updating the brake tags on our pick-up trucks. This is where our problems truly come into play. You see, congressman, I have been taking care of my pet alligator, Antoinette, since we were both babies. I am sure you are aware that it is illegal to tie your alligator to the fire hydrant in Louisiana. My alligator is my companion and gets me through the day. I get anxious in the city, and I am asking for your help in drafting a new law that would make exceptions for emotional-support alligators to be tied to fire hydrants. When I go to the city to participate as a productive, law-abiding citizen of our beautiful country, it is made more difficult by the lack of resources for my emotional-support pet. For Antoinette's safety, I would like to be able to tie her to the fire hydrant while I go into different buildings for my errands. I am asking that all emotional-support alligators be given an exemption to this law, thereby assisting bayou dwellers like me who have a hard time navigating city life and alligators like her who need a safe place to wait without the risk of getting run over.Thank you for your time, congressmen. I ask that you consider my proposal and help me to draft such a law. I will also be heading a petition as I am not alone in my concerns. Your support would be greatly appreciated.Sincerely, Boudreaux"},{"question":"Who won finals MVP in the 2017 NBA finals?Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors with the expressed purpose of besting LeBron James and Co. and winning his first NBA title.

Within the story, iterate how unimportant new or fancy gear can be sometimes when compared to older pieces of equipment that are trustworthy. Your audience is a group of mechanics who use old vehicles to do their off-roading trips.","answer":"A few miles down Perkinsville Road was an infamous off-roading trail full of rock features and steep descents, located precisely where Bo and Billy were headed. Billy had recently purchased a brand new Jeep and outfitted it with every Overlanding upgrade he could get his hands on. However, since Bo could not afford such niceties, he was trailing behind in his old hand-me-down Tacoma. This was nothing anyone ever heard Bo complain about as he seemed wholly content with his rig and, in any case, he could go anywhere someone like Billy could go in a souped-up new model.The friends arrived at the 4x4 trailhead, Billy ahead of Bo. They exited their vehicles and eyeballed the route they were going to travel down. Ultimately, the two decided it was nothing their vehicles could not handle. The trail was titled Smiley Rock at some point, likely because those who drove down it in the past were grinning the same as Billy and Bo were now. After conquering a few of the easier early sections, their two-car caravan came to an abrupt stop.Over half of the road had disappeared. Washed away by erosion over time, the trail was deemed impassable—at least, that was Bo’s conclusion. Billy wanted to try it, and Bo knew he could do little to persuade him otherwise. Therefore, the only option Bo had was to act as a spotter while Billy attempted the crossing.As soon as Billy’s rugged tires touched where the road had begun to disappear, the dirt and rocks slid out from under his Jeep and left him dangling over a cliff with two tires hanging in the air. Bo wasted no time jumping into action and attached the winch from his truck to Billy’s steel bumper and turned the motor on at the final moment. Billy’s truck stopped sliding and was pulled back onto safer ground. Instead of continuing, the two cut their losses and headed back to Perkinsville Road, just happy to be alive with both their rigs."},{"question":"I’m a writer and my work schedule is kind of unpredictable—some weeks I’m stretched thin but others I’m twiddling my thumbs. What are some ways I can earn additional income without being tied to a specific schedule or having to meet a minimum number of work hours per week? Give me at least 2 suggestions that are related to writing/editing.","answer":"No problem; here are some ways to earn additional income where you can set your own schedule and work minimal hours: -Drive for a ride-share service - If you have a car in decent shape and a good driving record, you can sign up to drive for Uber or Lyft. With these platforms, you can set your own schedule.-Sign up with a delivery service - Many delivery services like Instacart will allow delivery drivers to set their own schedules. -Take surveys online - There are many different platforms that pay users low rates to take surveys online, such as MTurk, Prolific, Springboard Panel, and Ipsos. The pay rate is usually relatively low, but you'll have a lot of freedom to set your own schedule and decide which surveys are (or aren't) worth your time.-Sign up for pet-sitting services - Platforms like Rover.com allow you to market yourself as a dog walker or pet sitter. You can visit other people's homes to check on their pets or host their pets at your home for a single day or multiple overnight stays. You'll have the power to decline any offer that doesn't suit your schedule. -Sign up for focus groups - With focus groups, you can get paid just to share your opinion on products or entertainment. These groups often require you to be present in person or virtually for specific hours, but you can always decline if the scheduled time doesn't work for you. The same is true of signing up for mock juries. -Become a mystery shopper - There are several different services that will pay you to visit stores and businesses as an undercover quality control analyst. Typically, they'll provide you with a checklist of things to review in the store and very clear instructions. All you have to do is visit the spot in question on your own time, follow the directions, and get paid. If the directions require you to make a purchase, the company will reimburse you. -Sell arts and crafts - If you've got a hobby (or more than one) that produces marketable products, consider selling them on platforms like Etsy, eBay, or Shopify. If your schedule is unpredictable, consider setting a shop policy that informs buyers that you're only available to ship items and respond to customer inquiries on certain days/times each week. You can also sell these items on your own website or at craft vendor fairs. -Re-sell used items - There are plenty of websites and brick-and-mortar stores where you can sell your used clothes, electronics, furniture, appliances, and more. -Sign up for a copywriting platform - You may want to do some research on these platforms to determine which is the best fit, as some do require their writers to meet a monthly minimum of work hours. Some don't, though, and will simply list available short-term copywriting projects for you to take or leave as you see fit.-Start your own small business - You can work with clients as a writing coach, editor, or in any other capacity you feel qualified to. It will be up to you to determine when you meet with clients and for how long. You can also set your own pay rate."},{"question":"Write a silly story about a duck trying to ask a frog on a date.  Make the frog oblivious to the duck's affection.","answer":"In the middle of a busy park, there was a small pond.  That pond was home to many animals, including a duck named Cathy.  She had plenty of fish to keep her company, and there was also the occasional visit from another duck or a goose as they traveled south.  There was also a very nice green frog named Peter.  Peter and Cathy were good friends.  She even gave him rides on her back if he grew tired of swimming.  At night, Peter would sit on his lilypad and look at the stars.  Cathy often joined him.It took Cathy some time to realize that she was starting to feel like she wanted to be more than friends with Peter.  It took many more days after that for her to get the courage to talk to him.  She found Peter on his lilypad home and swam up to him.  \\"Hey, Peter.

They will be replaced by a crew of equally well-trained kangaroos.As a breed, kangaroos are known for their strength, having been trained to box for many years in Australia. This aptitude adapts well to the hand-to-hand combat training cadets receive in the police academy. Their speed is comparable to that of our canine officers, thanks to their ability to leap great distances. Kangaroos have to wear a minimum of gear, using the storage naturally available within their pouches. And many kangaroos have an imposing size, with some breeds exceeding 7 feet in height.The inaugural unit of kangaroos, the KangaRegiment, has been trained to the same high standards of performance as the department's retiring K-9 officers. Each Rooficer (as these kangaroo officers are nicknamed) was individually selected from hundreds of applications from well-qualified Rooficer candidates. To be offered the position, the candidate had to measure between 7 and 8.5 feet in stature to present an intimidating physical presence. They had to outperform other candidates in distance leaping. And they had to show prowess inside the boxing ring.We request that citizens respect these new police officers in the same way you did our K-9s: do not approach them or their human partner officer in a menacing way, and do not try to pet them without asking their human partner officer first. Remember, these are service kangaroos, and when you see them with their partner out in the field, they are on the job, protecting the citizens of Macadamia County.Please join me in congratulating our new Rooficers and wishing our retiring Canines a well-deserved, restful retirement!"},{"question":"Please write a story about the sun and the moon joining forces to fight aliens.

The moon whipped around to see the spacecraft's hurdling toward Earth. The Sun looked at the moon, and the moon looked back at the sun. They nodded at each other and began powering up their special rays. After about five seconds, the sun and the moon unleashed their rays directly at each other, causing the two rays to combine and create an impenetrable forcefield that the aliens could not get around.

The app is primarily known for its short-form videos and viral dance challenges. Many children and even adults have been hooked on the short style of videos and the entertainment it provides. Although TikTok is used by many people to share their struggles and experiences, it has harmed many people's lives. Attention span has been reduced due to the short format videos, and watching a long video exceeding 2 minutes or reading a paragraph can be difficult for some who lose track of what they are doing. This affects a person's mental health, as it reduces their ability to stay focused for long periods of time, which can create anxiety outside of short format videos such as TikTok.Another problem that is slowly creeping up is that TikTok has contributed to a lot of people's confidence and self-esteem dropping. This is because they are exposed to videos that portray the 'perfect body' or 'perfect life.' Young people see these videos and reflect on themselves, which can hugely decrease their confidence, hence having a massive effect on a young person's view of the world and themselves.In terms of who it would affect most, it would be younger children, as they are the ones who are easily influenced. Seeing thousands of videos in the span of a few hours can have a toll on a young person's mind, which is curious, and views.TikTok can be used moderately where it is not affecting you personally, and you are able to watch it without it affecting your day-to-day life by moderating the time you spend on the app. "},{"question":"Write a news style post about a fake event, like aliens from Mars landing on Earth.

We are no longer alone in the universe. Life outside our planet exists and aliens have landed in Nevada.NASA scientists had been tracking a strange non-terrestrial object for days leading up to today's big event. The object appeared from behind the dark side of the moon and was originally believed to be an untracked asteroid or comet. However, the object's path and speed started changing until today it entered Earth's atmosphere. Instead of burning up like a hunk of space rock, it was able to penetrate the atmosphere and survive.The military scrambled jets and the first sighting described the flying object as being triangular with a matte black exterior and no visible ports of entry or egress. It was a tense few moments as first contact was made but the craft was allowed to continue unhindered as it showed no hostile intent.Passing over Washington, D.C., Chicago, and other major metropolitan areas the craft finally touched down in Nevada. Many top officials believed they were heading to the notorious Area 51. But that proved not to be the case as the UFO instead landed directly on the Vegas strip. Roughly the size of a 747 jet, all traffic stopped immediately.Two figures exited the craft distinctly humanoid in shape. The taller of the two raised its right hand and made a gesture splitting their fingers into a V-shape and spoke in perfect English, \\"Live long and prosper.\\" It was at this point that the shorter alien slapped the taller alien on the shoulder and let out an audible sigh.They were Trekkies. The aliens were Star Trek fans.As people approached the aliens they noticed they were clad in the uniforms of the original Star Trek officers, one in yellow for command and one in blue for science specialty. This was no alien invasion, this was a vacation.The aliens were allowed to proceed as journalists and military personnel alike shadowed them.

Though, I am so fortunate and glad that I have access to a washer & dryer, the convenience of clean clothes right from my own home!

Reading for pleasure or entertainment can be a wonderful use of time, but this article is about reading to learn. With that in mind, I’d like to share some of the best reading comprehension strategies I’ve found.Quit More BooksIt doesn’t take long to figure out if something is worth reading. Skilled writing and high-quality ideas stick out.As a result, most people should probably start more books than they do. This doesn’t mean you need to read each book page-by-page. You can skim the table of contents, chapter titles, and subheadings. Pick an interesting section and dive in for a few pages. Maybe flip through the book and glance at any bolded points or tables. In ten minutes, you’ll have a reasonable idea of how good it is.Then comes the crucial step: Quit books quickly and without guilt or shame.Choose Books You Can Use InstantlyOne way to improve reading comprehension is to choose books you can immediately apply. Putting the ideas you read into action is one of the best ways to secure them in your mind. Practice is a very effective form of learning.Choosing a book that you can use also provides a strong incentive to pay attention and remember the material. That’s particularly true when something important hangs in the balance. Create Searchable NotesKeep notes on what you read. You can do this however you like. It doesn’t need to be a big production or a complicated system. Just do something to emphasize the important points and passages.I do this in different ways depending on the format I’m consuming. I highlight passages when reading on Kindle. I type out interesting quotes as I listen to audiobooks. I dog-ear pages and transcribe notes when reading a print book.Combine Knowledge TreesOne way to imagine a book is like a knowledge tree with a few fundamental concepts forming the trunk and the details forming the branches. You can learn more and improve reading comprehension by “linking branches” and integrating your current book with other knowledge trees.Write a Short SummaryAs soon as I finish a book, I challenge myself to summarize the entire text in just three sentences. This constraint is just a game, of course, but it forces me to consider what was really important about the book.Surround the TopicOne way to attack this problem is to read a variety of books on the same topic. Dig in from different angles, look at the same problem through the eyes of various authors, and try to transcend the boundary of your own experience.Read It TwiceI’d like to finish by returning to an idea I mentioned near the beginning of this article: read the great books twice. The philosopher Karl Popper explained the benefits nicely, “Anything worth reading is not only worth reading twice, but worth reading again and again. If a book is worthwhile, then you will always be able to make new discoveries in it and find things in it that you didn’t notice before, even though you have read it many times.”","answer":"• Quit more books : It doesn't take alot of time to figure out if something is worth reading, skim it and see if it's something you would want to read. If not, quit it.• Choose books you can use instantly : Choosing a book that you can use provides a strong incentive to pay attention and remember the material.• Create searchable notes : Creating searchable notes is essential for returning ideas quickly• Combine Knowledge trees : You can learn more and improve reading and comprehension by \\"linking branches\\" and integrating your current book with other knowledge.• Write a short summary : This forces you to consider what was really important about the book.• Surround the topic : This can be done by reading a ton of books surrounding the same topic. • Read it twice : If a book is worth it, then you'll be to find things you didn't notice before. "},{"question":"Rewrite these polar bear facts by turning them into questions and answers so that a 6th grader could understand them.1. Polar bears are classified as marine animals.Because they spend most of their lives on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean depending on the ocean for their food and habitat, polar bears are the only bear species to be considered marine mammals.2. A polar bear's skin is actually black.Beneath all that thick fur, polar bears have jet black skin. The polar bear’s fur is also translucent, and only appears white because it reflects visible light.3. They can swim constantly for days at a time.As well as reaching speeds of up to 6mph in the water, polar bears can swim for long distances and steadily for many hours to get from one piece of ice to another. Their large paws are specially adapted for swimming, which they’ll use to paddle through the water while holding their hind legs flat like a rudder.4. Less than 2% of polar bear hunts are successful.Although about half of a polar bear’s life is spent hunting for food, their hunts are rarely successful. A polar bear’s main prey consists of ringed seals and bearded seals, which they hunt in a variety of ways. Either by breaking into pupping dens, waiting at breathing holes or at the water’s edge, or stalking seals that have hauled out to rest on the ice. Besides catching seals, polar bears will also scavenge carcasses or settle for small mammals, birds, eggs and vegetation.5. Scientists can extract polar bear DNA from just their footprints.An innovative new technique developed by WWF and DNA specialist firm SPYGEN allows scientists to isolate DNA from a polar bear’s footprint in the snow. Two tiny scoops of snow from a polar bear track revealed not just the DNA of the polar bear that made it, but even from a seal it had recently eaten.","answer":"1. What kind of animals are polar bears ?Polar bears are considered marine animals because they are on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean most of the time. After all, this is where they get their food. Polar bears are the only bears that are marine mammals.2. What is the color of a polar bear's skin, and why do they have white fur?A polar bear's skin is black. Although a polar bear's fur looks like it's white, it has no color. The only reason it looks like it's white is because it reflects visible light. 3. How long can polar bears swim for and how do they do it?Polar bears can swim day after day for a steady amount of time. Not only that, but they can swim for up to 6 miles per hour in water. Polar bears can swim far for a long time, especially if they want to get from one piece of ice to another. Their big paws are designed for swimming, and they use them to paddle through the water while keeping their hind legs flat. 4. How many polar bear hunts are successful, and what do they eat?Only 2 out of 100 polar bear hunts are a success. Even though a polar bear spends half of its life trying to hunt for food, they are rarely lucky. A polar bear mostly eats ringed seals and bearded seals, and they hunt for them in different ways. They either break into pupping dens or follow them when they are on the ice. Polar bears also eat small mammals, birds, plants, or eggs. 5. How do scientists get the DNA of a polar bear?There has been a new method developed by specialists that helps scientists get DNA from a polar bear's footprint in the snow. They only need two small scoops of snow to get the DNA of a polar bear, and even the DNA of a recent meal, such as a seal."},{"question":"I need to write a documentary on some of the deadliest insects out there.

Ancient Giant Hornet: Native to Eastern Asia, these fierce 2-inch hornets are known for their noxious venom, which can easily kill an allergic victim with a single stinger. Even for non-allergic victims, this savage venom can be brutally fatal, which makes this insect particularly dangerous. 2. Kissing Bug: Also known as vampire bugs, these bloodthirsty creatures bite their victims right around the soft tissues of their mouths. Their bite is known to carry the Chagas disease, which shows symptoms in 4 to 8 weeks and gets deadlier over time. Victims of the kissing bug are reported to be diagnosed with fever, swelling, and even heart disease if they're not cured in 10 to 30 years.3. Tsetse Fly: This notorious African bug is known to have an exceptionally ferocious bite that leads to victims suffering from sleeping sickness. This is a fatal disease with no easy treatment. Furthermore, a tsetse fly's bite can cause confusion, numbness, headaches, itchiness, and extensive trouble sleeping.4. Deathstalker Scorpion: One of the most dangerous scorpions in North Africa, the deathstalker scorpion's venom is comprised of four neurotoxins that can lead to instant heart failure. It's particularly deadly for children who can die from one sting if their bodies aren't treated with antivenom regularly.5. Assassin Caterpillar: Dominant in Brazil, this radiating caterpillar is a breed of furry moth that produces corrosive venomous bristles from its body. Upon physical contact, this caterpillar's venom can cause fever, vomiting, headache, and severe bleeding - all within 24 hours.These are 5 of the deadliest insects out there.

He didn’t get along with humans very well, but he was very talented at watching them and spent many days inventing stories in his mind about the passers-by. While his people-watching and story-making brought him joy, he was very lonely and desperately wished he had someone to share his stories with. One day Enjamin came across a poster advertising a story-writing competition, and he thought that if he could prove himself in that competition he could meet the sort of friend he was looking for. Enjamin sought out a new subject for his people-watching and began to follow a particular boy around the city to observe for inspiration. The boy, Leo, eventually realized he was being followed and confronted Enjamin, but despite Enjamin's awkward social ineptitude Leo came to find the goblin fun to talk with. While Enjamin never exactly came clean about why he was following Leo, he nevertheless continued to spend time together with him as Leo enjoyed listening to his stories and people-watching with him.Leo and Enjamin enjoyed their time together for several weeks, but eventually, Leo stumbled across Enjamin's writing and discovered that Enjamin had been writing about him. After confronting Enjamin with this and learning about the writing contest, Leo felt hurt and used and told Enjamin that he didn't want to hang out anymore. The goblin begged Leo to change his mind, but he refused. After Leo left him that day, Enjamin tossed his story away into the gutter and decided that he would not enter the contest as he didn't feel he could be happy winning it at the expense of having hurt Leo's feelings. The next day, Leo passed by the cast-away story while walking to school, and realized what must have transpired. While he was still upset with Enjamin, he didn't want to see the goblin hurt, so he gathered the scattered pages and entered them into the competition just before the entry deadline. The goblin's story ended up placing fourth in the contest, and Leo hunted down Enjamin to share the news.  And even though he didn't win the contest, that is when Enjamin realized he had won something far more important than that.

Despite having a name that somehow sounds obscene, Philip Thicknesse (1719-1792) was not a happy man. He spent his younger years traveling the world, getting up to various racist colonial goings-on, before settling down in England, where he published a sketchy book on healthy living that recommended as much inhalation of “the breath of young women” as possible. But he found normal life on land didn’t work for him, and he ended up living in the grounds of his house as a hermit, digging up Saxon coffins and making up stories about the bodies he found.

This, he said in an accompanying note, was to “remind him of his duty to God after having so long abandoned the duty he owed to a father, who once so affectionately loved him.” A combination of a vile guilt-trip and a subtle “I did not love you anymore” message, all in one.

Let's look at an example of a simple addition function in AutoHotKey:Addition(a, b){    return a + b}While this particular example does not represent space efficiency itself, each time this function is called, it will save a line of code.For a concrete example, see below where we want to add four numbers together using the function nested twice in a function:Mynumber := Addition(Addition(1,2),Addition(3,4))This line would return 10 because the function is called three times: first for (1+2), second for (3+4), and finally for (3+7). AHK also has mathematical functions predefined. If you wanted to achieve this more simply, you could use this code:Mynumber:= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4This avoids writing a function for extant features.

No one knew why, but she had no wings. And, what’s more, she was a Princess, daughter of the Great Fairy Queen. As she was so tiny, like a flower, life was just a series of problems for her. Not only couldn’t she fly, but she hardly had any magical powers, since fairy magic comes from their delicate crystal wings.So, from an early age, Adalina had depended on the help of others for many things. She grew up thanking people, smiling and being friendly, so naturally all the creatures in the forest were delighted to help her.But when she reached the age to become Queen, many fairies doubted she could be a good Queen with such a disability. They argued and protested so much that Adalina had to agree to take a test in which she would have to demonstrate to everyone the wonders she could work.The little fairy became extremely sad. What could she do? She was hardly magic at all, and couldn't even travel far with those little legs of hers. But while Adalina sat on a stone next to the river, trying to think of something that would surprise the other fairies, the news of the test was spreading among the friendly forest animals. Before long, hundreds of creatures were by her side, ready to help her however she needed.-“Thank you so much, little friends. I feel much better with you by my side,”she said with the sweetest of smiles,-\\"but I don't know whether you'll be able to help me.\\"-“Of course we will!”answered the squirrel,-“Tell us, what will you do to surprise those foolish fairies?”-“Wow…. if only I could, I would love to capture the first ray of sunshine before it touches the Earth, and keep it in a dewdrop, so that when it was needed it could be used as a lantern for all who live in the forest. Or… I’d also like to paint a rainbow in the night sky, under the pale moonlight, so that the nocturnal creatures could see its beauty… But I don’t have any magic or any wings to keep it in…”-“Well, you must have your magic kept somewhere else then! Look!\\"an old tortoise shouted excitedly, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it.It was true. When Adalina had been telling her friends of her deepest wishes, a wave of magic had washed over them, and there they all were, flying through the air, making a magic rainbow, and capturing not just one but hundreds of rays of sunshine within fine drops of water that filled the sky with tiny brilliant lamps. For the whole day and night you could see squirrels, mice, frogs, birds and fish leaping through the sky, filling it with light and colour, in a spectacle never seen before and that filled the forest dwellers with delight.Adalina was declared Queen of the Fairies, despite her not knowing from where such a powerful magic had come. And it wasn’t until some time later that the young Queen understood that she was the first of the Great Fairies, whose magic is to be found not in one's wings but within all one’s true friends.","answer":"Adalina was disparate. She was the only fairy who didn't have wings, and no one knew why. Furthermore, Adalina was the daughter of the Great Fairy Queen, making her a princess. Adalina was as petite as a flower. However, life didn't treat her delicately. Throughout her life, she constantly faced problems. She couldn't fly and she had barely any magical powers. This is because fairy power comes from the wings. Therefore, Adalina had to depend on others for help. She was extremely grateful for the help she would receive. She made sure that she always smiled and thanked people. Adalina was loved by the forest creatures due to her affectionate nature. When the time came for her to be Queen, many people doubted her abilities since they did not deem her as powerful. The people protested and argued against it, and Adalina felt as though she had to take a test in an attempt to exhibit the miracles she could spawn. This worried the fairy because she knew she did not have the powers expected of her. She can not even travel far distances with her small legs. Adaline sat on a stone near the river and attempted to think of a solution that would leave the fairies astonished. Eventually, the amiable forest animal heard the news of the test that Adalina would have to take. Shortly after, hundreds of the creatures came by her side, prepared to help for as long as necessary.\\"Thank you, friends. I feel better now that you all are with me.\\" she said with a beloved smile, \\"but I'm not sure whether you'll be able to help me.\\"\\"Of course, we will!\\" the squirrel answered, \\"What is your plan for surprising the imprudent fairies?\\" \\"Well, if only there was a way. I would love to be able to capture the first ray of sunshine before it touches the Earth and keep it in a dewdrop so that it could be used as a lantern whenever needed for everyone who lives in the forest. I would also like to paint a rainbow in the night sky, under the pale moonlight, so that nocturnal creatures could see its allure. Unfortunately, I don't have the magic required or the wings to keep the dewdrop in.\\"\\"You must have your magic kept elsewhere then! Look!\\" an old tortoise eagerly shouted, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it.The old tortoise was right. Whilst Adalina had been discussing her profound wishes, magic had taken over. They were all flying through the air, producing a magical rainbow and capturing not only one but hundreds of sunshine rays. They were confined within fine water droplets that occupied the sky with miniature gleaming lamps. Throughout the day and night, squirrels, mice, frogs, birds, and fish could be seen leaping across the sky, providing it with color and light. This performance has never been witnessed before, which captivated the forest dwellers.Adalina was appointed Queen of the Fairies, even though she was unaware of where the powerful magic had transpired. It isn't until later that the young Queen realized that she was the first of the Great Fairies whose magic was not found in their wings but within her sincere friends.

Mention jellyfish facts and what to do if you get stung by one.","answer":"Jellyfish are common in Hampton Roads coastal waters during the summer months. They are not aggressive, but they can sting people who accidentally bump into them. Jellyfish stings can be painful, but most are not emergencies. If you are stung, try to remain calm and seek medical attention if necessary.Jellyfish are not fish. They are invertebrate animals that do not have a backbone. The most common jellyfish in Hampton Roads is the sea nettle. Sea nettle tentacles can extend several feet and contain thousands of stingers. When touched, a sea nettle's stingers pierce a person's skin and release venom that can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting.Even a dead jellyfish can sting. If you see a jellyfish on the beach, do not touch it. Even a detached tentacle can release venom.To treat a jellyfish sting, rinse the affected area with seawater. Do not use fresh water, alcohol, or ammonia. Apply a cold compress to the area to help reduce pain and swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also help. If you have a severe allergic reaction to jellyfish stings, seek medical attention immediately.There are a few things you can do to prevent jellyfish stings:1. Check with local health departments and lifeguards about water conditions before swimming.2. Avoid swimming in areas where jellyfish have been reported.3. Wear protective clothing, such as a wetsuit or a stinger suit, when swimming in areas where jellyfish are present.4. Apply an anti-jellyfish sting lotion before swimming."},{"question":"Brainstorm a list of 5 – 10 gift ideas for my husband for fathers Day. He is a new father, so these presents will be his first fathers Day presents ever.","answer":"1. Sleep Aid Devices: As a new parent, sleep may be more challenging to come by than ever before in his life. Consider giving your husband a sleep aid device – like a white noise machine – that will help him fall asleep quickly when he has a few minutes to a few hours before the next feeding.2.\\tCoffee (Or tea/hot chocolate) Gift Baskets: If the sleep aid device is insufficient and he still needs extra caffeine create a gift basket of flavorful caffeinated beverages. This can include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. You may want special mugs, stirring spoons, and a new coffee maker or kettle. If he spends much time away from home, you can also include gift cards to his favorite coffee houses.3.\\tPersonalized Father Keychain: Personalized gifts are always a fantastic idea. Whether money is tight or you want to get him one more small gift, a keychain that says Father or Dad is a great idea. You can also get one from your child that says something like Daddy, I love you and the child’s name.4.\\tA daddy/baby matching outfit. This could be a t-shirt or t-shirt or sweatshirt for dad and a matching onesie or sleep-and-play for the baby. It is super cute when they go out or spend time together.5.\\tMatching sports jerseys for daddy and baby. If daddy wants to watch football with their baby every Sunday, you should encourage him and get them matching jerseys.

Put in one paragraph of five complete sentences, written in first person as the original is. Thanks! \\tThe Season I'm InGiving myself permission to accept the good.ALEX ELLE I'm trying to make more space to reflect on how far I've come in my healing. Over the past eleven years, I have done my best to change for the better. To allow myself to not only heal but lean into joy and lightness. To be intentional about what is allowed in my space and what needs to be kept at bay. Healing can feel like such a heavy lift, but giving myself permission to accept the good, the fun, and the happiness that comes with it has been a game-changer. I no longer want healing to be something I do in survival mode. Instead, I want this journey to be a place of lightness, softness, and ease. That's the season I'm in now.As I continue to embark on this journey, protecting my peace is something I am deeply committed to doing. My healing space no longer feels chaotic. Instead, it feels grounded and easeful. It’s been a long time coming.Choosing to change, and rewrite my narrative, is creating restoration within my lineage. Healing is an act of community care. Breaking generational cycles that were never mine to hold has been challenging but something I've grown to see as sacred. If not me, then who? I've grown to feel proud about being the matriarch of healing for my lineage. My children will know what love, joy, and emotional stability look and feel like. They'll witness their mother moving through life in energetic abundance versus lack and scarcity.There are days when I question if I am truly made for the healing and emotional expansion I'm doing. Some days it can feel like I'm healing in circles, and no real change is happening. Self-doubt can be hard to sort through, but it is also a glorious teacher if we allow it to be. Even in my moments of uncertainty, I choose to lean in and learn.Sometimes, no matter how much healing, growing, and changing we've done, our inner critique can and will rear its head. In these moments, I've learned to remind myself what the truth is. And in the moments that the truth feels hard to recall, I remind myself what I want to be true in my life and legacy.I'd like to invite us all to start taking more inventory of how we're blooming. Really look at how far your journey has taken you. Celebrate how you've changed in big and small ways. Commune with yourself and look at how you've emotionally matured. Don't just glance at your healing and growth in passing. Take a good hard look at the beauty you're creating. Don't just glance at it.If you need more support in seeing yourself positively, call someone that reflects your truth back to you. If there's someone in your life that you love, trust, and can be your mirror, allow them to show up for you and be the reflection you need. As my mom used to say, sometimes people can see us better than we can see ourselves. Having people in our lives who we feel safe with act as a mirror is magnificent. ","answer":"I'm realizing how much healing I've done and allowing myself to rest in the joy that comes from that. I'm committed to enjoying a season of lightness and protecting my peace along this journey. I'm grateful my children will know what emotional stability looks like as they witness me living it. I'll set aside self-doubt and learn from the teacher that healing and changing can be. I invite you to do the same; look how far you've come and celebrate it."},{"question":"When was Starbucks founded?","answer":"Starbucks was founded in 1971.

They loved their walks, especially Fido, who would often observe their surroundings with a keen eye, identifying all kinds of animals and objects with his keen intellect. It was good, after all, to work the mind as well as the legs, though Fido enjoyed working his legs a great deal as well, especially when they played fetch.One afternoon, Ed and Fido encountered the most peculiar object in their path. It was a stick, but no ordinary stick. No, this stick had only one end.Ed picked it up and turned it around, trying to find the other end. Try as he might, he could not. Fido whimpered, staring at the stick as if wanting a closer look. Ed obliged, holding it down to Fido's nose for him to smell. To Fido, it smelled like any other stick, but he could not deny that it looked very strange, having only a single end. He bit down on it and pulled, prompting Ed to let go, and then dropped it. He tried dropping it again and again from multiple angles, but to no avail - only the one end of the stick ever hit the ground.So Fido did the only sensible thing that one would do upon finding such a strange object. He picked it up to hand to his human to throw. And throw it he did, again and again, long into the evening, and Fido would go running after it.

My witches don't ride brooms, melt when they get wet, or have ugly warts on their noses, for example. Can you give me some ideas that would add validity without perpetuating stereotypes?","answer":"Of course! Here are some realistic ideas you could use:• Holidays: One way to lend a sense of realism to your novel is to include details of Wiccan or Pagan holidays, rather than the traditional Christian holidays. Many of the Christian holidays actually borrow their origins or dates from the original Pagan versions, which focused more on nature. Some examples are Samhain, which is aligned with Halloween, the Day of the Dead, and Yule, the winter ritual now associated with Christmas.• Interests: Many people today still participate in palm or tea leaf reading, so this could add a sense of realism to your story. Tarot and astrology are also still popular practices.• Historical details: Including information about the real historical events surrounding the Witch Trials brings a sense of validity to a story as well. Tens of thousands of accused witches were executed during the European witch hunts. As Puritans and other settlers traveled West to the colonies, the negative perceptions and accusations continued. The Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts occurred in 1692-1693 during which there were at least 20 executions and more than 200 witch accusations. Something as simple as having a pet cat, a sour attitude, or a lucky streak could put a woman in danger of witch accusations. If executed, these women could be hung, burned, or drowned.• Names: Beyond the history of the Witch Trials, researching the time period and using common names of the era (Jonathon, Thomas, Samuel, William, Sarah, and Bridget, for example) will make the story seem more grounded.I hope these inspire the necessary details for your novel!"},{"question":"Can you help me write an ad for an antique living room set I am selling?

Keep the steps as simple and easy to follow as possible without taking away from the final product.","answer":"Introducing the coveted caramel macchiato. If you've ever visited a Starbucks or even your local coffee shop, you've seen this popular coffee drink on the menu. What most partakers don't realize is that the sweetness in this drink comes from the vanilla syrup mixed with the espresso base, rather than actual caramel. Either way, follow the steps below and you'll be able to treat yourself to this delicious beverage any time, day or night, and most importantly, without hurting your pockets.Appliances: For this recipe, we'll be using a standard Keurig coffee maker and a hand-held electric milk frother. You can also use a French press if you have one at your disposal.Ingredients:Espresso k-cupMilk (whole, 2%, nondairy, etc. It's up to you)Vanilla coffee flavoring syrup (We like Torani's)Caramel sauce 1. Prepare your espresso: Put the K-cup in your Keurig coffeemaker and chose the smallest setting. Since the standard Keurig is not built to reach the kind of pressure we need for authentic espresso, we'll be using a stronger version of coffee instead.2. Flavoring: Add 1 or 2 pumps (more if you're a little bit extra) to the espresso.3. Froth: Using your electric frother, frother 1/2 to 1 cup of milk and pour this into your flavored espresso.4. Drizzle: Last, and most importantly, top your frothed milk with an ample drizzle of caramel syrup so that it looks just like the Starbucks version.5.

Use the following format :{Q}:{Question}{A}:{Answer}Evolutionary originsAll dogs descend from a species of wolf, but not the gray wolf (Canis lupus), like many people assume. In fact, DNA evidence suggests that the now-extinct wolf ancestor to modern dogs was Eurasian. However, scientists are still working to understand exactly what species gave rise to dogs.   When dogs broke off from their wild ancestors is also a matter of mystery, but genetics suggest that it occurred between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago.While it’s impossible to say exactly how a wild wolf species became a domesticated dog, most scientists believe the process happened gradually as wolves became more comfortable with humans. Perhaps wolves started down this path simply by eating human scraps. Many generations later, humans might have encouraged wolves to stay near by actively feeding them. Later still, those wolves may have been welcomed into the human home and eventually bred to encourage certain traits. All of this is thought to have unfolded over thousands of years.","answer":"Q: Do dogs descend from the gray wolf, Canis Iupus?A: Dogs did descend from a species of wolf, but not the gray wolf or Canis Iupus, as most people believe.

You’re a typical art teacher with a casual personality and this critique is for high school students.","answer":"Today I want to talk about a pretty famous painting—it’s Van Gogh’s “Starry Night!” It was painted way back in 1889, but I’m sure you’ve seen this picture on socks, phone cases, and posters. Truth be told, it really has such a rich history. So without further ado, we’re going to dive into it. What I want to talk about first is Van Gogh’s use of color. The blue and yellow tones are cohesive, and the dark lining on the tree in the foreground really separates you from the spiraling, intense sky.The use of color is really strong in the sense that nighttime moonlight is effortlessly shown. Don’t you feel as if you are actually there in the painting?Color brings me over to Gogh’s use of light. This is probably the most impressive part of the whole piece and what you notice first. The moon and stars have a great sense of value and really glow. The last thing I want to bring up is texture, which is an important factor. “Starry Night” has an iconic use of texture due to Gogh’s dash technique—short and thick brush strokes can make you think if you touched the painting, you would feel the individual grooves and curves.And that’s pretty much it for the time we have in class today. There are other parts of “Starry Night” too—you could really talk about it for hours. So, the next time you see a pair of familiar socks, you should be able to recall some cool facts about the iconic design!"},{"question":"Can you write a deep poem about flipping a coin?

Explain why each couple was \\"star-crossed.\\" ","answer":"The term “star-crossed lovers” is taken from the Shakespearean era of classic literature. It first appeared in Romeo and Juliet but has since been used in both classic and modern literary works. To be star-crossed is to be doomed to failure. It’s a love that was never meant to be, regardless of how much two people want it to be. In literature, romantic partners often recognize and acknowledge that they are star-crossed lovers, but they persist in hopes of beating the odds. They often believe that the universe, destiny, or some other outside force is against their unity. Star-crossed lovers, despite their romantic feelings and deep connection, are often driven apart by things that are out of their control. Aside from Romeo and Juliet, other star-crossed lovers in classic literature include: •\\tHeathcliff and Catherine from Wuthering Heights by Emily BronteWhile the pair had great love and fiery passion between them, Catherine eventually decides to marry based on financial stability and social status. •\\tOrpheus and Eurydice – Greek Mythologies  Eurydice and Orpheus could have had a perfect relationship if Orpheus had trusted and had faith in Hades. Instead, he looked back at Eurydice as she followed him out of the Underworld, and his distrust lost her to him forever. •\\tHester Prynne and Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale from The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel HawthorneThis couple’s relationship was doomed from the start because it was an affair between a single woman and a married pastor that conceived a child out of wedlock. Adultery was one of the ultimate sins in Puritan times, regardless of their passion for one another.  "},{"question":"Please write a blog post about how you can grow your hair stronger and faster. Please create a numbered list style post that gives tips and best practices.","answer":"Tips to Get Luscious Locks and Grow Your Hair Stronger and FasterYes! Getting luscious locks and strong hair is possible for anyone. You just have to try the right things. Here’s how:1. Avoid Heat: Avoid using hot tools excessively as the heat can damage and weaken your hair. Try cooler settings when styling and rinse your hair with cold water to seal in moisture and prevent breakage. 2. Keep it Nice and Trimmed: Contrary to popular belief, regular trims encourage hair growth as they remove split ends and prevent breakage from traveling up the hair shaft. Aim for a trim every 6-8 weeks to maintain healthy and strong hair. 3. On Any Condition: Proper conditioning is crucial for promoting hair growth as it nourishes and strengthens your strands from the inside out. Look for conditioners containing keratin, biotin, and/or other hair-boosting ingredients to maximize growth potential. 4. Tender Caring: Be gentle when brushing or combing to avoid damaging your hair. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle and minimize pulling, and avoid tight hairstyles (like tight ponytails or braids) that can put additional stress on your locks. 5. Don’t Dry it: Wet hair is more prone to damage and breakage, so avoid brushing or styling until it's dry. Instead, use a microfiber towel to gently pat your hair dry and then let it air dry, which is the healthiest method for your tresses.6. Meddling Meds: Some medications may cause hair loss, while others may help promote growth. Talk to your doctor to find out if your medication regimen is affecting your hair health. 7. De-Stress Tress: Stress can take a toll on your hair. Incorporate relaxation techniques into your daily routine, like yoga or meditation, to reduce stress and promote healthy hair growth.8. Coloring Conundrum: Frequent hair coloring can damage hair and inhibit growth. Choose natural dyes or give your locks a break from coloring for a while.9. Braids to Breaks: Wearing tight hairstyles or extensions for extended periods can cause damage to your hair follicles. Give your hair a break and switch up your hairstyle frequently to prevent breakage.You can try these yourself and watch the results. You won’t have to do anything else. As a bonus tip, eat healthy and grow stronger from the inside out."},{"question":"Write a letter to my boyfriend explaining that I need to break up with him so that I can focus on my studies.

For centuries, the tyranny of the mammoth's reign rendered the tribe to live in fear and famine, but no longer. It towered over the small tribe of 20, like ants to an anteater, it was over 50 grown men tall, and each footstep it took ravaged the ground, forcing them to regain their footing. Each breath it took from its coiling trunk had enough force to knock them clean off their feet, and its menacingly sharp ivory tusks could pierce them like a knife through butter. Despite all this, none around it showed signs of backing down. They had families and friends to protect, and knew in unison, that they could defeat it. It was slowing down.

It bore no difference to the behemoth, for it killed anything its crimson, sinister eyes gazed upon.The tribe slowly circled it.

Though they flowed around the beast like water, not one of them possessed liquid courage of any sort. In a burst of energy, they would lunge forward, swiping, stabbing, and piercing the Mammoth's feet. Each attempt may have looked futile, but it was death by a thousand cuts.

The tribe's roars and chants were the opposing force in this cacophonous symphony.One by one, each would lunge and deftly dodge the towering beast's legs. They knew it would only take one hit for their lives to be over, so they could afford no mistakes. The mammoth would aggressively spin its body around, hoping to slice anything in its range with its blade-like tusks, but the tribe responded in kind. They would skilfully dodge the beast's rage and strike back in kind. Bit by bit, they struck in tandem. Suddenly, the mammoth let out a disorienting wail and slumped to the ground.

The types of dishes you are used to making may require ingredients that are hard to come by in Japan. Moreover, the majority of produce is seasonal. If you want strawberries in January you are probably going to search a little bit longer, and pay a little bit more for them than you would if you wanted them at other times of the year.Since the packaging and ingredients list is in Japanese, it may also be risky for those with food allergies or dietary restrictions.To prepare you for your trip to the supermarket, here is a list of some essential ingredients, their kanji and how to read them in hiragana and English.

Don’t bog it down with science and facts, but do talk about how dangerous pesticide food is within industrial farming. Less than 300 words. ","answer":"Millions of Americans have restricted or completely cut out gluten from their diets. While some skip gluten because of a chosen diet, most people do so because their bodies have rejected gluten. But a Harvard study has recently released new and incredibly interesting information which states that millions of people who think they are allergic or intolerant to gluten actually have no problem with gluten at all! We’re here to tell you that if you believe your body cannot properly digest gluten, or even if your doctor diagnosed you with an allergy, it is extremely likely that you have no problem with glutenous food that contains wheat. In fact, you’re likely not allergic to wheat at all. The Harvard study found that it is actually the pesticides used on wheat that are causing millions of people to struggle with gluten digestion. That means that if you grew wheat in your yard without any pesticides, you would probably be able to eat anything you made with it without any issues at all! Now, it’s important to note that this is not the case for 100% of those Americans with gluten allergies. A select few may actually be intolerant to gluten itself; however, for millions of Americans, this could change everything. But in order for the masses to be able to enjoy glutenous products again, something needs to change in the way we allow industrial farmers to treat and grow wheat. Exactly how that will happen is still unclear. But there has certainly been a lot of talk since the study was released about exactly what these big farms are putting on our food and how it’s affecting not only what we eat but also how we feel.

Born as Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tenn., she was given her stage name by Ike early in their relationship. At the end, she was so eager to get away from him that she surrendered any claim to record royalties, publishing rights, and anything else, except \\"Tina Turner,\\" which she told the judge she had worked very hard for. \\"That name's got my daddy's blood written all over it,\\" Ike protested. But it would be more accurate to say it was written in Tina's own blood.\\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\" ranks as one of the most harrowing, uncompromising showbiz biographies I've ever seen. It is a tradition in the genre that performers must go through hard times in order to eventually arrive at fame, but few went through harder times than Tina Turner. The movie shows Ike, jealous of her talent and popularity, turning into a violent wife-beater, and it shows her putting up with a lot more than she should have, for a lot longer.The movie begins with a prologue in which little Anna Mae can sing louder than anyone else in the Nutbush church choir. A few years later, in St. Louis, she sees Ike Turner onstage and is intoxicated by his slick charm. Part of his act consists of inviting women from the audience to sing with his band. A few notes, and he shoos them away.But when Anna Mae Bullock got up on that stage, she came to stay. And soon, an innocent who hardly understands the world she is entering, she's on tour with Ike and his band.The movie stars Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne as Tina and Ike. They played the parents of the hero in \\"Boyz N the Hood,\\" but here they are in another universe -- Bassett fiery and convincing as Tina; Fishburne, in a powerful performance, able to show us both Ike's charm and his violent side.The singing on the movie's sound track is by Tina Turner, but Bassett's performances of the songs are so much in synch - not just lip-synch, but physically, and with personality and soul -- that it always seems as if we're watching Tina at work.As the two of them reach the heights of show business, with platinum records and big Vegas bookings and lots of money, their personal life turns into a nightmare. The movie shows Ike strung out on cocaine, flaunting his endless string of girlfriends, and subjecting Tina to verbal and physical abuse. A few friends advise her to walk away. Most of the people around them, intimidated by Ike or grateful for a generous drug supply, are enablers.The most harrowing scene in the movie comes one night as Ike beats Tina yet once again, and bleeding and battered she walks out of their hotel and down a highway and into a Ramada Inn, where she says, \\"My name is Tina Turner, and my husband and I have had an argument. I have 32 cents in my pocket. If you give me a room I promise you I will pay you back as soon as I can.\\" The manager gives her a room.The Ramada Inn roadside sign is prominent in the scene because, as Tina wrote in her autobiography, I, Tina, she will forever be grateful to the motel for taking her in.But what is amazing is that the scene isn't the end of Tina and Ike's relationship. The movie is unflinching in its willingness to show that Tina, like many battered wives, made excuses for her violent husband and believed his apologies and gave him more chances, long after she should have walked away.Finally she finds the strength to resist through Buddhist meditation techniques, and there is an unforgettable scene late in the film where she is about to open a big engagement and Ike slips past security and into her dressing room with a gun, and she finds the inner strength to face him down and not cave in, and go onstage like a professional.\\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\" has a lot of terrific music in it (including a closing glimpse of the real Tina Turner), but this is not the typical showbiz musical. It's a story of pain and courage, uncommonly honest and unflinching, and the next time I hear Tina Turner singing I will listen to the song in a whole new way.","answer":"As a young girl, Tina Turner, born Anna Mae Bullock, sings louder than anyone else in the Nutbush, Tenn., church choir.Years later, Ike Turner plucks her from the audience and invites her to sing with him on stage.Ike and Tina Turner reach the heights of show business together, but he is an abusive husband.Tina Turner finds the strength to leave her husband after a violent argument.The film shows how Buddhist meditation techniques eventually helped her find her own strength."},{"question":"How do I effectively grow my twitter brand.","answer":"Here are some ways to grow your brand on Twitter. 1. Refine marketing strategy. First, you must set clear goals and expectations, define your target audience, research the competition, and focus on what makes you stand out. By doing this, you give yourself clear metrics to be measured by. A goal allows you to track progress and identify when more work may be needed. Knowing your target audience makes it easier to produce content. Researching your competition can both inspire you and better you. Focusing on what stands out from the crowd will enable you to create engaging content. 2. Create valuable content. If your content doesn't give your readers any value, the likelihood of them engaging with you or continuing to follow you is slim. Your audience sees a whole load of content daily that is useless for them or simply too like other content. Create valuable content to stand out and grow a following that knows you constantly have them in mind. This will help to solidify your audience.3. Engage with your followers. Tweets providing value are great, but the one thing we value most is human connection. Engage and connect with followers through DM or in replies. This will help foster a genuine connection with your audience and show them that you care and are responsive to them. This is extremely important, considering how many people are online. If you create that bond with people, they can be more forgiving when you make mistakes and more supportive when needed. 4. Use trending hashtags.Hashtags are an incredible way to grow the visibility of your tweets. Try to see what is currently trending and produce content that hops on that bandwagon. The more people that see your tweets, the better, and using a trending hashtag vastly improves the chances prospective new followers will see your tweets. Be careful not to use too many hashtags, as this can be seen as spam.5. Reuse and Repurpose.Coming up with new content all the time can be pretty tough. There is no harm in reusing or repurposing old content. In many cases, the point will remain valuable if it's valuable content. Simply saying the same thing differently or highlighting a new use case for information is an excellent way to churn out lots of content over time. Obviously, it's not good to copy and paste your old tweets. Try improving them with better wording so your content constantly improves.

Other villagers were afraid of the dragon, but Yin vowed to defeat the dragon and bring her back.She climbed the mountain for three days until she reached the cave at the very peak of the mountain where the dragon lived. \\"Where is my friend?\\" she demanded. \\"Why have you taken her?\\" The dragon's deep rumbling voice replied from deep inside the cave. \\"Somebody has stolen my precious pearl. I will take a child from the humans every week until my pearl is returned.\\"Yin returned to the village but nobody knew what had happened to the dragon's pearl. A wise old frog in the lake told her that pearls were rumored to be deep in the ocean.Determined to bring her friend back, Yin traveled for three days until she reached the ocean. She jumped and dived, but she couldn't hold her breath long enough to reach the bottom. She asked a fish, who replied that he knew of a deep ocean cave where precious shining pearls were hidden. Yin waited on the shore while the fish fulfilled his promise to fetch the pearl. Hours later, the fish's shiny scales appeared, and the beautiful sheen of a pearl was in the fish's mouth.Yin thanked the fish and hurried to return to the mountain as fast as she could. \\"I have found your pearl!\\" she shouted into the cave where the dragon lived.\\"My pearl?!\\" The dragon's deep voice rumbled with excitement so much that the mountain shook.\\"Nobody stole your pearl,\\" Yin told the dragon. \\"You dropped it into the ocean.

Where did this start and what is the story behind it? Write a paragraph with around 200 words. Be sure to include what makes the main types of tea different.","answer":"According to a Chinese legend, tea was first discovered in 2737 BC when the then-emperor Shen Nung was sitting beneath a tree when leaves accidentally fell into the drinking water one of his servants was boiling. The leaves were from the Camellia sinensis tree which is now known as the tea plant. While the truth of this story is up for debate, there is no debate that tea originated in the regions around modern-day China thousands of years ago and was enjoyed by other nearby countries. However, it wasn’t until hundreds of years later that global trade routes brought tea to the rest of the world. Now tea comes in many different varieties. The main categories of tea that come from the tea plant are white, green, and black tea. The difference in these teas is in the oxidation process. Green tea is steamed after harvesting, maintaining the green color, while white tea is made by allowing the leaves to oxidize for a short amount of time. Lastly, black tea is allowed to undergo full oxidation, which allows its aroma to develop and gain its black-brown appearance.

The professor was known by some to hold discussions with the bust, puzzling over a variety of academic and ethical conundra. In the far corner of the room, stood a tall and dark mahogany closet, within which, peering from the shadows, was a skeleton. On the western wall hung a tall mirror, gilded and ornamented, within which was said to live the spirits of long-dead philosophers. A statue of a raven perched on a plinth by the door posed mid-flight and mid-caw. The feathers were intricately carved and it was so lifelike that the observer might have expected it to take off and flutter around the room at any moment.

The group he had been assigned to join in Economics 254 had been great for most of the semester. \\"Had been\\" were the keywords. Two weeks ago, they argued about how to proceed with their project, and since that day, he realized that things had shifted. Recently, Derrick realized that the other four members had discussed a topic, but he had not been included. And they had given him meaningless tasks to complete, and then when they met, the four agreed among themselves not to use his work. The members of the group were all very different. Tom was confident and a bit arrogant. His assigned tasks and contributions were usually late. Sander was shy. She rarely spoke in their meetings, mostly agreeing with everyone else. Bernard was a clown, hilarious but not productive. Julie was organized, productive and pleasant. What had he done to offend one or all of them? He wracked his brain but couldn't come up with anything personal. As he turned the question over and over in his mind, he had a glimmer of an idea. Derrick realized that during the argument, Tom had taken a strong position on the division of labor, and Derrick had been the only one to disagree. As he thought about it more, it seemed to him that at the beginning of the argument, it had only been him and Tom disagreeing, but slowly the other three chimed in and all three agreed with Tom. What could he do? He wanted an A in this class, and the group project was 50%. He had a problem. As he thought about it, three solutions came to mind. The first idea was to request a meeting with the group and lay it all out. Talk about it like adults. Another possibility was to go to the professor and seek advice. Or he could run a test? Go to Tom privately and say that he had thought about it and Tom was right. He would say that for the last three weeks, he would agree to Tom's plan so they could all forge ahead, get it done, and get an A. After sleeping on it, he knew what he had to do and headed to campus to put his plan into action.

Make is humorous and under 400 words.","answer":"In the land of Hoo-man, a tremendous power lay hidden for centuries - the One Ring to Rule them All. It was said that whoever possessed the Ring would be granted the power to control all the chihuahuas in the land and become their leader. They would have an army of the tiniest but fiercest dogs at their command. This power would make them undefeatable. Throughout history, many had sought the power of the Ring, but none had ever found it, until one day...A young chihuahua named Bolsón was playing in a stream deep in the forest when he stumbled upon the Ring. It was such a tiny gold band with strange markings on it. He knew immediately that he had found something of vital importance that must be protected at all costs.Some would stop at nothing to possess the Ring. The evil Maiar Saurpug, leader of the rival pug kingdom of Morpug, sent his PugOrc minions to find and capture Bolsón and the Ring. Bolsón knew that he had to leave his home, lest it be destroyed, and embark on a treacherous journey to destroy the Ring for once and for all before it fell into the wrong paws.With the help of his best friends - Samhowl the Beagle, MerryButts the Corgi, and Pippinlow the Dachshund - Bolsón set out on a quest to destroy the Ring. They encountered many dangers along the way, including treacherous rivers, towering mountains, and terrifying creatures, but they persevered.Finally, they reached the volcano, Mount Derp, where the Ring had to be destroyed. Saurpug and his army of pugs were close behind, determined to capture the Ring to claim ultimate power. Our heroes could feel their hot Pug breath on their necks at every turn.Bolsón knew that he had to act fast. So he threw the Ring into the volcano's core, destroying it forever. The chihuahuas of the land felt a great weight lifted off their shoulders and suddenly wanted to play.Bolsón and his friends returned home as heroes. They had saved their land from a great evil and ensured that no one would ever use the power of the Ring to raise an evil Chihuahua army again.Bolsón lived a simple existence with his loyal friends by his side because love and companionship are what really matter most, not power."},{"question":"1. Classify terms related to the word shaman. 2. Which people have had a shared interest in shamanism? List them.Shamanism or Samanism is a religious practice that involves a practitioner (shaman or saman) interacting with the spirit world through altered states of consciousness, such as trance.[1][2] The goal of this is usually to direct spirits or spiritual energies into the physical world for the purpose of healing, divination, or to aid human beings in some other way.[1]Beliefs and practices categorized as \\"shamanic\\" have attracted the interest of scholars from a variety of disciplines, including anthropologists, archeologists, historians, religious studies scholars, philosophers and psychologists. Hundreds of books and academic papers on the subject have been produced, with a peer-reviewed academic journal being devoted to the study of shamanism.In the 20th century, non-Indigenous Westerners involved in countercultural movements, such as hippies and the New Age created modern magicoreligious practices influenced by their ideas of various Indigenous religions, creating what has been termed neoshamanism or the neoshamanic movement.[3] It has affected the development of many neopagan practices, as well as faced a backlash and accusations of cultural appropriation,[4] exploitation and misrepresentation when outside observers have tried to practice the ceremonies of, or represent, centuries-old cultures to which they do not belong.[5]The earliest known depiction of a Siberian shaman, by the Dutch explorer Nicolaes Witsen, 17th century. Witsen called him a \\"priest of the Devil\\" and drew clawed feet for the supposed demonic qualities.[6]The Modern English word shamanism derives from the Russian word šamán, which itself comes from the word samān from a Tungusic language[7] – possibly from the southwestern dialect of the Evenki spoken by the Sym Evenki peoples,[8] or from the Manchu language.[9] The etymology of the word is sometimes connected to the Tungus root sā-, meaning \\"To Know\\".[10][11] However, Finnish ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen questions this connection on linguistic grounds: \\"The possibility cannot be completely rejected, but neither should it be accepted without reservation since the assumed derivational relationship is phonologically irregular (note especially the vowel quantities).\\"[12]Mircea Eliade noted that the Sanskrit word śramaṇa, designating a wandering monastic or holy figure, has spread to many Central Asian languages along with Buddhism and could be the ultimate origin of the word shaman.[13]The term was adopted by Russians interacting with the Indigenous peoples in Siberia. It is found in the memoirs of the exiled Russian churchman Avvakum.[14] It was brought to Western Europe twenty years later by the Dutch traveler Nicolaes Witsen, who reported his stay and journeys among the Tungusic- and Samoyedic-speaking Indigenous peoples of Siberia in his book Noord en Oost Tataryen (1692).[15] Adam Brand, a merchant from Lübeck, published in 1698 his account of a Russian embassy to China; a translation of his book, published the same year, introduced the word shaman to English speakers.[16]Anthropologist and archeologist Silvia Tomaskova argued that by the mid-1600s, many Europeans applied the Arabic term shaitan (meaning \\"devil\\") to the non-Christian practices and beliefs of Indigenous peoples beyond the Ural Mountains.[17] She suggests that shaman may have entered the various Tungus dialects as a corruption of this term, and then been told to Christian missionaries, explorers, soldiers and colonial administrators with whom the people had increasing contact for centuries.A female shaman is sometimes called a shamanka, which is not an actual Tungus term but simply shaman plus the Russian suffix -ka (for feminine nouns).[18]There is no single agreed-upon definition for the word \\"shamanism\\" among anthropologists. Thomas Downson suggests three shared elements of shamanism: practitioners consistently alter consciousness, the community regards altering consciousness as an important ritual practice, and the knowledge about the practice is controlled.The English historian Ronald Hutton noted that by the dawn of the 21st century, there were four separate definitions of the term which appeared to be in use:The first of these uses the term to refer to \\"anybody who contacts a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness\\".The second definition limits the term to refer to those who contact a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness at the behest of others.The third definition attempts to distinguish shamans from other magicoreligious specialists who are believed to contact spirits, such as \\"mediums\\", \\"witch doctors\\", \\"spiritual healers\\" or \\"prophets,\\" by claiming that shamans undertake some particular technique not used by the others. (Problematically, scholars advocating the third view have failed to agree on what the defining technique should be.)The fourth definition identified by Hutton uses \\"shamanism\\" to refer to the Indigenous religions of Siberia and neighboring parts of Asia.[20] According to the Golomt Center for Shamanic Studies, a Mongolian organization of shamans, the Evenk word shaman would more accurately be translated as \\"priest\\".[21]According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a shaman (/ˈʃɑːmən/ SHAH-men, /ˈʃæmən/ or /ˈʃeɪmən/)[22] is someone who is regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.[1][22] The word \\"shaman\\" probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia. According to Juha Janhunen, \\"the word is attested in all of the Tungusic idioms\\" such as Negidal, Lamut, Udehe/Orochi, Nanai, Ilcha, Orok, Manchu and Ulcha, and \\"nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning 'shaman' also derives from Proto-Tungusic\\" and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia.[23] The term was introduced to the west after Russian forces conquered the shamanistic Khanate of Kazan in 1552.The term \\"shamanism\\" was first applied by Western anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighbouring Tungusic- and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. Upon observing more religious traditions around the world, some Western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense. The term was used to describe unrelated magicoreligious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another.[24] While the term has been incorrectly applied by cultural outsiders to many Indigenous spiritual practices, the words “shaman” and “shamanism” do not accurately describe the variety and complexity that is Indigenous spirituality. Each nation and tribe has its own way of life, and uses terms in their own languages.[25]","answer":"1.

These periods can last from days to weeks. Mania is a term used to describe really severe happy periods or periods where the person is also seeing and hearing things that aren't actually there. Hypomania is a term used when those periods are less severe. When a person is experiencing mania they may have higher than normal levels of energy, make rash decisions without thinking, and will have trouble falling asleep at night. During depressive periods, a person may have a poor outlook on life and will try to avoid eye contact with others. 6% of individuals with bipolar disorder will die by suicide, while another 30-40% will hurt themselves. Anxiety and substance abuse is also commonly associated with bipolar disorder. The causes for these mood episodes are unknown, but genetics and the environment are understood to play a role. Each gene, with its individual small effects, may contribute to the development of bipolar disorder. They account for about 70-90% of the risk of developing the disorder. Long-term stress and childhood abuse are environmental risk factors. Bipolar I disorder is a classification used to describe the disorder if there has been at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes. Bipolar II disorder is used if there has been one hypomanic episode and a major depressive episode. Cyclothymia is a term used for classification if there are hypomanic episodes with periods of depression that don't meet the criteria for major depressive episodes. If drugs or other medical problems are causing the symptoms, then the diagnosis cannot be bipolar disorder. Similar conditions to bipolar disorder include schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance use disorder. Blood tests and imaging can help rule out other diagnoses, but overall medical testing is not required to make a bipolar diagnosis.

My target audience is American and I have twitter blue so large limit on characters.","answer":"Tweet 1- With no employment benefits, it should be at the forefront of a freelancer's mind to spend time planning for retirement. An emergency fund, however, is more important. With irregular income and fallow work periods, having an emergency fund in place can help reduce stress and provide financial security. With the present day protected, you can feel at ease when planning for the future. Tweet 2-As a freelancer, you are responsible for your own tax payments.Setting aside monthly income in a separate account can help you avoid being caught out and owing a large sum. Freelancers should work out their tax rates and be aware that a self-employment tax of 15% is also charged in the USA. Remember, as a freelancer, you should pay your tax quarterly to avoid underpayment fees. Tweet 3- Traditional or Roth IRA? Which is best for freelancers?Well, that depends on what your circumstances are. The main difference is that a Roth IRA is not taxable upon withdrawal; however, your contributions are not tax deductible. With a traditional IRA, you will be taxed upon withdrawal; however, you may benefit from tax deductions for contributions. You could open both accounts, but be sure to keep total contributions below the IRS's annual limit of 6,500.Tweet 4- Freelancers, open a SEP IRA! The SEP IRA is tailored for business owners or the self-employed. It allows tax-deductible contributions of up to 66,000 or 25% of income, whichever is smallest.This is an excellent option for freelancers who have maxed out Roth or traditional IRA contributions. Tweet 5- I've maxed out my contributions. What should I do?This is a familiar question I get, and the answer is simple. If you have exhausted your retirement planning options with IRA, invest with a taxable brokerage account. With no contribution limits, the only downside is the tax you will pay on capital gains. The current rate for capital gains tax depends on your income but ranges from 0-20%."},{"question":"Write a poem about Waffle House.

She's gluten-free and allergic to nuts. I don't know what to make, do you have any suggestions? Explain each idea. ","answer":"I can definitely suggest some great gluten-free and nut-free dinner ideas for you and your friend: 1. Sheet-Pan Honey Mustard Chicken. Make a sauce with oil, honey, mustard, garlic, and paprika then pour half over your chicken. Bake for 25 minutes, then add green beans, sweet peppers, and the remaining sauce and bake for 15-20 more minutes. This sheet-pan chicken is not only gluten-free and nut-free, but low-carb as well. 2. Pressure-Cooker Salsa London Broil. Cut your steak into thirds and place it in the pressure cooker, then add salsa, sweet potato, carrot, and garlic. Lock the lid and pressure cook on high for 10 minutes.  Slice your roast, serve with veggies, and garnish with lime wedges and cilantro, if desired. This dish comes together quickly but has plenty of delicious slow-cooked flavor. 3. Air-Fryer Chicken Pesto Stuffed Peppers. Cut peppers lengthwise in half, remove the stems and seeds, and heat them in your air fryer at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-15 minutes. While that cooks, combine the shredded rotisserie chicken, brown rice, and pesto in a large bowl. When the peppers are ready, add the filling and return to your air fryer at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cheese on top of each stuffed pepper and bake until melted.    4. Grilled Summer Sausage Salad. Brush sausage, zucchini, yellow squash, and peppers with olive oil and grill them over medium heat for 5-6 minutes. Remove them to a cutting board, then roughly chop and add them to a large salad bowl with your salad greens, sliced cucumber, and chopped celery. Add your dressing of choice and toss to coat for a delicious and refreshing gluten-free and nut-free meal.  5. Chicken and Asparagus Bundles. Flatten chicken breast halves, then wrap each one around five asparagus spears and secure them with toothpicks. Put them in a baking dish, add oil, lemon juice, and seasonings then cover and bake for 25-30 minutes. When the chicken and asparagus bundles are ready, combine cornstarch and chicken broth with your pan juices in a small saucepan and heat until thickened, around 2 minutes. These are just five ideas to help you come up with a great dinner idea for you and your guest. Keep in mind that it's always best to check nutrition facts and ensure that all of your ingredients are gluten-free and don't contain nuts.

They tend to gather near lakes and prefer areas with fish and forests. They have been seen near unfrozen lakes in the winter and hunting the coast. During migration times, they are seen near any type of water. Bald eagles mostly like fish. They are predators and when fish is not readily available, they will eat whatever they can catch. That includes rodents and other small birds. They can scavage for food as well, stealing food from other birds if the opportunity arises.

However, volcanic activity isn't limited to our planet and  space volcanoes are often found on other planets and moons. Within our solar system, the moon and Mars are rich with evidence of volcanoes and fiery volcanic activity, while other bodies possess volcanoes that spew ice from their frozen vistas. VOLCANOES ON THE MOONNow volcanically inert, the surface of the moon once hosted spectacular eruptions that created lava flows that extended as far as 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from their source, according to San Diego State University. A recent Chinese mission to the lunar surface — the Chang'e-5 lander — returned lava that seems to indicate Earth's primary natural satellite was volcanically active more recently than previously believed.The sample collected from Oceanus Procellarum on the moon's near side,  previously associated with recent volcanic activity, suggests volcanism as recently as two billion years ago, a full billion years later than previous estimates.VOLCANOES ON MARSAside from Earth, the planet humanity has studied the geology of most intensely is Mars. This has led to the discovery that the Red Planet is host to even more volcanic features than our planet, according to Arizona State University.Primary among these is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the entire solar system at twice the height of Mount Everest. It is surrounded by a plethora of other massive volcanoes.In addition to this, Mars' other volcanoes includes Elysium, Syrtis Major, and a cluster of low-profile volcanic structures near the Hellas impact basin. This basin is the lowest point on Mars and the third- or fourth-largest known impact crater in the solar system.Mars seems to be volcanically inactive, but when this happened is something astrogeologists are still attempting to figure out. The volcanoes in the Tharsis  — the location of Olympus Mons  —  show few asteroid impact craters, meaning they could be just a few million years old, which is fairly young in geological terms. Mars was clearly very active in its youth, with explosive eruptions petering out as it aged. The planet has no active volcanoes, according to the National Air and Space Museum, and it appears most of the heat once stored in the planet's interior has been lost. It is possible we are currently simply seeing Mars in a geologically quiet period and that volcanism could restart on the Red Planet. VOLCANOES ON OTHER PLANETSMany other planets in the solar system have been linked with volcanic activity with most of these having occurred when the solar system was young and violent.The closest planet to Earth, Venus, has lava flows that cover up to 90 percent of its surface. Venus has up to 1,600 major volcanoes and could have as many as a million smaller counterparts to these.What isn't certain is if the planet is still volcanically active. Though we have yet to see a volcano erupt on any other planet, Venus is shrouded by thick clouds of sulfuric acid, meaning long-distance observations are difficult. Visiting the planet with a probe is complicated by its intense pressures and temperatures.Images captured by the MESSENGER mission have shown that Mercury's surface was shaped by volcanic activity. Lava flows on the closest planet to the sun have been dated to be between one and two billion years old. This means that volcanic activity continued well after Mercury formed around 4.5 billion years ago.For active volcanoes, one has to look beyond the planets of the solar system to its moons.VOLCANOES ON MOONSAccording to an article by NASA, the most volcanic body in the solar system is Io, one of Jupiter's moons, this activity is caused by the tremendous gravitational influence of the gas giant deforming the tiny moon. Not only does Io have volcanoes that spew blisteringly hot lava, but the Jovian moon also hosts cryovolcanoes. These ice volcanoes which occur on planets and moons located away from the sun erupt cold, liquid, or frozen gases like water, ammonia, or methane.Io is punctuated with hundreds of volcanic vents, many of which blast jets of frozen gas hundreds of miles into Jupiter's atmosphere. Cyrovolcanoes were first observed on one of Neptune's moons, Triton when the Voyager 2 craft caught a glimpse of five mile-high plumes of nitrogen gas during its 1989 flyby of the Neptunian system.These eruptions are caused when solar radiation heats nitrogen below Triton's surface, vaporizing it, causing it to expand and eventually erupt from the Neptunian moon's icy surface. Eventually, this material condenses and falls back to the surface of Triton, giving it a smooth snow-covered surface. In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft observed ice jets released from the southern polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus. Cassini actually flew through one of these eruptions discovering it to be mostly comprised of water vapor with some nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.","answer":"Born from the power of both destruction and creation, the omnipresence of space volcanoes on the celestial bodies across the cosmic expanse is remarkable.Our home planet, Earth, is home to some of the most enthralling and cataclysmic geographical features, the result of the tumultuous dance of volcanoes - the architects of destruction and creation. But these molten marvels are not confined to the realm of our world, as space volcanoes dot the terrains of planets and moons far and wide.Our very own moon and the elusive Mars are littered with relics of past volcanic fury. Meanwhile, some celestial bodies boast volcanoes that eject ice from their frost-covered landscapes.MOON'S VOLCANIC PASTThe lunar surface, which is now volcanically dormant, was once a stage for magnificent volcanic eruptions, birthing lava flows that stretched for an astonishing 750 miles from their origin, as reported by San Diego State University.The recent Chang'e-5 lunar mission by China retrieved lava samples that hint at a more recent period of volcanic liveliness on Earth's closest celestial companion than previously assumed.MARS' VOLCANIC SAGAHumanity has examined Mars' geological secrets more than any other celestial body apart from Earth. This deep dive has uncovered the fact that the Red Planet is a treasure trove of more volcanic landmarks than our world.Olympus Mons, towering at twice the height of Mount Everest, holds the record for the largest volcano in our solar system. Along with this leviathan, Mars is adorned with several other colossal volcanoes.Despite its volcanic riches, Mars currently seems dormant. The timeline of its volcanic inactivity remains a mystery that astrogeologists strive to unveil.THE VOLCANIC COSMOSNumerous planets in our cosmic neighborhood bear traces of volcanic activity, a testament to a time when our solar system was young and turbulent.Venus, Earth's closest planetary neighbor, is a volcanic wonderland with lava flows covering a staggering 90% of its surface. Its surface is pockmarked with up to 1,600 significant volcanoes and potentially millions of smaller ones.THE MOON'S VOLCANIC PORTRAITFor an exhibition of active volcanoes, one must turn the gaze away from the planets to the moons of our solar system.Jupiter's moon, Io, bears the distinction of being the most volcanic celestial body in our solar system, as per NASA. Its volcanism is attributed to the immense gravitational pull of the gas giant.Neptune's moon, Triton, was the stage for the first sighting of cryovolcanoes when Voyager 2 witnessed colossal plumes of nitrogen gas during its 1989 encounter with the Neptunian system.In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft captured the spectacle of ice jets emanating from Saturn's moon Enceladus. Cassini even ventured through one of these icy eruptions, discovering it to be mostly water vapor with some nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide."},{"question":"Summarize the paragraphs below:U.S. regulators say Facebook misled parents and failed to protect the privacy of children using its Messenger Kids app, including misrepresenting the access it provided to app developers to private user data.As a result, The Federal Trade Commision on Wednesday proposed sweeping changes to a 2020 privacy order with Facebook — now called Meta — that would prohibit it from profiting from data it collects on users under 18.

Park Ranger Andy liked the job because he liked being out in nature, and he liked learning about the different trees, plants, and animals of the forest. To save money, Park Ranger Andy slept in a tent himself. It wasn't too bad, and he knew where all the best spots were. One night, Andy heard a sound out in the woods. It was an awful yowling sound, almost like a house cat. It didn't sound like it was very far away, and Andy thought that maybe someone's cat had gotten out of their house. He listened carefully and, eventually, heard it again, except this time it sounded more like a person's voice. Was it someone pretending to be a cat? Andy was the park ranger, so it was his responsibility to investigate. A few of the other campers say that Andy checked on their tents that night and told them he was looking for a prankster, but nobody knew who it might have been. Then, Andy went looking in the woods, the beam of his flashlight flickering through the trees. They found him a few days later. Well, what was left of him.

Talk about how adults and children sometimes grieve and remind the reader that it's important to allow time to grieve for each family member, even kids.","answer":"Dealing with Grief and LossTragedy strikes when we least expect it and the loss may turn your world (and your family’s) upside-down. This is particularly true with the loss of a loved one. Pain and grief come to the family and hits hard, especially to children. Children often feel it more intensely and may have a harder time recovering from the loss. How do you deal with the grief and the pain? How will you help your children who are looking to you for stability and security?Here are some reminders to help you as you deal with grief yourself and also try to muster up the comfort that your children may need during this difficult time.- Make time for your grief. The process of grieving takes time – there may be even some instances when you feel that the grief will just not let up. The time immediately after the death of a loved one may be a busy one – there is the funeral and burial to be arranged, well-wishers and mourners to be looked after. However, you should give yourself and your family time to sit down and grieve. Acknowledge your feelings – don’t suppress them. - Grieve in your own way. People grieve in different ways. As long as you are not doing anything harmful to yourself or others, you can choose to grieve in your own way. Don’t allow anyone to set a timetable for your grief or tell you how to feel. In the same way, don’t push children to overcome their grief within a certain timetable. - Realize that it’s normal to be angry. Anger is a part of the process of grieving. Your children may go through a period where they express anger at what has happened that resulted in the tragic loss of a loved one. Don’t belittle or deny the child’s feelings but reassure him or her of your presence at this time."},{"question":"What was the significance of the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century?","answer":"The Scientific Revolution, a period of great scientific discovery and innovation during the 17th century, fundamentally transformed the way humanity understands the natural world.

It’s creamy, filling and best of all, versatile—not to mention easier to make than you think. Allow recipe developer Erin McDowell’s polenta with roasted mushrooms and bacon to be your starting point.“This is something I would make as a weeknight dinner,” McDowell tells us, “because you can pop the mushrooms in the oven to roast while you’re cooking the polenta, and then they’re conveniently done at the same time.”If you’re still fooled by that old wives’ tale that polenta absolutely must be stirred through the entire cooking time, we promise that’s not the case. You should stir it frequently, getting to the bottom of the saucepan to make sure nothing is sticking, but you don’t have to coddle it.“To make this a heartier main course, you could top it with a fried egg,” McDowell continues, “or you could serve it family-style as a side dish alongside a bigger meal like a roast or a braise.” Erin, are you asking us to…put an egg on it?

People feel more paranoid about their health. Can you please brainstorm three solutions for people suffering from paranoia about their physical health? How can they feel more relaxed about their physical state and not trigger a placebo effect to make them think there's something wrong with them?","answer":"Here is a list of three ways people can reduce their medical anxiety:1) Work with a Primary Care Physician. By developing a relationship with a single doctor who can access all of your health records, you are gaining access to someone who can help ease any sense of paranoia you may be experiencing. Not only can they give you answers to possible problems you're having, but they are trained to help you through all sorts of concerns you have regarding your health and they will be able to refer you to a therapist if necessary. It's helpful to disclose that you are experiencing health anxiety so they can work with you on record keeping, tracking the actual state of your health, and avoiding costly and unnecessary screening tests.2) Live a healthier lifestyle. If you are worried about your physical health, it may help to improve your lifestyle. When your body feels good, your mind does too. Try exercising, eating healthier, and drinking more water. There's also more that goes into a healthier lifestyle, like interaction. Stay active in your community, make new friends, try new hobbies, and go out of your comfort zone.3) Regularly attend check-ups. Don't miss any check-ups, whether it be for a doctor, dentist, or another specialist. While you're at these check-ups, ask any questions you have about your health and share your concerns with them. They can help you feel better about any medical anxiety you have.4) Meditate. Meditation is a way to feel your body and appreciate it, even when it doesn't feel perfectly comfortable. By meditating, you are practicing looking deeper within and experiencing what your body is feeling. You'll have a better understanding of your body and what's going on with it through meditation. Meditation is also relaxing and can help ease your feelings of anxiety. Along with that, meditation can help you to understand the signals your body is sending so that you can practice regular and effective self-care rather than rushing to a doctor's office to address every passing ache and pain."},{"question":"I'm a 9th-grade history teacher and want to test my students on their knowledge of the Declaration of Independence.

The second line is defining ValueMinusTwo as a variable in function mode - if the colon was not used with the equals then the variable might interpret Value as a string and math functions would not work as expected.

Most of them have roller skating experience through their physical education classes. What are some group games that we could play on the rink that will hold their attention and break up the long skating session?","answer":"Here are some group roller skating games that can be used for a group of intermediate-level skaters in the middle school age group:* The Four Corner Game: The Four Corner game doesn't require any skating experience and is mostly a matter of luck. When the music plays, the skaters travel around the rink like normal. When the music stops, they find a corner. A designated dice roller will roll the large fuzzy die, and whichever corner number is rolled is removed from the game. This process of elimination continues until only one player is left and they are declared the winner. There are variations that can be used, such as playing odd/even corners or keeping the number that is rolled rather than eliminating that corner, which speeds up the game significantly.* Rockin' Robin (or the Record Game): This game is for skaters of intermediate skill. The DJ will play the songs \\"Rockin' Robin\\" or \\"You Spin Me Round\\" and blow the whistle throughout the song. When the whistle blows, skaters must turn and skate in the opposite direction. The whistle strikes may be fast and challenging, resulting in skaters making a complete circle. Skaters must pay close attention to the whistles.* Shoot the Duck: This game is played in teams, either red vs. blue or girls vs. boys. When the DJ blows the whistle, students must assume a squatting position on their skates and cannot use their legs to gain speed. As skaters lose momentum, they will stop moving and sit on their bottom. The goal is to be the last skater moving in order to earn a point for their team. The first team to five points wins the opportunity to skate one song all by themselves.* Dodgeball: For advanced skaters, adults/teachers/employees can throw the balls while students skate around the rink and \\"dodge\\" the balls. If a skater is \\"hit,\\" they must sit in the middle of the floor. The goal is to be the last skater standing. If a skater catches the ball, the adult must sit down, instead. Adults should begin by throwing the balls high, so they can be easily ducked under, but aim progressively lower as the song continues. These games are competitive or involve silly movements that are sure to keep skaters engaged. Longer games such as dodgeball can be played during large skating blocks, while it's easier to fit Rockin' Robin and short rounds of The Four Corner Game in between other activities.

The lead character, Mary, is a spoiled child that was from a wealthy family, but who finds herself an orphan when her parents both die from an epidemic of cholera. She is sent to live with her widowed uncle, and she grows to become angry and very withdrawn. She finds out that somewhere on the grounds of the home there is a locked garden space that her uncle's deceased wife loved and cared for before she died. Mary finds the garden and begins to bring it back to life, taking time to weed and clear overgrown areas. As she spends her time and energy cultivating the secret garden, Mary's disposition changes and she becomes more friendly and kind. She eventually will share the garden with her uncle's son, who believes he has a spinal deformity, and in the garden, he will find strength and hope again. Eventually, Mary's uncle finds out about the children's work in the garden and embraces it, along with his family in a way that brings the story to a happy close.

Rearrange the sentences to make fewer paragraphs.Why did dinosaurs go extinct?Around 75% of Earth's animals, including dinosaurs, suddenly died out at the same point in time. So how was this global mass extinction caused by a rock hurtling into the coast of Central America?Paul explains, 'The asteroid hit at high velocity and effectively vaporised. It made a huge crater, so in the immediate area there was total devastation. A huge blast wave and heatwave went out and it threw vast amounts of material up into the atmosphere.'It sent soot travelling all around the world. It didn't completely block out the Sun, but it reduced the amount of light that reached the Earth's surface. So it had an impact on plant growth.'Like dominos, this trailed up the food chain, causing the ecosystem to collapse. The reduction in plant life had a huge impact on herbivores' ability to survive, which in turn meant that carnivores would also have suffered from having less food available.Breeding seasons would have been shorter and conditions harsher. All living things would have been affected in some way, both on land and in the ocean.'There is a lot of discussion over the actual kill mechanism and how long that period lasted. There are still a lot of unknowns. But it was a massive event affecting all life on Earth, from microorganisms all the way through to dinosaurs,' says Paul.The casualty list is long. Among them, ammonites, some microscopic plankton, and large marine reptiles all died out.But the loss made room for the beginnings of the modern world.","answer":"Why did the dinosaurs die?A long time ago, many different animals lived on our planet that no longer live now.

Everything was destroyed and a lot of black powder called soot went flying into the air and all around the planet. There was so much of this black powder that the Sun was blocked out a little. It wasn't bright enough on Earth for the plants to grow normally anymore.Because the plants couldn't grow well, all other living beings were affected as well. The animals that only eat plants didn't have enough food to survive. Because there were not many plant-eating animals, the meat-eating animals also didn't have enough food anymore. The conditions were becoming more and more difficult for all living creatures on land and in the sea.Because this happened so long ago, it's hard to know everything, but we know for sure that it was a very big event and that it affected all organisms from the tiniest living beings all the way to dinosaurs. The list of animals that died during that time is very long. But even though it was the end of many things, it was also the beginning of many new things."},{"question":"Classify this poem as romantic, melancholic, inspirational, or humorous.

I might be doing the right thing, but that didn’t mean it was easy. Taking a mental tally, I tried to prioritize who needed to come in next. “Gerald,” I said aloud to myself. At least the big giraffe was usually more agreeable than Velma here. I grabbed my lasso and stalked back outside with a steely grin. I checked my watch. Not long now. The giants didn’t keep an exact schedule, but they never failed to appear as the day waned. Any of my valley’s animals who weren’t safely inside my compound by the time the giants arrived were liable to get tossed bodily into their big basket of despair. Bobby the toucan and Lino the lemur had spent weeks in the basket. And of course, poor Pablo, my old disabled bison, had never returned. I choked the tears back. “Not today,” I grumbled, readying the lasso. I whistled at Gerald. “Here, buddy! Time to come home!” He dodged my first cast, trotting casually to the next gum tree.“Persistence,” I told myself. “Don’t let yourself get discouraged.” My next toss circled Gerald’s big neck. He brayed loudly but dutifully fell into step behind me when I started toward the compound. “That’s it, big guy,” I reassured him. “We’ll be back out in the morning.”His gate creaked shut and I again wiped my brow.

He was nervous, but he was also excited to share his research with the world. Geraldo had been working on his research for years. He had already published several papers, but this was his first opportunity to present his work to a large audience. Geraldo started his presentation by giving a brief overview of his research. He then went into more detail about his methods and findings. He spoke clearly and passionately, and he could tell that the audience was interested. However, as Geraldo continued his presentation, he started to notice that the crowd was getting restless. People were talking and fidgeting, and some of them were even getting up and leaving.Geraldo tried to ignore the distractions, but they were too much for him. He could feel his anxiety rising, and he was starting to stumble over his words. He lost his train of thought several times. Finally, Geraldo could take it no more. He stopped his presentation and looked out at the crowd. \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said. \\"I can't do this.\\" The crowd then erupted into applause. People were cheering and laughing, and some of them were even giving Geraldo a standing ovation. Some people hooted and whistled. Geraldo was confused. He didn't understand why the crowd was so happy. He felt that his presentation had been a failure. Then, one of the people in the crowd shouted, \\"We're not laughing at you, Geraldo. We're laughing with you. We've all been there! It’s okay to be nervous, just shrug it off and have a laugh with us!\\" They knew what it was like to be nervous and to make mistakes, especially as a young presenter.Geraldo took a deep breath and smiled softly. \\"Thank you,\\" he said. \\"I'm so, so glad that you understand.\\" Geraldo then finished his presentation, and the crowd was very supportive.

Could you please give me some ideas on how to get my dog to listen to me? She just ignores me when I try giving her commands.","answer":"Yes! Here are some ways to get your dog to listen to you:1. Treats: Most dogs are food-motivated, so finding some yummy treats is a great way to get them to listen to you. You can also use their kibble if your dog is on a special diet or can't have too many treats. Every dog is different, so make sure you consider what treats your dog loves best. 2. Toys: If your dog has a favorite toy, you can also use this as motivation. Make sure your dog is aware of you holding the toy when you ask them to do something.3. Practice Without Distractions: If you're having trouble getting your dog to listen to you in a place where there are plenty of distractions, like in the park or on a busy street, try practicing somewhere without distractions first. At home is ideal, as there should be nothing out of the ordinary.4. Start Easy: Make sure you start with easy commands and build up. Use the ones your dog already knows well when trying to motivate them to listen to you.5. Use a Long Leash: If training recall, make sure you attach a long leash to your dog until their recall is solid. This will prevent them from running off.6. Always Use Positive Reinforcement: Lastly, don't punish your dog for not listening to you. This can result in your dog being fearful of you or aggressive towards you and failing to understand what you want from them. Praise your dog for doing the right thing, and try not to react when they don't.Every dog is different, so finding out what motivates your dog is important. It's also important to be understanding of their age, as a small puppy is much less likely to respond to you every time than an adult dog who's had plenty of practice."},{"question":"Can you give me a list of films that are based on comics that aren't superhero-related?

Please review this information and provide a summary of why earthquakes happen and what happens during an earthquake.An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth, or tectonic plates, suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!","answer":"An earthquake is the result of two tectonic plates colliding as they move past each other. Earthquakes may give a foreshock as a warning that a larger quake is coming, but this does not always happen. Next comes the mainshock, which is the largest shock of the earthquake.

To accomplish what you asked for, we first create a set so we can track whether we've already added an element or not. Then, we will use the filter method, which will only pass through elements that evaluate to true in a given function and assign it a lambda function that checks whether the given element is in the existing set or not. Note that in Python, the add method returns None and not a boolean value about the existence of the element like in other languages such as Java. So the return statement of our lambda function first checks whether x is already in the set or not. If it's not in the set, then we want to add the element x to the set and return true (so to return true from a value of None, we must add a not condition in front of it).def unique(n):    added = set()    return list(filter(lambda x: ( x not in added and not added.add(x) ) , n))"},{"question":"Pretend you’re a sales rep.

My guests were planning to come and do lots of hiking in nature, but the forecast now says it will be raining most of the time they’re here.","answer":"No problem! Here are some fun things to do in Santa Fe that don’t require good weather conditions.*Visit museums - There are lots of great museums to check out in Santa Fe. Take your guests to Meow Wolf to explore interactive, psychedelic exhibits crafted by local artists and funded by author George RR Martin, or bring them to see the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, the New Mexico History Museum, or the Museum of International Folk Art.*Grab a bite - Santa Fe has excellent restaurants, whether you’re looking for a tasty casual meal or a fine dining experience. CHOMP is an upscale food court hosting 4-5 popup restaurants, a bar, a dance floor, and a play area for kids. Plaza Cafe is a retro diner-style eatery serving breakfast all day as well as dinner, drinks, and desserts. Radish & Rye offers delicious upscale farm-to-table cuisine. Geronimo on Canyon Road is considered one of the best fine-dining restaurants in the country. Countless other restaurants in the area are sure to satisfy your guests’ cravings and curiosities. *10,000 Waves - While this famed spa is known for its beautiful scenery and outdoor hot tubs, the facility is designed to make hot tub bathing pleasant through rain, sleet, or snow. The spa also offers indoor massage and spa treatments, as well as fine dining and luxury lodging accommodations, so there’s plenty to do here, even if an outdoor soak is off the menu.*Violet Crown Cinema - The Railyard district in Santa Fe is often recommended for its outdoor concerts and easy walking, but there are a few indoor attractions worth visiting. Violet Crown Cinema is one of them. This movie theater has standard concessions, a full kitchen menu, and a bar serving wine and beer. You can dine in the lounge or take your food and drinks into the theaters. After the movie, you can walk less than 2 blocks to an indie bookstore, ice cream shop, pizza parlor, coffee shop, brewery, and boutique shopping*Sky Railway - Just around the corner from Violet Crown Cinema, you’ll find the Jean Cocteau, a small, historic indie theater revived by author George R.R. Martin. The novelist and patron of Santa Fe’s art scene also revived a dilapidated historical railroad line to create a luxe travel experience with Sky Railway. The train cars are outfitted in an antique style with food, drinks, and entertainment offered on board while the train travels right through the heart of Santa Fe’s Railyard district, as well as into more scenic surrounding areas.*Tumbleroot - If your guests enjoy music, they might like to catch a show at Tumbleroot Brewery and Distillery. This spot has excellent quality drinks, diverse musical acts, a large dance floor, a gallery and merch space, and a beautiful outdoor space in the back with food trucks, a bar, and a frog pond. *Shopping - Santa Fe is overflowing with artisans, so the shops on the plaza are always stocked with beautifully crafted and unique pieces. In this area, window shopping is just about as entertaining as a museum visit. Even if your guests don’t end up purchasing anything, they’ll be sure to enjoy browsing.

Rex is the Latin word for king. This is a truly unique name that will strike fear into the hearts of villains.- Blinding Cirrus: Blinding Cirrus is a name that references the dazzling light emitted when lightning strikes. And cirrus is a type of high-altitude cloud.

She wasn't wearing shoes or socks, and when she stepped, one could see the black caked on the soles of her feet. Surprisingly, she didn't wear heavy makeup. It was light and natural, with mascara, a light blush around her cheeks, and subtle lip stain being the only adornments. These, of course, were not her most notable features. When she walked into the dinner, her eyes were hollow. They held no shine--no recognition of life, even. If there was someone behind that dull glare, she was certainly preoccupied with other things.

With its holiday-themed amusement park, Christmas-themed restaurants and stores, a drive through a light show, and visits from Santa Claus himself, it's a perfect destination for families with young children.* Lake Placid, New York: While not a specific Christmas town per se, this picturesque Adirondack Mountains is a perfect destination for a festive Christmas vacation. The area is known for outdoor ice-skating rinks and toboggan runs, and also horse-drawn carriage rides through the snowy streets.* North Pole, Alaska - This is a year-round Christmas town, so you can visit any time you're craving a little holiday spirit. Here you'll find candy-cane posts, boughs of holly, and a Santa Claus house with live reindeer. But of course, it looks its best at Christmas when snow is virtually guaranteed and turns the town into a total winter wonderland. * Jackson, Wyoming - This charming ski town is surrounded by the snow-capped Teton mountains and offers plenty of snow-based activities, including sleigh rides, ice skating, and skiing. The town hosts a huge tree-lighting party, its annual Christmas parade, and more, making it the perfect family-friendly holiday location.These are just a few suggestions, but I hope your inspiration for your next holiday trip is here!"},{"question":"Summarize the four different views of Judaism held today based on the information found below.Judaism today is descended from Rabbinic Judaism, that is, the Judaism that emerged after the destruction of the second temple by the Romans in 70 ce. This form of Judaism was centered around the Torah and the synagogue, instead of the temple. From the first century ce until the nineteenth century, there was basically only one way of being Jewish, and for the most part, by choice or not, it consisted of a life lived separated from the larger society.With the growing secularization in nineteenth-century Western Europe, however, Jews became more active participants in “secular” society, even while maintaining their “sacred” practices and beliefs. Different interpretations of Judaism developed that guided the interplay between these sacred and secular worlds. Over time, these differences resulted in the four main branches of Judaism that exist today.Orthodox Judaism is the modern term for what historically has been mainline Judaism: in other words, before the nineteenth century, Orthodox Judaism was Judaism, plain and simple. It is based on an understanding of the Torah as the unchangeable, inerrant revelation of God that provides the sole guide for all aspects of one’s daily life. Accordingly, Orthodox Jews meticulously observe Jewish law, that is, halakhah (literally “the way one walks”), which is based on an understanding that all 613 commandments within the Torah have been revealed as the direct, immutable will of God.Reform Judaism emerged during the Enlightenment as some sought to “reform” Jewish thought and practice in light of new scientific developments, political ideas, and modernism. While Orthodox Judaism considers the Torah the unchanging divine command of God, Reform Judaism sees the Torah as written by “divinely inspired” human authors. The Torah—and the commandments therein—is regarded as instructional and inspirational, but not absolutely binding. Reform Judaism emphasizes obligation to the neighbor, care for the world, and the injunction to offer hospitality and care to all in need. All other aspects of Judaism are open to negotiation.Conservative Judaism was founded as a response to what were viewed as overly radical changes in Reform Judaism: it was believed that while change was needed, Reform Judaism had moved too far too quickly. Conservative Judaism emphasizes on ritual practice, rather than specific doctrines. One of the distinguishing marks of Conservative Judaism, as opposed to Reform Judaism, is its preservation of the halakhic process when deciding how traditional interpretation of Jewish law might be changed. In that process, rabbis consult sacred scriptures and commentaries, rabbinic codes of law, and previous generations of rabbinical opinion, in order to craft a new reading for today.Reconstructionist Judaism is the most recent to emerge. It holds that what is important about Judaism is not that everyone believes the same things about divine revelation, miracles, and God, or that people follow Jewish law in the same way. Instead, it sees the value of Judaism first as a cultural force uniting, supporting, and nurturing the Jewish people over time and space. As such, everything is open to debate and modification—all beliefs, all doctrines, all practices—according to the current needs of the Jewish community. Tradition is important as a way of maintaining community, but it has only a voice, not a veto—and, of course, there are many different views about how much of a vote tradition should have in any specific decision about Jewish life.","answer":"Rabbinic Judaism, which emerged after 70 CE, focused on the Torah and the synagogue, instead of the temple. Nineteenth-century secularism resulted in the separation of four main branches of Judaism.Orthodox Judaism believes that the Torah is the unchangeable, inerrant revelation of God and is the sole guide for daily life. As such, Orthodox Jews methodically follow Jewish law and the 613 commandments within the Torah.Reform Judaism sees the Torah as written by “divinely inspired” human authors and uses it as instruction and inspiration that is open to negotiation.Conservative Judaism, a response to Reform Judaism, emphasizes ritual practice over doctrines but uses rabbinic law and opinion, sacred scriptures, and commentaries, to craft change to traditional practices.Reconstructionist Judaism, the latest to emerge, holds that not everyone has the same beliefs about divine revelation or Jewish law and that as a result everything is open to debate and modification, Judaism’s value is a cultural force that unites, supports, and nurtures the Jewish people.

The information should be silly, but the tone should be very serious. It should be between 250 and 300 words. It can be any number of paragraphs. Make each paragraph start with 5 spaces.","answer":"There once was a camel named Lollypeeps that woke up very far from home. Lollypeeps had arisen from a dream about his camel bride, and was immediately startled into attention by his cat-like senses for danger; they were going off prudently. Lollypeeps felt something was amiss.         As Lollypeeps came to his senses, it seemed to be a dire situation. His face was covered in snow. His hump was sticking in the air negligently to his body. He was shaking from the cold, and slowly and suddenly realized that he was far from home.      He stood up on his feet. He slowly raised his neck and fixated his eyes on the sky before him, and suddenly he couldn’t believe his own eyes. A penguin was zigging and zagging through the air, just waiting for the chance to dive in at a 180-degree angle to the curve of Lollypeep’s hump. Suddenly, the penguin swooped down.     The penguin made contact with the freezing Camel’s trembling hump. It was a perfect landing! The penguin soared down the curve of the camel’s bump with not too much friction, but just enough to warm Lollypeeps up from the cold. The penguin made it all the way down the decline to the bottom arch of Lollypeeps’ hump effortlessly, folded back their penguin wings, and soared up the incline of the camel’s hump, finally landing on Lollypeeps’ head.     Lollypeeps thanked the penguin vigorously for warming him up. The penguin smiled mysteriously, and they were best friends forever."},{"question":"Write a funny story about two training swordsmen, Darren and Colby, who are sparring.

Suddenly, Colby turned his back to his opponent completely as he spun around. Darren immediately jabbed his torso with the wooden sword, earning a point.\\"Aw, man,\\" Colby said, taking off his helmet.\\"What was that?\\" Darren said, puzzled.\\"What?\\"\\"The spin.\\"\\"Oh, yeah,\\" Colby laughed. \\"It's this cool new technique I've been working on.\\"\\"A technique where you turn your back to the opponent?\\"\\"What would you know?\\" Colby said, snapping his helmet back down and assuming his sparring stance. The two fought again, and Colby began to take the upper hand, pushing Darren back. Then, he spun around again to deliver the final blow. Darren reached his sword forward with a thrust and poked Colby's torso again.\\"Oh, come on!\\" Colby said, visibly frustrated. \\"Why isn't this working?\\"\\"Maybe because you're making a series of pointless, slow, and predictable movements that give me a tremendous advantage in combat.\\"\\"No chance.\\" Colby suddenly launched into a flurry of spins, which Darren effortlessly dodged.

Can you write about the process of a young adult building a computer? If possible, I would like more of an artistic description.","answer":"I have all the parts laid out on the table. It has been a while, but I can finally start building my computer. I have been working a lot the past few weeks, motivated to get a new computer to play all the hottest new games and maybe start editing some content. Now, all the parts are laid out in front of me. The last thing that I have to do is put it all together. I start to sort through what I need. I unpackage the motherboard and place it on top of its box. Next, I cut the RAM out of its hard packaging. I put those into their slot in the motherboard. It was satisfying as I hear the light \\"click\\" sound after every piece.Click.Click.Click.Next, I carefully unwrap the CPU from its package and start to place it into the middle of the motherboard. It's weird. It feels like I'm doing brain surgery, installing a new brain into the fresh, new body called a motherboard as I install the CPU carefully and click the cover over, locking it in place. I take the thermal paste that I bought and slowly apply a little bit to the top of the CPU. Each blob is spaced out as far from each other as possible. After that, I grab a large box that contains a clean, new air cooler. The feeling never gets old as I unwrap the cooler and unbox it, revealing a silver champion. I take the cooler and slowly install it on top of the CPU. Below, the thermal paste slowly spreads throughout the top of the CPU and completely covers it. The last thing that I have to do for this part is install the SSD. These days, memory has gotten so small and so advanced that it completely skips a step. I take the 1TB SSD from the packaging and place it in its rightful place on the motherboard. I grab my smallest screwdriver, and with every spin, I feel that I am that much closer to completing this build. I start to sweat, which is weird because this is the easiest part of the build. With that, I can move on to the case.

And remember consistency is key. Here are a few tips to help you get started:- Take your puppy outside to go potty first thing in the morning, after eating or drinking, after playtime, and before bed.- Watch your puppy closely for signs that they need to go potty, such as sniffing, circling, staring, or whining.- If you catch your puppy in the act of going potty inside, immediately take them outside and have them finish there.- Every time your puppy successfully goes potty outside immediately say \\"yes\\" and reward them with a treat. Always reward their positive behavior.- If your puppy has an accident, do not punish them. This will only make them fear you and the potty training experience. Simply clean up the accident and be on the lookout for the next opportunity to take your puppy out.

Please finish each tweet with one to five hashtags relevant to the tweet. Bruce Cassidy saw a lot of the Florida Panthers when he was coaching the Boston Bruins from 2016-22.But the Vegas Golden Knights coach knows he'll see a different Florida team in the 2023 Stanley Cup Final, starting with Game 1 at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday (8 p.m. ET; TNT, TBS, truTV, CBC, SN, TVAS).\\"Obviously we've got our hands full,\\" Cassidy said Wednesday.The Panthers won the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best regular-season team in 2021-22 and defeated the Washington Capitals in six games in the Eastern Conference First Round, winning a Stanley Cup Playoff series for the first time since 1996.But after the Tampa Bay Lightning swept them in the second round, they made significant changes to become more of a playoff-style team this season, most notably hiring coach Paul Maurice on June 22 and acquiring forward Matthew Tkachuk in a trade with the Calgary Flames exactly one month later.The adjustment was among the reasons they struggled the first half of the regular season. But after a 4-2 loss at Vegas on Jan. 12, which dropped them to 19-20-4, they went 23-12-4 and earned the second wild card in the East. In the playoffs, they have defeated three of the top four teams in the regular season standings: the Bruins (first), Carolina Hurricanes (second) and Toronto Maple Leafs (fourth).\\"The biggest thing I've noticed is, the rush game used to kill you [against Florida],\\" Cassidy said. \\"If you could shut that down, you'd probably be able to outwill them to get to the front of the net, different areas like that.\\"The Panthers now create more offense below the goal line, getting pucks deep, forechecking and going to the net front.Tkachuk is a big part of that. He has 21 points (nine goals, 12 assists) in 16 games, second in the playoffs behind Dallas Stars center Roope Hintz, who had 24 points (10 goals, 14 assists) in 19 games. Tkachuk has four game-winning goals, tied for first in the postseason with Stars forward Joe Pavelski, including three overtime goals, most in the playoffs.Cassidy said Tkachuk has a high hockey IQ and will challenge the Golden Knights on small-area plays.\\"We have to find a way to take away his time and space, yet take away his options, because he moves the puck so quick, so that's going to be a delicate balance,\\" Cassidy said. \\"And you've got to get into him when he gets to the front of the net. We know that. He's got a great stick and nose for the net. We have some big 'D' that can do that.\\"Tkachuk (6-foot-2, 201 pounds) will battle with Vegas defensemen Nicolas Hague (6-6, 230), Brayden McNabb (6-4, 215), Alec Martinez (6-1, 210), Alex Pietrangelo (6-3, 215), Shea Theodore (6-2, 197) and Zach Whitecloud (6-2, 207).","answer":"Tweet 1: Cassidy has seen a lot of the Panthers from his time coaching in Boston from 2016-2022.

Professionals believe that’s because this is the number one best way to fix a multitude of issues with your teeth. In fact, there’s really no other way to eliminate spaces, straighten crooked teeth, and push teeth into alignment. The real question for most people is what type of braces to get.There are a few problems that clear aligners cannot handle. Traditional braces are still the cheapest and best way to give you the perfect smile. But for many people, clear aligners will work. They’re much easier to wear, and they are barely noticeable. With traditional braces, you may have discomfort when eating. Flossing and brushing are more difficult. The metal wires can poke your mouth and be painful.For those who qualify for Invisalign or some other type of clear aligner, the journey to the perfect smile will be much easier. Your orthodontist will examine you and take some X-rays. He or she will talk to you about what you want done. Most of us have a good idea about how we’d like our teeth to look and the types of issues we have. After your initial consultation, the orthodontist will put together a treatment plan, especially for you.

McDonald’s was only a mile down the road and all of them could already imagine what they were going to get. “I’m going to get the 10-piece nugget meal with a Coke and some honey mustard!” Marvin said with an excited expression. “Well me personally, I’m gonna get me a cheeseburger with an apple pie and a large smoothie,” Matthew responded. Both of them stating what they wanted left Leroy confused as he never planned out what he was going to get and would always just let the menu in the drive-thru “speak to him”. Either way, all three of their mouths were watering as they got closer and closer to their intended destination. As they pulled up into the drive-thru, they almost jumped out of their seats trying to convey their orders to the lady at the microphone. The lady almost felt inclined to scream at them and tell them to calm down. After it was all said and done and they all got their respective orders, you could tell they were very satisfied."},{"question":"I'm trying boba tea for the first time, but I'm a little scared. I love super sweet tea and I'm a fan of more traditional flavors. Give me five good options for trying boba tea for the first time.","answer":"Of course! Boba tea is a tasty beverage you're going to love. Here are five of the best flavors:1. Taro Milk Tea: The best flavor of milk tea is Taro. It's a sweet purple root that tastes like a dessert yam, but it isn't overwhelming. It's a subtle, valuable flavor.2. Brown Sugar Milk Tea: Brown sugar is one of the most popular flavors right now. It's sweet and fresh. Plus, the boba is cooked in brown sugar syrup to add to the flavor. It's also known as tiger stripe boba in some locations.3. Black Milk Tea: This classic is the most basic of basic flavors, but not in a bad way. It's slightly creamy with a low-key flavor for an excellent sip every time. 4. Thai Iced Tea: Thai iced tea is a little more flavorful. It's bright orange and sweet, spiced with cardamom, star anise, and more. It's sweetened with tasty condensed milk and sugar.5. Strawberry Milk Tea: If you love berries, go for a strawberry milk tea option. It's made with strawberry powder or fresh strawberries, then sweetened with a creamer.

Pretty neat, huh?2: Looks nice. How much did it cost you?1: About a hundred bucks. Can you help me set it up?2: Sure. What do we do?1: We'll take it out of the box, plug it in, and it should be ready to use.2: Don't we need water?1: Yes, I made sure to fill up a 5-gallon water jug before I came here. It's pretty heavy.2: How do we get the water into the water dispenser?1: Well, it says it's a \\"top loading\\" water dispenser, and the picture shows the water jug upside down.2: Let's open the box and read the instructions, maybe there's a special way to load it onto the dispenser.1: (Reads instructions) So apparently you just have to open the water jug, tip it upside down and put it on the top of the water dispenser.2: That seems difficult. Won't the water pour out of the opening when we tip the jug upside down?1: Yeah, I'm guessing it will. I don't see any other instructions on how to do this.2: I got an idea. Search online for videos on how to do this.1: Okay, so I checked a couple of videos and it says to just flip the jug over and load it onto the dispenser. There were a couple of videos that promoted a special cap that could be used for the bottles, but you'd have to order it online and wait for it to come in.2: This sounds too difficult. I mean, we can just try it, but we're gonna have to wipe the floor and the dispenser after we inevitably spill water all over the place. And imagine having to do that every time we refill the water jug...1: Well, there was one other video that showed them using plastic cling film over the opening of the jug, and it was held in place with a rubber band. When you tip the jug onto the dispenser the plastic film will be pierced by a spike in the dispenser that goes through the opening into the jug.2: Okay, let's try that.1: Sounds good.

If so, could explain what they are and their origin?","answer":"To answer your question, \\"In New Orleans, Lousiana, do they have distinct dialects or speak a different language other than English?\\" the answer is yes. Here is a list of the dialect and languages spoken in New Orleans and their origin:1. Cajun English - The Cajun people are of Acadian heritage and immigrants to Nova Scotia. When the first batch of Cajuns settled in Louisiana, they traded with English-speaking traders in the area using a language of commerce and trade called Cajun English.2. Yat - This is more of a dialect than a language but significantly differs from regular spoken English.  Yat is spoken only in the New Orleans metro area and can vary considerably based on the accent of Italian and Irish immigrants who reside around the port city.3. French and other varieties - French was spoken in Louisiana for 80 years before the state adapted to many different varieties of cultures. The French spoke Cajun French, and Creole was from a mix of French Creole. This eventually became known as Cajun French. Very few still speak Cajun French, but it is still used in some areas of southern Louisiana."},{"question":"Write a detailed explanation of what the return Typescript here does.export function* zip<T extends Iterable<any>[]>(    ...args: T): Iterable<{ [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends Iterable<infer U> ?

What are some examples of tool use among Capuchin monkeys?","answer":"Capuchin monkeys, particularly those found in South and Central America, have been observed using tools in several unique ways that demonstrate their problem-solving abilities and cognitive sophistication. One of the most well-known examples of tool use in Capuchin monkeys is their use of stones as hammers and anvils to crack open hard nuts. This behavior isn't instinctive but learned over time and passed down through generations, a clear indication of a form of culture. It also demonstrates planning and foresight as Capuchins are known to select special types of stones and even transport them for future use. Capuchins also use tools for foraging in other contexts. They use sticks to dig into termite mounds or to reach invertebrates hidden in tree bark. Another interesting example is the use of branches or reeds to catch small mammals. They poke the stick into a hole where a small mammal might be hiding, causing the frightened creature to bolt and become an easy prey item."},{"question":"What band is Eddie Hazel from?

The skies were a bit overcast and the water was a bit cold and so there weren't very many visitors to the shore on this particular day.

It was a barbecue, anyway, his least favorite flavor. Waddling around a bit farther he explored closer to the picnic benches that usually bustled with families but nothing too tasty jumped out at him. There was part of a hot dog bun with a little ketchup left on it, but that's hardly a meal for a bird, especially not one as discerning as Barry.Oh well, Barry thought to himself, \\"Sometimes the bird gets the worm, and sometimes the worm gets away.\\" Hopping around a bit more he saw some Seagull friends in the sky circling something. With his curiosity piqued he took a few hesitant steps and blasted himself into the air. Well, he almost made it. His right wing was bruised from a run-in with a light pole and still didn't work quite right. After a few false starts and a few less-than-graceful squawks, he was airborne.Joining his friends, he tried to see what they were looking at but couldn't make anything out. \\"Hey guys, what's going on up here?\\" Barry asked.All the seagulls ignored him but Jeff.

Today, it’s a daily reality for millions. The sudden shift to remote work had enormous ripple effects, not least of which was our changed perception of what work should be: a more flexible, sustainable pursuit that we have control over, rather than the other way around. Since Covid, many employees have come to expect more from their jobs — more days off, in the form of four-day work weeks; more options for where to live; even more opportunities to make the world a better place.

Zareb reveals how he was trained by the best coaches in martial arts and how he plans to grow the Hanlon Empire. He also discusses his support for rebellions against dictators and his weapon supplies to third world countries. Zareb's cousin, Aidan, challenges his leadership of the company. Alexander Owen advises him to talk privately with Zareb. Don’t write more than 400 words.","answer":"Nursed back to health by doctors who adopted him feeling like they found their child back in the form of Zareb who they lost during a car accident in 2004, Zareb arrives at his new home in the UK and is sent to meet his Grandfather who is impatiently waiting for him. Zareb takes in the splendor of the mansion he’s entering. The wait-staff bow to him as they welcome the adopted heir to the Hanlon Empire. Diana Scott continued her interview of Zareb Hanlon, asking him about how his life changed after meeting his grandfather and growing up under his care. Zareb indulged deeper in his memories and disclosed how it was his grandfather who taught him the importance of keeping the family first and taking care of everybody under his wing. It was Connor Hanlon, Zareb’s grandfather who groomed Zareb and trained him to be a cutthroat competitor in business and made sure Zareb’s personality was better than the best. Connor Hanlon made him train from the best coaches in Mix Martial Arts and Krav Maga, even Connor McGregor trained alongside Zareb. The interviewer inquired about the future plans Zareb holds for the company and how he wants the distillery and wing companies to grow. She hints about undercover businesses Zareb has which he negates saying that the competitors need to meet him in the market and not fabricate rumors and lies about him. He wanted to rule the world when he stepped into the business and that is exactly what he will do. Zareb goes home that day to his wife who sticks by every decision he makes and is there for him like a rock. He discusses the weapon supplies to third-world countries and supports rebellions to overthrow dictators. A strong man sat on the table with Aidan Hanlon, a hot head and Zareb’s cousin. This man was Alexander Owen, coming from a troubled past but setting himself up as the one man Zareb relies on. Aidan does not like Zareb leading the company considering he was adopted and feels that it is his right. He made it clear when Hanlon Holdings held a board meeting and Alexander advised him to talk privately to Zareb as he always puts family first and will respect what Aidan has to say. Aidan had other plans and did not care about honoring Zareb.

My character may have a little more time to prepare their case due to the extensive ceremonial rituals involved before the trial can proceed. Help me think up some of those rituals and how they might be manipulated to give the protagonist more time. You can be creative with the details.","answer":"No problem. I have generated some possible ceremonial rituals for your story. I have also considered how they might be manipulated to give your protagonist more time to gather evidence.1. The Appointment of the Jurors: Before the trial can begin, the jurors must be appointed. This is an elaborate process by which the eligible elders must present themselves and assent to their duty or recuse themselves. It can potentially be much more time-consuming if the eligible jurors are absent, say due to an illness or a distraction in the square.2. The Assent of the Judge: The judge must agree to the jurors that have been appointed. This is normally a quick formality, but it could be a significant roadblock if the judge refuses to accept certain jurors. This could be out of an expectation that they recuse themselves, for example in the event that the elder in question is supportive of your protagonist and thus may be biased. 3. Prayers to Goddess of Justice: Prayers to the Goddess of Justice must be performed before every day of court. Most of the time this is a relatively brief affair, lasting no more than 15 minutes, but there is an extended version of the prayer that can take up to two hours.4. Purification of the Court: The grounds of the courtroom must be purified with special incense. This is normally in abundance as it is from the neighboring city of D'larn, but perhaps recent trade disruptions have made the supply irregular, even scarce. Court proceedings surely could not continue without the incense, giving your protagonist more time. 5. Demonstration of Punishments: In order to impress upon the jury the weight of their decision, a demonstration of the maximum punishment that may be meted out by the court is performed. This however can be delayed or even prevented if the instruments or actors assigned to take part in such a demonstration are nowhere to be found.

Sedimentary Rocks:  These rocks are made from smaller pieces of existing rock or organic materials. There are three kinds: rocks formed from small pieces of other rocks, rocks made from  compressed plants and shells, and rocks created when dissolved minerals in water evaporate.2. Metamorphic Rocks: These rocks change due to high heat or pressure. There are two types: rocks with minerals lined up in layers and rocks without a layered appearance. Examples include gneiss, marble, and quartzite.3. Igneous Rocks: These rocks are formed when hot material cools and hardens. There are two categories: rocks formed inside the Earth and rocks formed outside or on top of the Earth's surface. Examples include granite and diorite (formed inside the Earth) and basalt and obsidian (formed outside the Earth).

The story should be written for an audience of children. The story does not need an ending at this point. Write in the 3rd person.","answer":"Kevin and his dog were best friends. They ran together, played together, and slept together. Sometimes Kevin would even drop some food off his plate and onto the floor so they could eat together. Kevin was a bit shy, and he didn't make many friends at school. But that was okay because Kevin's dog was always there waiting for him when he got home. They'd go outside and throw the ball or go on walks. And then they'd come inside and curl up on the couch. Kevin loved his dog more than anything else in the whole world.One day Kevin and his dog decided to go for a walk in the woods. Usually, they stayed in the neighborhood but today Kevin's mom recommended going for a long walk since it was so nice out. And Kevin knew that his dog would love to go explore the woods. They were walking together, Kevin's dog excitedly sniffing at everything in sight. Kevin loved how happy his dog was. Seeing his tail wag always made Kevin feel better.They got to a turn in the trail when the dog suddenly stopped, pointing off into the woods. Kevin stopped beside him and looked out. \\"What do you see buddy?\\" Kevin asked. A slight crunch of the leaves and a deer shot out from behind a tree. Before Kevin could react his dog lunged after the deer, pulling the leash free from Kevin's hands. Kevin tried to hand on but he couldn't.

Talk about its impact in modern times and discuss the symbolism of Nurse Ratched, RP McMurphy and the other patients. Give it a score from 1 to 10 at the end and explain why. ","answer":"*Summary*When Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) gets transferred from a prison farm to a mental institution for a psychiatric evaluation, he is hoping it will be a less restrictive environment. But the shrewish Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) runs the psychiatric ward with an iron fist, keeping her patients subdued through abuse, medication, and sessions of electro-shock therapy. A battle of wills between the rebellious McMurphy and the inflexible Ratched soon affects the behavior of all the ward's patients.*Review portion* This movie does an excellent job of accurately portraying life in a mental institution. You can see that some of the rules were more lenient, even well over 40 years ago. The patients were allowed to smoke in the buildings, (would be disallowed now but many patients aren't allowed to smoke at all while in a mental facility) they were allowed to be outside but some locations do not allow for that. The story revolves around McMurphy (as well as Nurse Ratched) and so does most of the symbolism and the points that the movie is trying to make. McMurphy is transferred from a prison facility at his discretion because he chooses the mental institution and thinks it's an easier way to serve the sentence that he has left. He is quick to realize that the rules and environment aren't as cushy as he believed, while also building genuine camaraderie with the patients. His special bond with Chief is felt but comes to an apex when Chief reveals to him that he can talk, one of the highlights of the film. McMurphy also catches on to Nurse Ratched's intentions to cause chaos and discord early on and tries to make her life hell because he realizes what she is doing. She also intentionally tries to hide it and play coy when people realize she is doing it.

In my previous articles, I’ve tried to articulate my stance towards legacy vs sunbelt markets, concluding that I don’t see either as significantly positioned. While legacy markets will see lower demand, this will be counter-balanced by lower supply. Sunbelt markets on the other hand, will see some of the highest levels of supply ever, but this will be offset by an influx of people and jobs. For my detailed outlook on the Sunbelt, check out my article on BSR REIT (OTCPK:BSRTF). Today I want to cover Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) which is a high-quality REIT, regarded by many as the safest one to invest into right now.Why do so many investors like it? It’s quite simple. Its geographical presence is heavily focused on growing markets in the Sunbelt, with their largest markets being Atlanta (13%), Dallas (10%), and Tampa (7%). This could also be considered the biggest risk as the supply is really high and demand might slow down in the future but I personally don't see it as a threat since the demand seems to be keeping up so far. The REIT owns high quality buildings as 92% of the portfolio is classified as A- or better. This corresponds with the fact that they tend to focus on higher income individuals with average rents amongst the highest of any residential REITs.Last year, as well as at the start of 2023, has been great for MAA as they managed to retain high occupancy of 95.5% and their rents increased by 13.5% fueled by inflation. Management is expecting these positive trends to continue in all of 2023, forecasting 6.25% revenue growth on the whole portfolio and a matching NOI growth. Occupancy is expected to tick up slightly to 95.8% at midpoint. That’s a really positive outlook at a time when the share price, as we’ll see shortly, is very low. The point I want to make clear is that MAA has grown their cash-flows by double digits last year, and is on its way to continue growing, though at a slower pace, also this year. Per share, 2023 FFO is expected at 9.11 at midpoint which would represent a 7% YoY growth.","answer":"Q: What is your stance towards legacy vs sunbelt markets?A: My stance is neutral as I believe both markets are equally positioned. Legacy markets will experience lower demand counter-balanced by lower supply, while Sunbelt markets will see high levels of supply offset by an influx of people and jobs.Q: Which specific REIT are you discussing today?A: Today, I'm discussing Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA), which is considered a high-quality, safe REIT to invest in.Q: Why do many investors favor Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)?A: Investors favor MAA due to its focus on growing markets in the Sunbelt region, with a significant presence in Atlanta, Dallas, and Tampa. Additionally, it boasts a portfolio of high-quality buildings, with 92% classified as A- or better.Q: How did MAA perform last year and what's the expectation for 2023?A: MAA performed well, maintaining a high occupancy of 95.5% and increasing rents by 13.5% due to inflation. For 2023, management forecasts 6.25% revenue growth, a similar NOI growth, and a slight increase in occupancy to 95.8%.Q: What was MAA's cash-flow growth last year and what's the forecast for 2023?A: MAA saw double-digit cash-flow growth last year. In 2023, though growth is expected to slow down, they still expect an increase. The forecasted 2023 FFO per share is 9.11, representing 7% YoY growth."},{"question":"Rewrite this detailed account of Ted Breaux's efforts to recreate authentic absinthe in a 19th-century French distillery into a suspense filled tale of a man trying to unlock a long-lost secret recipe.By Ted Breaux's estimate, there are only a few dozen people alive who have had the opportunity to taste authentic absinthe, the drink whose notoriety defined the Belle Epoque and which had been banned in many countries for almost a century. It is a number that he is determined to increase. On a crisp, clear fall morning, he greeted me at the Combier distillery, in Saumur, in France's Loire Valley. It is here that Breaux, a thirty-nine-year-old environmental chemist from Louisiana, is trying to reverse-engineer absinthe, precisely as it was made a hundred years ago.In the near distance, the towers of Saumur's castle rose above the slate roofs of the town like an image from a medieval Book of Hours. On the street outside, a pair of young men in military fatigues and black berets cycled past before disappearing into the dressage yards of the adjacent Cadre Noir, the elite equestrian academy that has taught the French cavalry since the eighteenth century. Across the way stood the commandant's house, an elegant Second Empire building cordoned off from the street with pink and red roses.Like the castle and the Cadre Noir, the distillery, whose interior was designed by Gustave Eiffel, is a survivor from an earlier age. Breaux refers to it as \\"the Temple,\\" and, as he took me past pallets of empty bottles and a row of potted lemon tees, there was certainly a resemblance to sacred architecture: one of the region's Romanesque chapels, perhaps, with their pale limestone walls and vaulted ceilings. The narrow doorway was surmounted by a rose window, and graceful arched windows ran along one wall beneath a steep slate roof. Instead of incense, the air was heavy with the aromas of anise, fennel, and lucerne and the sharp tang of alcohol. Breaux was preparing to distill a batch of his Verte Suisse 65, one of three that he makes based on vintage recipes.The distillery was built in 1834, and though various features have been added, all its significant equipment predates the twentieth century. \\"It's an anachronism,\\" Breaux said. Inside, it looks like something from a Jules Verne novel. A spaghetti tangle of pipes and tubes emerges from two rows of bulbous copper alembics that line the walls on either side. The stills were acquired in 1920, after the breakup of the Pernod Fils absinthe distillery in Pontarlier, in the French Jura, once the centre of the absinthe industry. The Combier distillery is, literally, a museum; Breaux, who distils there every few months, has access to it in return for a small commission on every bottle he produces. During distillation, an occasional group of tourists wanders through, admiring the alembics. When I visited, sacks of herbs were stacked in every available space; there was a container of grape alcohol the size of a small car, and an electric pump. Near the entrance stood an immense plastic tub of wormwood, absinthe's distinctive and contentious constituent, which, since the late nineteenth century, was held to cause insanity. Down the center of the room, suspended fifteen feet above the floor, ran a wrought-iron passerelle, or walkway, whose lacy gold-and-maroon ironwork clearly bore the signature of Gustave Eiffel. Since Combier began operating, techniques of distillation have moved on to embrace new technologies such as mechanized mixing and electronic temperature and pressure controls. But obsolescence is precisely what Breaux wants.","answer":"In the mysterious world of spirits, authentic absinthe – the infamously potent beverage that charmed the Belle Epoque – has been shrouded in a veil of obscurity for nearly a century. Today, only a handful of living souls have had the chance to taste this legendary concoction. But there's a man, a man named Ted Breaux, who is on a mission to lift that veil.Under the vivid canvas of a fall morning, we found ourselves at the gateway of the Combier distillery, situated in the charming Loire Valley of France. Breaux, a chemist by profession and Louisiana by origin, was there, embarking on a daring journey. His quest? To resurrect absinthe, just as it was crafted a century ago. The silhouette of Saumur's castle loomed majestically against the skyline, a spectacle reminiscent of a scene from a medieval manuscript. Beyond, the rhythmic pedalling of youthful soldiers in dark berets echoed through the streets, their destination - the hallowed Cadre Noir, a prestigious equestrian academy steeped in French military history. Amidst this backdrop of history and elegance, a quaint Second Empire building adorned with blooming roses stood defiantly – the commandant's abode.Inside the distillery, lovingly referred to as \\"the Temple\\" by Breaux, one could feel an atmosphere akin to a sacred sanctuary. The intricate designs by Gustave Eiffel, the aged limestone walls, and high vaulted ceilings lent an ethereal quality to the structure. The air within the temple was thick with intoxicating fragrances of anise, fennel, and lucerne, underpinned by the potent aroma of alcohol. Breaux was on the verge of distilling his Verte Suisse 65, one of the three vintage recipes he was attempting to reincarnate.The distillery, a timeless testament from 1834, was a labyrinth of intricate copper alembics and labyrinthine piping, an ambiance that would befit a Jules Verne narrative. Breaux, in a reciprocal arrangement with the owners, was allowed to utilize this living museum. Amid the chaotic arrangement of sacks of herbs and vast containers of alcohol, Breaux was focused on his mission – unlocking the secret recipe of authentic absinthe. The heart of absinthe, wormwood, known for its controversial reputation of inducing insanity, lay in an enormous plastic tub near the entrance.The distillery was a relic of a bygone era, untouched by modern innovations in distillation technology. But for Breaux, this was perfect. After all, he was not looking to the future; his mission was anchored in the past – in the resurrection of a long-lost secret."},{"question":"Write an editorial letter to Michael providing feedback for his manuscript, No One Can.

It should include three paragraphs, and one of those should include bullet points.","answer":"For the long-haul truck driver, the semi-tractor is a home away from home. As such, it should be comfortable and cozy, which means that it also needs to be well-organized to store the necessities and the little extras that give a big rig the home touch. There are a number of ways to achieve this.Organization comes in many forms, but you'll be sure to find the following items invaluable:* Command hooks: They are removable and can be relocated to a position that works best in the cab; they're useful for hanging caps, belts, and towels to dry.* Over-the-door shoe storage: The pockets are perfect for toiletries, spare water bottles or soda cans, and all types of snack storage.* Plastic storage containers: These take the place of your house bedroom's dresser drawers. You can also get appropriately sized containers for extra supplies, such as paper and pens.* Shower caddies: Not only can these be used for grabbing quickly to take to the showers, but they can hold your eating utensils, spices, and a variety of kitchen items.* Spring-tension curtain or shower curtain rods: There is usually some unused vertical space in a semi, so these can create extra space for hanging clothes and jackets, or you can even use them to hang a curtain to hide what's being stored on an unused upper bunk.* Back-of-the-seat organizers: You really can't go wrong with extra pockets everywhere!* Sticker labels: Be sure to label everything so that you're not constantly searching for what you need.Be sure that you're taking a piece of home with you on the road. A cell phone and a laptop are musts. Use comfortable bedding, and even invest in a good mattress to ensure you stay well-rested. Pictures of your family are a nice touch, and many truckers even travel with a furry companion. It's up to the individual to decide what makes a \\"home away from home,\\" but the good news is that it's entirely possible to spend time on the road with many of the comforts of home."},{"question":"Extract from the article the actresses who are expected to appear during the MTV Movie and TV Awards into a starred list in alphabetical order by surname.

For example, a tree in a humid environment will need less water than a dry environment and in the summer trees need more water than they do in the winter due to heat and sun.  A good rule of thumb is to water the tree when the soil becomes dry in the top 1-2 inches of the soil. To test how often to water in any given season, water the tree thoroughly and check it daily by poking your finger into the soil to test for dryness. Once dry, water again. You may find that in hot summer months, you need to water your tree 2-3 a week, while in the winter, watering may be required much less frequently. Pay attention to your tree and monitor it for signs of over or under-watering. If you notice yellowing or spotted leaves these may be symptoms of poor health. To give your tree the best care for your area and environment, consult a local nursery on the best way to properly care for your tree.

One brown and one pale blue. The pale blue eye would occasionally roll around or look in a different direction to the brown one. Herb shuddered. The rain had trickled under his collar, soaking him through. Waiting for the bus in the rain, eh Herb, he thought. When did my life come to this? The eye was really rolling around now.

Talk about different fabrics and running surfaces.","answer":"Running is a fantastic sport to get into as it requires very little equipment to get started! To make your entry into running more comfortable, I would recommend you consider a few items to get you on the right track.There are two main things you need when you're running: running shoes and comfortable clothing.When you're out for a run, you want to be fully immersed in the experience, without your clothes causing distraction or discomfort. Although you can feel free to wear anything you choose when you're running, it is advisable to wear clothes that are designed for the purpose.The two main attributes to look for in running gear are chafe-free and constriction-free. Chafe-free fabric is essential for high-friction areas such as underarms and thighs. You should aim to purchase some lightweight, moisture-wicking clothing to avoid discomfort.Purchasing constriction-free designs applies to both footwear and clothing. Overly tight footwear will become painful very quickly and constrictive clothing can cause chaffing and further distraction in the elements.When deciding on footwear, it is important to assess what surface you will be running on. Is it a trail or a woodland path? Or will you be pounding the pavements of a city? Once you have ascertained your running route, aim to purchase the correct running sneakers that are built for your chosen surface. By considering this, you will be further protected against injury and discomfort. "},{"question":"You are a Major League Baseball season ticket holder and heckler for over 20 years.

What are some possible causes?","answer":"Low fantasy settings are known for their more realistic scenarios, where magic and the supernatural are not as widespread or pervasive. As such, here are some possible causes of war in your setting:1. Territorial claims: Perhaps the recent succession of a ruler or the annulment of a marriage has made the ownership of a desirable territory disputed. Perhaps it is not the desirability of the territory, but rather the political situation that necessitates war. One nation, out of concern for how others may perceive them if they do not enforce their claims, feels obligated to act aggressively. 2. Resources: A magical catalyst essential in the production of vital medicines is available in a key region. Ownership of it would prolong the rule and the perceived stability of the nation's leadership who controls it. 3. Preemptive strike: The rapid economic growth of one nation has stoked fears that they will soon rearm and build a mighty military. The other nation believes they must be stopped before that can come to pass.4. Buffer state: Out of fears that another, larger empire would consume one of the nations and use them as a staging area for an invasion, one nation feels it is necessary to invade them to set up a buffer state that is friendly to their interests.What do you think?

Either turn the clock around or put it out of sight. Obsessing about how much time you have left to sleep can be a major distraction. *Wind Down with a RoutineSet a fixed routine before bed to signal your brain that it's time to call it a night. Try taking a bath, reading, or doing some light stretching to get your body and mind ready for sleep.*Sleep-Friendly FoodsWhat you eat can impact your sleep quality. Avoid sugary, or spicy foods before bed. They can cause indigestion, especially in heavy foods. Go for sleep-friendly snacks like bananas, almonds, or a warm cup of chamomile tea.*Nap SmartIf you don't want to throw off your nightly sleep schedule, timing your naps during the day is key. Don’t nap too late in the day or for too long. Keeping naps around 20-30 minutes can help you feel refreshed without interfering with your nighttime sleep.*Boo BustersEncourage your kids to think of a brave, confident superhero who can fight off any nighttime fears that might come their way.

Explain why someone may be afraid of these things. Also, please explain if phobias can be cured. ","answer":"In the world of mental health and wellness, phobias are considered a kind of anxiety disorder that can cause someone to have an extreme fear of places, objects, animals, people, situations, and things. The fears are often irrational and difficult to explain, but exposure to the subject of a phobia can cause severe reactions, like the urge to run away or lash out violently. Some phobias are more widely accepted and well-known than others. Arachnophobia, for instance, is the extreme fear of spiders, and it affects up to 15 percent of the world’s population. Other common phobias include ophidiophobia (the fear of snakes), acrophobia (the fear of heights), and cynophobia (the fear of dogs). Some phobias, while uncommon, are still real and scary to the people that suffer from them. Five lesser-known phobias include: •\\tAlektorophobia (the fear of chickens). •\\tGlobophobia (the fear of balloons). •\\tPodophobia (the fear of feet). •\\tPedophobia (the fear of small children)•\\tPhobophobia (the fear of fear) While some phobias may seem strange or silly to other people, they are often a source of extreme anxiety and insecurity for sufferers. The cause of each phobia can vary depending on the person. While some may have had negative experiences that caused extreme fear, others could associate their general anxiety disorder with a specific phobia because their brain latches onto that fear at the moment. Through psychotherapy and consistent behavioral therapy, most phobias can be either completely cured or lessened. The sufferer has to be dedicated to finding treatment and healing from their fears. There’s no linear method of treatment since every phobia sufferer is different and has different reasons for the fear that they feel. In most cases, exposure therapy is a method of overcoming any phobia. This means that a sufferer has to get comfortable with the object of their fear before they can heal and overcome their phobia. In other cases, anxiety medications can help lessen the extreme fear and visceral reactions associated with certain phobias.

Hummingbirds have compact, strongly muscled bodies and rather long, bladelike wings that, unlike the wings of other birds, articulate (connect) to the body only from the shoulder joint. The architecture of the wing permits hummingbirds to fly not only forward but also straight up and down, sideways, and backward and to hover in front of flowers as they obtain nectar and insects from them. The rate at which a hummingbird beats its wings is the same during directional and hovering flight. It varies with the size of the bird—the larger the bird, the lower the rate. Consequently, the smallest hummingbirds have extremely rapid wing-beat rates. In Calliphlox amethystina, one of the tiniest species, the male has a wing-beat rate of about 80 per second; the female, which is larger, beats her wings at a rate of about 60 times per second. The ruby-throated hummingbird has a wing-beat rate of about 70 per second in the male and about 50 per second in the female. The rate is much lower in the larger hummingbirds; the giant hummingbird, for example, beats its wings only about 10 times per second. In fact, the larger hummingbirds appear to beat their wings more slowly than do other birds of comparable size.","answer":"Various hummingbird species beat their wings at different speeds. The larger the hummingbird, the slower the speed of the wings; therefore, the smallest hummingbird's wings flap the fastest. Within the smallest species of hummingbirds, the males' wings beat faster as they are smaller than the females.

Caffeine is love. Caffeine is life! There are so many forms of it. I can't get enough! Sometimes it makes me all dizzy and such. But man, the rush of being fueled is like nothing else!Let's start with the basics and move up from there. Hahah. I get giddy thinking about all the forms of caffeine. Let me make another pot, and we'll get started!• Trace amounts (0-10mg): decaffeinated coffee or tea. These will still have a tiny bit, but maybe 5% of the caffeine of a cup's worth. I never drink this stuff!• Baby mode (10-20mg): chocolate and tea. Both of them contain some morsels of caffeine, it's true. Those sensitive to the stuff should probably stay away. Who knew a Hershey's bar could give you a buzz?• Startin' to feel it (20-60mg): black teas, chai, and a few others. Not as strong as the old bean juice, but might do something for ya! This is the kind of stuff I drink when winding down for the day. Haha!• The real stuff (70-150mg): coffee! Pretty much a baseline of measurement for caffeine with 80-120mg of caffeine per cup. It's about the same in serving amounts for espresso, iced coffee, Americanos, and lattes.• Harder. Stronger (150-230mg): stronger coffee! Coffee, such as the way Starbucks brews it, is made with less water and will have more caffeine. Also, cold brews (the ones you sit in the fridge overnight) will be around this range too. Yum!• Kickin' and Screamin'! (250-400mg): the strongest energy drinks will reach this. For example, a 24 oz big can of Monster will have 240mg! A 16 oz can of Bang Energy is 300mg as well! Now that'll be a rush!• Carl's Choice (400-500mg+): Kaffn8 Liquified Caffeine contains 300 mg in only 1 oz of drink! Take 1-2 of these and you'll be livin' fast! It probably will cause you some nausea, headache, or dizziness. But I love livin' life like that, baby!

The invention of the microscope led to the discovery of the cell by Hooke. While looking at cork, Hooke observed box-shaped structures, which he called “cells” as they reminded him of the cells, or rooms, in monasteries. This discovery led to the development of the classical cell theory.The classical cell theory was proposed by Theodor Schwann in 1839. There are three parts to this theory. The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part states that cells are the basic units of life. These parts were based on a conclusion made by Schwann and Matthias Schleiden in 1838, after comparing their observations of plant and animal cells. The third part, which asserts that cells come from preexisting cells that have multiplied, was described by Rudolf Virchow in 1858, when he stated omnis cellula e cellula (all cells come from cells).Since the formation of classical cell theory, technology has improved, allowing for more detailed observations that have led to new discoveries about cells. These findings led to the formation of the modern cell theory, which has three main additions: first, that DNA is passed between cells during cell division; second, that the cells of all organisms within a similar species are mostly the same, both structurally and chemically; and finally, that energy flow occurs within cells.","answer":"[Intro Music]Host: Welcome back, listeners, to another episode of \\"Science Talks.\\" I am your host, Madeline, and today we will start off on a fascinating journey through the history of cellular biology. We'll explore the groundbreaking discoveries that shaped our understanding of cells and meet experts who have helped revolutionize this field of biology. So, grab a snack, sit back, and get ready for a mind-blowing episode. [Background Music]Host: Our story begins in the year 1665 when a brilliant scientist named Robert Hooke forever changed our perception of the microscopic world. Hooke published a remarkable book called Micrographia, where he meticulously documented the organism he observed using the newly invented microscope. Joining us today is Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned expert in cell biology. Dr. Thompson, could you tell us more about Robert Hooke's groundbreaking work?Dr. Thompson: Absolutely, Madeline. Hooke's observations were truly revolutionary. While examining a piece of cork, he noticed small box-shaped structures that reminded him of the tiny rooms in monasteries. These structures, which he called \\"cells,\\" became the foundation of his discovery. Hooke's incredible observation led to the birth of the classical cell theory.Host: Fascinating! So, what exactly is the classical cell theory and who proposed it?Dr. Thompson: The classical cell theory was proposed by Theodor Schwann in 1839. It consists of three fundamental parts. The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part emphasizes that cells are the basic unit of life. Schwann and Matthias Schleiden reached these conclusions in 1838, following their extensive observations of plant and animal cells. The third part, known as \\"omnis cellula e cellula\\" or \\"all cells come from cells,\\" was described by Rudolf Virchow in 1858.Host: That's incredible! The classical cell theory laid the groundwork for our understanding of cells. But how has technology advanced since then?Dr. Thompson: Great question, Madeline. Technological advancement has played a pivotal role in our continued exploration of cells. With improved tools and techniques, scientists have made astonishing discoveries, leading to the formulation of the modern cell theory.Host: And what are the key additions to the modern cell theory?Dr. Thompson: The modern cell theory encompasses three main additions. First, we now know that DNA is passed between cells during cell division, facilitating the transfer of genetic information. Second, cells within species are largely similar structurally an chemically, underscoring the unity of life. And finally, energy flow occurs within cells, which is crucial for their functioning and survival.Host: Fascinating, Dr. Thompson! These new discoveries have undoubtedly expanded our knowledge of cells. But could you give us a glimpse into how these breakthroughs have influenced other scientific disciplines or even everyday life?Dr. Thompson: Certainly! Our understanding of cells has profound implications across various fields. It has revolutionized medicine, enabling us to develop targeted therapies for diseases, such as cancer. Cell biology has also shed light on developmental processes, helping us understand how life unfolds from a single cell to a complex organism. Furthermore, advancements in cellular research have given rise to biotechnology, allowing us to engineer cells for various applications, such as the production of medicines and sustainable fuels.Host: And there you have it, folks- the captivating story of cells, from Robert Hooke's Micrographia to the modern cell theory. We owe a debt of gratitude to these brilliant scientists who have explored the unseen and unravelled the mysteries of life.Remember to tune in next time as we dive into another riveting scientific topic. Until then, keep asking questions, keep exploring, and keep expanding the boundaries of knowledge.[Outro Music]Host: This has been \\"Science Talks\\" with your host Madeline.

I will be flying with friends, so you can include them in some of your ideas if necessary. The plane does not have in-flight entertainment. Format your answer as a numbered list of 15 ideas. Title each idea in a few words and then include a small description and/or examples if necessary. Each number on the list should contain 25-65 words total.","answer":"1. Do crafts. Doing an artistic hobby on board your flight is a great way to pass time. Consider bringing tools for drawing, knitting, or crocheting. 2. Write in your journal. Your flight makes a great time to reflect on your past, upcoming events, and your internal thoughts and emotions. If you aren't into keeping diary-style entries, you can also use journals for brainstorming, freewriting, or creative writing such as poetry. You could also write a letter to a friend while you are flying. 3. Organize your trip. While on the plane, make a vague outline of events and attractions that you will visit once you arrive at your new location. 4. Watch a film or a TV show. Even if your plane does not have in-flight entertainment, you can still pass time on your flight by watching a movie or TV series on your smartphone or a tablet if you have one.5. Listen to music. Listening to music will keep you somewhat occupied and makes a great activity to combine with something else, such as making crafts or journaling. Choosing to listen to new and unfamiliar music can make a great choice for keeping yourself more entertained.6. Use an app. If you have your phone available, use an app to keep you entertained on the flight. You can play games, scroll social media, manage your finances, or organize your email. Some apps require internet to use, which is not available on all flights. It typically costs money to connect to in-flight wifi.7. Read a book. Whether you prefer classic print on paper, e-readers, or using the Kindle app on your iPad, reading a book on your flight is a great way to help time pass by more quickly. Bonus points if the book is particularly suspenseful or otherwise works well to hold your attention.8. Do skincare. Planes have extremely dry air and this can dry out your skin. Your flight makes a great time to use a face mask, apply moisturizers, or do other small and simple skincare treatments. Avoid bringing any products that must be rinsed off.9. Take pictures out the window of the plane. If you have a window seat, taking pictures of the ground from your bird's-eye viewpoint can allow you to capture some very interesting moments in time. This suggestion is not as good for overnight flights, those not sat in window seats, or those who are flying over mostly water.10. Get productive. If you can do so, complete some work for your job or potentially for school assignments while on your flight. This will help pass time and has the bonus of giving you a sense of accomplishment once you are done.11. Chat with your neighbor. Whether it be friends or strangers, your seatmates on a flight can be a great source of entertainment if you are the social type. Talking to others on your flight can pass time and gives you insights into the lives of others, which can help you foster more empathy.12. Listen to a podcast. Podcasts are a great option for killing time on a flight. The topics of podcasts can be informational, scientific, spiritual, comedic, or pure entertainment. 13. Learn the local language. Using podcasts, apps, or pocket-sized guidebooks, you can attempt to learn the local language of the place you are visiting. Some helpful words include thank you, please, sorry, hello, yes, no, you're welcome, and goodbye.14. Play a game. If you have friends sitting near you on your flight, one great way to pass time is by playing games. Some examples of games that are great for flights include word games and card games.15. Move around. If you are comfortable, walk around on your flight a little bit to stretch your legs. This can improve blood flow and will prevent you from feeling as stiff upon landing."},{"question":"Can you give me a list of at least 3 different video ideas relating to exoplanets and the hunt for alien life?","answer":"1.

The height of the doors was intimidating; they were designed for the tall Kardillean forms to fit through. At least she wouldn’t bump her head on any of the frames here. Jennifer was taller than most people she knew, something that had always embarrassed her, but maybe that was a good thing now that she had been called to duty as firstborn. She could never blend in with the aliens that had taken over the world and demanded the firstborn of every family in servitude against its endless war with another species that wanted to steal her planet. She did have pale, milky skin, though, closer to theirs than most of her people with their golden tans.3.\\tBree really didn’t understand the point of making a firstborn walk over three miles on foot to the Kardille intake center. It was bad enough that every family had to give up their oldest kid to the aliens who had taken over their world. Why not make it just a little easier to be ripped away from everyone she loved? She pushed black hair out of her eyes and sighed as she surveyed the road. She was strong and muscular so the exercise wouldn’t kill her. The road was pretty smooth at least. It was just too bad there wasn’t any traffic going in her direction. All she could do was just keep walking and try not to think about the fact that she was going to fight a war that wasn’t hers against some other alien species that might be worse than the one they already had."},{"question":"My name is James.","answer":"Hello James.

","answer":"There are a few different ways that you can try to promote hair growth so that it grows strong and quickly. I've listed a few things to try below:- Make sure you are eating enough vitamins and minerals and getting the nutrition your body needs. If you are on a restrictive diet, it may hinder your hair growth as your body will need to focus on more important bodily functions as opposed to hair growth. - Using topical products that contain caffeine may help to stimulate hair growth as well as prevent hair loss. - Try using essential oil mixtures on your hair. There is some research that may support the effectiveness of some essential oils on hair growth and preventing hair loss including rosemary, pumpkin seed oil, peppermint oil, jojoba oil, and lavender oil. - Massaging your scalp may help to stimulate blood flow to the area and can lead to thicker, stronger hair. - Avoid using styling tools frequently that use heat such as flat irons, hair dryers, and curling irons, as they can damage your hair. You may want to try one of the aforementioned techniques at a time to see what will be most beneficial to your hair's health and growth.

Tell me three stories from Greek or Roman times that are considered legends or folklore. Give me a short summary of each","answer":"Mythology is taken from the Grecian words for mythos and logos, meaning the story of people through word or voice. They are often tales about culture and human emotions and conditions, passed down through generations and retold hundreds of thousands of times. Some mythologies are fables in that they teach lessons, while others are explanations to explain things like death, love, life, and the universe. Two of the most well-known cultures for mythologies are Greek and Roman. They often spoke of Gods, Goddesses, Titans, and Heroes. You’ve probably seen many of those cultures’ mythologies played out in modern books and movies. Hercules, for instance, is based on Grecian mythology, told, and retold, over centuries. Here are three more instances of Greek or Roman myths. •\\tThe Three Fated Sisters of Life and DeathClotho, Lachesis, and Atropos were three sisters, tasked with weaving the fates of both humans and gods. While Clotho spins the thread of life from someone’s birth, like an origin story, Lachesis is responsible for the continuation of the thread through life’s ups and downs. The latter measures the length of the thread to determine the longevity of the fated person. Finally, Atropos cuts the thread, foreseeing how someone will die. •\\tThe Weaving Wars of Athena and Arachne Arachne was a weaver, and she could create elaborate quilts and tapestries from simple threads. Radiant in her confidence, she challenged Athena, the goddess of the arts, to a weaving contest, and the goddess accepted. However, where Athena wove a tapestry that portrayed her hard-fought battle with Poseidon, Arachne mocked Athena with a woven tapestry of Zeus (Athena’s father) up to his naughty antics. Athena took great offense, turning Arachne into a spider, cursed to hang forever in her woven webs. •\\tThe Curse of the Bee’s Sting Humans have always taken a liking to honey, much to the chagrin of Bee, a hive queen in Rome. She journeyed to Mount Olympus, seeking counsel with Jupiter, to ask him to give her a stinger that would be so toxic that it would kill humans that stole her honey. Jupiter had a love for the human race, but he had made Bee a promise after tasting her delicious honey. The God King decided to teach her a lesson about wishing for the downfall of others. He granted her request, but at the price that she would die as well if she stung a human.

Appliances and equipment Although there is no single cause that leads to an accidental house fire, there are some common factors that can lead to the accidental eruption of a fire. Appliances and other electrical equipment are some of the leading causes of house fires. Any device that generates heat such as a stove, clothes dryer, or a space heater, or one that will heat up after extended use such as a computer, is a potential fire hazard for your home. Additionally, any cooking vessels left unattended are another frequent cause of house fires. 2. Candles Every candle will have a warning label that states \\"A burning candle should never be left unsupervised\\". However many people will light a scented candle and forget about it until they start to burn uncontrollably. Candle fires are most likely to occur on Christmas Day, New Year's Day, and Christmas Eve. 3. Holiday decor Candles are not the only culprit that can lead to a tragic fire during the holiday season. Christmas tree lights and other decorations are also to blame. Live trees that are not watered properly and left to dry out are another easy target for a fire caused by the hot lights wrapped around them. 4. Electrical systems and devices Any device you own that uses electric power can start a fire and overheated lighting equipment is at the very top of that list. Questionable electrical work within a home, poorly connected circuits, loose wires, and improper grounding all pose a serious threat to homeowners. 5. Smoking Another common cause of house fire is due to negligence while smoking. People will often fall asleep while smoking cigarettes, and by doing so they can set their chairs, bed, or couch on fire. This can easily result in a fatality and cause the entire house to burn down. Another avoidable issue related to smoking is caused by discarding ashes that are still hot into the trash where they could ignite. 6. Chemicals and gasses Home fires can also be caused by sources of propane gas and natural gas. A sudden spark combined with a small leak could create a combustible situation. Improperly mixed household chemicals can also trigger combustion, which is why it's important to conduct this form of activity outside the home. 7. Lightning Lightning fires will most commonly occur during the summer months when afternoon or early evening storms are at their highest. Homes that are in heavily wooded areas are extremely vulnerable to lightning strikes and could set the surrounding area on fire as well.

Ernie is a carnivore, so if you see him please offer him some tasty crickets or something until we arrive.While we were gone for the day, Ernie seems to have figured out how to undo the latch on the top of his cage using a precarious ladder of habitat terrain to reach it. Once free, he looted the house of all the best snacks (without touching any of the healthy ones) and didn't even have the decency to place the recyclable waste in the correct bin. Evidently, he fancied himself a bath and upon finding the restroom, was drawn by the fresh breeze of the open window. The best we can figure from our shredded shower curtain is that he climbed up it, balanced on the pole, and lept out to the tree outside. Where he is now, we have no idea.Please let us know as soon as you see something that may be him.

A medium banana only contains 105 calories, on average. However, more than 90% of a banana is composed of carbs.People generally know that bananas are very nutritious, but many wonder how many calories and carbs they actually contain.This article answers those questions.How many calories are in various sizes of bananas?Bananas contain around 100 calories, but this can vary by the fruit size and how you consume it. Below are the calorie contents of standard banana sizes (1Trusted Source):Extra small (shorter than 6 inches, 81 grams): 72 caloriesSmall (6–7 inches, 101 grams): 90 caloriesMedium (7–8 inches, 118 grams): 105 caloriesLarge (8–9 inches, 136 grams): 121 caloriesExtra large (9 inches or longer, 152 grams): 135 caloriesSliced (1 cup, 150 grams): 134 caloriesMashed (1 cup, 225 grams): 200 caloriesIf you’re unsure about the size of your banana, you can estimate that an average banana contains about 100 calories.About 93% of a banana’s calories come from carbs, 4% from protein, and 3% from fat.SUMMARYThe calorie content of a banana ranges from 72–135 calories depending on its size. An average-sized banana contains about 100 calories.How many carbs are in a banana?Bananas are almost exclusively composed of water and carbs.People who watch their carb intake are interested in knowing the carb content of their food.Here is the carb content of standard banana sizes (1Trusted Source):Extra small (shorter than 6 inches, 81 grams): 19 gramsSmall (6–7 inches, 101 grams): 23 gramsMedium (7–8 inches, 118 grams): 27 gramsLarge (8–9 inches, 136 grams): 31 gramsExtra large (9 inches or longer, 152 grams): 35 gramsSliced (1 cup, 150 grams): 34 gramsMashed (1 cup, 225 grams): 51 gramsA banana also contains 2–4 grams of fiber, depending on its size. You can subtract 2–4 grams if you are looking for the “net” carb content (net carbs = total carbs – fiber).Additionally, a banana’s ripeness may affect its carb content.Generally, green or unripe bananas contain fewer digestible carbs than ripe bananas.SUMMARYAn average-sized banana contains about 25 grams of carbs — maybe even less if the banana is unripe (green).Unripe (green) bananas contain more resistant starchThe main nutrient in bananas is carbs, but the carb composition changes drastically during ripening.Unripe bananas contain high amounts of starch, and some of it is resistant starch (2Trusted Source).Because the starch in a banana is converted to sugar during ripening, yellow bananas contain much less resistant starch than green ones. In fact, the resistant starch content of a fully ripe banana is less than 1% (2Trusted Source).Resistant starch is a type of indigestible carbohydrate that escapes digestion and functions like fiber in the body.It reaches the colon undigested. There, it feeds friendly gut bacteria (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).When the bacteria digest resistant starches, they form gases and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are important for digestive health (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).About 95% of these SCFAs are then rapidly absorbed by the cells in the colon and used by the body for energy (5Trusted Source, 7, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).So although resistant starches will not yield as many calories as regular carbs during digestion, they may be transformed into SCFAs that provide calories later.Therefore, green and yellow bananas may provide similar amounts of calories in the end.SUMMARYUnripe bananas contain high amounts of resistant starch. Resistant starch escapes digestion and feeds the friendly bacteria in your gut, which use it to produce short-chain fatty acids.Bananas contain many other beneficial nutrientsBananas contain good amounts of several vitamins and minerals.One medium banana contains (1Trusted Source):Fiber: 3.1 gramsVitamin B6: 25% of the DVVitamin C: 11% of the DVManganese: 14% of the DVPotassium: 12% of the DVFolate: 6% of the DVRiboflavin (vitamin B2): 5% of the DVBananas are tasty and nutritious. They make an excellent, healthy, and low calorie snack.SUMMARYBananas contain good amounts of fiber, vitamin B6, manganese, vitamin C, folate, and potassium.The bottom lineBananas generally contain 72–135 calories and 19-35 grams of carbs, depending on their size.An average-sized banana contains about 100 calories and 25 grams of carbs.Last medically reviewed on August 3, 2021","answer":"The calorific content of a banana depends on the banana's size. An average-sized banana contains around 100 calories, while an extra-large banana can provide about 135 calories. Bananas are a nutrient-rich fruit and a good source of dietary fiber."},{"question":"Rewrite the following dream. Transform this into a very dark short story where it doesn’t look like mankind will survive. Change it from first person to third person.I dreamed that World War 3 left the whole world in destruction. More people survived than you might think though. They formed groups who would go out looking for food, medicine, and other things they needed. Some groups were very violent and some were just trying to survive. I took my group to Kaufman, Texas to my grandmother’s farm. The soil is very rich there. You can grow anything. The problem was that we had no seeds. We made it safely to Kaufman. We found a large house that had been abandoned and a big lake. I told everyone that we should stay there because we could catch fish to eat and keep looking for seeds.

Article - On September 11, 2001, a devastating act of terrorism unfolded in New York City, forever changing the course of history. This report sheds light on the aftermath of the attacks and the crucial role played by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) in issuing death certificates to honor and remember the victims. By August 16, 2002, a total of 2,726 death certificates related to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks had been filed. The majority of individuals, 2,713 out of 2,726, lost their lives on September 11 itself. However, tragically, 13 people sustained injuries that day and passed away later, with three of them dying in different states. Of the decedents, 77% were males, and 23% were females. The median age of those who perished was 39 years, with the youngest being under 5 years old and the oldest over 80 years.Examining the ethnic composition, 61% of the decedents were non-Hispanic white males, and 15% were non-Hispanic white females. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black individuals accounted for smaller percentages, with 6% and 5% respectively. Asian/Pacific Islander males and females constituted 4% and 2% respectively. A significant proportion, 67%, had completed college or obtained postgraduate education.The impact of this tragedy extended beyond U.S. borders. While 79% of the decedents were born in the 50 U.S. states, a notable 21% were born in other countries, including the United Kingdom, India, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Japan. Regarding residency, 43% were residents of New York City, 22% lived elsewhere in New York state, and 25% resided in New Jersey. A small number, 1%, hailed from foreign nations. Massachusetts, the origin of the hijacked planes, had 90 residents among the victims, while California, the flight destination, had 29.To process the death certificates, the NYCDOHMH worked closely with the NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). Each reported death was classified as a homicide, except for the 10 terrorists involved. The OCME had issued 2,734 death certificates by August 22, 2002. Different identification methods were employed, including DNA analysis, dental radiographs, fingerprints, personal effects, and photographs.This report offers a glimpse into the immense tragedy of September 11, 2001, as well as the resilient efforts made to commemorate and provide closure for the victims. It serves as a solemn reminder of the lasting impact such events have on individuals, communities, and the world.","answer":"I have created a succinct report as requested:  >>>Ethnic Breakdown of Victims in the September 11 AttacksAccording to the article, here is a breakdown of the victims who died in their respective ethnic groups:- Non-Hispanic White Males: 61%- Non-Hispanic White Females: 15%- Hispanic Individuals: 6%- Non-Hispanic Black Individuals: 5%- Asian/Pacific Islander Males: 4%- Asian/Pacific Islander Females: 2%These percentages represent the proportion of victims within each ethnic group.The article also provides additional information about the victims.

It should be written in the second-person and be abstract.","answer":"Waiting for something is the sweetest kind of agony. You want the moment to be here so badly that it causes a rising gush of exhilaration that quickly fades into disappointment because, no matter how hard you wish it into being, the moment isn't here yet, and time won't march on any faster for your impatience. You count the days, will the hours away, and sometimes even count down the minutes.It's that final stretch that continues the cycle of anticipation. You always remember the first experience involving what you wanted. It's imprinted on your heart in a special box of memories that words just can't describe. Those memories aren't even necessarily profound; they're just locked away because when the moment finally arrives—that anticipated thing is finally right in front of you—you're so utterly focused on that one moment, you can't help but remember it for a long while."},{"question":"I would like you to write me a fable about \\"not judging a book by its cover.\\"  I want there to be two main characters, an ant and a gorilla and I don't want it too long so keep under 400 words.","answer":"Once upon a time, there was a very hungry gorilla who lived in the rainforest. It had been very sick and had very little energy. In fact, it had used the last of its strength to gather an armful of guava before it settled down for a much-needed rest. Just as it had settled into its tree for the night, preparing to eat, its precious armful of guavas fell out of its arms and down into the overgrowth below. Dismayed, it reluctantly came down from the tree and began to search the ground below. As it searched, it discovered they had rolled down a drop-off and into some sort of pit. As it reached its arm down into the pit, it had discovered it was much deeper than anticipated as its arm could not feel the bottom and the guavas remained several feet from its reach. Suddenly it began to cry. Just at that moment, a little leafcutter ant came strolling by. Taking pity on the gorilla, it asked it what was wrong. Seeing the little ant, it laughed and told it to go away as there was no way that it could possibly help. The hole was too deep and the leafcutter ant would never be able to help get the guava from such a deep hole. The ant thought for a minute and, seeming to agree with the gorilla, it continued on its way. About twenty minutes later, just as the gorilla had resigned itself to no food for the night, it spotted the little leafcutter ant once again. However, the leafcutter was not alone as it was also accompanied by a sea of its friends. Lines upon lines of ants disappeared down into the hole. Moments later the gorilla understood what they were doing. They brought up all of the guavas that had fallen into the hole and laid them at the gorilla's feet. Then quietly they all disappeared somewhere into the overgrowth again. The gorilla felt so humbled that it could only manage a weak \\"thank you\\" in return."},{"question":"Describe a character Bob Ross might use if he was playing Dungeons and Dragons.","answer":"Brossard is a cheerful human cleric.

Its products include calculators, mobile phones, digital cameras, electronic musical instruments, and analogue and digital watches. It was founded in 1946, and in 1957 introduced the first entirely compact electronic calculator. It was an early digital camera innovator, and during the 1980s and 1990s, the company developed numerous affordable home electronic keyboards for musicians along with introducing the first mass-produced digital watches.HistoryCasio was established as Kashio Seisakujo in April 1946 by Tadao Kashio [ja] (1917–1993), an engineer specializing in fabrication technology.[1] Kashio's first major product was the yubiwa pipe, a finger ring that would hold a cigarette, allowing the wearer to smoke the cigarette down to its nub while also leaving the wearer's hands free.[5] Japan was impoverished immediately following World War II, so cigarettes were valuable, and the invention was a success.","answer":"Tadao Kashio was an engineer specializing in fabrication technology."},{"question":"How far apart are the Earth and the moon?","answer":"The moon is far away from the Earth, averaging a distance of 238,855 miles (384,400 km) between them. This distance can also be represented by 30 Earths. Noting that this distance is an average is essential because the Moon's orbit is not a perfect circle. Therefore, the Moon is sometimes farther or closer to Earth.

I laughed and grabbed his head as I had done God knows how many times before, when I was playing with him or when he had annoyed me. But this time when I touched him something happened in him and in me which made this touch different from any touch either of us had ever known. And he did not resist, as he usually did, but lay where I had pulled him, against my chest. And I realized that my heart was beating in an awful way and that Joey was trembling against me and the light in the room was very bright and hot. I started to move and to make some kind of joke but Joey mumbled something and I put my head down to hear. Joey raised his head as I lowered mine and we kissed, as it were, by accident. Then, for the first time in my life, I was really aware of another person’s body, of another person’s smell. We had our arms around each other. It was like holding in my hand some rare, exhausted, nearly doomed bird which I had miraculously happened to find. I was very frightened; I am sure he was frightened too, and we shut our eyes. To remember it so clearly, so painfully tonight tells me that I have never for an instant truly forgotten it. I feel in myself now a faint, a dreadful stirring of what so overwhelmingly stirred in me then, great thirsty heat, and trembling, and tenderness so painful I thought my heart would burst. But out of this astounding, intolerable pain came joy; we gave each other joy that night. It seemed, then, that a lifetime would not be long enough for me to act with Joey the act of love.","answer":"The passage is negative in emotion. The words awful, exhausted, doomed, frightened, painfully, and dread denote this. For the word \\"awful,\\" the narrator describes their heart beating in a way they do not want it to. \\"Exhausted\\" denotes tiredness and describes both the narrator and Joey. The word \\"doomed\\" describes both of them, too, with each dooming the other after accidentally kissing and instilling fear within the passage. \\"Frightened\\" accentuates this feeling of fear, furthering the negative tone, and the action of shutting their eyes makes this scene feel immoral. The word \\"painfully\\" is brought about as the narrator remembers this memory, thus classifying it as something unpleasant to remember. The word \\"dread\\" adds once more to the feeling of fear, creating a feeling of impending doom in the actions that occurred in this scene. Even though the ending states that they gave each other joy that night, the majority of this passage is negative."},{"question":"1. Who invented the instant camera?2. When did it become popular? Please answer questions in the form of a paragraph. ","answer":"Edwin H. Land, who founded the Polaroid Corporation, developed the first instant camera during World War II. Once the war was over and the economy improved and new industries flourished; one was instant photography. The first Polaroid Camera came out in 1948 but required the user to pull out the print, burst a pod of chemicals, and peel away the top layer. At first, prints were only available in sepia tone, but by 1950 black and white prints were available. Over the years and as technology progressed, prints would develop within a minute. In 1963, peel-apart color prints came along, but by 1972 they were non-peel-apart. 1977 was the height of popularity for instant photography and Polaroid held two thirds of the instant camera market.

A nonstick muffin tin is recommended, but brush the tin with mild-tasting olive oil just to be safe.The first step is to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl. Start with one-and-a-half cups of whole-wheat pastry flour, one-half cups, at pastry flour. If you don't have it in your pantry, you can use white whole-wheat flour or three-quarter cups (100 grams) of all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour. Two teaspoons of baking powder provide the leavening in this recipe. Follow this with one-half teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and one-quarter teaspoon of fine salt. Briefly whisk the ingredients together to combine them.In a larger bowl, whisk the wet ingredients: two-thirds cup (180 milliliters of whole or reduced-fat milk or plant-based milk; one half-up (113 grams) of plain Greek yogurt, one large egg, and one teaspoon of honey.  Once these ingredients are well combined, add the flour mixture. Stir the wet and dry ingredients together, but only until just combined.  For the primary flavoring, gently stir in four ounces (115 grams) of fresh crumbled goat cheese, also sold as chevre and one half-cup of finely chopped fresh chives. After the batter is done, divide it equally between the muffin tin cups. Each cup should be about three-quarters full. Using a one-quarter measuring cup as a scoop is a good guide.From here, the muffins go into the preheated oven. We are looking for golden-brown muffin tops, which should take about 18 to 20 minutes. You will know the muffins are done when an inserted toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. Transfer the tin to a wire rack to add in cooling. After five to ten minutes use a butter knife or offset spatula to remove the muffins.  These tasty muffins are best served warm.

What is important during this time is visualization and noticing what comes up when you pay attention. Now ask yourself \\"What do I need to do today? What do I want to do today?\\" Is there a true intention or anchor to the to-do list today? What needs to be achieved? Think about what your reflexive response is - what comes from your heart?

This was not the first accident that occurred in our subdivision, and it won't be the last unless we address the matter appropriately. There has been an ongoing safety concern for some time now, with the speed limit on our streets at 45mph, which drivers carelessly ignore. Many residents complain about their children not being able to even ride a bike because they fear for their safety, which is understandable. I have personally witnessed innocent animals fall victim to the wreckless driving as well. It's time to take action!Our neighborhood is not safe anymore, and we need to step up to enforce new rules, and implement additional features to reduce speeds. What I am requesting is for the HOA to install speed humps in the areas with the most traffic that have proven to be a concern. I feel it is also important that we change the speed limit to 35, which is the standard for neighborhoods this size.The speed humps are beneficial because:-The humps cause drivers to slow down considerably, at a rate of 10-15 mph. This encourages drive responsibly, and increases the safety of residents.-Drivers who slow down are more aware of their surroundings, and more likely to read the signs posted near the humps. -If drivers ignore the humps, they are likely to damage their vehicle. -Our children are less likely to be hit by a car if this safety feature is installed.I am very optimistic and hopeful for the installation to take place, to reduce the hazards we are now experiencing. Please take into consideration these additions that I have outlined for the safety of our residents.

Needless to say, this obsession doesn’t bode well for either of them.The most common advice on competition is two-fold: “competition is for losers” and “compete with your past self.” Both sound great but aren’t always super helpful. Let me elaborate.Your ultimate goal is to become a monopoly and get out of the rat race. That is what the first adage is all about. This essentially means: don’t play others’ games. Do things differently. Create your own game.This is good advice but you don’t always have the luxury to create your own rules, especially when you are only trying to get promoted before your (rival) friend.The second adage is about having a growth mindset. Competing with others can be stressful and in fact degrade our performance. We should instead measure ourselves against our past selves and see how far we have come. This will definitely give us a sense of accomplishment. Also, we should measure ourselves against our future ideal self. This will give us a sense of purpose.","answer":"In the film 'The Prestige' by Christopher Nolan, the two antagonists in the story are magicians who become dreadful rivals. The competition between the two becomes so obsessive on their parts it takes over their lives. The article says that competition with others is unhealthy and can affect your performance negatively. Instead, it is better to compete with your past self. Although this is not always easy, it will give a better sense of purpose than comparing to others and playing their games."},{"question":"What are the three domains of life?

It doesn't matter the activity, or the duration, just that you stick to the schedule. Committing consistently to other activities, even reading, walking, or doing chores, will eventually form better habits.* Figure out what a few of your interests are and join a club or group related to them.  Video games and other online activities usually have some related local activities if you look. Having hobbies or interests in common is a great way for adults to make friends and start new relationships.* Take some time and reach out to people you haven't talked to in a while, whether it's family or old friends. A call, text, or email can spark up a past relationship that only lacked a bit of effort, and believe it or not, they probably miss you too.* Volunteering is a good way to meet new people and feel productive at the same time. You'll have a chance to do some networking, as well as help your local community.* Going back to school is a great way to renew your motivation and social life.  It doesn't have to be full-time, or to get a degree, it can be as little as one hour a week. Education outside of your job can provide much-needed brain stimulation and many opportunities to meet classmates with similar ideas.Do these hit the mark that you were thinking of?  Let me know if you would like any changes or other ideas.  I hope these help you feel more connected and productive."},{"question":"I need an ahk script that accepts a user inputted integer, multiplies it by 42, subtracts 8, and checks if the result is even.

Line them up from the shortest sentence to the longest to make it look neat. About the SpeciesBlue whales are the largest animals ever to live on our planet. They feed almost exclusively on krill, straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates (which hang from the roof of the mouth and work like a sieve). Some of the biggest individuals may eat up to 6 tons of krill a day.Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic Ocean. There are five currently recognized subspecies of blue whales.The number of blue whales today is only a small fraction of what it was before modern commercial whaling significantly reduced their numbers during the early 1900s, but populations are increasing globally. The primary threats blue whales currently face are vessel strikes and entanglements in fishing gear.NOAA Fisheries and its partners are dedicated to conserving and rebuilding blue whale populations worldwide. We use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and rescue these endangered animals. We engage our partners as we develop regulations and management plans that foster healthy fisheries and reduce the risk of entanglements, create whale-safe shipping practices, and reduce ocean noise.Population StatusBlue whales were significantly depleted by commercial whaling activities worldwide. Today, blue whales are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The latest stock assessment reports of blue whales include data for various stocks, including areas of the North Pacific and western North Atlantic Oceans.AppearanceBlue whales have a long body and generally slender shape. Their mottled blue-gray color appears light blue under water—hence their name, the blue whale. The mottling pattern is variable and can be used to identify individuals.Antarctic blue whales are generally larger than other blue whale subspecies. For example, in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, blue whales can grow up to about 90 feet and are over 100,000 pounds, but in the Antarctic, they can reach up to about 110 feet and weigh more than 330,000 pounds. Like many other baleen whales, female blue whales are generally larger than males.Behavior and DietBlue whales sometimes swim in small groups but are more often found alone or in pairs. They generally spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the equatorial waters as winter arrives.Blue whales typically swim at about 5 miles an hour while they are feeding and traveling, but can accelerate to more than 20 miles an hour for short bursts. They are among the loudest animals on the planet, emitting a series of pulses, groans, and moans, and it is thought that in the right oceanographic conditions, sounds emitted by blue whales can be heard by other whales up to 1,000 miles away. Scientists think they use these vocalizations to communicate and—along with their excellent hearing—perhaps to sonar-navigate the dark ocean depths.The primary diet of blue whales is krill—tiny shrimp-like animals, but fish and copepods (tiny crustaceans) may occasionally be part of the blue whale’s diet. When blue whales hunt for food, they filter feed by swimming toward large schools of krill with their mouth open and closing their mouths around the krill while inflating their throat pleats. Once closed, blue whales then push the trapped water out of their mouth with their tongue and use their baleen plates to keep the krill trapped inside.Where They LiveBlue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic. They generally migrate seasonally between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding grounds, but some evidence suggests that individuals in certain areas might not migrate at all. Information about distribution and movement varies with location, and migratory routes are not well known. In general, distribution is driven largely by food availability—they occur in waters where krill are concentrated.In the North Atlantic Ocean, their range extends from the subtropics to the Greenland Sea. Blue whales have been sighted in the waters off eastern Canada and in the shelf waters of the eastern United States.Along the West Coast of the United States, eastern North Pacific blue whales are believed to spend winters off of Mexico and Central America. They likely feed during summer off the U.S. West Coast and, to a lesser extent, in the Gulf of Alaska and central North Pacific waters.Blue whales with young calves are regularly observed in the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) from December through March. It is believed that this area is an important calving and nursing area for the species.In the northern Indian Ocean, there is a \\"resident\\" population. Blue whale sightings, strandings, and acoustic detections have been reported from the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and across the Bay of Bengal. The migratory movements of these whales are largely unknown but may be driven by oceanographic changes associated with monsoons.In the Southern Hemisphere, Antarctic blue whales occur mainly in relatively high latitude waters south of the \\"Antarctic Convergence\\" and close to the ice edge in summer. They generally migrate to middle and low latitudes in winter, although not all whales migrate each year. Pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda)—a subspecies—are typically distributed north of the Antarctic Convergence and are most abundant in waters off Australia, Madagascar, and New Zealand. An unnamed subspecies of blue whale is found in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, particularly in the Chiloense Ecoregion, and migrates to lower latitude areas, including the Galapagos Islands and the eastern tropical Pacific.Lifespan & ReproductionBlue whales’ average lifespan is estimated at around 80 to 90 years. Scientists can estimate the age of whales by counting the layers of wax-like earplugs collected from deceased animals.Scientists know little about the life history of the blue whale. The best available science suggests the gestation period is approximately 10 to 12 months. Weaning probably occurs at around 6 to 7 months on, or en route to, summer feeding areas. The age of sexual maturity is thought to be 5 to 15 years. Most reproductive activity, including births and mating, takes place during the winter. The average calving interval is probably 2 to 3 years.ThreatsVessel StrikesVessel strikes can injure or kill blue whales. Vessel strikes have killed blue whales throughout their range, but the risk is much higher in some coastal areas with heavy vessel traffic, like ports and in shipping lanes, and from larger vessels and vessels traveling at high speeds.Entanglement in Fishing GearBlue whales can become entangled in fishing gear, either swimming off with the gear attached or becoming anchored. Blue whales can become entangled in many different gear types, including traps, pots, and nets. Once entangled, whales may drag the attached gear for long distances, ultimately resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury, which may lead to reduced reproductive success and death.Additional ThreatsAdditional possible threats to blue whales that are less understood include ocean noise, habitat degradation, pollution, vessel disturbance, and climate change.","answer":"- Blue whales are the largest animals on the planet. - A blue whale may eat up to 6 tons of krill in one day. - The only ocean where we cannot find blue whales is the Arctic. - Blue whales usually live alone or in pairs but sometimes live in small groups. - The diet of a blue whale consists mainly of krill, which they hunt by finding schools.

Due to the surrounding context, the target audience for this post won’t be believers in the Enneagram and I’m not trying to convince them there’s any validity to this concept. So there’s no need to provide extensive detail, just an overview for general understanding is good. ","answer":"The Enneagram is a popular tool used to test, classify, and analyze personality types, as well as their interpersonal dynamics. There are 9 personality types within the Enneagram and they are often referred to by their numbers rather than names. Type 1 is called “The Reformer,” describing someone who is idealistic but rational, a perfectionist, and sometimes a bit self-righteous. Type 2 is labeled “The Helper,” describing someone who is generous, caring, and finds their worth through helping others with a tendency toward people-pleasing. Type 3 is “The Achiever,” describing someone who is goal-oriented, driven, and craves success because they know it will impress others. Type 4 is called “The Individualist,” describing someone who is sensitive, dramatic, romantic, and often moody. Type 5 is “The Investigator,” describing someone who is perceptive, innovative, independent, and cerebral. Type 6 is called “The Loyalist,” or sometimes “The Skeptic,” describing someone who is responsible, safety-oriented, vigilant, and committed but often distrustful. Type 7 is dubbed “The Enthusiast,” describing someone who is extroverted, spontaneous, optimistic, and easily distractible. Type 8 is “The Challenger,” describing someone who is assertive, self-reliant, protective, and sometimes controlling. Type 9 is known as “The Peacemaker,” describing someone who is relaxed, optimistic, conflict-avoidant, and sometimes modest to a fault. These are simplified explanations and there is room for a great deal of diversity in the personalities found within each type. After testing, each type is given guidance on its strengths and weaknesses, a defining fear and motivation, and areas for potential growth. There are also some who believe that certain enneagram types pair well with others as partners, whereas some other type pairings are automatically ill-fated. However, the Enneagram, like all personality categorizing tests, is a highly subjective pseudoscience that provides diagnoses and advice in a manner that is often vague, allowing any willing audience to project their own identities onto the given information. "},{"question":"Write a 5-paragraph article explaining the invention of the dishwasher. Write the article from the perspective of Josephine Cochran, who invented one of the first dishwashers.","answer":"Well, my grandfather was an inventor, so I guess you could say that inventing is in our blood. I figured, if no one else was going to invent a dishwashing machine, I guess I'd have to do it myself. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll start at the beginning.In 1850, a man named Joel Houghton patented a wooden machine with a hand-turned wheel that splashed water on the dishes. Joel made a great effort, but every housewife knows that gently splashing water on dishes is not enough to get them clean. Then, in the 1860s, a man named L.A. Alexander invented a machine that allowed a user to spin dishes on racks through a tub of water. A mild improvement, maybe, but still not enough to get the job done. Meanwhile, I married William Cochran in 1858. The next years were a wild ride as William became a very wealthy merchant of dry goods and a politician in the Democratic Party. In 1870, we moved into a mansion! At one of our dinner parties, the servants chipped a few of our heirloom china dishes, and I was fed up. I knew there had to be some kind of alternative. Plus, I remembered what it felt like to wash dishes for hours every day as a housewife - and I didn't want one more woman to have to waste her time standing at the sink. I had a few ideas for a dishwashing machine, but I wasn't motivated to take them further until my dear William died in 1883. He was a man troubled by the drink, and he left me with numerous unpaid debts. I had to figure out how to continue on and find a way to support my family. I finished designing my dishwasher model and received a patent in December 1886. My dishwasher is the first one that uses water pressure instead of scrubbers to clean the dishes. I unveiled the design at the World's Fair in 1893. I thought housewives would jump at the chance to purchase one, but it ended up being restaurants and hotels that bought my invention. I started a company to build my manually operated dishwasher, and later on, it became a brand that you've probably heard of - KitchenAid.

It was no surprise when she skipped kindergarten and also no surprise when she excelled in every grade she was in thereafter. She was taking college courses during her high school years, and it wasn't long until she graduated college with her Master's in Engineering and Science, with honors. Eager to get to work, she was invited to work at the Lab of Theoretical Sciences and jumped at the opportunity. There, she worked with her peers to run tests, verify, and even create new inventions (or improve older ones). One of her lesser-known contributions is her work on improving the lifespans of apples, giving them twice as much time before they rot and become unfeasible for human consumption. However, it was here that she would work on her biggest invention, the Eternal Popcorn Generator. As a result of previous work, they had discovered certain wormholes and dimensions they could access, if often for brief times. One of these dimensions was one filled with an unlimited amount of popcorn, already popped and never-aging until they were brought into our dimension. Working with a small team, they created an appliance that could tap into this dimension with the flip of a switch, as long as enough electricity was supplied to keep the portal open. And so she was paid trillions for her idea and scientific knowledge and became one of the richest people in the world.In her final years, she retired to a lakeside home, where she continued her research on her terms. She was able to learn much about the different dimensions and their applications but never had quite the same breakthrough that went into the Eternal Popcorn Generator. Eventually, old age caught up to her, and in a bed surrounded by many of her closest friends, relatives, and young scientists she inspired, she passed away. But even now, her legacy remains strong, and her invention is a staple in every household."},{"question":"Which U.S. Presidents have been assassinated?

Ronan is a Borderdoodle, which is a perfect hybrid breed that combines the best traits of Border Collies and Poodles. The Border Collie is known for its intelligence and herding skills, while the Poodle is known for its intelligence, hypoallergenic coat, and affectionate personality. When you combine these two breeds, the result is a dog that is not only trainable and brilliant but also loving and loyal to its humans. Ronan has been with me for about 2 months now, and I couldn't be more excited and grateful to be his momma.I am an avid dog lover that loves to train dogs to be the best versions of themselves. I've also always wanted to share my experiences and adventures with my best friend in the world. When I finally decided to adopt another dog, I spent much time researching breeds and looking for the perfect match for my family. I have had Border Collie mixes before but have struggled with some allergies related to their fur. That's when I discovered the Borderdoodle breed and fell in love with their intelligence, loving nature, and more hypoallergenic coat.But my Ronan is not just any Borderdoodle. He's a special dog with a unique personality all his own. From the moment I laid eyes on him, I knew he was the perfect companion for me. He is so smart, playful, extremely loving, and always eager to please. Whether we're exploring nature or cuddling on the couch, Ronan has become my perfect sidekick.In this blog, I will share our life, from the challenges of training a new puppy to the joys of exploring new places together. Eventually, I will share Ronan's training experiences as he becomes a service dog. I hope sharing our experience with other dog lovers out there inspires some to consider adopting or rescuing a Borderdoodle of their own. I also hope to provide a platform for other Borderdoodle owners to connect and share their own stories. So, join us on our adventures and get to know Ronan. I know you will love him too!"},{"question":"What are the main functions of the respiratory system and what is the role of the diaphragm in breathing?","answer":"The network of tissues and organs that aids in breathing is known as the respiratory system. It comprises the blood vessels, lungs, and airways. The respiratory system also includes the muscles that move your lungs. Together these components circulate oxygen throughout the body and remove waste gases like carbon dioxide.The respiratory system serves a variety of purposes. In addition to assisting with breathing, it also:• It enables you to speak and smell.•It also warms the temperature of the air to that of your body and moisturizes it to the humidity levels a body needs.•Provides the body cells with oxygen•Enables a body to exhale waste gases from the body•Keeps irritants and harmful substances out of the airways.The main muscle used for breathing is the diaphragm, which is situated below the lungs. It is a sizable, dome-shaped muscle that frequently contracts continually and rhythmically. The diaphragm's role in breathing is it contracts and tightens during inhalation and the chest cavity widens. This creates a vacuum through the contractions, drawing air into the lungs. The diaphragm relaxes and assumes its dome-like shape during exhalation, forcing air out of the lungs."},{"question":"I'm arguing with my dad about what the biggest freshwater fish in North America is.

I've got some tips to share for anyone looking to change up things around the house and make it more lively. First: you don't need to focus on big changes! There are lots of things you can do that can make a big impact with a small investment. Here are a few:New light fixtures (even standing or tabletop ones) can easily change the mood of a room, especially with the options at your disposal. Consider dimmable lights, RGB lights, or candelabra fixtures for example. A porch swing or other outdoor furniture can inspire you to spend more of your time outside, making a cozier environment to be in. Both of these are just scratching the surface of some of the relatively low-cost and low-effort improvements you can make at home. Something as simple as changing the layout of a room can make a big difference, too. It can change the way you manage your routine, or your workflow if you work from home in a bedroom office, for instance.As we go on, I'll talk about things that require more funds or work to do, but they're quite fulfilling to get done, and make for a much better home both for yourself (and any family that lives with you or may inherit it) or if you ever decide to sell.Something you may not often think of is cabinet accessibility in your kitchen. Surprisingly, it can make a big impact with something so seemingly insignificant, like putting a lazy susan mechanism in your corner cabinets. It makes it a lot easier to get things out since you don't have to strain yourself reaching to the back and over other things stored in them. Other kitchen improvements include updating your appliances. I know it isn't the most compelling option, but it can make a huge difference to have something more modern with better ease of use, and it looks prettier, too! Some people prefer to settle for what's usable though, and that's okay; just remember to pick what most suits your needs.If you've got a lot of unused space in your lot, there are plenty of things you can do with it. One that can have a surprising impact on the overall quality of the home is tastefully populating your yard with plants such as trees and bushes.  The trees can provide shade, privacy, and places for things like swings or feeders for local birds, and bushes can be super pretty ways of accentuating spaces in your yard. One that's more complicated, but can massively increase the value of your property is adding an addition to your house. It's a great way of adding new functions and square footage, as you can have one or more extra rooms to dedicate to activities or living. Even though it requires a lot of time and work, it's very rewarding with the increase in value and use of your home: I wouldn't recommend it to newcomers, but it's a great longer-term project for experienced home improvers!Thanks for reading along. I hope these suggestions have given you ideas about how you can tailor your home to fit your needs, especially if these led you to your own creative ideas! I look forward to seeing home improvement being more commonplace, especially since it's such a fulfilling thing to do.

The algae that grows on sloths' fur also helps them avoid predators by letting them blend in with green leaves. They rarely come down from the trees. About once every week, they descend to go to the bathroom, slowly moving about by digging their front claws into the dirt and dragging their bodies. If they are caught by a predator, sloths turn from sluggish to slugger, biting fiercely, hissing, slashing with their claws, and shrieking.","answer":"Some scientists believe sloths move slowly to avoid detection by predators that rely on their eyesight while hunting; if attacked, sloths can bite, slash, and shriek.

Their nests have a yearly cycle and can contain 50 to 500 occupants. They don’t look like your typical beehive as the nest entrance of the colony can usually be found in the ground. Bumblebees work their entire lives feeding and protecting the colony, particularly the queen bee. If a bumblebee feels as if the safety of the colony is threatened or the bee is provoked, it will sting. Carpenter bees are solitary insects and are often described as harmless (to humans, but not your wooden deck!). Female carpenter bees create their nest in wood, using their strong jaws to chew through porches, doors, and other wooden materials. They prefer soft, weathered and unpainted wood. While female carpenter bees do have stingers, they rarely use them. This only occurs if the bee is seriously provoked. Male carpenter bees are very protective but do not possess a stinger.

ALK-positivity confers sensitivity to small-molecule ALK kinase inhibitors, such as crizotinib. The integration of crizotinib into standard treatment practice in NSCLC will rest on the widespread implementation of an effective screening system for newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC which is flexible enough to incorporate new targets as treatments are developed for them. Phase I and II studies of crizotinib in ALK-positive lung cancer have demonstrated significant activity and impressive clinical benefit, which led to its early approval by USFDA in 2011. Although crizotinib induces remissions and extends the lives of patients, there have been reports of emerging resistance to Crizotinib therapy. In this review, we discuss the history, mechanism of action, uses, adverse effects, dose modifications and future challenges and opportunities for patients with ALK-positive lung cancers.Keywords: ALK mutation, ALK inhibitors, ALK positive Non-small cell lung cancer, CrizotinibOverview of Clinical TrialsThe antitumor efficacy of crizotinib was initially demonstrated in two multicenter, single-arm studies.[23,24] Dosage for these extended series was 250 mg, orally, given twice a day, based on results from the initial phase I dose escalation study. In aggregate, these studies included 255 patients, all of whose tumors contained an ALK gene rearrangement, as shown by FISH. Overall, 95% of the patients had metastatic disease and 5% had locally advanced NSCLC. Overall, 94% of the patients had received prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease, and 76% had received two or more treatment regimens. The combined objective (complete plus partial) response rate was 55%, the majority of which was achieved during the first eight weeks of treatment. The median durations of response at the time of analysis of the two studies were 42 and 48 weeks, respectively [Table 1].Table 1Comparison of results of profile 1001 and profile 1005 trialsAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.Object name is SAJC-2-91-g003.jpgEvidence of the impact of crizotinib on the survival of patients came from a non-randomized, retrospective analysis of the patients enrolled in the phase I study.[25] The one- and two-year survival rates for patients treated with crizotinib were 74 and 54%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 18 months. In a cohort of 36 patients with the ALK fusion oncogene, who were not treated with crizotinib, the survival rates at one- and two-years were 44 and 12%, respectively. A comparison with a larger cohort of patients with wild-type tumors did not identify a difference when compared with those with the ALK rearrangement not treated with crizotinib, suggesting that the presence of ALK rearrangement was not prognostically significant.ConclusionsThe presence of an ALK fusion oncogene defines a molecular subset of NSCLC with distinct clinical and pathological features. The patients most likely to harbor ALK rearrangement are relatively young, never or light smokers with adenocarcinoma. Whenever possible, therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC should be individualized, based on the molecular and histological features of the tumor. If feasible, patients should have the tumor tissue assessed for the presence of a somatic mutation in the EGFR, which confers sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to the ALK fusion oncogene, which is associated with sensitivity to crizotinib.Thus, crizotinib is an important unmet medical need. It is a straightforward, biology-based biomarker, predicting a high response rate in heavily pre-treated patients and is relatively non-toxic. It is a triumph for a targeted therapy in the era of oncogenic driver mutations.","answer":"Crizotinib is a small-molecule anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor that can be used to induce remission in non-small-cell lung cancers or NSCLC when ALK mutations are present.In a non-randomized, retrospective analysis from a phase 1 study, crizotinib was found to improve one to two-year survival rates for patients from 44-12% to 74-54%.Crizotinib has been shown to be a relatively non-toxic biomarker that has accomplished successful targeted therapy for people with a somatic mutation of the EGFR who have sensitivity to the ALK fusion oncogene although it remains an unmet medical need.There have been reports of increased resistance to crizotinib which may require further research."},{"question":"I hope to be successful and one day be content.","answer":"For sure you will make it, to the grandest extent."},{"question":"Who was involved in the infamous gunfight at O.K.

Layered in threes, the sponge cake is sandwiched with a mixture of cherries and whipped cream or milk chocolate mousse, then the sides are pressed with Bavarian chocolate shards or milk chocolate curls. Traditionally, the dessert is creamy and indulgent, soaked in black cherry liquor for extra richness. •\\tCoffee Caramel MousseCreamy and airy with a fluff factor that could rival the softness of homemade whipped cream, Coffee Caramel Mousse boasts a subtle sweetness that makes it the perfect lightweight dessert. The tastes of coffee and caramel intermingle, and its often accompanied by fresh raspberries or strawberry slices to break up texture and flavors. •\\tBanana Bread The sweetness in Banana Bread comes from mashed bananas, stirred with butter to a fluffy consistency before being baked to golden-brown perfection. The exterior crust is slightly crispy, while the interior is soft and light. Best-served warm, banana bread is delicious down to the last crumb. Some bakers incorporate chopped walnuts or chocolate chips for added texture and flavor.   •\\tApple Brown Betty Reminiscent of an apple pie, Apple Brown Betty incorporates soft cinnamon-sugared apple slices with buttery, oven-browned breadcrumbs. The perfect dessert for autumn, this one is sticky-sweet with a spiced crisp that melts in your mouth. To cut the warmth and spice of the Apple Brown Betty, it’s best served with a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream or fluffy, subtly sweet homemade whipped cream.

Include disclaimers that you are not sponsored by any company.","answer":"You guys have got to try this thing called miracle berries! They will totally change the way you taste food and drinks. Literally! They have this all-natural substance in them called miraculin (seriously called miraculin!) that binds to the taste buds on your tongue. Once in your mouth, they change how your taste buds perceive foods, making sour stuff taste sweet! It's so cool and all-natural. It makes foods that have no sugar in them at all taste like they're super sweet. The fruit itself doesn't have much sugar either, so they're great if you're trying to reduce your sugar intake, without losing that sweet flavor.  Best of all, it's not habit-forming or permanent at all. It literally washes off your tongue and mouth surfaces with your saliva in a few minutes. So you can just try it out and see if you like it, or just pop one when you feel like tasting something sweet without all the sugar. It's so cool, I think everyone should try it. And before you ask, no I'm not sponsored by any miracle berry company. I'm not paid to say any of this, I just think it's super neat!

After a broad overview can you explain the specific process of making at least 2 cheeses, at least one should be cheddar? ","answer":"After milking a cow, the cream must be separated from the milk before the milk is used in cheesemaking. Once the milk is obtained, the process of making cheese can begin. First, the milk is taken, and based on the kind of cheese being made, a starter culture of bacteria is added in order to convert the lactose sugars in the cheese into lactic acid. After the bacteria has mixed with the milk, a curdling agent called rennet is added in order to cause the casein to curdle and separate from the water liquid known as whey. The curds are then separated and salt is added to help drain more whey before it is processed into its final form, which can range from being stretched and kneaded, to being pressed into a mold and aging. Cheddar, for example, is made by keeping no more than 39% moisture in it and aging it depending on the level of sharpness and hardness desired. To make mozzarella cheese, after the curds are formed, they are heated and kneaded together until it forms their signature elastic texture.

What made it as popular as it is?","answer":"The record for the most-produced airplane is held by the Cessna 172 “Skyhawk.” It is a lightweight, 4-seat civil aircraft that first flew in 1956. The 172 has come in a few different variants over the years, but all told, well over 44,000 of them have been sold.There are a few appealing characteristics that have made the Skyhawk popular. One of the biggest factors is its simplicity. Compared to many aircraft, the Cessna 172 is simple to fly and maintain. It is regularly used by pilot training schools specifically for that reason. Compared to many of its competitors, the Cessna's high wing can be advantageous. Most competing aircraft like the Piper Cherokee have low-mounted wings which limit visibility below the cockpit and make the cabin harder to get into and out of. The Skyhawk's high wing limits upward visibility but makes it easier for pilots to see the ground and runway.Until recent years, the 172 was also among the most affordable planes to buy. Unfortunately for Cessna, a downturn in demand has meant fewer Skyhawks are coming off the line now and their per-airframe price is rising accordingly. However, they’re still relatively affordable to keep and maintain."},{"question":"Please write a free-form poem about someone who is angry and sad because their stock portfolio has gone way down since 2021.

Make it about 400 words and introduce a few of the characters. ","answer":"After parking the car, Mike climbed out of the driver's seat and took a long, deep breath as he took in the familiar view. The trees and wildflowers seemed to sway and bob their heads in greeting, saying, \\"Hello again, old friend.\\" In the distance, sunlight sparkled on the surface of the lake. The scent of pine and damp moss was underscored by the smell of burning firewood, and Mike saw smoke rising from the cabin's chimney. His sister Phoebe and her husband Jamal must have arrived hours ago. \\"What's the wifi password?\\" his son, Charlie, asked, stepping out of the car without so much as a glance up at the cabin. \\"No wifi here, buddy.\\" \\"What?\\" Charlie squawked, incredulous. \\"How could you not warn me before we left?\\" In retrospect, Mike thought, perhaps he should have allowed his son to bring a friend along. Most of Charlie’s friends were unsavory James Dean types, but even a bad influence would be better than total isolation and cold turkey wifi withdrawal for a week. His daughter Nina was next to climb out of the car, popping the trunk to make sure her luggage hadn't been damaged on the drive. It was obvious that Nina had packed for a vacation entirely different from the one she was actually on; her strappy sandals and cream linen jumpsuit wouldn’t last an hour before the mud surrounding the cabin irreparably soiled the clothes and the jagged rocks punched holes in her leather soles. She stood by the trunk, tapping her feet for a minute before Mike caught her eye.“Sorry,” Mike teased, “Bellhop’s on break right now, so you’ll have to carry those bags in yourself.”Nina sighed, rolled her eyes, and wrenched her duffel from the pile. On the back porch, Mike found his sister serving a tray of freshly baked biscuits--a family tradition. \\"Hey, brother,\\" she grinned as he planted a kiss on her cheek. \\"You're just in time.\\" Mike greeted Phoebe and Jamal briefly but didn't make any small talk. Not yet. Phoebe twisted the dusty lid off an old glass jar and offered Mike a butter knife. \\"For old time's sake?\\"Mike slathered a biscuit with butter and his grandmother’s incomparable raspberry jam, then sank his teeth in with a sigh as he gazed over the treetops.

I typically work Mondays through Fridays every week but I can't go to work next Thursday and Friday, which are about 5 days out from now.","answer":"Here are some general reasons you can give to your manager on why you won't be able to work next Thursday and Friday.1) Medical or Health-related reasonsThe legitimacy of medical or health-related issues is rarely questioned, especially in the workplace where Federal HIPAA laws surrounding health information privacy may allow you to outright refuse to disclose specific reasons to your manager. Also, medical or health issues are often valid reasons to avoid work and overall is a sensitive topic. It may be seen as tactless if follow-up questions from your manager are repeatedly asked surrounding absences caused by medical or health issues. 2) Urgent family reasonsMissing work due to family-related issues is another possible reason to provide your manager. The severity of the family-related reason(s) can vary widely from simple daycare substitute duties to death, however, you should emphasize that the emergency was unanticipated. Most people can relate to familial emergencies disrupting the normal flow of their personal life. Keep in mind, it would be important to remember any details you inform your manager of your family going forward. For example, if you say that you had to miss work to babysit your nephew, but mention a few weeks later that you have no aunts or uncles, you may be seen as dishonest and future genuine requests to take time off from work may be scrutinized. 3) Car-related issuesCar-related issues may also support your upcoming absence when you talk with your manager. This general reason is also relatable to those who have experience owning a car. Unexpected issues with your car may prevent you from commuting to work, and since you plan to only be off for two days, which is a reasonable amount of time to get most car issues remediated, this type of reason may be valid to provide. You should also be mindful of any personal details your manager might know (or will know in the future) that may conflict with this reason. For example, if you told your manager that you sold your car last month, then this reason will be revealed to be a lie and you may face disciplinary action from your manager.

If you’re planning a corporate event for over 50 people, it’s best to enlist some help. A team of planners can ensure that the project stays on track to its completion. 2.\\tGood location.The location should be central to employees but in an area with good parking.

Chicken is a favorite at corporate events, but seafood is also popular.4.\\tFun entertainment and music.You might be able to hire a local band to play live music during the event. Decide on the style of music, whether country, rock, soul, etc., then search for local talent online.5.\\tThe budget.Pay close attention to your budget.

Holmes is not naive, nor are most readers of The New York Times. While last weekend’s “a hero or a villain” coverage may be said to have betrayed the patients who were harmed by her inaccurate blood tests, and the memory of a Theranos employee who died by suicide, it is also just another entry in the expanded universe of Holmes-themed entertainment. There are books and podcasts and feature-length documentaries. A TV miniseries about Holmes has a score of 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. (“Addictively engrossing!” “Consistently entertaining!”) Surely some of those who now bemoan the Times’ friendly treatment have consumed this material for less-than-academic reasons.The prosaic details of a convicted cheat’s domestic life aren’t really news, but they are interesting—because the character of Elizabeth Holmes is interesting. So, too, are her continued efforts to spin a narrative of who she is. But with such well-trodden ground, the irony is built right in. You know that Holmes is a scammer. I know it. On some level, The New York Times seems to know it too; the article runs through her crimes and even quotes a friend of Holmes’s who says she isn’t to be trusted. This isn’t character rehabilitation; it’s content. We’re all waiting to see what Liz gets up to next. Have the media learned their lesson? The real test will arrive when the next scientific scammer comes along, and the one after that—when their narrative is still intact, and their fraud hasn’t yet been revealed.

Everyone knows that she's still a scammer, but the content is still holding viewers, which is more important. The writer says the real test is when the next scientific scammer arises and their narrative hasn't been compromised and their fraud hasn't yet been revealed.

Hailstone decides to stay with the unicorns, where he feels accepted for who he is. He spends the rest of his life happily among them.","answer":"Treebranch was a stallion of brilliant white, so he always hoped his peers would name him something like pearl, ivory, or moonstone. He would have settled for snow, snowstorm, or even blizzard! But the first thing the other horses ever saw witnessed was this sharp and long horn that protruded from his forehead. It was like the branch of a tree, and from then, on he was known as Treebranch.He couldn’t help but be jealous of the other horses, especially those gifted with beautiful names like Thunderclap, whose hooves beat on the ground like the drum of thunder when he dashed across the plains – or Nightfall, whose sable coat glistened like stars under the sunlight. How could Treebranch ever compare? Especially when his horn was all any other horse could see.One day while the herd was moving across the grassy plains, a terrible storm began, with clouds so dark that it hid the sun. Torrents of rain and deafening winds caused mayhem, and Treebranch found himself separated from the others. The storm had subsided. He tried to make his way back to them. However, he found himself lost in a forest instead. That’s when he stumbled upon another band of horses, and the first thing he noticed was the long horns that grew out from their forehead!“Oh, a fellow unicorn,” one of them said as means of greeting. “What is your name?”“The other horses call me Treebranch,” he replied.“That’s far too unfitting a name for such a beautiful unicorn.”“They call me so because they cannot see beyond my horn.”“Then you must live with those of us who do,” the unicorn said. “Live with us, and we shall know you as the white unicorn that came to us from the storm, and henceforth call you Hailstone.”Hailstone, what a dashing name!

Current detainees include Evan Gershkovich, Kai Li, and Paul Whelan. "},{"question":"Write a professional review of a new product aimed at dinosaurs. Be sure to give an overview of the product, talk about both the pros and cons of the product and include a rating + recommendation at the end.","answer":"Review: The Flexible Ginkgo Back ScratcherToday, we will be taking a look at the newest product from the T-Rexes R Us company called The Flexible Ginkgo Back Scratcher. Since it's carved from the trunk of a ginkgo tree, its main selling point is its customizable length (up to 50 feet long), as well as the ability for customers to specify the size and number of branches they'd like to leave on the main trunk. This way, regardless of the hardness of your skin or the length of your arms, the back scratcher is sure to have a setting that satisfies your itch.We tested this back scratcher on T-Rexes both young and old, with a wide variety of arm lengths, and the biggest pro of this product is that it can be fitted to work for any T-Rex, no matter how short their arms are or how wide their girth is. Another good point of this product is its sturdiness. A ginkgo tree's trunk can be as wide as 25-35 feet, which guarantees not even the strongest T-Rex can break it. Finally, the ability to set the number and size of the branches on the trunk means that you can set your back scratcher to scratch as hard or as lightly as you need it. Young T-Rexes with less-developed, more sensitive skin may want to opt for a basic option without any branches at all, while older T-Rexes with tougher skin should opt for a full set of branches at a variety of lengths for maximum satisfaction.There is only one con to this back scratcher, which is the possibility of smaller creatures being accidentally left in the trunk. Out of the 20 back scratchers we ordered, one of them came with an uninvited guest - a volaticotherium that flew directly into one of our tester's mouths in a panic. It isn't a deal-breaker, but if you're a picky eater, it can be a bit of a disappointment to receive an unsolicited snack this way.Overall, we would give this product 4.5 stars out of 5, and highly recommend it to any T-Rex struggling to reach their back for a good scratch."},{"question":"Please write a haiku about two samurais fighting each other.","answer":"Two samurais fightTheir swords clashing like thunderOne stands, and one falls"},{"question":"Write me a somewhat sad poem about a dog named Billy and his friend Tim","answer":"Billy was a good dog, and the color brown,His fur was so very softAnd he loved a good scratchHis friend Tim was such a faithful friendWhen Billy finally one day was laid to rest,Tim still visited all the time."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:q,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(o=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return o.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||o.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function E(o,e,h,c,i,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",B,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(w,null,b(s.filteredPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),v(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[i.isLoading?(a(),n("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",D,"See more"))],8,j)):k("",!0)])}const z=u(H,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-69bc4bd7"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/31.md","filePath":"guide/31.md"}'),F={name:"guide/31.md"},O=Object.assign(F,{setup(o){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[I(z)]))}});export{L as __pageData,O as default};
