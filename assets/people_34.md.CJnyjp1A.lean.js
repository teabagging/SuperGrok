If the representative plans to add additional radar stations to cover the entire coastline with some overlap for increased security, and each new radar station overlaps 5 kilometers of the area covered by the existing stations, how many new radar stations should be installed to ensure full coverage of the 150-kilometer stretch?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many radar stations are required to cover a 150-kilometer stretch of coastline, given that each radar station covers 25 kilometers. Additionally, each new station overlaps 5 kilometers with the area covered by the previous station.Here’s how we approach the problem step-by-step:1. Understanding coverage with overlap:    - Each radar station covers 25 kilometers.   - When adding a new radar station, 5 kilometers of its coverage overlap with the previous station. This means each new station effectively adds (25 - 5 = 20) kilometers of new coverage.2. Calculating initial setup:   - The first radar station will cover the first 25 kilometers (0 to 25 km).  3. Determining additional stations needed:   - After the first station, each additional station contributes 20 kilometers of new coverage.   - We need to cover a total of 150 kilometers, so the remaining distance after the first station is (150 - 25 = 125) kilometers.4. Calculating the number of additional stations:   - To find out how many additional stations are needed to cover the remaining 125 kilometers, we divide 125 by the effective new coverage per additional station (20 kilometers):   [   text{Number of additional stations} = frac{125}{20} = 6.25   ]   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a radar station, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 7 additional stations.5. Total number of radar stations:   - Including the initial station, the total number of radar stations needed is (1 + 7 = 8).Thus, the Ministry of Defense should install a total of 8 radar stations to ensure full coverage of the 150-kilometer stretch with the specified overlap.# 8"},{"question":"Alex is a high school student who is interested in pursuing a career in healthcare.

She discovers that there are 7 generations spanning from the earliest recorded ancestor to the current family members.In her research, Professor Smith notes that each generation, on average, has 4 children. If the first generation started with 2 siblings, how many descendants are there in total by the 7th generation?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of descendants across all 7 generations, starting from the initial 2 siblings in the first generation.Let's outline the steps:1. First Generation:   - The first generation consists of 2 siblings.   - Total in the 1st generation = 2.2. Subsequent Generations:   - Each individual in every generation has an average of 4 children.   - Therefore, to find the number of descendants in each subsequent generation, we multiply the number of individuals in the current generation by 4.3. Calculate for Each Generation:   - Second Generation:     - First generation has 2 individuals.     - Each has 4 children: (2 times 4 = 8).     - Total in the 2nd generation = 8.   - Third Generation:     - Second generation has 8 individuals.     - Each has 4 children: (8 times 4 = 32).     - Total in the 3rd generation = 32.   - Fourth Generation:     - Third generation has 32 individuals.     - Each has 4 children: (32 times 4 = 128).     - Total in the 4th generation = 128.   - Fifth Generation:     - Fourth generation has 128 individuals.     - Each has 4 children: (128 times 4 = 512).     - Total in the 5th generation = 512.   - Sixth Generation:     - Fifth generation has 512 individuals.     - Each has 4 children: (512 times 4 = 2048).     - Total in the 6th generation = 2048.   - Seventh Generation:     - Sixth generation has 2048 individuals.     - Each has 4 children: (2048 times 4 = 8192).     - Total in the 7th generation = 8192.4. Calculate the Total Number of Descendants:   - Add up all the individuals from each generation:   - Total = 2 (1st) + 8 (2nd) + 32 (3rd) + 128 (4th) + 512 (5th) + 2048 (6th) + 8192 (7th).   - Total = 2 + 8 + 32 + 128 + 512 + 2048 + 8192 = 10922.Thus, the total number of descendants by the 7th generation is 10922.# 10922"},{"question":"Alex is an e-commerce entrepreneur who sells custom mugs online.

Currently, there are 50 media outlets in the country. The lawmaker believes that each outlet should undergo a security review every 6 months to ensure compliance with new regulations. Each security review costs 2,000. The lawmaker proposes to allocate 120,000 per year for these reviews. How many security reviews can be conducted annually with the proposed budget, and how many media outlets can be reviewed every 6 months within this budget?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many security reviews can be conducted annually with the proposed budget, and how many media outlets can be reviewed every 6 months within this budget. Step 1: Determine the number of reviews that can be conducted annually with the proposed budget.1. Proposed annual budget: 120,0002. Cost per security review: 2,000To find out how many security reviews can be conducted annually, we divide the annual budget by the cost of one review:[text{Number of reviews per year} = frac{text{Annual Budget}}{text{Cost per Review}} = frac{120,000}{2,000} = 60] Step 2: Determine how many media outlets can be reviewed every 6 months.Since each media outlet is supposed to undergo a security review every 6 months, the annual budget should cover reviews for both halves of the year.1. Total number of reviews possible per year: 602. Reviews needed every 6 months: Since reviews occur every 6 months, the number of reviews that can be conducted in each half-year period is half of the annual total:[text{Number of reviews every 6 months} = frac{text{Total Reviews per Year}}{2} = frac{60}{2} = 30]Thus, 30 media outlets can be reviewed every 6 months within this budget. ConclusionThe proposed budget allows for 60 security reviews annually, and 30 media outlets can be reviewed every 6 months.# 60, 30"},{"question":"Javier, a fellow Breaking Bad fan from Spain, loves sharing behind-the-scenes trivia and rare interviews about the show.

If she needs 5 minutes to walk between each scene, how many different scenes can Anna photograph during the golden hour?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's break down the time Anna has and how it can be allocated to photographing different scenes.1. Total time available during the golden hour:   - The golden hour lasts for 1.5 hours.   - Converting hours into minutes:      [     1.5 text{ hours} = 1.5 times 60 = 90 text{ minutes}     ]2. Time spent on each scene:   - Anna spends 15 minutes photographing each scene.3. Time spent walking between scenes:   - Anna spends 5 minutes walking between each scene.4. Total time spent per scene, including transition:   - For each scene, Anna will spend 15 minutes photographing and 5 minutes walking to the next scene.   - Total time per scene, including transition:      [     15 text{ minutes} + 5 text{ minutes} = 20 text{ minutes}     ]5. Calculate the number of scenes Anna can photograph:   - Anna needs to use the available 90 minutes effectively.   - To find the number of scenes she can photograph, we divide the total available time by the time spent per scene:     [     frac{90 text{ minutes}}{20 text{ minutes per scene}} = 4.5     ]6. Interpretation of the result:   - Since Anna can't photograph a fraction of a scene, she can photograph only whole scenes.   - Therefore, she can photograph 4 full scenes during the golden hour.Thus, the number of different scenes Anna can photograph during the golden hour is:# 4"},{"question":"Alex is a grassroots activist who is advocating for a new community center that will provide essential social services to the local neighborhood.

She believes that the number 7 holds special significance, as it is often associated with divine perfection. For her lecture series, she plans to distribute 77 pamphlets to the attendees. If she wants to hand out an equal number of pamphlets to each of the 7 days of the week, plus an additional 7 pamphlets to give out on the final day as a symbolic gesture, how many pamphlets should she distribute each day, excluding the final day?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pamphlets Professor Smith should distribute each day over the 7 days, with the constraint that on the final day, she will distribute additional pamphlets as a symbolic gesture.1. Total pamphlets to be distributed: 77 pamphlets.2. Additional pamphlets on the final day: 7 pamphlets.First, calculate the number of pamphlets distributed over the first 6 days, excluding the additional pamphlets on the final day:3. Pamphlets distributed on the final day (excluding additional ones): Let this be ( x ).4. Total pamphlets distributed over 7 days (including additional ones): Since there are additional 7 pamphlets given on the last day, the total distribution over 7 days is ( 7x + 7 ).This distribution should equal the total number of pamphlets:[ 7x + 7 = 77 ]5. Simplify the equation:   Subtract 7 from both sides:   [ 7x = 70 ]6. Solve for ( x ):   Divide both sides by 7:   [ x = frac{70}{7} = 10 ]Thus, Professor Smith should distribute 10 pamphlets each day for the first 6 days. On the final day, she will distribute 10 pamphlets plus the additional 7 pamphlets as a symbolic gesture, making it 17 pamphlets on the final day.# 10"},{"question":"Jane is a journalism major enthusiastic about understanding how oil production impacts international relations. She reads that Country A produces 500,000 barrels of oil per day, while Country B produces 300,000 barrels per day. Jane learns that Country A exports 60% of its oil production, and Country B exports 75% of its oil production. If both countries decide to increase their daily production by 10% next year, how many more barrels of oil will Country A and Country B together export per day compared to their current exports?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current and future exports of oil for both Country A and Country B, and then find the difference in exports after the production increase. Step 1: Calculate Current Exports1. Country A:   - Current production = 500,000 barrels/day   - Export percentage = 60%   - Current exports = 60% of 500,000 = 0.60 * 500,000 = 300,000 barrels/day2. Country B:   - Current production = 300,000 barrels/day   - Export percentage = 75%   - Current exports = 75% of 300,000 = 0.75 * 300,000 = 225,000 barrels/day Step 2: Calculate Future Production1. Country A:   - Production increase = 10%   - Future production = 500,000 + 10% of 500,000   - Future production = 500,000 + 0.10 * 500,000 = 500,000 + 50,000 = 550,000 barrels/day2. Country B:   - Production increase = 10%   - Future production = 300,000 + 10% of 300,000   - Future production = 300,000 + 0.10 * 300,000 = 300,000 + 30,000 = 330,000 barrels/day Step 3: Calculate Future Exports1. Country A:   - Future exports = 60% of future production   - Future exports = 0.60 * 550,000 = 330,000 barrels/day2. Country B:   - Future exports = 75% of future production   - Future exports = 0.75 * 330,000 = 247,500 barrels/day Step 4: Calculate Increase in Exports1. Country A:   - Increase in exports = Future exports - Current exports   - Increase = 330,000 - 300,000 = 30,000 barrels/day2. Country B:   - Increase in exports = Future exports - Current exports   - Increase = 247,500 - 225,000 = 22,500 barrels/day Step 5: Total Increase in Exports- Total increase for both countries = Increase by Country A + Increase by Country B- Total increase = 30,000 + 22,500 = 52,500 barrels/dayTherefore, the combined increase in exports for both countries is:# 52,500 barrels/day"},{"question":"Jamie is a medical laboratory technician who needs to buy new work attire that is both comfortable and durable.

One day, Leonardo's grandmother tells him about a famous painter from the Renaissance who was working on a fresco. She explains that the painter needed exactly 48 small tiles to complete the artwork, and each tile required 4 different colors of paint. Leonardo wants to help his grandmother understand how much paint the painter needed. If each color of paint comes in bottles that can paint 10 tiles, how many bottles of each color did the painter need to complete the fresco?","answer":"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:1. Determine the total number of tiles and colors required:   - The painter needs 48 small tiles.   - Each tile requires 4 different colors.2. Calculate the total number of colors needed for all tiles:   - Since each tile uses 4 colors, the total number of color usages across all tiles is:     [     48 text{ tiles} times 4 text{ colors per tile} = 192 text{ color usages}     ]3. Calculate the number of bottles required for each color:   - Each bottle can paint 10 tiles, but since each tile requires 4 colors, each bottle can be used for 10 full tile colorings. Hence, each bottle can provide 10 usages of a single color.   - To find out how many bottles are needed to cover 192 color usages, we divide the total number of color usages by the number of color usages per bottle:     [     frac{192 text{ color usages}}{10 text{ color usages per bottle}} = 19.2 text{ bottles}     ]4. Round up to the nearest whole number:   - Since it's not possible to purchase a fraction of a bottle, we must round up to the nearest whole number. Thus, 20 bottles are required for each color.Therefore, the painter needs 20 bottles of each color to complete the fresco.# 20"},{"question":"A traveler is exploring a city known for its unique buildings and wants to capture the perfect photos.

He leaves New York on the 1st of December and returns on the 1st of April. While in Florida, he goes for a leisurely walk on the beach every day. Mr. Johnson walks 3 miles each day from Monday to Friday and 5 miles each day on Saturday and Sunday. How many total miles does Mr. Johnson walk during his entire stay in Florida?","answer":"To determine the total miles Mr. Johnson walks during his stay in Florida, we need to follow these steps:Step 1: Determine the duration of Mr. Johnson's stay in Florida.- Mr. Johnson leaves New York on December 1st and returns on April 1st.- This means he is in Florida for the entire months of December, January, February, and March.- We need to calculate the total number of days from December 1st to March 31st inclusive.- December has 31 days.- January has 31 days.- February typically has 28 days, but we need to check if it's a leap year. Since the problem doesn't specify a year, we'll assume it's a non-leap year, so February has 28 days.- March has 31 days.Thus, the total number of days Mr. Johnson spends in Florida is:[ 31 text{ (December)} + 31 text{ (January)} + 28 text{ (February)} + 31 text{ (March)} = 121 text{ days} ]Step 2: Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends.Next, we need to determine how many of these days are weekdays and how many are weekends. - A week consists of 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).- To find out how many complete weeks and additional days are in 121 days, we perform the division:[ 121 div 7 = 17 text{ full weeks with a remainder of } 2 text{ days} ]- This means there are 17 full weeks and 2 additional days. In 17 full weeks, there are:  - ( 17 times 5 = 85 ) weekdays  - ( 17 times 2 = 34 ) weekend days- The 2 additional days will complete a week starting with Friday and Saturday:  - So, 1 more weekday (Friday)  - 1 more weekend day (Saturday)Thus, the total number of weekdays and weekend days are:- Total weekdays = ( 85 + 1 = 86 )- Total weekend days = ( 34 + 1 = 35 )Step 3: Calculate total miles walked.- Mr. Johnson walks 3 miles each weekday.- Mr. Johnson walks 5 miles each weekend day.Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays:[ 86 text{ weekdays} times 3 text{ miles/day} = 258 text{ miles} ]And the total miles walked on weekend days:[ 35 text{ weekend days} times 5 text{ miles/day} = 175 text{ miles} ]Step 4: Add the totals.- Total miles walked = miles walked on weekdays + miles walked on weekend days[ 258 text{ miles} + 175 text{ miles} = 433 text{ miles} ]Therefore, the total number of miles Mr. Johnson walks during his stay in Florida is:# 433"},{"question":"Alex is a young soccer player who idolizes Bukayo Saka, one of Arsenal's star players.

The kitchen has a countertop area of 40 square feet. Granite costs 50 per square foot, while quartz costs 65 per square foot. The homeowner is interested in durability and is willing to spend an extra 500 if the material is more durable. However, they can only afford a total renovation cost of 3,000, including the extra cost for durability if needed. What is the most expensive countertop material the homeowner can choose within their budget if they prioritize durability?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the cost of each countertop material, including the additional cost for durability, and check if the total cost fits within the homeowner's budget of 3,000. Let's break it down step-by-step:1. Calculate the Cost of Granite:   - Cost per square foot for granite = 50.   - Total area = 40 square feet.   - Total cost for granite without durability consideration = 50/sq ft * 40 sq ft = 2,000.2. Calculate the Cost of Quartz:   - Cost per square foot for quartz = 65.   - Total area = 40 square feet.   - Total cost for quartz without durability consideration = 65/sq ft * 40 sq ft = 2,600.3. Consider Additional Cost for Durability:   - The homeowner is willing to spend an extra 500 for more durable material.   - We need to determine if either granite or quartz is the more durable option and if it's worth the extra cost.4. Evaluate Total Costs with Durability Premium:   - If granite is chosen for durability, the total cost would be: 2,000 + 500 = 2,500.   - If quartz is chosen for durability, the total cost would be: 2,600 + 500 = 3,100.5. Check Affordability within the Budget:   - The total renovation budget is 3,000.   - Granite with the durability premium costs 2,500, which is within the budget.   - Quartz with the durability premium costs 3,100, which exceeds the budget.6. Determine the Most Expensive Material within the Budget:   - Since the homeowner prioritizes durability and is willing to spend extra for it, and considering the budget constraint, granite with the extra durability cost is within the budget while quartz is not.7. Conclusion:   - The most expensive material the homeowner can afford within their budget, while prioritizing durability, is granite.# Granite"},{"question":"Sarah, a longtime resident of Leeds, takes the bus every day to get around the city.

Jamie says they saw the UFO for exactly 3 minutes, and during that time, they counted 12 blinking lights on the UFO. However, skeptical Alex believes that Jamie is just imagining things and decides to do some calculations to prove it. Alex thinks that if Jamie was imagining, they would have overestimated the number of lights by 25%. If Jamie actually saw 12 blinking lights, how many blinking lights would Alex expect Jamie to have actually seen, according to Alex's theory?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blinking lights Jamie would have actually seen if they overestimated the number by 25%, according to Alex's theory.Let's denote the actual number of blinking lights as ( x ).According to the problem, Jamie counted 12 blinking lights, which Alex believes is an overestimation by 25%.This means that the reported number of lights (12) is 125% of the actual number ( x ). We can express this mathematically as:[ 1.25x = 12 ]To find the actual number of blinking lights ( x ), we need to solve the equation for ( x ):[ x = frac{12}{1.25} ]Now, let's calculate ( x ):[ x = frac{12}{1.25} = frac{12 times 100}{125} = frac{1200}{125} = 9.6 ]Since the number of blinking lights must be a whole number, we will round 9.6 to the nearest whole number, which is 10.Therefore, according to Alex's theory, Jamie would have actually seen 10 blinking lights.# 10"},{"question":"A civil servant working at the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Environment of Sabah is planning a cultural festival that will showcase 5 different traditional dances. Each dance requires 8 performers. If the civil servant wants to invite 3 separate schools to participate equally in the festival, how many performers will each school need to provide?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many performers each of the three schools must provide for the cultural festival.Step 1: Calculate the total number of performers required for the festival.- There are 5 different traditional dances.- Each dance requires 8 performers.- Therefore, the total number of performers needed is:  [  5 text{ dances} times 8 text{ performers per dance} = 40 text{ performers}  ]Step 2: Distribute the total number of performers equally among the 3 schools.- We need to divide the total number of performers (40) by the number of schools (3):  [  frac{40 text{ performers}}{3 text{ schools}} = frac{40}{3} approx 13.33 text{ performers per school}  ]Since the number of performers must be a whole number, we round 13.33 to the nearest whole number. However, in practical situations involving people, we generally cannot have fractional performers. Therefore, each school needs to provide a whole number of performers such that the total is as close to 40 as possible.Step 3: Ensure the total number of performers is exactly 40.- If each school provides 13 performers:  [  13 text{ performers per school} times 3 text{ schools} = 39 text{ performers}  ]  This total is 1 performer short of 40.- If each school provides 14 performers:  [  14 text{ performers per school} times 3 text{ schools} = 42 text{ performers}  ]  This total exceeds 40 by 2 performers.Given that the total must be exactly 40 performers, we need to adjust the distribution:- Two schools can provide 13 performers each, and the third school can provide 14 performers to reach the total of 40.In this distribution:- School 1: 13 performers- School 2: 13 performers- School 3: 14 performersThis distribution respects the requirement of having a total of 40 performers while keeping the numbers as balanced as possible.# 13, 13, 14"},{"question":"Sarah is a professional specializing in foster care and uses data analysis to assess and improve placement outcomes for children.

Over the course of a month, Alex watches a total of 20 horror movies. They notice that every third horror movie they watch leaves them feeling 10% more relaxed due to its cathartic effect. For the remaining movies, they feel 5% more relaxed. By the end of the month, Alex calculates that they feel 100% more relaxed overall. How many of the 20 horror movies left them feeling 10% more relaxed?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's use algebra to determine how many of the 20 horror movies left Alex feeling 10% more relaxed.1. Define Variables:   - Let ( x ) be the number of horror movies that leave Alex feeling 10% more relaxed.   - The remaining ( 20 - x ) movies leave Alex feeling 5% more relaxed.2. Set Up the Equation:   - Every movie that leaves Alex feeling 10% more relaxed contributes 10% to the total relaxation.   - Every movie that leaves Alex feeling 5% more relaxed contributes 5% to the total relaxation.   - The total relaxation increase is 100%.   Therefore, the equation can be set up as follows:   [   10x + 5(20 - x) = 100   ]3. Simplify and Solve the Equation:   - Distribute the 5 into the expression ( 5(20 - x) ):     [     10x + 100 - 5x = 100     ]   - Combine like terms:     [     5x + 100 = 100     ]   - Subtract 100 from both sides:     [     5x = 0     ]   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for ( x ):     [     x = 0     ]4. Interpret the Result:   - The solution ( x = 0 ) means that none of the horror movies left Alex feeling 10% more relaxed. This solution implies that all relaxation increases came from movies that contributed 5% relaxation each.5. Verification:   - If ( x = 0 ), then all 20 movies contributed 5% each to relaxation, resulting in:     [     5 times 20 = 100%     ]   - This matches the given condition of Alex feeling 100% more relaxed overall.# 0"},{"question":"Your cousin runs a vegan bakery and is working on a new innovative recipe with the pastry chef.

According to the problem, Alex wants to buy the same number of classic and modern games, so we have:[ c = m ]Each classic game costs 5, and each modern game costs 15. Therefore, the total cost for ( c ) classic games is ( 5c ) dollars, and the total cost for ( m ) modern games is ( 15m ) dollars. Since ( c = m ), the total cost for both types of games is:[ 5c + 15m = 150 ]Substituting ( c = m ) into the equation, we get:[ 5c + 15c = 150 ][ 20c = 150 ]To find ( c ), divide both sides of the equation by 20:[ c = frac{150}{20} ][ c = 7.5 ]However, ( c ) must be a whole number because Alex can only buy whole games. Therefore, we round ( c ) down to the nearest whole number, which is 7.So, Alex can buy 7 classic games and 7 modern games.Let's verify the cost:- Cost of 7 classic games: ( 7 times 5 = 35 ) dollars- Cost of 7 modern games: ( 7 times 15 = 105 ) dollarsTotal cost: ( 35 + 105 = 140 ) dollarsSince Alex has 150 and spends 140, he has 10 left over. If he buys 8 of each, he would exceed his budget because:- Cost of 8 classic games: ( 8 times 5 = 40 ) dollars- Cost of 8 modern games: ( 8 times 15 = 120 ) dollarsTotal cost: ( 40 + 120 = 160 ) dollars, which exceeds his budget.Thus, the maximum number of classic and modern games Alex can buy while having an equal number of each and staying within budget is 7 of each.# 7"},{"question":"Jamie is a digital animator who is working on a new animated film.

She plans to watch a total of 5 matches, each featuring players from different countries. Each match lasts an average of 90 minutes, and she also spends 30 minutes in between each match talking to fellow fans about the players and the game. If the first match starts at 10:00 AM, what time will she finish watching all the matches and having discussions in between?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent watching the matches and having discussions between them. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:1. Determine the total duration for the matches:   - There are 5 matches.   - Each match lasts 90 minutes.   - Total time for the matches = 5 matches × 90 minutes/match = 450 minutes.2. Determine the total duration for discussions:   - Discussions occur between each pair of consecutive matches.   - Since there are 5 matches, there are 4 intervals for discussions.   - Each discussion lasts 30 minutes.   - Total time for discussions = 4 intervals × 30 minutes/interval = 120 minutes.3. Calculate the total time spent at the tournament:   - Total time = Time for matches + Time for discussions   - Total time = 450 minutes + 120 minutes = 570 minutes.4. Convert total time spent from minutes to hours and minutes:   - 570 minutes = 9 hours and 30 minutes (since 570 ÷ 60 = 9 remainder 30).5. Determine the end time:   - The first match starts at 10:00 AM.   - Add 9 hours and 30 minutes to 10:00 AM.   - 10:00 AM + 9 hours = 7:00 PM.   - 7:00 PM + 30 minutes = 7:30 PM.Therefore, after watching all the matches and having discussions in between, she will finish at:# 7:30 PM"},{"question":"Emily, a recent economics graduate, is passionate about development economics and is inspired by countries improving their educational systems. She learns that in Country A, the literacy rate increased from 70% to 82% over a period of 5 years. During the same period, the number of schools in Country A increased by 250, reaching a total of 1,000 schools. If the increase in the literacy rate is directly proportional to the increase in the number of schools, how many schools were there in Country A 5 years ago?","answer":"To solve the problem, we'll use the concept of direct proportionality. We're given that the increase in literacy rate is directly proportional to the increase in the number of schools. This means:[frac{text{Increase in Literacy Rate}}{text{Initial Literacy Rate}} = frac{text{Increase in Number of Schools}}{text{Initial Number of Schools}}]We need to identify the following components:1. Initial Literacy Rate: 70%2. Final Literacy Rate: 82%3. Increase in Literacy Rate: (82% - 70% = 12%)Let:- ( L_0 ) = Initial number of schools- ( L_1 = 1000 ) (Final number of schools)- Increase in the number of schools = (1000 - L_0)We can set up the proportion as follows:[frac{12}{70} = frac{1000 - L_0}{L_0}]Let’s solve for ( L_0 ):1. Cross-multiply to solve the proportion:[12 cdot L_0 = 70 cdot (1000 - L_0)]2. Distribute the 70 on the right-hand side:[12L_0 = 70000 - 70L_0]3. Add ( 70L_0 ) to both sides to combine like terms:[12L_0 + 70L_0 = 70000 ][82L_0 = 70000]4. Divide both sides by 82 to solve for ( L_0 ):[L_0 = frac{70000}{82}]5. Calculate the division:[L_0 approx 853.66]Since the number of schools must be a whole number, we'll round to the nearest whole number. Because the context of the problem suggests a whole number, it implies:[L_0 = 854]Therefore, the number of schools in Country A 5 years ago was approximately 854.#854"},{"question":"Alex is a big fan of Damien Done and decides to create a playlist featuring his favorite songs from Damien Done's albums.

He wants to cover 5 different eras equally: the Kievan Rus', the Tsardom of Russia, the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and modern-day Russia. He has compiled a total of 60 significant events and decides that each era should have an equal number of events presented to avoid any revisionism. However, he realizes that 3 extra events should be included specifically in the Soviet Union era to cover its complexity. How many events will Mr. Ivanov allocate to each era, including the additional ones for the Soviet Union era?","answer":"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of events each era will receive before considering the additional events for the Soviet Union.1. Divide the total number of events equally among the five eras:   [   text{Total events} = 60   ]   Since Mr. Ivanov wants to cover 5 different eras equally, divide the total number of events by 5:   [   text{Events per era (initially)} = frac{60}{5} = 12   ]   So, each era would initially receive 12 events.2. Allocate additional events to the Soviet Union era:   Mr. Ivanov wants to add 3 extra events specifically to the Soviet Union era. Therefore, the number of events for the Soviet Union era becomes:   [   text{Events for Soviet Union era} = 12 + 3 = 15   ]3. Determine the final allocation of events for each era:   - Kievan Rus': 12 events   - Tsardom of Russia: 12 events   - Russian Empire: 12 events   - Soviet Union: 15 events (including the 3 extra events)   - Modern-day Russia: 12 eventsNow, let's ensure that the total number of events is still 60:[12 + 12 + 12 + 15 + 12 = 63]This means we need to adjust our understanding because we allocated 3 extra events to the Soviet Union, which were not initially part of the 60 events. Therefore, we need to remove 3 events from the original allocation of 60 to accommodate the extra ones for the Soviet Union. To correctly balance, we need to:1. Recalculate by accounting for the extra 3 events within the total of 60:   Subtract the additional 3 events for the Soviet Union from the total initially allocated:   [   text{Total events to distribute equally among other eras} = 60 - 3 = 57   ]2. Distribute the remaining 57 events equally among the 5 eras:   [   text{Events per era (excluding extra for Soviet Union)} = frac{57}{5} approx 11.4   ]   Since we can't allocate a fraction of an event, the original problem requires an adjustment or clarification as it doesn't perfectly divide.

Determine the number of lingerie sets sold.   - Lisa received 250 lingerie sets.   - She plans to sell 80% of these sets.   - Number of sets sold = 80% of 250 = 0.80 × 250 = 200 sets.2. Calculate the revenue from selling the lingerie sets.   - Lisa sells each set for 45.   - Revenue from selling 200 sets = 200 × 45 = 9,000.3. Calculate the cost of purchasing the lingerie sets.   - Each set costs Lisa 15 to purchase.   - Cost for 250 sets = 250 × 15 = 3,750.4. Calculate the profit.   - Profit is defined as revenue minus cost.   - Profit = Revenue - Cost = 9,000 - 3,750 = 5,250.Therefore, Lisa's profit from this shipment is 5,250.# 5,250"},{"question":"Dr. Thompson, a fellow historian, is planning a research trip to a historical region.
