It is characterized by pervasive and recurrent episodes of low mood and motivation, despair and anhedonia. Despite the availability of several classes of antidepressants, more than a third of patients are either unremitting or relapsing (Bambico and Gobbi, 2008, Zisook et al., 2008). Antidepressants that are known to act on the brain's monoamine systems are limited by a delayed onset of therapeutic action. Moreover, the pathophysiology of depression is far from being fully elucidated. Multiple levels of dysfunction have been proposed, including impaired synaptic transmission of the monoamine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) (Bambico et al., 2009a), which is produced by the midbrain raphe 5-HT neurons (Dahlström and Fuxe, 1964, Descarries et al., 1982), and known to regulate emotional, vegetative and neuroendocrine functions (Holmes, 2008). Not surprisingly, drugs that augment 5-HT transmission, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are most preferred first-line treatments (Vaswani et al., 2003). Their chronic application facilitates exocytosis of 5-HT and/or increases 5-HT synaptic availability in corticolimbic regions extensively innervated by the raphe. Many of these forebrain structures, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala are implicated in mood regulation and stress adaptation (Holmes, 2008). On the other hand, chronic stress that is known to be a risk factor for depression impairs presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT transmission (Bambico et al., 2009b). Also, acute or repeated 5-HT or tryptophan depletion precipitates anxiety/depression-like behaviors in animals (Blokland et al., 2002) and mood-lowering effects in humans (for review, Young and Leyton, 2002), exacerbates anxiogenic responses in human subjects (Miller et al., 2000), and triggers relapse in depressive patients (for review, Van der Does, 2001).","answer":"Major depression, characterized by low mood and motivation, despair, and lack of pleasure, is one of the most common mental health disorders. Even though several drugs exist to treat it, more than a third of people who have it don't get relief. However, depression isn't fully understood. The go-to treatment is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRI drugs. Parts of the front of the brain regulate mood and response to stress, but chronic stress can impair the brain. A lack of tryptophan - an amino acid - can also trigger depression."},{"question":"Create a couple of paragraphs of about 150-200 words talking about walruses and walrus facts for a kindergarten class?","answer":"Have you guys ever seen a walrus before? No? Here’s a picture of one. Walruses are mammals. And you can see that they have very long tusks, which look like teeth but are actually used to break holes in the ice so they can breathe! Walruses also use their tusks to help haul themselves out of the water onto the ice and even to fight other walruses! So where do you think walruses live? That’s right, in and around the ice. In fact, walruses migrate, which means they move with ice floes. But walruses never move too far away from land because that’s where their food lives. They eat mollusks and other animals that don’t have backbones. They can go deep into the icy water to eat. Some walruses go as deep as 20-30 meters, which is 100 feet, or almost 20 adults long! In the Arctic, people have always used walrus meat to eat, and they carve the tusks to make art and trade them with other people.

She wasn’t scared of flying - or at least, she hadn’t been growing up. At that moment though, Samantha was sure she’d die of fright.She felt a presence and turned her head to the side to see a red-haired stranger put his carry-on in the compartment. He settled into the seat beside her once he was done and gave her a nod of acknowledgment. Sakura nodded back, taken aback by his appearance. He was handsome, sort of. With sharp, green eyes lined with dark bruises attributed to a possible case of insomnia. His mouth was set in a neutral, blank line.

'And that's something that doesn't matter, either to you or me. I've never been there, and I'm never going, nor you either, if you've got any sense at all. Don't ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here's our backwater at last, where we're going to lunch.'Leaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first sight like a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either edge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful that the Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, 'O my! O my! O my!'The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket. The Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, 'O my! O my!' at each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, 'Now, pitch in, old fellow!' and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had started his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people WILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days ago.","answer":"As the bird soared above, it observed the Mole's unease and his swift decision to abandon any mention of impending trouble, aware that it violated animal etiquette. The topic was dropped promptly.Curiosity piqued the bird's interest as the Mole inquired about what lay beyond the Wild Wood. The Rat responded, describing a realm of indistinct blues and dimness, where hazy shapes resembling hills or mere illusions blended with what might be smoke from distant towns or simply wisps of cloud.The Rat dismissed it, asserting that the Wide World beyond the Wild Wood held no significance for them. It was a place neither had ventured into nor desired to if they possessed any semblance of reason. The Rat implored the Mole to never bring it up again. With that, they arrived at their secluded backwater, their chosen spot for lunch.Leaving the mainstream behind, they entered what initially appeared to be a small, enclosed lake. Verdant grass sloped down on either side, revealing glimpses of snakelike brown tree roots beneath the tranquil surface of the water. Up ahead, the silver cascade and frothy churn of a weir greeted them, accompanied by the incessant drip of a restless mill wheel. The mill wheel, in turn, supported a gray-gabled mill house that emanated a comforting, muffled hum, intermittently interrupted by cheerful, clear voices. The sight was so breathtaking that the Mole could only lift both forepaws in awe, gasping, \\"O my! O my! O my!\\"The Rat skillfully guided the boat to the bank, securing it firmly. He assisted the still unsteady Mole in stepping ashore and retrieved the luncheon basket. As a favor, the Mole requested permission to unpack the contents himself. The Rat gladly obliged, sprawling on the grass, enjoying a moment of rest while his enthused companion laid out the tablecloth and arranged the mysterious packets one by one. With each new revelation, the Mole continued to gasp in amazement, exclaiming, \\"O my! O my!\\" At last, when everything was prepared, the Rat encouraged, \\"Now, dig in, my dear friend!\\" The Mole eagerly complied, grateful for the invitation, as he had been engrossed in spring cleaning since the early hours of the morning, forsaking both sustenance and rest. Since that distant time, which now felt like countless days ago, he had undergone a multitude of experiences."},{"question":"Turn this article into a list of questions and answers.A Partner Visa UK, also known as a UK Spouse Visa, is a settlement visa that allows you to live together with your British partner in the UK for up to 30 months.

There are a lot of card games you might enjoy. Here are some that are similar to Hearts:- Euchre. Four players are required for this game, and they're paired up into two teams. It's a relatively simple game, but what makes it unique is that it's played with only a partial deck. Most people use a 24-card deck, while others use a British Euchre set with 25 cards. The object of the game is to be the first team to reach a certain number of points, and you win these points by grabbing tricks. - Spades. This game is often played with two teams of two, but it can also be played with just two players. During each hand, players estimate how many tricks they think they can take with the hand they've been dealt - keeping in mind that spades are wildcards. Get ready to wager against your opponents!- Oh Pshaw. This game doesn't require partners, so it can be played by three to seven players.

I will be there for 48 hours and hope to visit 4 attractions across the city.","answer":"No problem, here are 4 places to see Modern and Contemporary Art in Berlin:1. Contemporary Fine Arts - Berlin’s best-known gallery space, Contemporary Fine Arts has been showing distinctive works of art since opening in 1992. Run by Nicole Hackert and Bruno Brunnet, the gallery can be found in a Chipperfield-designed building next to Museum Island. The gallery boasts works from contemporary giants from around the globe.2. East Side Gallery - This outdoor, mile-long gallery is made up of the remnants of the eastern Berlin wall. It displays over 100 anarchistic works of street art from a collective of local artists. The gallery is slowly degrading due to a lack of funding, making this an essential stop on your tour.3. König Galerie - Johann König is one of Berlin’s contemporary art revolutionists. Opening his gallery at the tender age of 21 in 2002, König invited his artist friend Jeppe Hein to install a kinetic work that involved a wrecking ball that would smash into the walls of the gallery, destroying the space with simultaneously giving it purpose. He remains a leading iconoclast of Berlin's modern art scene with his current space located at St. Agnes Church, an imposing Brutalist structure.4. KW Institute for Contemporary Art - Set in the unusual surrounding of a former margarine factory, Kunst Werke has been a stronghold for supporting new talent since the early 1990s. Today, curator Ellen Blumenstein promotes a gentler approach to the exhibitions offering a more audience-friendly program solidifying KW at the heart of Berlin’s cultural agenda."},{"question":"My burglar alarm is faulty and keeps tripping randomly at night.

The rat always tried to steal food items from the store or the kitchen, while the cat always tried to eat the cat. One day, the old lady left the two animals at home alone. The rat as usual ran into the store room to nibble some food and the cat chased the rat. The rat ran over the food sacs and accidentally hit a keg of oil. The oil spilled out and caused the ground to become extremely slippery. The cat tried to keep chasing the rat, but he kept slipping and falling. Watching this caused the rat to laugh for a while before he decided to run back to his tiny hole. But the sole of the rat’s feet was covered with oil, so he also slipped and fell. This caused the cat to laugh. Both animals stopped chasing each other and began to laugh.The old woman returned home and saw the two animals laughing. She was quite perplexed as to how the two animals weren’t fighting each other as usual. The old lady sent the two animals out of the store room so she could clean the mess.

"},{"question":"What are the correct options in the following MCQs about the passage on the economy?1. What are the two signs of a slowdown in the economy?a) A decline in manufacturing output and an increase in retail sales.b) A decline in retail sales and an increase in manufacturing output.c) A decline in both retail sales and manufacturing output.d) An increase in both retail sales and manufacturing output.2. Why is the decline in retail sales seen as ominous?a) It could lead to inflation.b) It could lead to an increase in borrowing costs.c) It could result in companies cutting back on employees.d) It could result in companies increasing production.3. What is the reason for the inflation that has put household budgets under pressure?a) A decrease in consumer spending.b) An increase in production costs for goods and services.c) A decrease in production costs for goods and services.d) An increase in consumer savings.Shoppers are buying less and factories are making less—in other words, the economy is slowing down, and might even have entered a recession. Signs of a slowdown came on two fronts in reports Wednesday. Retail sales fell 1.1% in December, as consumers cut their spending in 10 out of the 13 major categories tracked by the Census Bureau.1 Businesses also hit the brakes, with U.S. manufacturing output falling 1.3% in December, the Federal Reserve said.2 Both were the second month of slowdowns in a row. The decline in retail sales is especially ominous because if consumers and businesses both continue cutting back, the economy could slow to the point that it enters a recession. When people curtail their spending, companies cut back on employees that make the good or service that isn’t selling. Economists have been predicting for months that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes could push the economy into a recession by making it too expensive to borrow money.  If that does happen, the current job market where positions are plentiful—so far a bright spot for workers—could take a turn for the worse, economists said.Taken together, the day’s data “reinforces the message that recession is on its way and we could in fact already be in it.” said James Knightley, chief U.S. economist at ING, in a commentary. “Companies are going to increasingly adopt defensive strategies so the strong jobs numbers—pretty much the only decent set of numbers right now—cannot continue in this environment,”Inflation is partly responsible for the slowdown. Prices for products and services have rapidly increased since 2021, putting household budgets under pressure. Consumers have tapped into their savings and made purchases on credit cards to maintain their spending habits despite the price increases. But they may not be able to sustain this any longer. Not only that but household finances have been caught in the crossfire of the Federal Reserve’s war against that very inflation. The central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rate by 4.25 percentage points since March, a move that’s raised costs on consumer borrowing for things like credit cards and car loans.3NoteThe federal funds rate heavily influences interest rates throughout the economy, including those on credit cards and car loans, but it’s not the rate you get on those loans. Banks typically charge a set amount above their so-called prime rate. The prime rate moves in tandem with the fed funds rate, but it’s typically about 3 percentage points higher. “American consumers are tightening their belts in the face of still-high inflation, rising credit costs, and shrinking wealth,” Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a commentary. Businesses are tightening their belts too, and have cut production across a broad range of items from cars to computers to clothes, according to the Fed’s data on industrial production—an indication that they are bracing for reduced demand for their goods. “It is evident that the manufacturing sector is already in recession,” economists at Wells Fargo Securities said in a commentary.The Fed’s interest rate hikes and subsequent slowing of the economy appear to have had the intended effect. Inflation has slowed significantly in recent months, according to data on consumer prices. Not only that, but the producer price index, which measures wholesale prices, fell 0.5%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said—and that could translate into lower prices on store shelves.","answer":"Answer: C. The two indicators of a slowdown in the economy are a decline in retail sales and manufacturing output.Answer: C. The decline in retail sales is considered ominous because it could result in companies cutting back on their employees.Answer: B.

Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it.In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by London's Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.Houdini made several movies but quit acting when it failed to bring in money.

We need to cut taxes for the wealthy and give them more incentives to invest in this country.

Let's also talk about foreign policy. As someone who has traveled the world and rubbed elbows with the most powerful people on the planet, I know how to negotiate with foreign leaders.

Is the sport of basketball artistic?","answer":"Although basketball may not be viewed as artistic when a team of players is all working together and in sync, the sport of basketball can be a thing of beauty. There is a timing and rhythm to the way the ball moves, how players make cuts and run down the floor, the perfect timing of passes, and when a player shoots in rhythm, it can all look and feel like a classic Renaissance painting to a discerning eye when watching.The tactics of basketball can be thought of as reminiscent of war. The player who is dribbling the basketball wants to attack the defender aggressively and make him lose his balance or even embarrass him if the battle is very heated. Once the goal of passing the first defender is achieved, the player dribbling the ball may be able to drive all the way to the rim, shoot a mid-range shot open or defended, keep dribbling past another defender to get a better shot, pass to a teammate on the three-point line, or pass to another player running towards the basket. The possibilities are endless, and those are just examples of when things go right for the offense.As a defender, you want to stand your ground and not allow the offense to go around you or back you down and shoot over you if you are both close to the basket. You can choose to play with strength or quickness as you try to disrupt whatever the person handling the ball is trying to do. It is important to be light on your feet and not let your weight transfer to your heels or a skilled ballhandler will be able to go around you or make you further lose your balance.There is so much strategy to the game of basketball, and always more to learn and study as a seasoned watcher and/or player is able to pick up more knowledge about the game. It is a glorious thing to watch and experience the sport of basketball."},{"question":"Hi, I could use some suggestions on the best full-size professional tripods used for photography.

"},{"question":"What are some creative ways I can save money on everyday expenses, I need five. ","answer":"Here are five creative ways you can save money.1. Join loyalty programs.Oftentimes, people shop at the same places for regular purchases. An example is shopping at the same grocery store every week. If you are doing this, determining whether the places you shop have loyalty programs that reward consistent customers is well worth your time. These loyalty programs will allow you to gain rewards for future shops. In the long run, this can save you lots of money. If your grocery store doesn't offer a loyalty program, it's worth checking the closest one that does. Weighing up the cost of extra fuel and time to get there will help you to decide if it's worth trying somewhere new. 2. Use cash-back credit cards. If you are responsible with money and do not have problems paying off credit cards, look into getting a high cashback credit card. Like loyalty programs, this will help you get extra rewards for simply doing what you are already doing. Extra money with minimal extra work is always good when trying to save money. Often times you will receive cashback on just about anything, so using your cash-back card for all your purchases and then paying the balance straight off could lead to great returns over a long period. It is essential to remember to pay off your card as the interest you gain through not doing so will likely exceed your cash-back, leaving you worse off. 3. Cancel subscriptions you are not using. Check your monthly outgoings and see if there are any subscriptions you are not using. If you find any, it would be best off to cancel them. This will mean a monthly bill is removed, which is excellent as these monthly bills can add up to a lot over time. The quicker you cancel, the faster you save. Many TV or Telephone will even offer a lower rate to customers considering leaving. This means that contacting and informing them of your plans to leave could mean they offer you a significant discount to stay. Doing this yearly can really help to keep your bills down in the long run. There is no harm in saying you will leave unless your bills go down. They can only say no. 4. DIY where possible. Doing DIY instead of hiring a tradesman can really save you a lot of money. These days it couldn't be easier to find tutorials and how-to videos online for most DIY projects. Ensure you watch these videos before purchasing any materials or tools to ensure you are confident in completing the task to a high standard. If you have a lot of time on your hands, this is one of the best ways to save money as you also learn a valuable skill that you can use as a second income. DIY doesn't just mean working at home, though. It can even mean taking your own coffee or lunch at home instead of buying it out for a higher price.5. Set up automatic payments for bills. Life is tough, and it's hard to remember everything. You shouldn't be charged fees when you forget to pay a bill. But unfortunately, late fees are a fact of life, and sometimes they can damage your bank balance. By setting up automatic payments for your bills, you can ensure you never get charged late fees or accrue interest on any account you may have. An added bonus is that this will save you time meaning you have more to make money.

This will be concerning my pay.","answer":"Here are five tips to use when negotiating your pay. 1. Know your worth.Before entering negotiations regarding your pay, you must know what you are worth. Knowing what you are worth to a company will give you a base for negotiations. It can be tough to see what you are worth to your company, but luckily, you can use sites like glassdoor.com and payscale.com to get a better idea of what people in similar roles and companies to you do earn. This knowledge will mean you can confidently suggest a number in line with the market rate. Offering a rate identical to others in your field will allow you to have confidence that the company will not be able to find someone better without at least paying an equal rate. Hiring new staff is often tedious and not cost-effective, so forcing your employer into this decision can work in your favor. 2. Use good timing. Timing is everything in negotiations, which is never more true than in salary negotiations. Utilizing good timing can be the difference between a successful salary negotiation and an awkward conversation with your boss. Try to initiate salary negotiations while the company is doing well and you are being seen to impact that success substantially. A salesman who isn't hitting targets regularly would be ill-advised to open negotiations regarding salary. It may be that they can get a higher wage but unlikely to be sufficient if they don't have the data to back up their claimed performances. If you've just completed a profitable project and been a key player, it's probably a great time to strike while the iron is hot and ask for a pay rise. 3. Be realistic.It is necessary to know your worth and understand your value to a company, but remaining realistic is also pivotal. If you aim for the stars and ask for 50% more than you are worth, you can expect your employer to grow frustrated and unsympathetic to your request. The better tactic is to have a number in mind you would like, then add a small % to it so that you can work down to your ideal number. This will allow your employer some wiggle room to negotiate and feel they are not being played. It is essential to back your realistic request up with why you deserve it and what others are getting. 4. Don't ask too often. As stated above, alienating and frustrating your employer is not a good idea. If you do this, you risk no negotiations and just a simple no. This will leave you in no better position than you were before. That is precisely why it is essential not to ask too frequently for a pay rise. Think of a similar situation in the car when a child asks the parents are we there yet over and over. The parents become frustrated and eventually will stop answering. The same will happen with your employer. They will revert to a standard no answer if you continuously ask for something. Instead, be sure to research what you are worth and strike while the iron is hot, as we described in point 2. 5. Don't be afraid to ask. It seems silly to put this point straight after point 4. However, the fact is valid and should be discussed. While asking too often is not advised, not asking at all will probably get you nowhere. While this can't be said for all companies, most are reluctant to hand out pay raises regularly and will wait until they are asked or forced. That's why it is crucial that if you feel you deserve a pay rise and the circumstances dictate one, you stand up for yourself and ask. The worst thing they can say is no. If you don't think you deserve a pay raise, that's fine. Don't ask till you do. But if you have been stuck at the same rate for years and are integral to our company's operations, then speak up and ask for your worth.

The federal government and all 50 states have enacted anti-stalking statutes, yet there is still no universally accepted definition of what constitutes stalking. When I talk about stalking, I'm referring to a pattern of behavior carried out by one person against another which is intended to harass, intimidate, or terrorize the victim—and usually does.Cyberstalking occurred in about 25 percent of cases studied—which seems low to me. If my suspicion is correct, the reasons for the low numbers arise from the data collection methodology, the population being studied, and other reasons that I won’t digress on here. But it seems likely that cyberstalking is only likely to increase, since the potential for surveillance and harassment is huge while the risk to the stalker is relatively small.Former spouses and paramours are the most common targets of stalking, followed by victims being stalked by an acquaintance. Only about one in four incidents involves stalking by a stranger. Most stalkers are men—70 to 80 percent, as reported by various studies—but one specific type of stalking is perpetrated almost exclusively by women.

Ptolemy secured control of Egypt and the Land of Israel. Seleucus grabbed Syria and Asia Minor, and Antigonus took Greece.The Land of Israel was thus sandwiched between two of the rivals and, for the next 125 years, Seleucids and Ptolemies battled for this prize. The former finally won in 198 B.C. when Antiochus III defeated the Egyptians and incorporated Judea into his empire. Initially, he continued to allow the Jews autonomy, but after a stinging defeat at the hands of the Romans he began a program of Hellenization that threatened to force the Jews to abandon their monotheism for the Greeks' paganism. Antiochus backed down in the face of Jewish opposition to his effort to introduce idols in their temples, but his son, Antiochus IV, who inherited the throne in 176 B.C. resumed his father's original policy without excepting the Jews. A brief Jewish rebellion only hardened his views and led him to outlaw central tenets of Judaism such as the Sabbath and circumcision, and defile the holy Temple by erecting an altar to the god Zeus, allowing the sacrifice of pigs, and opening the shrine to non-Jews.The Jewish HammerThough many Jews had been seduced by the virtues of Hellenism, the extreme measures adopted by Antiochus helped unite the people. When a Greek official tried to force a priest named Mattathias to make a sacrifice to a pagan god, the Jew murdered the man. Predictably, Antiochus began reprisals, but in 167 BCE the Jews rose up behind Mattathias and his five sons and fought for their liberation.The family of Mattathias became known as the Maccabees, from the Hebrew word for \\"hammer,\\" because they were said to strike hammer blows against their enemies. Jews refer to the Maccabees, but the family is more commonly known as the Hasmoneans.Like other rulers before him, Antiochus underestimated the will and strength of his Jewish adversaries and sent a small force to put down the rebellion. When that was annihilated, he led a more powerful army into battle only to be defeated. In 164 BCE, Jerusalem was recaptured by the Maccabees and the Temple purified, an event that gave birth to the holiday of Chanukah.Jews Regain Their IndependenceIt took more than two decades of fighting before the Maccabees forced the Seleucids to retreat from the Land of Israel. By this time Antiochus had died and his successor agreed to the Jews' demand for independence. In the year 142 BCE, after more than 500 years of subjugation, the Jews were again masters of their own fate.When Mattathias died, the revolt was led by his son Judas, or Judah Maccabee, as he is often called. By the end of the war, Simon was the only one of the five sons of Mattathias to survive and he ushered in an 80-year period of Jewish independence in Judea, as the Land of Israel was now called. The kingdom regained boundaries not far short of Solomon's realm and Jewish life flourished.The Hasmoneans claimed not only the throne of Judah, but also the post of High Priest. This assertion of religious authority conflicted with the tradition of the priests coming from the descendants of Moses' brother Aaron and the tribe of Levi.It did not take long for rival factions to develop and threaten the unity of the kingdom. Ultimately, internal divisions and the appearance of yet another imperial power were to put an end to Jewish independence in the Land of Israel for nearly two centuries.","answer":"After Alexander, the Great died in 323 BCE, three of his generals fought over the Middle East. Antiochus III took full control in 198 BCE and brought Judea into his empire. Though initially granting Jews religious autonomy, he eventually tried to force Hellenism on the Jews. Jewish opposition forced him to back down, but his son Antiochus IV enforced the policy upon inheriting the throne in 176 BCE. He outlawed the Sabbath and circumcision and defiled the Temple by erecting an altar to Zeus where pigs were sacrificed, all things abhorrent to Jews.Antiochus' extremism united the people, until eventually a Greek official attempted to force a Jew named Matthias Hasmonean to make a sacrifice to a pagan god, and Matthias murdered the official instead. Antiochus retaliated, but the Jews fought back for liberation behind Mattathias and his five sons who became known as the Maccabees (the Hebrew word for “hammer”). Underestimating Jewish resolve and strength, Antiochus sent a small force to quelch the rebellion only to have them annihilated. He then took a powerful army into battle only to suffer the same result. The Maccabees recaptured Jerusalem in 164 BCE, an event retold on the holiday of Chanukah as its origin story.Two decades later the Maccabees forced the Greeks out of Judea and won their independence.

Fill in as many details as you want.","answer":"The main character is a woman in her late twenties who is slowly being stalked by something. She doesn't know what it is, but it has been following her, hiding behind corners and in the shadows for a few days now. Something had happened a few days ago that drew the monster to the protagonist and caused it to latch onto her, but she is unaware of that in those first few days. The monster continues to pursue her, slowly, so slowly. The main character doesn't know what to do to get the monster to stop following her. It always stays a distance away and has not acted aggressively, yet. She hasn't slept well and she knows if she talks about it to anyone they either won't believe her or think she is crazy.She turns to the internet to find some answers and begins to find clues and piece together what is happening to her by reading through accounts of \\"supernatural occurrences\\" and things people have discussed in chatrooms concerning weird experiences. She finally figures out what the thing is and what she accidentally did to attract it to her. But she hasn't figured out how to make it stop yet. She must work fast and think hard because the monster is unrelenting in its pursuit."},{"question":"Write an article about ways to fix up your house if you're planning to sell it so that you can get top dollar. Include a list of quick fixes that would be helpful to a homeowner. Keep the word count under 400 words.","answer":"Selling your home and moving on can be beneficial but you’ll want to get top dollar for it. If you don’t have 30,000 or 40,000 to invest but want to increase the likelihood of selling quickly, some quick fixes can help. Below are 4 quick and easy ways to improve your home’s appearance.1.\\tRemove clutter. If possible, rent a storage unit and pack all the stuff away into boxes and get it out of the house. Pack up old books, videos, trophies, photos, and other memorabilia, and take that stuff to a local self-storage facility. Leave just a few nice pieces of pottery and wall hangings that will dress the place up, but not overwhelm it.2.\\tUpdate your kitchen. Potential home buyers will check this room out very carefully. They look at the age of cabinets, the condition of flooring and countertops, and the overall feel of the kitchen. You can reface or repaint cabinet fronts for just a few hundred dollars. Countertops are expensive to replace, but if you have the budget for them, quartz or granite countertops are a good selling feature. 3.\\tFreshen the bath. Next to your kitchen, the bathrooms are the second most important area of the home to most buyers. Bathroom renovations can be pricey and if it’s small and cramped, home buyers will often just mark it off their list as too much work. Though expanding a bathroom can get quite expensive, there are a few ways to make it look larger and updated. 4.\\tCurb appeal. Curb appeal can be created very easily and for just a few hundred dollars. If your front door is old-looking, put a fresh coat of paint on it. Shutters can be purchased for the windows across the front of the house to give it a whole new vibe. Try to find a color that blends well with your home’s exterior. Clear out flower beds and plant some lovely flowers."},{"question":"Write a poem telling a story about a dog and a frog using the \\"og\\" phonic.","answer":"There once was a frog.His name was Nog.He lived in a bogUnder a log.One day, Nog went for a jogAnd ran into a dog.The dog's name was Hog.He said to the frog,\\"I got lost in the fog.\\"This couldn't stand for the frog.So he invited him to his logAnd posted on his blog:\\"Missing dog.\\"The human of HogDid run to the bogAnd the dog said to the frog,\\"Thank goodness you jog.\\""},{"question":"Write a description for my movie blog as if you are a haughty celebrity.

Global warming has brought about serious consequences such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, deforestation, and species loss. But we, as individuals, can slow down this destructive force by implementing sustainable actions within our communities.Here are six simple yet impactful actions to fight climate change locally:1. Reduce emissions: Use your car less, and opt for sustainable transportation like biking or public transit. Choose trains over airplanes for long-distance travel. Remember, even a tiny speed  increases significantly raise CO2 emissions and expenses.2.

The five words are: Utmost, Hungry, Open-minded, Honest and Balanced. Make sure to include details on how you had to teach yourself some things since you didn't have a father growing up and how your mother told you to do the best you could in everything you do.","answer":"The top five words that best describe me are:-Utmost-Hungry-Open-minded-Honest-Balanced.One of the most useful life lessons I live by was taught by my mother. She would always repeat to me to do my absolute best in everything I do. She would make it a point that although regrets in life are going to be inevitable, those who do their utmost each day can turn those regrets into opportunities. This lesson of doing the best you could in everything you do has always been with me and carried me through darker times throughout my life. I have a dream of working at a hedge fund, but it is not the dream that pulls me. I have a fear of being mediocre, but that is not what pushes or motivates me. As someone who was born and raised in a single-family household, I did not have a father nor any father-figure substitute and therefore had to learn how to fill some of the gaps in my upbringing. For example, I had to teach myself how to tie a tie for my first job interview or teach myself that black dress socks are usually less appropriate when paired with navy dress pants. I seize each day because I am hungry to become the best version of myself. Nevertheless, I maintain an open mind for opportunities and to be accepting of other people with differences. I also maintain an open mind inward toward myself, self-reflecting and constantly maturing my dreams of working at a hedge fund. Being both outwardly and inwardly open-minded has opened more doors for me, and has consistently translated into some important successes for me in the past. However, the most important standard I hold myself to is maintaining a clean conscience. Personally, this means that I am honest in the most doubtful of times and particularly when it is not in my best self-interest to do so. I am nothing if I am anything but honest. Against the backdrop of everything I elaborated about myself, more importantly, I strive to live a balanced life. Despite being focused on my career, I maintain a healthy balance between friends, family, work and education. I also maintain an internal balance, between logical thinking versus creative activities. This lifestyle grounds me in reality and keeps me happy."},{"question":"I hear what you're saying but I can't help but feel like I'm not good enough to do this.","answer":"Peter, you are doing amazing.

I tossed the bag over my right shoulder and jogged toward the dugout. As I got close, I pulled the bag down and leaned it up against the wall. I grabbed my glove and my bat out of the bag and brought them into the dugout with me. I was pretty early for the game still. Only the coach and a couple of my teammates were in the dugout.\\"Howdy, Paul,\\" said Coach, \\"I've got you playing second base again today. You can go ahead and get some stretching and long toss in with James.\\"\\"Sweet, sounds good, Coach.\\" I grabbed my glove and jogged quickly toward the outfield where James was already standing. I'll be honest. I was a little bit upset that Coach had me playing second base. I was hoping that he'd soon let me play shortstop again. Before I joined this team, I had only ever played shortstop. I was fast and had a really strong arm. On my old team, I was one of the best players. That was one reason we'd joined this new travel team.  My parents wanted me to play with a more competitive team so I could get better experience and coaching. I missed a lot of my old teammates. A lot of them were friends that I still hung out with sometimes. But I had to admit that it was probably good for me to play with this new team. We won a lot of games, and everything felt a little bit more serious. My newer teammates were still nice, but I hadn't really made any friends yet.

How quickly you react to events in video games depends on your hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye or eye-hand coordination refers to your eyes and hands working simultaneously to solve your situation. You can improve your hand-eye coordination by playing sports, playing more video games, practicing juggling, playing cornhole, painting, or any activity requiring you to use your hands and eyes simultaneously.2) Practice your aim. Aiming is a big part of most games. FPS games are extremely popular, and they rely heavily on aiming. You can practice aiming by playing custom games against AIs, using practice ranges, and changing your settings to match your play style better.3) Fix your crosshair. Everyone has a different play style. To understand yours better, try experimenting with the crosshair you use. Changing your crosshair will improve your aim and help you become a better gamer.4) Learn more about the game. Whatever games you're playing, you need to understand them. You cannot improve at the game if you don't know why certain actions are good or bad. For example, if you died, analyze why you died. Was it bad positioning? Were you not listening closely enough? You'll become a better gamer by analyzing the game and learning more about the ins and outs of it,5) Discover your strengths and weaknesses. Every gamer has strengths and weaknesses, no matter what game they're playing. Some players are naturally gifted at aiming, while others are not. Some gamers are gifted with game sense, while others are not. Determine what your strengths and weaknesses are, and work on your weaknesses. If you can, try working on your weaknesses in an area where you're strong. For example, if you have good positioning but a bad aim, try improving your aim by positioning yourself in an area you feel more comfortable practicing your aim."},{"question":"What are three things I can do in Two Harbors, Minnesota?

Can you suggest to me some common mistakes you should avoid before creating business cards and explain how to avoid each?","answer":"Sure! A business card is your company’s identity. Here are some common mistakes you should avoid before creating business cards:1.\\tOutdated Information: Don't give off a bad impression by having information on your card that is no longer accurate. Order new cards if necessary.2.\\tMisprints and Typos: Grammatical errors and typos can make your business appear unprofessional. Always proofread your card before printing.3.\\tImage Quality: High-resolution images are essential for clear printing. Avoid pixelated or blurry images that can detract from your card's design.4.\\tPoor-Quality Card Stock: Selecting the appropriate card stock is critical. Using flimsy or low-quality paper can make your business appear cheap and unreliable.5.\\tUnreadable Text or Tiny Print: A well-designed card shouldn't compromise readability. Avoid using hard-to-read fonts or tiny prints that make it difficult for customers to read your contact details.6.\\tFocus on the Value: Your business card should communicate what problems you can solve and what value you provide to potential customers.7.\\tLack of Branding: Building brand recognition is key to differentiating yourself from competitors. Make sure your card reflects your branding elements, such as your color scheme and logo design.8.\\tVisual Clutter: Avoid overwhelming your card with too many graphics, images, or text. Create enough white space to keep your designs clean and readable."},{"question":"Who is Gilbert Baker and what's his claim to fame?","answer":"Gilbert Baker was a famous political activist, designer and flag-maker, and is most well-known for creating the Rainbow Flag in 1978 in San Francisco. He never trademarked the flag so that it could be freely reproduced and flown around San Francisco and the world. He is also known as \\"the gay Betsy Ross.\\" Baker is also known for the drag ensembles that he sewed himself and that he wore to many protests and celebrations beginning in the 1970s. In a June 12, 2018 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Charley Beal, one of Baker's friends and the creative projects manager for the Baker estate, said \\"Gilbert knew the power of fashion in a 'Devil Wears Prada' kind of way. He used that power to make statements, quite often political statements.\\" "},{"question":"Summarize this text as if you were explaining it to a 5 year old:\\"Muscles such as biceps, pectorals and quadriceps are called skeletal muscles because they attach to the skeleton to generate motion. Skeletal muscles are composed of very long, thin cells that include the full complement of organelles needed for general cellular functions. In addition, more than 90 percent of the total volume of a skeletal muscle cell is composed of muscle proteins, including the contractile proteins actin and myosin. When a muscle cell is activated by its nerve cell, the interaction of actin and myosin generates force through so-called power strokes. The total force depends on the sum of all the power strokes occurring simultaneously within all of the cells of a muscle.The exact mechanism by which exercise enhances strength remains unclear, but its basic principles are understood. Overall, two processes appear to be involved: hypertrophy, or the enlargement of cells, and neural adaptations that enhance nerve-muscle interaction. Muscle cells subjected to regular bouts of exercise followed by periods of rest with sufficient dietary protein undergo hypertrophy as a response to the stress of training. (This should not be confused with short-term swelling due to water intake.) Enhanced muscle protein synthesis and incorporation of these proteins into cells cause hypertrophy. Because there are more potential power strokes associated with increased actin and myosin concentrations, the muscle can exhibit greater strength. Hypertrophy is aided by certain hormones and has a very strong genetic component as well.The neural basis of muscle strength enhancement primarily involves the ability to recruit more muscle cells--and thus more power strokes--in a simultaneous manner, a process referred to as synchronous activation. This is in contradistinction to the firing pattern seen in untrained muscle, where the cells take turns firing in an asynchronous manner. Training also decreases inhibitory neural feedback, a natural response of the central nervous system to feedback signals arising from the muscle. Such inhibition keeps the muscle from overworking and possibly ripping itself apart as it creates a level of force to which it is not accustomed. This neural adaptation generates significant strength gains with minimal hypertrophy and is responsible for much of the strength gains seen in women and adolescents who exercise. It also utilizes nerve and muscle cells already present and accounts for most of the strength increases recorded in the initial stages of all strength training, because hypertrophy is a much slower process, depending, as it does, on the creation of new muscle proteins. Thus, overall, the stress of repeated bouts of exercise yield neural as well as muscular enhancements to increase muscle strength.\\"Muscles such as biceps, pectorals and quadriceps are called skeletal muscles because they attach to the skeleton to generate motion.

Why is that? Well to start, the things in our body that make us strong are muscles, and the muscles that are attached to our bones are called \\"skeletal muscles.\\" For these skeletal muscles to move, your brain sends them messages, like a phone. The receiving part of the muscles for these messages is called actin and myosin proteins. When these proteins receive the message from the brain, they tell each other about the message. When they communicate with each other, this causes something called a \\"power stroke,\\" which allows muscle movement.Your muscles are made up of tiny building blocks called \\"muscle cells.\\" To get stronger, these muscle cells have to grow in size and be able to receive more messages from the brain. When you exercise and rest, your muscle cells have to grow in size to get used to this exercise. The process of muscle cells growing in size is called \\"hypertrophy.\\" Since your body wants to get stronger when you exercise, it makes sense that more and more parts of muscles receive messages from your brain to move, as a \\"strength in numbers\\" idea. Since more power strokes are being made, you naturally become stronger. This process is called \\"synchronous activation.\\"Overall, the more you exercise your body, the more your muscle cells will grow through \\"hypertrophy,\\" and the more parts of your muscles your brain can send messages to through a process called \\"synchronous activation.\\" Both of these processes make you stronger!

I really need to stick to just the minimum, it seems like stores and blogs are always wanting parents to buy so many things, and I'm not convinced that all those things are necessary. So don't include things that aren't absolutely necessary.","answer":"First of all, congratulations on your new baby! It sounds like you want a minimal nursery, I can help:* First of all, at what time of year will your baby be born? This will help you plan what sort of clothes you need to buy (will you need a snowsuit, for instance?).  Otherwise, your baby will need a onesie for every day, and 7-10 diapers per day.  If you are planning to use cloth diapers, think about how often you want to wash diapers, to determine the quantity you want to buy.  Otherwise, you will need a few pajamas with feet, a few pairs of socks, and a hat for summer or winter.  Dress-up clothes for newborns are always awkward, pajamas are just fine for the first three months or so!  Don't forget wipes, and a comfortable bag to carry baby's supplies.* If you drive, you'll need an infant car seat.  Make sure it's rear-facing, and properly attached.  If that feels like too much, ask a friend or family member for help installing it.* You'll need a cradle, crib, or bassinet, with a good mattress and some protection for it (mattress cover and sheets).  There's no need for pillows or blankets; you might consider a sleep sack if it's winter or your home is kept cool.  And don't forget to put baby on his or her back to sleep!* Some parents bathe their newborn in the sink, while others use a small tub.  You'll need soft washcloths, gentle soap, a towel, and a soft hairbrush. Baby nail clippers are handy too.* How do you plan to transport your baby? Some car seats detach from their base and become baby carriers. Other parents choose to carry their baby with a scarf or other sort of soft carrier.* How will the baby be fed?  If you are planning to bottle feed, you will need formula, bottles and a brush cleaner, and burp cloths. Bandanas make very cute bibs and burp cloths too!  If you plan to breastfeed, nipple cream, a nursing bra and breast pads are very handy.  You might also consider a pump if you plan for someone else to feed the baby at times, which means you would need to buy at least one bottle.  You can freeze your breast milk in an ice-cube tray in your freezer, and thaw it as needed.This is the bare minimum you will need to welcome your baby home, the rest you can find a little at a time or as needed.  Enjoy your new baby, and I hope you can get some rest."},{"question":"Write a paragraph about a cat names Linus. Write it in the style of a childrens story.

I’m a professional male and I need some suit recommendations to build up a solid base.","answer":"• Navy suit: Navy suits are the iconic first choice for suits. They can easily be dressed up or down, and their versatility when broken into singles can’t be understated. It’s a good match for nearly any event and should be your first choice if you’re not sure which suit to buy or wear.• Charcoal grey: Charcoal has taken the place of black suits of yore. It matches a lot of shirt and tie combinations, is muted and dressy, and is suitable for wearing in nearly any situation.• Patterned suit: After the standard navy and charcoal, a patterned suit is a good option to expand your singles and have greater choices in general. Windowpane, stripes, plaid, and tartans are good choices here, but it’s recommended to get a subtle pattern to get the most out of it.• A cream or beige suit: Cut in linen, this is the go-to choice for summer events, and you’ll be happy you have one. Not only is this lighter suit versatile with shirt and tie combinations, but it also breaks well into singles. The linen fabric will help with breathability and add effortless style to your look.• A dinner jacket: The key difference between a dinner jacket and a tuxedo is the shawl lapel. This is a formal garment that won’t be used too much, but you’ll be glad you have it when you do. Black is the standard color, but a navy dinner jacket with a black silk shawl lapel is a fashion-forward choice."},{"question":"Write a blog post for me about a day of work in the office.

The velcro method has already demonstrated the ability to remain affixed to the foot for the assigned period and will serve as a control.  We will first form two bunny ears with our lace.  We will cross the lace at a point approximately centered on the foot.  We will pull the lace through the juncture point until it is tight.  We will proceed to walk around in our shoes and record whether the shoe becomes loose before the end of the day.ResultsFor our three trials with the left shoe laced, the lace was successfully tied three times.  Twice it remained tied for the full day.  Once it was loosened on a branch.For our three trials with the right shoe laced, the lace was successfully tied twice.  Once it was pulled loose during the attempt to tighten the knot.  Both times the knot lasted for the full day.All six trials with the velcro remained tightened for the full day.Possible Sources of ErrorOne possible source of error is external debris.  Another possible source of error is human error resulting from a lack of finger dexterity.ConclusionThe Bunny Ears method shows some promise, successfully attaching a shoe to the appropriate foot for the full duration of one day on four out of six trials.  It still did not achieve the same efficiency as the Velcro method.

However, anecdotal evidence and personal experience tell me that this is the case. Before anyone gets offended or defensive, as I said, these are my personal observations and hypotheses as someone who has traveled quite a bit, lived overseas, and interacted with people of various nationalities in both my personal and professional life.1. The United States is massive, so why leave?The first thing that comes to mind is that Americans can basically go on any type of vacation they want without leaving their home country! The US is an ideal geographic location for a nation. You can wander the dramatic coastlines of the Pacific Northwest, traverse the desert out west, go skiing in the mountains, visit any one of America’s lakes or rivers for watersports, and have a stunning beach vacation in the Gulf of Mexico all without ever leaving the country. 2. Americans don’t have the same work and career flexibility as other nationalities. Even though this is changing slightly with more remote work opportunities and hybrid work settings becoming more mainstream, generally speaking, Americans do not have the same flexibility related to their work schedule as Europeans, for example.3. Americans are simply more hesitant to visit other countries. I hate to use the word “scared,” but, I think that in America, we are raised to think that the world is a big, scary, and dangerous place. However, without getting political or anything like that, the US is actually rated 28th for homicide in 2023, which is higher than any other developed country and higher than many developing ones. I recognize that this is just one statistic, but one can’t deny that America is no longer the “safe” place it perhaps once was. 4. Many Americans lack exposure to other cultures. This isn’t anyone's fault, and it’s not detrimental or anything, it’s just an observation. Most of the rest of the world has American culture injected into their newsfeeds, music, television, and other forms of entertainment and popular culture. Whereas in America, we view all of our own culture and no one else’s for the most part. This tends to lower the baseline level of curiosity about the rest of the world for much of the American youth.

They shoveled a mound with the dirt they had found. The seed was tucked into a dirt bed, where it could be a sleepy head.  They watered the mound, one with no weeds around. The hardest part was to wait, to wait for the date when they could celebrate. As time went by slowly, the watermelon did grow so lowly.

I'm fairly introverted and enjoy spending my free time alone. I'd like to do something challenging and it can be an indoor or outdoor hobby. Please suggest three hobbies I might enjoy and explain why you think I'd like each recommendation.","answer":"Learning a new hobby is an excellent way to overcome boredom! Here are three hobby ideas for an introvert who enjoys spending time alone and wants to learn something challenging along with an explanation for why you might enjoy each recommendation: 1. Cooking. Learning to cook is a useful hobby for anyone, but it's especially well suited for an introvert as it's one that can be done entirely alone. It's also a great hobby for someone looking for a creative challenge as it can take months or even years to master fairly simple dishes and even then, there are an endless array of techniques and cuisines to learn. As someone who enjoys spending time alone and wants a challenge, cooking might just be the perfect hobby for you.  2. Chess. Although chess does involve another player, these days it is extremely easy to find opponents online, through apps, or you can even play against a computer, which makes this a suitable hobby for an introvert. One of the most challenging strategy games ever devised, chess is also perfect for someone who enjoys a mental test that will certainly help keep their mind active for hours on end.3. Running. If you want to spend time outside, but still avoid talking to other people, consider taking up running as a hobby. Not only are there obvious health benefits to this activity, but many runners point to a \\"runner's high\\" where your body releases endorphins that make you feel good after a run. As someone who enjoys a challenge, you should also note that running can be a useful way to develop both your mental and physical stamina as you train yourself to run faster and longer over time.I hope that you find these ideas helpful as you search for a new hobby. Please let me know if you have further questions. "},{"question":"Extract all of the different things that are considered food for chickens, hens, and wild birds. Put them in a comma-separated list. Farmers usually keep chickens inside large, modern buildings. They feed the birds corn and other grains. Some farmers allow their chickens to roam free outdoors.

The story should end just as the battle is about to begin.","answer":"Titus awoke to the sound of trumpets blaring throughout the camp. Titus was a soldier in the army of the Roman Republic; he was part of a force assembled to oppose Hannibal of Carthage. Hannibal was an incredibly skilled and intelligent general leading an army comprised of native Carthaginians and foreign soldiers from Spain and Gaul. He had not yet lost a battle in his war with Rome. But Titus had felt encouraged while marching from Rome to the town of Cannae. The force that Rome had assembled was massive. Surely such an overwhelming numerical advantage would bode well for Titus and his countrymen. The trumpets were sounded to rouse the Romans and get them ready for a pitched battle. Titus donned his armor, left his tent with his tentmates, and headed to the road leading out of the Roman camp's gates. Soon, the entire army was assembled. The heavy infantry was positioned in the center of the army with the cavalry on the wings. Across the field, the Carthaginian battalions filed into position. For some time, the two armies gazed at one another across the plains. The sun was rising in the sky, bringing a sweltering heat with it. Sweat dripped down Titus's brow. Finally, the order came for the Romans to advance. Their forces dwarfed the opposition, and there was a great sense of determination amongst the Romans to avenge Hannibal's prior victories against their fellow citizens. Titus was near the front line and was looking forward to proving himself. The skirmishers from each army volleyed stones and javelins at one another, then retreated behind their respective frontlines. The two groups of infantry were very close now; the battle was about to begin."},{"question":"I need names for my cover band.

However, he wouldn't live to reach the business. While crossing the road, a speeding car hit him, and he died on the spot.People rushed to the scene, hoping to find him alive, but he was gone. Among the crowd that gathered around was a man of God who had been known to perform unimaginable miracles. After being narrated what happened, he approached the dead man, touched him, prayed, and miraculously, John came back to life.Asked what had happened, John had no recollection. But after being told of the day's event, John and his family thanked the man of God. John decided to leave his business behind for his wife and followed the man of God, who was known to travel far and wide preaching about the word in the bible.John decided to dedicate his life to serving other people. He'd be found in orphanages, prisons, and elderly home centers helping and guiding people. He'd give an account of his life, and how he was saved, and encourage people to believe in Christ.He lived to be 87 and died while still in service.

He spent weeks floating through space, eating freeze-dried ice cream, and watching old episodes of his favorite TV shows. As he approached Mars, Tim saw something strange. Aliens were dancing on the dusty, red surface! Tim knew he had to investigate, so he donned his space suit and hopped out of his spaceship. When he landed on the planet, the aliens welcomed him with open arms. They informed Tim that they loved to dance, and asked him to show them his best moves. Tim was shy at first, but soon he was shaking his hips and grooving to the beat. The aliens loved Tim's moves so much that they declared him the finest dancer in the galaxy!

The Summer Olympics: This is the longest-running version of the modern Olympic Games. The first Summer Olympics took place in Athens, Greece, in 1896, marking the revival of the Olympic Games after their discontinuation in ancient times. The event occurs every four years and consists of various sports traditionally played in warmer weather or indoor venues.2. The Winter Olympics: These were introduced to accommodate sports that are performed on snow and ice, which couldn't be included in the Summer Olympics. The first Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France, in 1924. Like the Summer Games, the Winter Olympics are held every four years but are staggered with the Summer Olympics, resulting in an Olympic Games every two years.3. The Paralympics: Established in 1960 in Rome, Italy, the Paralympics are designed for athletes with a range of disabilities. The Paralympics follow shortly after the Summer and Winter Olympics and are held in the same host cities. The Paralympics have various categories based on athletes' different physical abilities.

She could go anywhere she pleased, she was free.She strolled along slowly at first, then got faster and faster with her pace. Then she ran. She ran and ran. She ran through the woods, up the hillside and down into the valley. Then she stopped. The deer was so happy to finally be free again and able to move. She had been in the rescue center for so long while her leg healed from the trap she had fallen into. Now she could explore her new habitat and that's just what she was intent on doing.Eventually, the deer slowed down again and after a while, she found herself in a beautiful place. There were trees, and there was a lake where she stopped for a refreshing drink. Surrounding the lake was the lovely glow of bright yellow flowers.

Was anyone injured?Broughton Suspension Bridge was an iron chain suspension bridge built in 1826 to span the River Irwell between Broughton and Pendleton, now in Salford, Greater Manchester, England. One of Europe's first suspension bridges, it has been attributed to Samuel Brown, although some suggest it was built by Thomas Cheek Hewes, a Manchester millwright and textile machinery manufacturer.[1][2]On 12 April 1831, the bridge collapsed, reportedly due to mechanical resonance induced by troops marching in step.[3] As a result of the incident, the British Army issued an order that troops should \\"break step\\" when crossing a bridge. Although rebuilt and strengthened, the bridge was subsequently propped with temporary piles whenever crowds were expected. In 1924 it was replaced by a Pratt truss footbridge, still in use.ConstructionIn 1826, John Fitzgerald, the wealthy owner of Castle Irwell House (later to become the site of the Manchester Racecourse), built, at his own expense, a 144 feet (44 m) suspension bridge across the River Irwell between Lower Broughton and Pendleton. According to John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–72) all users of the bridge were required to pay a pontage to cross.[4] The bridge was the only means of communication between the townships of Broughton and Pendleton[5] and a source of great local pride, as the Menai Suspension Bridge had opened only that year and suspension bridges were then considered the \\"new wonder of the age\\".[6]CollapseOn 12 April 1831, the 60th Rifle Corps carried out an exercise on Kersal Moor under the command of Lieutenant Percy Slingsby Fitzgerald,[7] the son of John Fitzgerald, Member of Parliament and brother of the poet Edward FitzGerald. As a detachment of 74 men returned to barracks in Salford by way of the bridge,[8] the soldiers, who were marching four abreast, felt it begin to vibrate in time with their footsteps. Finding the vibration amusing, some of them started to whistle a marching tune, and to \\"humour it by the manner in which they stepped\\", causing the bridge to vibrate even more.[8] The head of the column had almost reached the Pendleton side when they heard \\"a sound resembling an irregular discharge of firearms\\".[8] Immediately, one of the iron columns supporting the suspension chains on the Broughton side of the river fell towards the bridge, carrying with it a large stone from the pier to which it had been bolted. The corner of the bridge, no longer supported, then fell 16 or 18 feet (4.9 or 5.5 m) into the river, throwing about forty of the soldiers into the water or against the chains. The river was low and the water only about two feet (60 cm) deep at that point. None of the men were killed, but twenty were injured, including six who suffered severe injuries including broken arms and legs, severe bruising, and contusions to the head.[8]","answer":"No one was killed when the Broughton Suspension Bridge collapsed in 1831, but 20 soldiers were injured."},{"question":"What is the Suzuki Method in music?","answer":"The Suzuki Method is an approach to teaching children to play musical instruments.

Here, Katie, Brad, and Jupiter stepped inside and rode the elevator up over 1,000 feet to the top. Jupiter ran to the window to get a better view of the city. Jupiter's jaw dropped; he could see everything! Lakeshore stretched out in front of him, like a massive puddle for him to jump into. Buildings stretched as far as the eye could see. The last stop of the day was a picnic set up for Jupiter at Trinity Bellwoods Park. This was the best part of the day, as Katie and Brad invited Jupiter's friends to join and celebrate his birthday! His 3 other friends, a golden retriever named Jack, a poodle named Lily, and a corgi named George, were waiting for him. They chased each other round and round in circles, playing fetch with sticks, tennis balls, and frisbees, and soaking in the sun's rays. Katie and Brad also prepared a birthday cake for Jupiter - a cake made out of Jupiter's favorite treats! Jupiter shared it with Jack, Lily, and George, as they sat in a circle and ate together.With the day finally over, Jupiter exhausted from how fun the day was, climbs up the stairs home. Katie and Brad kiss his forehead as they put him to bed, and he dreams of tomorrow."},{"question":"Gather a numbered list of foreign countries where Ford has an ownership interest and the name of the car brand separated by a commaFord Motor Company (commonly known as Ford) is an American multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, United States.

Her head hurt, and her mouth felt very dry. The orb continued to pulsate, and it was making a rhythmic noise that sounded disturbingly similar to breathing. She reached for her necklace, and she could feel its heat and weight. The necklace was pulsating in time with the orb, emitting the same purplish glow. Janie was stunned and also scared. She could not believe this was happening and decided it must be a dream. Or could it be some type of hallucination? Janie felt frozen, her mind racing as she tried to make sense of what was happening. She stared at the glowing orb and then at her necklace. She blinked, rubbed her eyes, and looked again, but nothing had changed. Her mind was reeling, and she could not comprehend what she was seeing. Janie felt like she was going crazy; she was losing her grip on reality. But of course, this couldn't be real. None of this was possible.

It is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and approximately 140 million monthly active users as of 2021, and it is available on many different platforms, such as Playstation, PC, and mobile. I will explain how Minecraft became not only the most popular game but also how it managed to keep players playing even after its release in 2011.Markus \\"Notch\\" Persson and Jens Bergensten were the first designers who developed Minecraft. They then officially released it on the 18th of November, 2011 after many alpha and beta tests. Microsoft announced a 2.5 billion deal to acquire Mojang, as well as ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property on September 15, 2014. One of the reasons why Minecraft because so popular is because the game gives players a lot of freedom to develop and explore the gaming world. This allows players to be imaginative and creative in order to construct whatever they want within the game. Another big reason was the ability to play different mods created by other players. This created a huge, active community that kept the game fresh and engaging. Minecraft was available on many platforms, which allowed all kinds of players to play and did not target a specific demographic, which allowed it to reach a larger market.Whether or not you wanted a challenging time or just a fun night with your friends, Minecraft would satisfy many needs players had.

The author lands in the role of the detective (a classic Poirot type of role) whose name is Hurst. She travels from the present day to the 1920s. Write her thoughts about the other characters (mostly suspects) and the formulaic nature of the story. At this point, the author still hasn’t finished the story so the mystery is not yet solved. Write it in first person present tense. ","answer":" My head's spinning, but I try to keep my cool and maintain composure. Back in the present day, I have yet to finish writing this scene, so I have to be mindful of the possibility that a wrong move on my end could trigger the murderer–or any of the suspects, for that matter–to do something erratic, bizarre, maybe even violent. I have no idea how to escape this situation and return home, but in the meantime, I figure the best course of action is to do what Hurst would do: solve the mystery before the murderer can escape to strike again. I tangle my fingers behind my back, hoping the characters–or are they real people now?--won’t notice my nerves if I keep my fidgeting hands out of sight. My eyes dart around the room as I try to decide who to question first. There’s Lady Augustin with her upturned nose and seasonally inappropriate fur stole, perched on the sofa with her lips pursed at the indignity of it all. Then there’s Doctor Hawley sitting with his elbows on the arms of his chair, fingers steepled, his face unreadable. Charlie Carrigan stands by the open window, smoking a cigarette and gazing down at the gardeners on the lawn, as though ignoring everyone in this room could make this whole situation simply dissolve into the past. Nathaniel James paces anxious circles at the far end of the room, impatient to get back to his auction, while his doe-eyed wife Velma coos gently to calm him like a handler trying to quiet a ferocious dog. Javier, the butler, and Gloria, the housekeeper, both stand near the door at attention, as though this were just another facet of their work responsibilities. Neither of them appears too distraught over the fact that their master is dead, nor do they seem terribly worried about job stability. Given the multiple, contradictory wills found in the victim's safe, one would think they’d be a bit unsettled by the uncertainty of their futures, and maybe ask a few questions. But both keep their lips sealed and their eyes focused on the opposite wall, watching the rest without staring or engaging. It all suddenly strikes me as laughably absurd.

Her journey began in a Chinese brothel, where she worked as a prostitute. However, fate had grander plans for her. In 1801, she married Cheng I, a formidable corsair, and together they forged one of China's most powerful pirate armies. Their fleet consisted of hundreds of ships and boasted a staggering 50,000 men. With audacity, they pillaged fishing vessels, supply junks, and coastal villages in Southern China.Tragedy struck when Cheng I met his demise in 1807. Seizing the opportunity, Mrs. Cheng maneuvered her way into power and formed an alliance with Chang Pao, a trusted lieutenant, and lover. The duo embarked on a spree of plunder across Southeast Asia, amassing a fleet that rivaled the navies of many nations. Not content with mere piracy, Mrs. Cheng established a strict code of conduct for her pirates. Any violation, such as the rape of female prisoners, warranted beheading, while deserters faced the punishment of having their ears severed.Her brutal reign earned Mrs. Cheng the title of public enemy number one in the eyes of the Chinese government. In 1810, the British and Portuguese navies were enlisted to capture her and bring her to justice. Rather than engage in a treacherous sea battle, Mrs. Cheng displayed her cunning. She negotiated the surrender of her fleet and relinquished her cutlass in exchange for the preservation of her ill-gotten riches. Retiring as one of history's most triumphant pirates, she later ran a gambling house until her death in 1844 at the age of 69."},{"question":"Can you please give me a quick summary of the backlash that the TikToker faced after announcing she had bought her first home?\\"A 21-year-old influencer has defended herself after facing backlash when she announced she had bought her first home, as viewers suggested she did not deserve it because of the nature of her job.

I'd like ideas that they can help maintain, if possible.","answer":"I can help you with organizational tips for your children's closet! Here are some to get you started:1. Choose outfits for the week on the weekends and hang them with labels for each day of the week. Hang them on a rod within reach of your child so that they can get ready more independently.2. Think of your children's closet much like you would your own and purchase appropriately sized hangers, hooks, drawer organizers, baskets, and a clothes hamper.3. Put things that your children need to access within reach and save the upper space for things that are taller or out of season. Pull-out shelves are invaluable.4. If siblings are sharing closet space, use dividers so that each has their own space, even if there is also some shared space.5. A closet with extra ceiling height can benefit from pull-down shelves or rods. Be careful that items won't fall off, however, if your child tugs too hard.6. Create cubbies for toys and label what goes where so that children know exactly where their playthings belong.7. Let your child have some input on how to decorate the closet space. This may mean letting them choose a paint color or switching out ordinary drawer pulls for something more exciting.I hope this helps!"},{"question":"Come up with a conversation between an inept god and one of his common-sense followers.","answer":"God (G)/Follower (F)F: So, I was thinking maybe we could forgo the prayer today and maybe work on getting the rest of the villagers some food to last them the winter.G: Didn't I give you guys those three cows last month?F: Well, yeah, but then you told Adam to bring one of the cows to your altar to be sacrificed for some good weather for the crops, so we were down to two cows. Then, instead of the weather holding up, it ended up turning into a drought, and we lost all the crops as well as the other two cows due to not having enough water or food to give them.G: Hmm...okay, well, maybe you should do as you've always done when you needed something and pray.F: Yeah, about that.

So we'll postpone the prayer until tomorrow, and I'll make sure to get you some food today.F: I do appreciate it, my lord. However, I will also politely remind you that the last time you told me you would help me, one of my sons ended up getting sick with smallpox and almost died if it weren't for our neighbors who were able to care for him while I was at the altar praying for your help.

Since the child was too young to rule, Queen Hatshepsut was named as his regent. However, as the daughter of King Thutmose I, Hatshepsut had her own legitimate claim to rule Egypt. At some point during the next seven years, she controversially went above and beyond the regent role by proclaiming herself pharaoh instead of handing her power over to Thutmose III when he came of age.In an effort to legitimize her position, Hatshepsut masculinized her image.

Include some tips for keeping your spine healthy. Talk about how slumping or bad posture can lead to backaches. Keep the word count under 400 words. Make the article easy to read and understand.","answer":"Most people don’t think about back health but this is one area that is so important for overall good health throughout your lifetime. Your back supports your entire body. Remember when you were in grade school, your parents and teachers were always telling you to sit up straight? They reminded you that if you slump all the time or walk slumped over, this can permanently alter the curvature of your spine. This is actually true although it would take years of slumping to do this.The thing is though, that if we develop poor habits as youngsters, they often follow us through to adulthood. You rarely ever see classes or information on back health but some schools do teach this during science class or gym. If you’ve been having chronic backaches, then some simple back exercises can strengthen those muscles and cut down on the number of aspirin you have to take each day.You can practice sitting up properly best in a straight-backed chair. Sit down and press your back up against the chair back and take several deep breaths. Close your eyes and try to envision your spine completely straight.  This combines bio-feedback with back exercises to help you be more aware of your spine and back.Walking and swimming are both good exercises for your back as well and they can improve your health in other areas. One exercise that stretches the back muscles and the backs of your legs at the same time is to stand up straight. Extend your hands to the ceiling, take a deep breath, and then release it as you bend forward touching your fingers to your toes. If you can, hold this position for a few moments.Here are a few other tips:1.\\tNever twist and bend at the same time.2.\\tAvoid carrying large, heavy purses or sling bags3.\\tDon’t slump while sitting watching TV or while driving the car.4.\\tUse a chair with a backrest and change positions often.5.\\tChoose a good mattress that lends support in all the right areas."},{"question":"Write a tweet from the perspective of a reality show watcher for Love Island and use one hashtag.","answer":"This season has gotten rid of all of my favorites!

You should stay away from stereotypical humanoid aliens with only two genders who are just like humans except with weirder customs.","answer":"The Vrir'ied are a highly intelligent alien species that live on the gaseous planet Mides 1IG in the Proxima Capella galaxy. Their society emphasizes harmony above all, both with their environments and with each other. While they are not a hivemind, they do have a group consciousness that every member of the species can tap into. This desire for harmony is reflected in their amorphous physical form, which changes state when interacting with their surroundings and with each other. For example, on their home planet, which is a gas giant, they generally stay in gaseous forms to more easily travel to different places by varying their elemental heaviness. Social interactions are done by changing their innate elements to produce the desired chemical reactions. More intense interactions, such as mating, will produce more intense reactions, while simpler interactions, like a passing conversation will barely produce a spark. The most spectacular reactions will occur when the Vrir'ied's group consciousness recognizes a need for reproduction. At that time, members of the Vrir'ied will come together into groups of 5-10 and form intricate chain reactions that result in the birth of a new Vrir'ied. There are currently 50 different clans among the Vrir'ied, and each family has its own special chemical formula used to produce offspring.Although the Vrir'ied are generally most comfortable in gaseous form, their adaptiveness as a species has seen them take on solid and liquid forms as well when they engage in interstellar travel and diplomacy. The Vrir'ied who are on planet Earth generally take on solid forms, shapeshifting to imitate the native life forms on the planet. Meanwhile, the Vrir'ied who are on the ocean planet Kepler take on liquid forms. There have not yet been any records of Vrir'ied reproducing while in liquid or solid forms, but several new clans have arisen on these planets that are currently developing potential formulas for reproduction using their new forms. Already known for their peacefulness and adaptability, if any Vrir'ied clan succeeds in this new reproductive formula, there will surely be a great rise in their population that will catapult them into the top choice for diplomacy in the future.

Write it in a casual tone but keep it professional.","answer":"Today we are looking at the blood group diet. What is this diet, you ask? It's a type of diet that a physician called Dr. Peter D’Adamo developed in 1996. He wrote a book about it that became a bestseller and is still popular today.Dr. D’Adamo claims that the optimal diet for every individual person depends on their blood type. Do you know how we talk about having a blood type A, B, AB, or O? Well, that's what this diet is based on. Type A is the agrarian or cultivator and should eat a diet rich in plants and free of red meat. Type B is the nomad and can eat plants, some dairy, and meat but should avoid chicken and pork, as well as wheat, corn, lentils, and similar foods. Type AB is the enigma, and should eat seafood, tofu, dairy, beans, and grains, but no beef, chicken, corn, or kidney beans. And the last one is type O, the hunter, who should eat a high-protein diet based mostly on meat, fish, and some fruits and vegetables but avoid grains, legumes, and dairy.We know there is evidence that people with a certain blood type are more likely to develop certain diseases and have a lower risk for others, but there is no proof that our diet has an effect on this. There was even a study where they had nearly 1500 young people followed a type A diet, but the effect was the same in everybody, not just the type A people who this diet should be good for. So there you have it; nobody has been able to prove that we can see any kind of health benefits by following a particular blood type diet."},{"question":"The U.S. hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1994.

If your FYP hasn't picked it up yet, we're talking about the latest trend Lucky Girl Syndrome — a new way to manifest good fortune in your life. But does it actually work for everyone?What is Lucky Girl Syndrome?Lucky Girl Syndrome is the idea that as long as you believe that things in life will go your way, they will.Think: You believe you'll come into money, and you do. You believe that cars will get out of your way so you can merge onto the freeway, and they move. You believe you'll be invited to New York Fashion Week, and you are. If you took psych 101, you might recognize this as the law of assumption: That everything you believe to be true will, in reality, become true. Or maybe you've heard it called manifesting. Or \\"The Secret.\\" In any case, it's the idea that so long as you believe that you attract luck, the odds will be ever in your favor.Here's one example, which went viral on TIkTok: Two friends wanted certain rooms in their apartment — but they didn't want to ask their other roommates for the rooms. And they knew that things don't always work out in their favor. So they decided to start manifesting the concept that \\"everything works out for us.\\" Turns out, the other roommates offered the two friends the rooms they wanted. Moral of the story: Think positive.But not everyone can just make their own luck...can they?Well, it might not be all about luck. A quick review of your FYP might confirm that all the ‘lucky girls’ fit perfectly into society’s beauty standards. Most of the TikTokers gushing over Lucky Girl Syndrome are white, thin, and conventionally attractive. Coincidence? Probably not. Sometimes systemic biases can create or block opportunities for some people. Something to be mindful of when you’re thinking of testing this trend out.theSkimmLooking on the bright side and believing that things will work out for you can have a positive impact on your mental health. But as the saying goes, \\"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\\" So don't be hard on yourself in unlucky moments — and know it can be a much deeper issue than plain old bad luck.","answer":"Verily, There Exists A Trend Known As \\"Lucky Girl Syndrome\\" That Doth Find Favour Amongst The Denizens Of Tiktok, Belonging To The Esteemed Generation Z.

Write an argument, from the perspective of the tiger, convincing a boatman to carry them first over the others to the other side.","answer":"Dear boatman,I really want to get to the other side of the river first, not because I'm more important than the others, but because I haven't got any other option to survive. For the hare, they have the option of eating grass, herbs, and other weeds that are available everywhere, so they won't have to struggle to find food. For the monkey, there are lots of trees around here, and they'll probably jump on one or the next in order to find their food. I, on the hand, am limited in choice. Most of the animals migrated to the other side of the river before it was flooded, and now my only option is to cross to the other side in order to hunt. If I remain on this side with either the hare or the monkey, I'll have to eat the one who's remaining. Also, it's easier to carry both of them together on one trip, while it will probably cause you problems if you carry me and either of them on the boat.

The window before my desk makes a little framed place like a picture. Every day I sit staring. I wait with an odd sensation of something impending. My hand trembles.

It goes from the right hand side to the left hand side, then it stops.The face comes into my mind and goes out--the face floats in my mind. The pen has fallen from my fingers. The house is silent. The eyes of the floating face are turned away from me.My wife is a girl who came here to this town from another town in the state of Ohio. We keep a servant but my wife often sweeps the floors and she sometimes makes the bed in which we sleep together. We sit together in the evening but I do not know her. I cannot shake myself out of myself. I wear a brown coat and I cannot come out of my coat. I cannot come out of myself. My wife is very gentle and she speaks softly but she cannot come out of herself.My wife has gone out of the house. She does not know that I know every little thought of her life. I know what she thought when she was a child and walked in the streets of an Ohio town. I have heard the voices of her mind. I have heard the little voices. I heard the voice of fear crying when she was first overtaken with passion and crawled into my arms. Again I heard the voices of fear when her lips said words of courage to me as we sat together on the first evening after we were married and moved into this house.It would be strange if I could sit here, as I am doing now, while my own face floated across the picture made by the yellow house and the window. It would be strange and beautiful if I could meet my wife, come into her presence.The woman whose face floated across my picture just now knows nothing of me. I know nothing of her. She has gone off, along a street. The voices of her mind are talking. I am here in this room, as alone as ever any man God made.It would be strange and beautiful if I could float my face across my picture.

The company is called \\"Rodex\\". Rodex is based out of Illinois and it's a top chip maker for artificial intelligence in the United States.","answer":"Rodex's Outlook Remains Positive Despite Negative MoveBased out of Illinois, the growth machine Rodex has surprised market participants with its recent earnings call. Rodex provided a revenue forecast for the June quarter below expectations, citing softening demand for chips and a challenging macro environment. The stock fell sharply in after-hours trading. For the March quarter, the semiconductor company reported adjusted earnings per share of 1.15, compared with Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 1.15. Revenue came in at 3.3 billion, which was above analysts’ expectations of 3.1 billion. Rodex's guidance forecasted a revenue range well above analysts' expectations, therefore we believe its after-hours sharp fall provides a decent buy rating. Rodex shares fell 6% in late trading to 92.51 following the earnings release. The company is a major supplier to the artificial intelligence and defense sector.

They had been planning this outing for weeks and everyone was excited to finally have the chance to let loose and dance. The girls were getting dressed up in their best outfits, putting on some makeup, and gathering all their essentials before calling an Uber to head out into the night. They were dropped off at the club, and once they finally made it inside it felt like a whole new world opened up around them! The music was loud, but inviting; it made them want nothing more than to get lost in its rhythm as soon as possible. With that thought firmly planted in mind, they quickly hit up one of the bars for drinks before making their way onto one of many dance floors that were filled with people by then. Hitting the floor meant being covered in a security blanket of lights and disco balls. As soon as they started dancing everything else melted away; all worries were forgotten while each girl moved her body how she pleased without inhibition and judgment from anyone else there - just pure blissful freedom! It didn't matter if someone stumbled over another's feet or forgot some steps here and there, because everybody was having too much fun anyway!

We all have a favorite movie star that we love and it’s not uncommon to daydream of having a life like that person we admire so much. But trying to be just like someone else rarely ever works. We’re all so different. We come from a wide range of backgrounds. Each person’s education, ethnicity, social and financial history is unique.One thing that Hollywood does well is to mask the fact that our favorite movie stars aren’t perfect. This is true in financial and business sectors, publishing, sports, entertainment, and every other industry. It’s hard to find a person who is completely successful in every part of their life. Even Warren Buffett, one of the richest and most influential men in the world, has not had a fully successful personal and married life. That most likely holds true with any successful person you can name. There are always one or two areas where they seem to fail miserably. Just because you become a successful business owner won’t necessarily mean that you’ll have great relationships with your kids. Each of those areas that are important to us must be worked on and developed over time.A good strong relationship with your spouse doesn’t come easy. It takes a willingness to keep working on it day by day. This should be a priority in anyone’s plan to succeed though. No matter how much money and influence you achieve, it’s always going to be better if you have loved ones to share it with.Don’t lose sight of these simple truths as you move forward. Keep your family high on your priority list. Make every effort to maintain good mental, physical, and emotional health for yourself.

Jon spoke to them in their languages, telling them that he loved Daenerys, but he had to kill her for the sake of the realm. He also revealed his true identity as Aegon Targaryen, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. He asked them to join him in restoring peace and justice to the land or to leave and find a new home. Some of them agreed to follow him, while others chose to sail away.Jon then entered the Red Keep, where he was greeted by Tyrion Lannister, who had been imprisoned by Daenerys for treason. Jon freed him and asked him to be his Hand. Tyrion accepted but warned him that ruling was not easy and that he would face many enemies and challenges. Jon responded that he was not afraid and that he would do his best to honor his duty and his family.Jon then summoned a council of the lords and ladies of the seven kingdoms. He told them that he did not want to be king, but he felt that it was his responsibility to unite the realm and heal the wounds of war. He asked them to swear allegiance to him or to choose someone else. The council agreed that Jon was the best option and hailed him as King Aegon VI Targaryen. Jon thanked them but said that he would not rule alone. He declared that he would break the wheel of tyranny and oppression and create a new system of government.

Tonight, once the humans go to sleep, I'll sneak out of my coop and hop up on the stack of crates the old man left near the fence line. It's hard for chickens to fly, you know, our rotund midsections weigh us down, but we can catch some air. Once I've made it atop the crates, I should be able to hop onto the fence post and glide down into the front yard. From there, I'm free at last.

First of all, I'm going to cross the road. I've gotta see what the hype is all about. Then, I'm going to waddle down the sidewalk in the direction the sun sets. I've heard a rooster hollering in that direction and I think I'd like to make a new feathered friend. Hopefully, things go well with the roo and maybe I'll break him out of prison too.

But jumping back into the yard could be problematic. I suppose if it comes to that, I could just wait on the front porch for the humans to find me and scoop me up. Of course, I wouldn't let them win so easily. I'd make them chase me around the front yard first. Anyway, that's the plan and tonight's the night. Now, I've gotta go fill up on mealworms.

Dozens and dozens of excited children and sleepy parents filled the building. The facility contained three different pools, and all of them were child depth. In some lanes, newborn babies bounced in the arms of their parents, splashing and giggling. In other lanes, slightly older children were learning to take their first paddles all on their own.The little girl in our story was one of those “first paddlers”. She loved jumping and splashing in the pool, and so doing everything on her own. She looked to the side wall where her father was sitting. “Daddy, watch this!” she shouted, before leaping off the steps and propelling towards the platform set up in the water. Daddy smiled. She had come such a long way in these classes and could now really do lots of things on her own. The first half of class involved instruction on things like flipping and back floats, but the second half of class was the little girl’s favorite part. Less instruction, and more splashing! They got to take turns jumping off the deck of the pool, only to turn around, return to the deck, and pull themselves out. She was determined to make the biggest splash she’d every done today.  Her leap was so big, and her splash was so giant, it was hard to argue she didn’t succeed.Class ended with a “washing machine” where all the kids hang on the teacher while she spins them around in the water. Everyone giggles and laughs at that one. Leaving the pool, she ran back to her daddy who was waiting with a towel to make her dry and warm. A quick rinse, and change of clothes, and it might be time for the two of them to grab a post class treat. The little girl loved these fun Sunday mornings spent just with her dad."},{"question":"Write me a series of 3 haiku that captures the feeling of experiencing and ultimately conquering writer's block.","answer":"Chewing on my penBlank page staring back at meNothing comes to mindScribbles on the pageMost of it is nonsense butThe page isn't blankIdeas start to flowThe beast inside is conqueredI can write again"},{"question":"I’m planning on taking Amtrak Coach from Chigaco to San Francisco by the California Zephyr route.

Discuss the general method of repairing small and larger holes in sheetrock. Include general information on the cost of sheetrock, drywall joint compound, and drywall tape.","answer":"Small holes or cracks in sheetrock are easy to repair. Using a putty knife, or just your finger, spread some spackle into the hole or along the crack. Allow that to dry for several hours, thenlightly sand the area. You may need to touch up the paint. One jar of spackle costs a few dollars and can last up to a year or more. Keep the cover on tightly to prevent it from drying out.If you have a larger hole to cover, then it’s best to make a nice clean square-shaped cut using a hand saw. Next, cut out a piece of sheet rock the exact size of the hole. Gently place the sheetrock into the hole and tape and bed the area just as you normally would when hanging drywall. This involves applying tape and then texturing over it and sanding.Sheetrock is purchased in 4’ X 8’ pieces and is available in various thicknesses. Try to match what you currently have in your walls when making repairs. A 4’ X 8’ sheet costs anywhere from 12 to 20 per piece. Drywall joint compound (or mud) is about 20 for a 5-pound bucket. Drywall tape comes in at around 5 for a 250-foot roll.Though it may seem like a lot of trouble, once you buy these items, you’ll have them out in the garage or shed for any future sheetrocking repairs.

The brain integrates sensory information and directs motor responses; in higher vertebrates it is also the centre of learning. The human brain weighs approximately 1.4 kg (3 pounds) and is made up of billions of cells called neurons. Junctions between neurons, known as synapses, enable electrical and chemical messages to be transmitted from one neuron to the next in the brain, a process that underlies basic sensory functions and that is critical to learning, memory and thought formation, and other cognitive activities.In lower vertebrates the brain is tubular and resembles an early developmental stage of the brain in higher vertebrates. It consists of three distinct regions: the hindbrain, the midbrain, and the forebrain. Although the brain of higher vertebrates undergoes considerable modification during embryonic development, these three regions are still discernible.Superficial arteries and veins of face and scalp, cardiovascular system, human anatomy, (Netter replacement project - SSC)Britannica QuizThe Human Bodyhuman brain; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)human brain; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)The hindbrain is composed of the medulla oblongata and the pons. The medulla transmits signals between the spinal cord and the higher parts of the brain; it also controls such autonomic functions as heartbeat and respiration. The pons is partly made up of tracts connecting the spinal cord with higher brain levels, and it also contains cell groups that transfer information from the cerebrum to the cerebellum.The midbrain, the upper portion of which evolved from the optic lobes, is the main centre of sensory integration in fish and amphibians. It also is involved with integration in reptiles and birds. In mammals the midbrain is greatly reduced, serving primarily as a connecting link between the hindbrain and the forebrain.Connected to the medulla, pons, and midbrain by large bundles of fibres is the cerebellum. Relatively large in humans, this “little brain” controls balance and coordination by producing smooth, coordinated movements of muscle groups.The forebrain includes the cerebral hemispheres and, under these, the brainstem, which contains the thalamus and hypothalamus. The thalamus is the main relay centre between the medulla and the cerebrum; the hypothalamus is an important control centre for sex drive, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst, blood pressure, body temperature, and other visceral functions. The hypothalamus produces hormones that control the secretions of the anterior pituitary gland, and it also produces oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone, which are stored in and released by the posterior pituitary gland.","answer":"The brain, our friend in the anterior endWhere ideas are born, where thoughts do attendSensory cues light the wayThis knowledge humans use todayIt’s light as a feather at just three pounds.With neurons and electric pulses abound.Endless messages leave their mark.In days of sunlight, storms, light and darkThere are other creatures.With familiar featuresThough simple in nature in veinHigher vertebrate hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrainIf you look in the hindbrain, you’ll seeThe medulla oblongata freeAnd the pons, a bridge, sends support To special friends, the heart and spinal cordThen the midbrain, through the optic lobesIs the centerpiece of senses to find controlsCerebellum, for humans, is what steadies our feetBut that isn’t all; its function reigns supremeForebrain, which houses our thoughts, dwellsBeneeath cerebrum veilsThe brainstem is safe hereThe body’s overseerFrom craving food to craving waterTo senses, both cold and those hotterHormones and oxytocin Everything above sets our bodies into motion"},{"question":"Rewrite the conversation adding a third person Duke who disagrees with everything Joan and Luke say.Joan: Hey, lately, relationships have been on my mind a lot.

Born on San Nicholas, her tribe faced devastation in the early 1800s when hostile hunters slaughtered most of its members. In 1835, missionaries evacuated the remaining survivors, but Juana Maria, in a desperate search for her missing infant, ran back to the island and was inadvertently left behind when rescue efforts fell through. Thus, she was left to fend for herself in complete isolation on San Nicholas.For the next 18 years, Juana Maria sought refuge in a cave and relied on fishing using seashell hooks. She skillfully captured sea birds and seals, utilizing their feathers and skins to create dresses. She occupied her time by weaving baskets and bowls from grasses, showcasing her resourcefulness and adaptability. However, her solitude was interrupted in 1853 when Captain George Nidever discovered her presence on San Nicholas. Several weeks later, Nidever brought Juana Maria to Santa Barbara. Although communication was challenging due to the language barrier, Juana Maria managed to convey her extraordinary tale of survival through hand gestures.Tragically, Juana Maria's adjustment to mainland life proved difficult. She struggled with the unfamiliar diet and succumbed to dysentery a mere two months after leaving her isolated island. Her remarkable story captivated the public's imagination and was later fictionalized in the popular children's novel \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins.\\" "},{"question":"Can you list all the colleges/universities in Michigan that have a dedicated writing major?

Many people made a habit of going to Blockbuster once a week to pick a movie. It became a true part of people's routines.

Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy with over 900 million in debt. There are no more Blockbuster stores. What happened? The easy answer is the emergence of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. But Blockbuster was struggling even before Netflix moved to a streaming service. And the issues that caused the downfall of Blockbuster are bigger and more complex than the rise of streaming services. Along with the emergence of sites like Netflix, Blockbuster struggled to stay up-to-date with the demands of the times.

What are some recipes I can make and freeze to get rid of them all before they rot?","answer":"Congratulations on a bountiful tomato harvest! Here are some things you can do with the tomatoes you've grown: -Tomato soup: When made from scratch, this requires a whole lot of tomatoes. You might be able to use them all for one large pot of soup. Enjoy some for dinner with grilled cheese sandwiches or toasted bread, and freeze the leftovers for a rainy day.-Homemade marinara sauce: If you can your tomato sauce, you can store it for a long time and use it for pasta, pizzas, or as a dipping sauce. -Cooked and canned salsa: There are lots of different recipes you can experiment with when making salsa, but the flavor of homegrown tomatoes will always give it a competitive edge over store-bought salsa.-Homemade ketchup: Though somewhat labor intensive, homemade ketchup has much less sugar and fewer preservatives than store-bought versions, making it a healthy staple to keep on hand. -Tomato juice: You can drink tomato juice, use it to make bloody marys, marinate meat in it, or even use it as a deodorizer for your refrigerator. -Freeze them: You can actually freeze whole tomatoes, whether they're cooked or raw, and use them at a later point in time. -DIY sun-dried: You can make your own sun-dried tomatoes at home by the pound for a fraction of what you'd pay for a small jar at the grocery store.-Italian oil or butter: You can make a large batch of either olive oil or butter mixed with tomatoes, garlic, and basil; freeze in large containers or in ice cube trays and cook with it later on for an extra dose of fresh summery flavor at any time of year. -Veggie stuffed bread loaf: You can make a loaf of cornbread with tomatoes and jalapeños mixed into the batter, or an Italian-style loaf with tomatoes, onions, and olives. These can be frozen for later consumption or given as gifts.Inedible recipes:-Skin cleanser: Mixed with aloe vera, tomato juice makes a great natural skincare product, useful for softening dry skin or treating sunburns."},{"question":"Please rewrite this with correct grammar and natural English.When they were sitting around the fire and talking about their life and experience, it was very touching 🥺❤ I'm very, very  happy!

Where did she die?Jean Racine, in full Jean-Baptiste Racine, (baptized December 22, 1639, La Ferté-Milon, France—died April 21, 1699, Paris), French dramatic poet and historiographer renowned for his mastery of French classical tragedy. His reputation rests on the plays he wrote between 1664 and 1691, notably Andromaque (first performed 1667, published 1668), Britannicus (first performed 1669, published 1670), Bérénice (first performed 1670, published 1671), Bajazet (first performed and published 1672), Phèdre (first performed and published 1677), and Athalie (first performed and published 1691).Racine was born into a provincial family of minor administrators who were financially comfortable and socially ambitious. His mother died 13 months after he was born, and his father died two years later. His maternal grandparents took him in, and, when his grandmother, Marie des Moulins, became a widow, she brought Racine with her, perhaps as early as 1646, to live at the convent of Port-Royal des Champs near Paris. Since a group of devout scholars and teachers had founded a school there, Racine had the opportunity to study the classics of Latin and Greek literature with distinguished masters. The school was steeped in the austere Roman Catholic reform movement that came to be known as Jansenism, which had recently been condemned by the church as heretical. The Jansenists participated in the centuries-long debate over the primacy of free will or of divine omnipotence in the process of salvation. Inspired by the writings of Saint Augustine, as transmitted by Cornelius Otto Jansen, bishop of Ypres, in his work Augustinus (1640), the Jansenists believed that salvation was a gift—a grace—that was accorded only by God and that free will played little role in the process. For these Augustinians, life on earth was to be a rigorous pursuit of penance for original sin. Since the French monarchy suspected the Jansenists of being not only theologically but also politically subversive, Racine’s lifelong relationship with his former friends and teachers remained ambivalent, inasmuch as the artist ever sought admittance into the secular realm of court society. His former teachers remained extremely disappointed in a man who had used his excellent education as a means of succeeding in a profession that Port-Royal considered an abomination, because the theatre promoted illusion as a distraction from reflection on the wretched human condition. The degree to which his upbringing at Port-Royal inspired Racine’s tragic vision is a question unlikely to be answered with any precision, given the other influences exerted on him, such as those of Greek and Roman tragedy, the Bible, and life itself.After leaving Port-Royal in 1653, Racine transferred to the College of Beauvais for almost two years and then returned to Port-Royal in October 1655 to complete his studies in rhetoric. The school at Port-Royal was closed by the authorities in 1656, but Racine was allowed to stay on there. When he was 18, the Jansenists sent him to study law at the College of Harcourt in Paris. Racine had both the disposition and the talent to thrive in the cultural climate of Paris, where to conform and to please—in Racine’s case, to please by his pen—were indispensable assets. One of the first manifestations of Racine’s intentions was his composition of a sonnet in praise of Jules Cardinal Mazarin, the prime minister of France, for successfully concluding a peace treaty with Spain (1659). This tribute reveals Racine’s strategy of social conquest through what was to become a vocation and a mission: to be acknowledged as the greatest literary figure of his age, in effect the Euripides of classical France.","answer":"Jean Racine was baptized on December 22, 1639.

I don't really know what to do. The question is: explore the development of a character in Dracula.","answer":"Absolutely; please find some ideas below:• Johnathan Harker: Johnathan goes through quite a lot of changes in the novel Dracula. In the beginning, he is an effeminate and uncertain young man, easily taken in and manipulated by the Count. As his character develops and he becomes more violent and assertive, it would be interesting to discuss how violence from the Count is considered barbaric, whereas violence from Harker is presented as righteous.• Mina Harker: Mina changes dramatically throughout the story. She is a constant companion to Johnathan, from his rescue in Budapest to the fateful carriage-top battle at the end of the novel. Mina's character could be examined in the light of how she is closer and further away emotionally from Johnathan at different times in the book and how this reflects Victorian discomfort with foreigners and infidelity.• Quincy P Morris: Quincy is an interesting character as he says little but does much. Quincy is the 'good' equivalent of the Count - a violent and romantic foreigner that tempts Lucy. As his character is taciturn throughout much of the novel, at first glance, he develops little - but consider the parallels between the three foreigners in the novel. Also, consider how his death at the end of the novel is in tandem with the Counts. Is it accidental that both non-English perish?I hope that helps!

Each paragraph should consist of 5 sentences or less. ","answer":"You should prepare to bring home a new puppy by ensuring you have all the necessary supplies and items. Most importantly, you'll need an in-depth understanding of the care needs and requirements of the puppy's breed. Small breed puppies will have different needs from medium and large breed puppies. Different breeds have different grooming needs. Some breed types will require more exercise than others, while some may need thorough behavioral training as soon as they are brought home. Necessary supplies and items include food and water bowls, leashes and collars, toys, bedding, food, parasite prevention, training treats, and a kennel for safe housing when unsupervised. The brand of food you feed your puppy needs to be specified for puppies of the same breed size to ensure they are receiving adequate nutrition as they grow and mature. Finally, you should make an appointment with your chosen veterinarian soon after they are brought home to ensure they are healthy and parasite free. Certain vaccinations are required for puppies of specific ages, so you will need to stay on top of vaccination appointments. It is important to remember that taking ownership of a puppy can be a 10-15 year commitment.

Could you rewrite it to make it sound more polite and simple so a 5th grader could understand it?People often say the key to confidence and success in life is to simply “not give a fuck.” Indeed, we often refer to the strongest, most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucks given. Like “Oh, look at Susie working weekends again, she doesn’t give a fuck.” Or “Did you hear that Tom called the company president an asshole and still got a raise anyway? Holy shit, that dude does not give a fuck.” Or “Jason got up and ended his date with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wasn’t going to listen to her bullshit anymore. Man, that guy does not give a fuck.”Chances are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another, did not give a fuck and went on to accomplish amazing feats. Perhaps there was a time in your life where you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary heights. I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice online ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fuck” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fucks given? None. Just went and did it.Everybody just wants to be liked and accepted. Except for Tim. Tim doesn't give a fuck.Now, while not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it’s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don’t even know what that sentence means, but I don’t give a fuck. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let’s just go with it.The point is, most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given. We give a fuck about the rude gas station attendant who gave us too many nickels. We give a fuck when a show we liked was canceled on TV. We give a fuck when our coworkers don’t bother asking us about our awesome weekend. We give a fuck when it’s raining and we were supposed to go jogging in the morning.Fucks given everywhere. Strewn about like seeds in mother-fucking spring time. And for what purpose? For what reason? Convenience? Easy comforts? A pat on the fucking back maybe?This is the problem, my friend.Because when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, that’s when life fucks us.","answer":"People say that you'd have to not care too much to get confidence and success. And that's true because we all think the coolest people are the people who don't let something affect them too much. Susie doesn't let the fact she has to work weekends mess with her mood; Tom doesn't let the stress at work stop him from being himself; Jason doesn't let other people's opinions stop him from walking out from an event he doesn't enjoy.You may know somebody who didn't care about what others thought and did something super cool. Maybe even you did something amazing because you didn't care about what others thought. I know that one of my best moments was when I stopped caring too much and told my boss that I wanted to quit my job because I wanted to sell dating advice. Another of my best moments was selling everything I owned to move to South America. I didn't care too much; I just did it anyway.Everyone in the world wants to be liked and accepted, but there are some people, like Tim, who don't care much about these things.Even though not caring about what others think sounds easy, it's actually a whole chunk of fish and chips in it. I'm not sure what I just said, but I don't really care. But hey, fish and chips are lovely, so let's leave the sentence that way.What I mean is most people care too much all the time, even during times when they shouldn't. We care when someone gives us too many coins. We care when our favorite show gets canceled. We care when our colleagues didn't ask us what we got up to on the weekend. We care when the day we wanted to exercise was a rainy one instead.People care about this, people care about that. Care is everywhere in the world... But why? What is it for? To make yourself feel like you fit in?That's the problem.When we choose to care about everything, we feel like we deserve to be comfortable and happy.

Make sure one of the paragraphs is about innovations in undergarments.","answer":"At the Tudor court, small, flat-fronted waists leading to full breasts pressed down by the square-necked gown were all the rage. How was that achieved? In short, it was the use of busks that produced the silhouette and structure of the upper part of gowns. A busk could be made out of wood, bone, or sometimes metal. During the Tudor period, these flat inserts became more and more ornamental. They could be etched with personal messages or swirls of branching flora. These busks were the first step toward the corset we would later become so familiar with, providing rigidity and forcing good posture that advertised to the world that a woman was high-born. One very important piece of underwear was the \\"bum roll.\\" Showing up for the first time in the 1500s, this stuffed tube of fabric was tied around the lower portion of a lady's waist to increase her hip circumference and the amount of fabric she could wear on her skirts. Since silks and brocades were the going materials of the day and deeply exclusive because of cost, the more fabric worn translated into more wealth a wearer was likely to have. These bum rolls allowed for wide swathes of skirts, more pleats, and flounces. These undergarments also helped the women to bear some of the weight of their heavy skirts without it sitting directly on their hip bones. Tudor fashion was more about statement than comfort. Like busks, bum rolls were essentially shapewear, modifying the female silhouette to what was considered ideal at the time. One of the most important pieces of jewelry a woman of this period may have owned would have been her girdle belt. This was a long string, often of silver or gold and embellished with gems, that highlighted a woman's small waist and hung downward. Some women wore a pomander ball at the end of their girdle belts for when the city air got especially ripe. Others, like Anne Boleyn, used it to carry small prayer books about with them. Katherine of Aragon was even known to clutch the girdle belt of her patron saint while in childbirth, though this doesn't seem to have provided her with any luck. There are portraits of Kaherine herself in an immense string of pearls girdle belt that matches her royal necklaces. One of Jane Seymour, Henry's third wife, shows a girdle belt with a pattern of pearls and red gems that leads to a very large oval stone set in gold at the end.

How and where should I start?","answer":"To begin, identify what and where needs to be cleaned. Let’s take a cluttered bedroom. You might start with any clothes that are on the floor or anywhere outside a dresser or basket. If it’s clean, put it away. If not, put it into a laundry basket or bag. Just performing this first step is a big one, and lets you take the next one.Continuing with the bedroom, now that the clothes are picked up, what about the bed? If it needs to be made, go ahead and make it. Be sure to smooth out the top and bottom sheets before putting a blanket back on top. Do you have a nightstand next to the bed? Is it minimal, or full of wrappers and drink glasses? This and any dressers or other furniture should be your next plan of attack.You may be wondering, what about the vacuum? Before we do that, let’s make sure our surfaces are clean. You can use any number of light cleaning solutions, or even just plain soap and water, depending on the surface you are cleaning. But the goal is to get any dirt off the surfaces and onto a rag or the floor. Use a window cleaning agent to wipe down any mirrors, and perhaps even get the windows while you are at it.

Global average temperature has increased about 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016.1 Changes of one or two degrees in the average temperature of the planet can cause potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather. These real, observable changes are what we call climate change impacts​​​​​​ because they are the visible ways that climate change is affecting the Earth. For example, many places have experienced changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves. The planet's oceans and glaciers have also experienced changes—oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, ice caps are melting, and sea level is rising. As these and other changes become more pronounced in the coming decades, they will likely present challenges to our society and our environment.Warmer temperatures increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves,2 which can pose health risks, particularly for young children and the elderly.Climate change can also impact human health by worsening air and water quality, increasing the spread of certain diseases, and altering the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.3Rising sea level threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.4Changes in the patterns and amount of rainfall, as well as changes in the timing and amount of stream flow, can affect water supplies and water quality and the production of hydroelectricity.5Changing ecosystems influence geographic ranges of many plant and animal species and the timing of their lifecycle events, such as migration and reproduction.6Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, and floods, can increase losses to property, cause costly disruptions to society, and reduce the affordability of insurance.7","answer":"It can be denied no longer: climate change is real, and it is a threat to the globe. The average temperature has been raised by almost 2°F in the past century, causing dramatic and unprecedented effects across the world. We need to put an end to this before it causes deeper and more permanent changes to our lives, ecosystem, and planet. Our air is being polluted, our ecosystems are being threatened, our seas are rising, and our planet is being destroyed. Communities across the globe are being harmed: not just ours, but those of wildlife as well. These changes are causing more natural disasters which can be seen in extreme weather events like droughts, floods, wildfires, and heat waves. To stop these events that endanger us all, we must put an end to the causes of climate change, both to better our planet and to better the lives of ourselves and future generations. We must put every effort we have into stopping climate change before it progresses further and causes irreparable damage.

The network signed on from its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, with a lead story about the attempted assassination of civil rights leader Vernon Jordan. CNN went on to change the notion that news could only be reported at fixed times throughout the day. At the time of CNN’s launch, TV news was dominated by three major networks—ABC, CBS and NBC—and their nightly 30-minute broadcasts. CNN was the brainchild of Robert “Ted” Turner, a colorful, outspoken businessman dubbed the “Mouth of the South.” Turner was born on November 19, 1938, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and as a child moved with his family to Georgia, where his father ran a successful billboard advertising company. After his father died by suicide in 1963, Turner took over the business and expanded it. In 1970, he bought a failing Atlanta TV station that broadcast old movies and network reruns and within a few years Turner had transformed it into a “superstation,” a concept he pioneered, in which the station was beamed by satellite into homes across the country. Turner later bought the Atlanta Braves baseball team and the Atlanta Hawks basketball team and aired their games on his network, TBS (Turner Broadcasting System). In 1977, Turner gained international fame when he sailed his yacht to victory in the prestigious America’s Cup race.In its first years of operation, CNN lost money and was ridiculed as the Chicken Noodle Network. However, Turner continued to invest in building up the network’s news bureaus around the world and in 1983, he bought Satellite News Channel, owned in part by ABC, and thereby eliminated CNN’s main competitor. CNN eventually came to be known for covering live events around the world as they happened, often beating the major networks to the punch. The network gained significant traction with its live coverage of the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and the network’s audience grew along with the increasing popularity of cable television during the 1990s and well into the 21st century.","answer":"CNN, which means Cable News Network, became the world's first 24-hour TV news in 1980.

When CNN started there were only three other big channels that had 30-minute news reports. CNN was made by Ted Turner. He was a loud businessman that was often called the \\"Mouth of the South\\". Ted Turner was born in 1938 in Ohio and moved to Georgia for his father's job. Ted Turner took over his father's advertising company in 1963.

Ted Turner changed this channel into a \\"superstation\\" with the station being able to be seen by people all over the United States. Ted Turner also bought the Atlanta Braves baseball team and the Atlanta Hawks basketball team and played their games on one of his channels. He then got famous when he sailed his boat and won the important America's Cup race. When CNN first started, people made fun of it and called it the Chicken Noodle Network. Ted Turner ignored this and kept going to build up the news company. In 1983, he bought Satellite News Channel which was a main competitor for CNN. CNN became known to people by covering live events everywhere around the world. They were even able to cover these news events as they happened, which was quicker than many other news channels.

Not like he's about to laugh or make a joke; no, he's looking at me like my face is somehow more fascinating than the vivid sunset hues spread over the mountains ahead of us, and also like he might be somewhat nauseous. I'm about to bring my fingers to my cheeks and ask if there's something on my face when I suddenly realize what's happening and start to feel a touch nauseous, too.

Almost immediately, he stiffens and pulls away. “Oh,” he starts, “I’m sorry, Nora, I didn’t think you would—object, honestly—““No!” I squeak, “That’s not...” Then I draw a breath to summon courage and lunge back at him with a vengeance.

Source Text: [The firm-foundation theory argues that each investment instrument, be it a common stock or a piece of real estate, has a firm anchor of something called intrinsic value, which can be determined by careful analysis of present conditions and future prospects. When market prices fall below (rise above) this firm foundation of intrinsic value, a buying (selling) opportunity arises, because this fluctuation will eventually be corrected—or so the theory goes. Investing then becomes a dull but straightforward matter of comparing something’s actual price with its firm foundation of value. In The Theory of Investment Value, Williams presented a formula for determining the intrinsic value of stock. Williams based his approach on dividend income. In a fiendishly clever attempt to keep things from being simple, he introduced the concept of “discounting.” Discounting basically involves looking at income backwards. Rather than seeing how much money you will have next year (say 1.05 if you put 1 in a savings certificate at 5 percent interest), you look at money expected in the future and see how much less it is worth currently (thus, next year’s 1 is worth today only about 95¢, which could be invested at 5 percent to produce approximately 1 at that time). Williams actually was serious about this. He went on to argue that the intrinsic value of a stock was equal to the present (or discounted) value of all its future dividends. Investors were advised to “discount” the value of moneys received later. Because so few people understood it, the term caught on and “discounting” now enjoys popular usage among investment people. It received a further boost under the aegis of Professor Irving Fisher of Yale, a distinguished economist and investor.]","answer":"The firm-foundation theory argues that every investment instrument has a firm anchor of intrinsic value which can be determined by analyzing present conditions and future prospects.

She was so upset that she left the pond and started walking across the green grass, lost in her own thoughts. Finally, she stumbled upon another pond - one she had never seen before. A whole group of young ducks came swimming over and shouting at her, “what are you doing here? Where did you come from?”While the young duck was scared, she explained how she had left home to find a new home. Within a few minutes, all the other ducks were telling their stories about when they left home and how fun it was to be out on your own. She didn’t feel so alone anymore; in fact, she was pretty excited."},{"question":"How many championships did Michael Schumacher win with Ferrari? Give me an overview of his championship years. Use a bullet point list to list the championship years. Each bullet point should be less than 6 sentences in length. Be sure to talk about records he broke during the seasons.","answer":"• 2000 Championship winning season - This season consisted of a hard battle with McClaren driver Mikka Häkkinen. Schumacher had much more success when it came to winning races, but the team struggled with DNF results. In the end, Schumacher secured the Championship at Suzuka after a dramatic race in which Schumacher passed Häkkinen to clinch the title.• 2001 Championship winning season - This season was dominant for Schumacher. No other driver posed much of a challenge, and he won 9 times during the season. Schumacher would clinch the championship with four races to go and ended up finishing 58 points ahead of second place.• 2002 Championship winning season - This was another dominant season for Schumacher and Ferrari — perhaps the most dominant. Schumacher would clinch the championship with six races left and won a record-breaking 11 races. There were 17 races that year and Ferrari won all but two. This was also the season where Schumacher tied the long-standing record of Juan Manuel Fangio's 5 World Drivers' Championships.• 2003 Championship winning season - The 2003 season was a season of regulation changes designed to make the racing more competitive, and it worked. Schumacher just barely won the championship with a two-point lead over his season rival, Kimi Räikkönen. Schumacher became the driver with the most Formula One World Drivers' Championships in history.• 2004 Championship winning season - Despite regulation changes the previous year and a much more competitive 2003 season, this would be another dominant season for Schumacher and Ferrari. The level of dominance was on par with his 2002 season, and Schumacher would once again break the record for most races won in a season. In the first 13 races of the season, Schumacher only lost once. He went on to rack up an astounding 13 wins in 18 races over the course of the season. He once again had no serious rival with his teammate, Reubens Barrichello, taking second place in the championship standings."},{"question":"Parse the article below for the names of the victims and give them to me using one sentence that is designated by a bullet point.

Just days before, stabbings at two parks near campus claimed the lives of UC Davis senior Karim Abou Najm on Saturday and David Breaux on Thursday.Mrak Hall, administrative center of UC Davis, Davis, California. Taken February 11, 2015.3rd stabbing in a week near UC Davis leaves campus on edge as officials lift overnight shelter-in-place orderThe violence has put the college community on edge and prompted officials to ramp up security measures and urge students to be ultra-vigilant.“Nobody should go into class knowing they have a risk of getting murdered. It’s just not worth it,” UC-Davis sophomore Henry Li told CNN. He added that he’s considering leaving town for the summer or even transferring to another school.Davis Police have stopped short of issuing a curfew, saying it’s an extraordinary move at this time. It remains unclear whether the attacks were linked, though police have noted some similarities surrounding how they were carried out.Elaine Lu, a recent graduate of UC Davis, was visiting campus and said the town had always felt safe — until now. She and her friends decided to stay inside at night following the attacks, she said.“This kind of thing never happened before. After this murder, everyone is going to be so intimidated about it. I hope the school can improve their safety,” Lu told CNN.On Tuesday, Chancellor Gary S. May announced all classes ending after 6 p.m. would be taught virtually instead of in classrooms. That change, which Li said made him feel safer, began Tuesday, and will remain in place indefinitely.“We are aware of how troubling this is to the community. It’s making people fearful and anxious, and we encourage the community to take advantage of whatever resources are available,” May said during a news briefing Tuesday.Police patrols on campus and around the city have been increased, with help from hired security and police from the UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley, according to UC Davis Police Chief Joseph A.

However, there isn't a lot of sound research to back these claims. It's also important to note that some brands are more effective at blocking blue light than others. For those that suffer from migraines and light sensitivity, a specific light-filtering (not just blue light) lens may be beneficial. For the majority of people that just want to reduce digital eye strain, blue light glasses may not do much. People are better off monitoring their screen time and following the 20-20-20 rule according to experts. This involves looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes. Where did the idea come from that we need to be blocking blue light you ask? The biggest source of blue light is from the sun, but when we say blue light, we're usually referring to artificial blue light from digital screens. In an evolving digital world, people are spending more and more time in front of screens. This is associated with some health problems like eye strain, headaches, and sleep disturbances.Some scientists hypothesized the role of blue light in these issues.  An in vitro study (meaning in cells not in real humans) alluded to the fact that blue light harms ocular cells. A research study in mice illustrated that as exposure to blue light increased, instances of cataracts increased. Other recent research concluded that blue light glasses did not help mitigate the effects of screen exposure compared to a placebo. Research into this area is ongoing, but there is no undisputed answer at this point in time. There is slightly stronger research into the effects of blue light on melatonin. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that wearing blue light glasses before sleep may improve sleep quality. To summarize, if you are looking to reduce digital eye strain, blue light glasses should not be the sole solution. If you feel that they help, by all means, invest in a good pair from a reputable brand. The best ways to reduce eye strain though is to remain at arm's length from your screen, follow the 20-20-20 rule, and try and reduce your overall screen time.

It should exemplify the implicit moral of not antagonizing or disrupting the wildlife.","answer":"Tory, Dannie, and Jett were having the time of their life on the safari. They had seen a number of antelope, baboons, and even lions. As they slowly crawled along the dirt path, they saw a large figure looming up ahead.\\"It's an elephant!\\" Dannie cried, almost hopping up from the back seat. Jett pressed on the gas, and they accelerated towards the massive mammal. It was pretty close to the road, reaching for leaves from a nearby tree. Jett stopped nearby, and the three gawked.\\"It's huge!\\" Tory said in amazement. \\"Honk at it.\\" Dannie punched Jett's shoulder, her eyes never leaving the elephant. It had noticed them now and tensed, holding its ears out. It stomped its foot in agitation and trumpeted at them. Against his better judgment, Jett honked the horn to get the elephant's attention. It was enraged now and began dashing towards them at alarming speed.\\"Go, go, go!\\" Tory clutched the back of the headrest as the car lurched forward.

They can often remember information better if it's presented visually rather than delivered orally. These individuals might benefit from strategies like using flashcards, taking notes, or watching videos to grasp and retain new information.-Auditory learners, as the name suggests, learn best through listening. They are good at remembering things that they hear, like spoken words, music, or ambient sounds. These individuals may prefer lectures, group discussions, and audio resources for learning. When studying, they might benefit from reading text aloud or using a tape recorder to playback information.-Kinesthetic learners prefer a more physical style of learning through doing and moving. They learn best when they can use tactile experiences and carry out a physical activity to understand a concept. This could include role-playing, building models, or using physical objects that can be touched or manipulated. Kinesthetic learners often prefer a 'hands-on' approach to learning, rather than sitting still for long periods."},{"question":"Computer, I need some creative writing inspiration. Please write a few paragraphs about a space explorer who just landed on a beautiful untouched planet.","answer":"The hatch slid open with a comforting hiss. Immediately, my spacesuit’s microphones relayed the whistle of the planet’s brisk breeze. It seemed a shame I couldn’t draw a deep breath of it and smell the pristine air, but the hydrogen cyanide that made up 30% of the planet’s atmosphere would have made that a bad idea. Instead, I drank in the scene with my eyes. The horizon to the north was dominated by jagged lavender peaks that ended just below blue clouds. Toward the east were immense rock formations that would put all of Earth’s national parks to shame. Each one was striated with layers of burgundy, ochre, crimson, and the occasional thin line of teal that made everything pop.Between those rocks and my ship was a broad floodplain full of orange soil. Only a small stream of yellow liquid flowed down from the mountains at the moment, but it was clear that this whole landscape could change in a hurry when the rains came. No sight I’d ever beheld could compare and I knew I’d probably never feel such an incalculable sense of awe again. And all this was in spite of the fact that there were no plants to speak of. No forests framed the landscape. No wildflowers pocked the surface. Not a speck of life could be found anywhere. As of this moment, I was the only human - and indeed maybe the only living thing - to have ever looked upon it.I felt a slight pang of shame for daring to intrude upon this pristine perfection.

She also suffered from pulmonary edema. It’s a condition when the lungs get filled with fluid, so they had to operate on that too.It's been more than 24 hours, and it’s still the same. She also had a thyroid problem, so that’s not helping either. She’s also having a blood transfusion reaction, and her body is killing the red blood cells. All of that is damaging her heart.

Lenny had never been outside of the city in the 26 years he had been alive; Sally, on the other hand, grew up in West Virginia, where she was surrounded by beautiful snow-capped mountains and vast forests. On this second date, Lenny and Sally decided to drive approximately 30 miles north out of the city and away from the hustle and bustle of metropolitan life, toward a rocky mountain trail that boasted several miles of scenic hiking trails and a rumor of a hidden waterfall deep in the valley.They drove in Lenny's car, a modern SUV capable of transporting two dating humans and their supplies: a cooler filled with ice, drinks and snacks, hiking gear, backpacks and swim attire. Lenny concentrated on the road but was able to keep an engaging conversation with Sally, who sat in the passenger's seat. \\"I haven't been on this particular hike before, but I have read about it online and have been wanting to go. Now I'm glad I have someone to go with me!\\" Sally told Lenny with excitement in her voice. Lenny was excited as well, but also a bit apprehensive at the idea of going hiking in an unfamiliar environment. The most hiking Lenny had ever done was going from block to block when visiting his favorite restaurants a few miles from his apartment building. He wondered if he would be accosted by bears or bitten by snakes while he was there, but he didn't want to appear nervous and risk looking weak in front of his new friend.As if Sally had read Lenny's mind, she immediately confessed: \\"I hope we don't get mauled by bears while we're out there hiking!\\" Lenny, with a nervous laugh, replied: \\"Don't worry, I'll protect you.\\" Sally, with a wry smile, let Lenny in on the joke. \\"I'm just playing. There's no wildlife where we're going. It's mostly well-established trails and lots of trees and birds. Plus, there are park rangers from the nearby forest reserves that can assist us in case we need it. We'll be fine.\\""},{"question":"Please write me a short story about a serial killer.

Describe the creepy house and garden. Build up the tension and suspense by referring to a dark past. Use first-person narrative. ","answer":"The full moon cast an eerie glow on the creepy, old Manor House. As I approached, I became increasingly nervous. It appeared more and more ominous in the gathering gloom. The old house was more threatening, more sinister than I could ever have envisaged. It had fallen into a derelict state and its facade was one of utter dilapidation. There were crumbling walls, peeling paintwork, and cracked walls. There was also a gaping hole in the roof, where tiles had blown off last winter in the gales. Cobwebs decked every window and hung like macabre Halloween decorations.Then, there was the garden. Just a tangle of overgrown shrubs and trees, where roots had broken up the path. The heads of grotesque-looking statues stuck out amidst the tangle of weeds. They looked supernatural in the dusk. Almost unearthly! Some said the garden housed an ancient graveyard. Former residents of the house were laid to rest in the place where they had lived and died. They were destined to roam forever as ghosts within the walls of the manor.The house stood as a relic from a past era. People said it was old, ancient even. Nobody could date it, but everyone knew it was a house with a terrible reputation. The exact nature and circumstances were shrouded in mystery. Numerous rumors of its dark former life were whispered in hushed tones. Some talked of a murder: an innocent young girl, strangled in her bed as she slept. Others dismissed it as a legend. It was a secret lost to the depths of time. Some people told of strange goings-on. There were unexplainable noises at night. Haunting screams echoed out at midnight, as eerie, bloodcurdling moans, and dark shadows complete with disfigured faces were seen in the windows. That was enough to give even the bravest soul nightmares. The tales became more ghastly, more terrifying, and more outlandish every time they were recounted. I tried desperately to push these images to the back of my mind, but I could not escape the impending doom and feeling that horrific evil lingered beneath the walls of this house.This place was truly hostile. I paused, momentarily overcome with fear and trepidation at my mission. Through it all, I had made my mind up. I would face my fear and go in.

However, it was only by custom that bus drivers had the authority to ask a Black person to give up a seat for a white rider. There were contradictory Montgomery laws on the books: One said segregation must be enforced, but another, largely ignored, said no person (white or Black) could be asked to give up a seat even if there were no other seats on the bus available.Nonetheless, at one point on the route, a white man had no seat because all the seats in the designated “white” section were taken. So the driver told the riders in the four seats of the first row of the “colored” section to stand, in effect adding another row to the “white” section. The three others obeyed. Parks did not.","answer":"In Montgomery, there were laws about what we now call segregation. The law said black people had to sit on the back of the bus in the \\"colored\\" section, while white people could sit up at the front of the bus in the \\"white\\" section. Now, if a white rider got on the bus and it was full, the bus driver could ask a black person to give up their seat. This wasn't always true for all buses because the rules could be confusing.

","answer":"Believe me, a man who assassinates a US President is not someone who had a pleasant life or was well in the head. Lee Harvey Oswald had issues with spelling and reading as a child, though grew to become an avid reader. He declared himself a socialist after reading a good deal of socialist literature, even writing to America's Socialist Party to ask about joining their programs. However, one of his friends at the time disputes that his reading habits were especially sophisticated. I could never judge a man for how he gets into reading, though I can and do judge him for how he would repeat the history of what happened to me. Regardless of how true his claims to read socialist theory were, he was so vocally pro-Soviet that when he joined the US military, he gained the nickname \\"Oswaldskovich.\\"Over three score ago, Oswald taught himself Russian and traveled to the USSR. He insisted to Soviet officials that he loved the Soviet Union and wanted to join. They initially rejected his citizenship application, so he forced them to keep him in the country with a self-inflicted wound. He offered his knowledge of the American military to the Soviets and became a laborer in Belarus. He lived somewhat comfortably for a Soviet worker, though was constantly watched. After only two years, Oswald decided he would rather return to America. I can certainly remember a handful of Confederates who had second thoughts back in my time. Oswald thought that his work was dull and the recreational activities were lacking.

Please write that description into an introduction for an anime.","answer":"A truck came barrelling down the road without breaks. The light was red, but it didn't matter. The driver was sleep deprived and overworked. Anyone could make such a mistake. A teenager, Kaori, was on the crosswalk helping her grandfather cross. It would be both of their funerals. Kaori pushed her grandfather away and accepted her fate. She clenched her jaw and closed her eyes. A robed man dropped from the sky mere seconds before the truck would have killed Kaori and thrust his palm forward. The truck plowed into him and came to a violent stop. Kaori's ears rang as shrapnel lacerated her skin. The hand around her waist loosened as everything fell silent, and she looked up. It was a man in his late teens, probably. He had long, messy hair in a bun and a handsome face. He scowled as he looked at her and asked, \\"Are you okay?\\"Kaori nodded. \\"Good.\\"The man released her and was gone. Kaori dreamed of her savior that night and couldn't get his face out of her mind. The next day at school, as she bought her lunch at the school store, she caught a glimpse of her savior. But that couldn't have been right. The person she was looking at was Kuroki, an average-looking loner with an ugly mop of hair and glasses who blended into the background. However, she couldn't mistake those eyes anywhere. She followed him outside until she caught him alone and then confronted him, \\"you're the one who saved me yesterday! Be my boyfriend!\\"Kuroki narrowed his eyes at her and spoke with a congested voice, \\"huh? Oh, I get it. Someone dared you to do this.

It originally operated as a translator of Chicago sister station WCIU-TV, which at the time was an independent station with Telemundo as a secondary affiliation. On October 18, 1995, W58BT (channel 58, now WBND-LD on channel 57) became the South Bend market's new ABC affiliate, after full-power WSJV (channel 28) ended its affiliation with that network to join Fox.[3] Due to W58BT's low-power signal which could not reach the entire market, Weigel then converted W69BT into a translator of W58BT to reach areas that could not receive an adequate signal as Weigel campaigned the FCC to increase the station's signal radius, along with establishing its pay-TV coverage.After several years, those efforts were successful. As most of the market could receive channel 57 without issue, in October 1999, channel 69 became an affiliate of The WB with its own schedule. The station's callsign was changed to WMWB-LP (standing for \\"Michiana's WB\\").After Weigel purchased WYGN-LP (channel 25, now CW affiliate WCWW-LD) in 2002 from 3ABN, Weigel chose to move channel 69's schedule, call letters, and WB affiliation to that station, which was closer to the majority of the channels on the South Bend television dial. Channel 69 then adopted channel 25's former WRDY-LP call letters. It later changed its calls three more times: first to WAAT-LP in 2004, then briefly to WCWW-LP in March 2006. From 2002 until 2004, it was once again simulcasting ABC programming from WBND-LP; after that, it returned to being an independent station, with occasional programming from the Sportsman Channel.

In between the gingerbread tiles, there was hard, crusted icing. Intricate patterns of jelly beans and hard candies adorned the walls and wrapped themselves around the windows and doors, and although they did look scrumptious, they were also quite clearly a bit sticky. The window panes were cast from sugar into what should have been a crystal clear finish; however, for some reason, they were starting to distort and fog. If you look around the garden, the house is sitting in a field of candyfloss grass that makes the mouth truly water.

Change the dating system from B.C. to BCE.The Ancient Greeks, particularly the Ancient Athenians, are given the credit for inventing theater itself. As a result of that, theater became part of the culture, as well as everything that went along with it. There are theaters located throughout Ancient Greece. Also as a result of this fact, playwrights began to spring up all over Greece. One of the most well known of these is Euripides, who is especially noted for his tragedies. He is also one of the only playwrights whose work has actually survived. Here is some more information about this famous playwright from Ancient Greece:Information About EuripidesEuripides as born in 480 B.C. in Salamis, which is an island in the Saronic Gulf in Greece. It is interesting to note that he was born on the same day as the Battle of Salamis, where the ultimate victory of the Greeks prevented an invasion by the Persian Empire. He died in 406 B.C. in the city-state of Macedonia. His mother’s name was Cleito and his father’s name was Mnesarchus. His father insisted that he should be an athlete. Although his parents valued athletics, however, he wasn’t restricted in his education. He also learned artistic pursuits, such as painting, as well as philosophy from masters such as Anaxagorus. He was also a dancer and torch bearer at the rites of Apollo Zosterius. Later on, it was clear that he had a knack for the stage and he eventually began writing the plays he was most famous for.His personal life, however, wasn’t as successful as his professional one. He was actually married twice and in both instances, his wives weren’t faithful to him. He also had three sons from one of these marriages. After this happened, he moved to a cave in Salamis because he wanted to live alone. Referred to as the Cave of Euripides, after his death his followers started a shrine in his honor.Works of EuripidesThere is actually some debate as to how many plays there are that were written by Euripides that we know of. Some sources say that there are 95, others say that there are 92. One thing is certain, however, is that his impact on theater is vast and his plays are still being performed today. Of these plays, a much smaller number survived in its complete form. Only about eighteen or nineteen of his plays had been found in their entirety. Besides the fact that his plays have been entertaining people for centuries, his work has also influenced playwrights through the ages. In other words, his artistic legacy has survived the ages.Euripides was also a contemporary of two other famous playwrights. Sophocles’ first play deputed thirteen years before his, and Aeschylus’s masterwork, Oresteia, debuted three years before Euripides’ first play was released.As you can see, Euripedes has had a big impact on theater not only in Ancient Greece, but in the whole world. Sure, theater was invented in Ancient Greece, but the works of people like Euripides is everlasting and they’re still being performed today.","answer":"The ancient Greek playwright, Euripides was born on the Greek island of Salamis in 480 BCE. As a youth, he studied athletics, philosophy, and painting. He was a torchbearer and dancer during rites to the god Apollo. Though there are questions about how many plays he wrote, 18 or 19 of them survive in complete form today. After his second failed marriage, he took up residence in a cave on Salamis which is now called the Cave of Euripides.

Cats are great at grooming themselves, but it helps to brush them regularly to prevent hairballs and extra shedding.3. Give your cat stimulating toys. Different cats have different preferences for toys, so try to find a type that your cat specifically likes. It's good to get them a variety of toys because they need the extra stimulation.4. Buy or plant some cat grass. This plant is pretty easy to grow both indoors and outdoors and will be helpful to your cat's digestion.5. Give your cat a little catnip. While not all cats do well with catnip, many seem to find it enjoyable and stimulating.6. Get a cat bed. A cat bed will give your cat a dedicated place to curl up and nap.

Break it down into two sections: breakfast and dinner.","answer":"Cooking while camping doesn't need to be difficult. Many recipes only utilize a single piece of cookware. With simple ingredients and some prep work, food for a campsite can be fairly easy and still taste great! Here are a few suggestions of what you can bring.Breakfast- Sausage Sandwiches - One griddle is all you need. Prepare a sausage patty beforehand, and just throw it on the griddle on the campsite. A toasted biscuit with jam, jelly, honey, or whatever you'd like would be a very simple way to give the flavor a real kick. - French Toast Sticks - A classic breakfast option with the added benefit of becoming on-the-go finger food. This is great for when you want to make a camping breakfast fun for kids.- Breakfast Skillet - Everything in this is to taste. Simply put a skillet on a fire, and add what you like. A great way to start is with eggs, ham, and potatoes. There is no wrong option here, just add whatever hearty option makes you happy.Dinner- Dutch Oven Mac & Cheese - A comfort classic that will give you the carbs to carry on the next day. Just place the ingredients in the dutch oven, cover it with coals, then let it cook for ten minutes.- Hotdogs and Burgers - Many campsites come with a grill. Why not put it to use with an easy but delicious choice like burgers and dogs?- Silver Turtles - Similar to the breakfast skillet, silver turtles are a big conglomeration of the stuff that you like. The traditional way is with ground beef, onions, and other veggies, you can replace, mix, or match whatever you want to put in this dish. Gather ingredients in some aluminum foil, then roll it up. Set the whole thing in coals or fire, wait for it to cook through, and that's it. You can even eat right out of the foil and throw it away without any fuss.

Any format is fine.","answer":"The first step in managing stress is to understand it. Although the terms stress, worry, and anxiety are used interchangeably by many people, they do have differences. Stress involves reacting mentally and physically to a specific experience in your daily life. Anxiety, on the other hand, is what happens when stress continues without the stressor.Stress and anxiety management is a personal journey. What works for one person may not work for another. Try these coping strategies when you are feeling anxious or stressed:1. Deep Breathing: The most basic relaxation exercise is slow, rhythmic breathing from your abdomen to calm yourself.2. Meditation: Meditation is a proven method for relaxation of the mind and body. Meditation can bring you into the present by focusing your attention on your breathing, a few repeated words, a single repetitive action, or the flickering light from a candle.3. Self-Compassion: Self-compassion is the way to achieve well-being and relaxation through responding to yourself with kindness and understanding when you struggle with feelings of inadequacy, embarrassment, and other negative feelings."},{"question":"Write a review of a Nespresso Vertuo Coffee Machine.

For example, an individual might buy a certain type of chocolate for a while. Soon, they may buy less and choose another type of chocolate or buy cookies instead because the satisfaction they were initially getting from the chocolate is diminishing. Understanding the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Whenever an individual interacts or consumes an economic good, that individual acts in a way that demonstrates the order in which they value the use of that good. Thus, the first unit that is consumed satisfies the consumer's greatest need. The second unit results in a lesser amount of satisfaction, and so on. For example, consider an individual on a deserted island who finds a case of bottled water that washes ashore. That person might drink the first bottle indicating that satisfying their thirst was the most important use of the water. The individual might bathe themselves with the second bottle, or they might decide to save it for later. If they save it for later, this indicates that the person values the future use of the water more than bathing today, but still less than the immediate quenching of their thirst. This is called ordinal time preference. This concept helps explain savings and investing versus current consumption and spending. The example above also helps to explain why demand curves are downward sloping in microeconomic models since each additional unit of a good or service is put toward a less valuable use.","answer":"The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility explains that the value people place on goods decreases as they consume more units of it. For example, the satisfaction derived from one bottle of water may quench thirst, but the additional ones do not hold the same value for bathing or saving for the future. The concept explains why people choose to save and invest instead of spending immediately, and why demand curves have a downward slope in microeconomics."},{"question":"I need to write a short letter to an RA I have supervised this year, thanking them and wishing them well after the graduate.","answer":"Dear [student],I have loved getting to know and work with you this year.

Write a, 400-450 word article, as if you're a sports writer. ","answer":"First, let's list their stats:Bruno Mars - 5'5\\" 146lbsOctavian Augustus - UnknownIt's hard to call based on the stats, but Octavian likely has the edge because Bruno and Octavian were probably around the same height, but having unknown qualities could be an edge in the competition since Bruno wouldn't know what to prepare against.Bruno Mars might be nicknamed after a wrestler, but he's been singing and entertaining his whole life rather than working on any sports or physical activities that could help him in a boxing match. Octavian fought in wars from a young age, was wounded and overcame his injuries, survived a shipwreck, and he went on to win a civil war that transformed Rome into an Empire that dramatically changed the course of human history. So, Octavian seems to have an advantage.Octavian would have known and possibly even trained for Ancient Greek boxing or Pankration. Some ancient boxing matches used spiked gauntlets, and others used wrestling techniques combined with striking which would be more similar to modern MMA. If you put Bruno in boxing matches like those, he probably doesn't stand a chance. However, contemporary boxing uses vastly different techniques that could give Bruno an edge. Ancient Greek boxing didn't have much footwork, so Bruno could get a slight edge if he learned to move correctly. Pankration fighting and even early modern boxing didn't aim for the head because the head contains extremely hard bones that can easily break the delicate bones of the hand. Breaking fingers back then could mean death. Not only could boxers no longer defend themselves in combat, but they could lose the ability to take care of themselves after the fight and compound fractures could easily result in deadly infections. Instead, boxers of the past aimed for body shots to the liver for maximum damage and even today the liver shot is a brutal strategy. Of course, Octavian's concept of boxing would have limited him to only headshots, but it was more like slap boxing where fighters couldn't move much. The liver shot still works today and could catch Octavian off-guard, and Octavian wouldn't have a concept of head defense like Bruno would have seen in movies or at in-person boxing matches. A single well-timed jab could be lights-out for the Roman Emperor.Of course, if you give both of them time to train, and both fighters were trained equally, it's unlikely Bruno could put a dent in the former soldier."},{"question":"Create a new list of songs, titles only, but only include ones that are 4-5 minutes long - include the length of the track.

The duality of the portrayal of women gives a stark contrast between the characters Homer portrays as shallow or deep, regardless of the actual depth any of the women in this epic possessed.

It can be difficult to understand the grant funding opportunities from the federal government. Here is a brief breakdown of four different types of federal grants. 1. Competitive grants: Competitive grants are also known as discretionary funding. The awardee is not chosen beforehand, so the applicant must draft a comprehensive proposal to submit to the review board. Since these are “competitive” grants, there may be multiple organizations and individuals applying for a certain sum of money. 2. Formula grants: For formula grants, awardees are predetermined. The formula is how grant money is mathematically dispersed among awardees. An example of this type of grant is when state governments are awarded federal funding, but then this allotted amount is broken down into different projects and incentives at the local level. 3. Continuation grants: As the name implies, these are for grantees that desire to renew an existing grant and continue to receive funding for their projects. It’s important to note that even though the grant money has been awarded in the past, it does not always guarantee continued funding. Those applying for continuation grants will sometimes be competing against those will new ideas and compelling proposals. 4. Pass-through grants: Pass-through grants are issued by a federal agency, but dealt with by state governments. At the state level, the government has the autonomy to allocate funds where it is deemed necessary in the form of competitive or noncompetitive grants. By first understanding these four types of federal grants, you or the organization you represent will know more about the funding at your disposal.

Include any variation of name(s) in a numbered list. Don't include duplicates. Thanks.Today began with another story about yet more ties between Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas and Republican billionaire Harlan Crow. Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, and Alex Mierjeski of ProPublica reported that Crow paid the private school tuition for Thomas’s grandnephew, to the tune of more than 6,000 a month, ultimately adding up to an amount that may have been more than 150,000. Thomas did not report the payments.Then news broke that a jury in Washington, D.C., found four members of the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys—Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl—guilty of seditious conspiracy for their participation in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. A fifth defendant, Dominic Pezzola, was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy but, like the others, was found guilty of other serious charges including obstructing Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election results and conspiring to prevent Congress and federal officers from discharging their duties.In a statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted that the Department of Justice has secured more than 600 convictions for criminal conduct surrounding the events of January 6, including fourteen “leaders of both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers for seditious conspiracy—specifically conspiring to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power. Our work will continue,” he said.It is unlikely that Garland’s statement about ongoing work was casual.Defense attorneys for the Proud Boys emphasized that their clients believed then-president Trump—who, after all, had told them in September 2020 to “stand back and stand by”—had called them to Washington to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Although there were no explicit orders to attack the Capitol, members of the Proud Boys testified that they believed there was an implicit agreement to prevent Biden from becoming president.Tarrio, convicted today, was not at the Capitol during the attack, but a jury convicted him of seditious conspiracy nonetheless, suggesting that leaders who incited the violence can be found guilty, even if they weren’t present.Today attorneys for E. Jean Carroll, who is suing the former president in a civil trial for battery and defamation connected with his alleged rape of her, rested their case. So did Trump’s lawyers, but District Judge Lewis Kaplan gave Trump the weekend to rethink testifying. “He has a right to testify which has been waived but if he has second thoughts, I’ll at least consider it and maybe we’ll see what happens,” Kaplan said.","answer":"1.

He got what he needed to take care of her through piracy – running a torrenting website that monetized illegal downloads of songs and movies. It wasn’t much, and he often thought about how lame he looked compared to the pirate crews of old.Back in the old days, pirates had their own republic and commanded massive vessels capable of going up against anyone, while he could only tackle defenseless ships and had to run before any assistance came. He didn’t have a crew to sing sea shanties with, a parrot to perch on his shoulder, and his tattered outfit certainly couldn’t compete with 17th-century fashion. As he was going to sleep one night, he thought to himself, “If I had to be a pirate, at least I could have been one of the cool ones.” The next morning, he woke up and quickly realized he was not in his home. It was dark and the world was rocking side to side around him. Was this an earthquake? No, the rocking was because he was at sea.

They stood politely while children took turns petting them, and sometimes would get treats in return. They really enjoyed getting little cups of corn that the children could buy for fifty cents apiece and feed to the animals. One day, a new llama joined Charlotte and Ronald at the fair. \\"Hello! My name is Matilda,\\" said the newcomer. She held out a hoof in greeting. Charlotte frowned. The county fair was her and Ronald's turf. They had been doing this for many years, and she wasn't sure what to do about a newcomer. Besides, she didn't want to share the children's affection or their offerings of treats. \\"My name is Ronald, and this is Charlotte!\\" Ronald replied. He nudged Charlotte. \\"Come on, say hello, Charlotte! It's good to make new friends. Besides, with three of us here, even more children will want to visit!\\" Charlotte begrudgingly shook hooves with Matilda. Ronald was usually right, and what harm had being friendly ever done? As it turns out, Matilda was full of energy and ideas. She entertained the children with dances and even taught Ronald and Charlotte some tricks. Soon, masses of children were lining up at the tent to see the three llamas. \\"I'm so glad you joined us, Matilda! I have to admit, I've never had so much corn in my life!\\" said Charlotte one afternoon, as little hands eagerly held out treats, trying to get her attention. \\"I was wrong to think that having three llamas was a bad idea.\\" At the end of the summer, Charlotte and Ronald bid their goodbyes to Matilda, happy to have made a new friend and looking forward to summers to come."},{"question":"I'm trying to find a thoughtful and practical birthday gift for my sister.

He also leads Florida in average time on ice on the penalty kill (3:11) and is third in plus-minus rating (plus-9), behind Carter Verhaeghe (plus-11) and Tkachuk (plus-10).\\"Well, he plays on our No. 1 pair, and everybody in that role has the exact same job: play against the single best players in the world every single night, and it's every game, right?\\" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Tuesday. \\"He's come into this group like a lot of other players … that needed their opportunity to come, and then value that opportunity.

Although the Florida Panthers are led by some high-profile players such as Sergei Bobrovsky, a Vezina Trophy winner, Sam Bennett, Sam Reinhart and Matthew Tkachuk, Forsling's impact has been felt by teammates and opponents alike. The Panthers took Frosling off waivers two and a half years ago and never looked back. Paired with Aaron Ekblad, Forsling is averaging second in ice time on the team with 26:44 per game. He is first on the team in time on the ice during a penalty kill, averaging a massive 3:11 per game. Quietly, Forsling has established himself as one of the key pieces in the Florida Panther's defensive rotation during the regular season and playoffs. His plus-9 rating, which speaks for itself, is good for third on the team. When asked, head coach Paul Maurice said that he needed an opportunity and he has made the most of it with Florida. Gustav seems to have the good stuff for the Florida Panthers. This is Rebecca Black from ABL News, signing off.

Name the main character Hank.","answer":"“Sometimes the hardest part is letting go.”Hank heard what Larry said, but he didn't respond. He'd owned this 1985 Ford truck since his father handed it down to him in high school. At that time, the truck was seemingly on its last leg. Hank’s father thought it would be good for Hank to start with a clunker—that way, Hank would have to make repairs and become familiar with regular maintenance. His father had hoped that owning this beat-up truck would make Hank a humbled and grateful owner of whichever vehicle he purchased next, likely a newer model. However, that was over thirty years ago, and Hank had yet to purchase a replacement vehicle.Hank would take what he learned from working on the old truck and start his own mechanic shop in town. His clientele was a fairly general audience to begin with, but over time, he would come to niche down to servicing classic vehicles and helping passionate owners restore old cars and trucks. Hank was never interested in a new paint job or sourcing the cosmetic parts of his own truck that had broken off over the years; all Hank needed was to know the truck was mechanically sound, nipping every problem in the bud as soon as it arose.Standing in front of his truck that day with Larry still trying to console him, however, Hank knew he would never drive the truck again. Hank was at a loss for words as, to him, this truck was a family member. For a while, he did not know what to do. Then, an idea hit him. Now, if you drive past Hank’s mechanic shop, out front you will see that old truck from his high school days parked right out front wearing his shop’s name as a badge of honor for making a good thing last as long as it could."},{"question":"How often do you check blood sugar levels when on an insulin pump?","answer":"Your health care provider may recommend blood sugar testing 4 to 10 times a day if you have Type 1 diabetes.

Keep it under 250 words.","answer":"The Jews of the Silk Road– Bukhara, Uzbekistan’s Jewish LegacySituated far beyond the reaches of Judea, one would never expect a small Uzbek city to be the place thousands of Jews call home. However, Bukhara has been a hub of Jewish life for well over a millennium. They’ve inhabited the city for so long that their origins are the subject of legend. However, historians believe that they’ve traced their arrival to 586 BCE. The first groups came seeking refuge in the wake of the Babylonians exiling them from Israel.Over the centuries, various upheavals and conquests in the region shook the community. They were the subject of discrimination under some rulers, but some, such as the Russian Tsar, looked upon them favorably. Many have left the region since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s due to economic instability and opportunities in faraway places like Israel and the United States. However, it’s estimated that roughly 50,000 Jews lived in Bukhara at the peak of their population. Despite the economic exodus, a group of 100-200 Bukharan Jews remains, keeping local traditions alive. A walk around Bukhara’s historic center will no doubt bring you to the Jewish district where you can find their old synagogue. Those who remained still hold traditional Jewish weddings and funerals for community members, too."},{"question":"I know, that's why I asked for a relaxing multiplyer game. Wiso: Oh, yes, yes.

She took his hand and gazed out at the castle ahead.The sun shone brightly down on them as the day wound down towards evening, with rays still beaming down in a mix of gold and orange. The rows of intricate stained glass windows reflected the sunlight, making the castle a veritable beacon. Tall arches and turrets rose toward the sky, seemingly touching the clouds, and a clock tower loomed overhead, watching over all with its ominous, dark face.

Also, please forgive any spelling and grammar mistakes. I am a food inspector in a large country. I was trying to take a selfie near a dam when I accidentally dropped my phone in the water.

Finally, after years of toiling away in an office with no windows, he was able to find a weekend away on the lake all by himself and with no one to answer to. No bosses were breathing down his neck and nobody was blowing up his phone. This weekend it was just about a man and his boat.Exiting his lakeside cottage with a piece of toast in his mouth, a vintage tin lunch pail, and a thermos in his hand, he made his way down to the dock at the end of his property. It was a short walk but each step he took seemed to have a little bit of extra bounce to it. There, at the dock, he found his little red canoe. Careful to maintain his balance he stepped into the boat, untied it from the mooring, and pushed off into the foggy morning glow.It was nearly dead silent in the hours before dawn. The lake rippled with each paddle but nary a bird bothered him. Fred paddled around in a circuitous route staying close to the shore before venturing a bit farther out. The sun was starting to rise and he aimed his boat directly for it almost as if trying to catch Apollo's chariot before it breached the horizon.Of course, that wasn't a race Fred could win and he soon found himself a quarter mile from land and the sun shining its new rays on his face. He stopped paddling and just coasted for a few moments breathing in the air and feeling the warmth whisk away the last bit of fog clinging to the lake's surface. Closing his eyes, he retracted his paddle from the water and placed it beside him in the boat.Leaning back slightly he felt all the tension in his body releasing in one big wave. And at the end, an abrupt sound which ended up being his stomach rumbling. It wakened him from his reverie but not in a disruptive sort of way.  No, it was like a comforting old friend giving you a pat on the back.And so Fred opened up his lunch pail and pulled out a breakfast sandwich. He poured himself a cup of piping hot joe from his thermos. And then he ate. All alone, and with a very big smile on his face."},{"question":"What are some clutter-free items for Easter baskets?

I am in desperate need of a Swedish Death Cleanse. What is Swedish Death Cleaning, you ask? Swedish Death Cleaning is also known as döstädning in Swedish. The basic premise involves decluttering your home and getting rid of possessions that you no longer need to make things easier for your loved ones when you pass away. I know it seems like the idea of death cleaning might be morbid or depressing, but I see it as a helpful and even cathartic exercise. I also look at Death Cleaning as a guide to living a great life in the present - not in the past - with purpose and not letting \\"stuff\\" drag you down. As you can imagine, Swedish Death Cleaning can be a daunting task, but it also can be an incredibly liberating experience. Focus on what serves you in the here and now and keep just those special pieces that matter to you.  Create a more peaceful living space by limiting possessions to only things that bring you joy and peace. It can also be helpful to think about the legacy that you want to leave behind, and how you want to be remembered. By getting rid of things that you no longer need, you can make things easier for your loved ones after you're gone and yourself as you live for today.If you're feeling overwhelmed by clutter in your home and constantly struggling to find space for new things like me, then you are in dire need of Swedish Death Cleaning.

Nothing turns a good sandwich bad faster than a bread type that doesn’t match what you’re trying to create. As a general rule of thumb, think of soft breads for soft spreads. The sturdier your sandwich filling, the firmer your bread can be. 2. Don’t limit yourself to one sauce. Mayo and mustard are great together. Mayo and anything, really. But consider dressing each side of the sandwich with different sauces. It changes the balance of the sandwich in a great way.3. Consider the pickle. Sandwiches often have fatty, savory elements. A good pickle adds crunch and a bit to cut through all that fat. Pickles don’t have to be cucumbers, too. Think about pickled onions, peppers, or even giardiniera.4. Let it rest. A good sandwich is like a complex chord. You want to give it a second to let those notes blend together. Your patience will be rewarded!Let’s dig deeper into the classic Italian grinder. This sandwich is best with a crusty seeded roll. Balance out the savory meats with a sharp cheese like cheddar or provolone, and don’t forget some pickled peppers.

Wearing and caring for contact lenses properly is critical to keeping the eyes healthy and preventing eye infections; however, the majority of contact lens wearers 1 do not practice proper contact lens hygiene. Since 2006, in the US there have been three outbreaks of Acanthamoeba keratitis 2,3 and Fusarium keratitis 4—both of which are very serious and sometimes blinding types of eye infections. These outbreaks have brought attention to contact lens wearer hygiene and the need for consistent information about how to wear and care for contact lenses to help prevent such infections.CDC—with feedback from experts in optometry, ophthalmology, opticianry, and infectious diseases—encourages contact lens wearers to follow these recommendations, which are based on data from a number of studies.

You can use lowercase words.How they prepareGrant writers usually have a range of skills, a college degree, and other training or experience.Skills. Research and writing skills are essential for grant writers. Research helps writers find grant opportunities. Good writing expresses ideas clearly and succinctly, with creativity and persuasiveness helping a proposal stand out.Interpersonal skills are important, too, because grant writers interact with clients, colleagues, and donors to gather and relay information.Grant writers also need to be detail oriented and have multitasking and organizational skills. These skills allow them to juggle multiple grant applications and adhere to each grant’s guidelines and deadlines.Education and training. Grant writers, like other types of writers and authors, typically need a bachelor’s degree to qualify for entry-level jobs. Often, the field of study doesn’t matter, but helpful courses include marketing and English.Some colleges and universities offer programs specifically in grant writing. Classes and workshops are also available through community colleges and professional associations.But many grant writers learn from online resources, books, and on-the-job training. And years of practice help them develop the skills for writing successful grant proposals. “You learn by doing,” says Shelia. “And the more you do it, the better you’ll get. You also learn from your rejections.”Experience and more. Experience in a related occupation is generally not required for entry-level grant writing jobs, but it can be helpful to have. For example, many grant writers start out in another role in an organization before transitioning to grant writing. A background in communications, fundraising, or budgeting is valuable.Gaining experience isn’t limited to employment, however. Networking with other grant writers and doing some unpaid work may help you learn more about the occupation. “Talk to folks involved in the funding and application process,” says Shelia. “And volunteer with small organizations to learn how grant writing is done.”Experienced grant writers also might opt to earn certification, which demonstrates a level of proficiency and could improve their employment options.And, although success is not guaranteed, grant writers have a better chance of writing a good proposal if they’re passionate about the causes for which they seek funds. “If you feel it, then you can write it for others to feel as well,” Shelia says. “If you aren’t motivated for the cause, you can’t motivate anyone else.”","answer":"bachelor's degree, online resources, books, other work experience, on-the-job training, unpaid work, classes and workshops, certifications"},{"question":"Can you please write me the outline for an article about Alex Pietrangelo?

You would do that by writing:# As floatradius_input = float(input(\\"What is the radius? \\"))# As integerradius_input = int(input(\\"What is the radius? \\"))2. Check for syntax mistakes in the mathematical operations or the print statements that might cause SyntaxError. Be sure you are using parentheses \`()\` and curly braces \`{}\` properly, especially if you are printing with an f-string or using \`pow()\` to square the radius.3. Make sure all the variable names are written as they were originally defined. A mismatch between a defined variable and a variable used later in the code could produce a NameError. For example, if you use \`radius_input\` in the input statement but you try to square \`r_input\`, you would get a NameError.If none of these suggestions help, I may be able to provide more help if you show me the script you are having trouble with."},{"question":"Write a poem about a dog and Covid-19.","answer":"My human is wearing a mask,Not sure why, I should ask,\\"Bark, bark\\" with no reply,I hope my human doesn't cry,He's in the house more and more,Watching TV is a bore,He usually takes me out for a walk soon,I want to show him the beauty of the moon,Nature is still here, pandemic or not,He could at least take me to the parking lot!"},{"question":"Help me create a restaurant review for a fictional, magical dining establishment, describing the enchanting atmosphere, otherworldly dishes, and unforgettable experience.","answer":"I visited the Vanara restaurant with my family for an afternoon lunch recently, and all I can say is wow.

If you trace the outline of the city you can see the shape it produces: it is that of the bottle. The bottle was a revolutionary tool for storing water and other beverages. With its strong construction, the bottle could house high-pressure liquids and keep them fresh for an indeterminant time if they remain in proper storage. Likewise, people with this map sign are likely to need time to adapt to new environments. They can open up quickly, but getting to know them takes more time. Personalities associated with the bottle of Orcasur are likely to be energetic, loud, and expressive, but they also may need the approval of others and external victories to validate their internal sense of self. They may pair best with map signs from Fuencarral-El Pardo since their resourcefulness can help Orcasur signs open up. That's because Fuencarral-El Pardo resembles the mighty bottle-opener.

It spread to Persia and, after the Islamic conquests of the 7th century, throughout the Muslim world. The game was introduced to Western Europe and Russia in the 9th century. Over the centuries, the rules evolved to their current form in the late 15th century. Below is a list of a few of the game's milestones.In 1495, the first chess book was printed.The earliest surviving printed chess book dates to 1497.The first professional playwrights appeared in 1600.The first master games that were recorded live were in the 1780s.The first chess magazine was published in 1836.First US chess competition, 1849.The first chess competition was held internationally in 1851.The first game time by a clock was in 1866.The first tournament to use chess clocks that were specifically made was in 1883.The first official world championship match took place in 1886.

The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on May 28 without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups.[44] Following the conquest of the Low Countries, Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on April 9, 1940. Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish ore to the Nazi war machine. Norway held on for a few crucial weeks, but Denmark surrendered after only four days.[45][46] Sweden was the only Scandinavian country to successfully maintain its neutrality throughout the war, with occasional breaches of neutrality in favor of both Germany and the Western Allies.[47]","answer":"9, 10, 28, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 88, 600, 1939, 1940"},{"question":"Write me a paragraph explaining why Dodo birds went extinct.","answer":"The Dodo went extinct due to hunting, invasive species threat, and deforestation. Dodo birds were flightless, fearless birds native to Mauritius, an island off the coast of Madagascar that was largely uninhabited from the human population until the 1500s. This made them an easy target for humans to hunt due to their inability to fly and because of their fearlessness to humans. Not only did humans hunt them, but the animals they brought with them did as well. Dogs, pigs, cats, and rats ate their eggs and destroyed their nests. Because the Dodos had no known natural predators, they did not fear these animals, had no way to defend themselves, and had no means of escape. The presence of these animals created more competition for food and resources and the Dodo birds were simply outnumbered. At the same time, humans were destroying their natural habitats. Explorers cut down trees to make way for paths across the island, pushing the dodo birds into a smaller area. This created an even greater lack of food and ultimately, extinction.

On their 10th album, Heritage, they aren't. For longtime fans, the shift from progressive death metal to full-on progressive rock won't be a surprise: 2003's Damnation gave a good idea of what Åkerfeldt sounded like doing clean vocals sans death growls, and since 1995's debut, Orchid, he's never been afraid to stretch the templates of all the genres they incorporate. (Åkerfeldt's used his airier croon for ages-- here, more confident in that angle, he removed the heavier stuff and expanded upon the airier bridges.) What might surprise you, though, is the intense completeness of the transition: Heritage's 1970s-inspired prog feels more like the follow-up to fellow countrymen Dungen's 2004 opus Ta Det Lugnt than Opeth's own Watershed.The 10-song collection is another collaboration with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson, who mixed the record with Åkerfeldt-- it has a warm, analog feel, something that lives up to the colors of the cover painting. The brief opening title track is a plaintive, scene-setting piano piece Åkerfeldt says was inspired by Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and the folk music of his country. Elsewhere, guest spots from Swedish flautist Björn J:son Lindh and Weather Report percussionist Alex Acuña (both on eight-minute loud-quiet-loud standout \\"Famine\\"), give Heritage a mystical, pastoral feel. If you've heard only the King Crimson-nodding lead track, \\"The Devil's Orchard\\", you have a good idea what to expect: an exuberant, forward rushing blend of bell-bottomed jazziness and Deep Purple, Camel, and Jethro Tull love made more complex with quick tempo shifts, stop-on-a-dime implosions, and breezy, racing, drifting, and other sorts of atmospheric, psychedelic flourishes.Another track, the muscular \\"Slither\\", is appropriately dedicated to Ronnie James Dio. The 37-year-old Åkerfeldt, who says Heritage is an album he's been \\"building up to write for and participate on\\" since he was 19, has also mentioned listening to Alice Cooper frequently over the past year. You won't necessarily detect the latter in any obvious way, but you'll feel it in the album's appropriation of the texture and atmosphere of an era. Åkerfeldt and co. do offer a convincing take-- it's a pretty, well-thought out collection-- but for all the ideas and layers, Heritage feels somewhat empty. It's the group's most genre-melding, but it's also the most obvious, largely because much of it sounds like things we've heard before. The lifelessness may also be the result of the singularity of the vision: Heritage lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant. When it comes down to it, Åkerfeldt's death growl is more memorable than his rock singing (and both work best when you get them together). There are dynamics here, but not the kind that create unexpected chills.The story behind Travis Smith's colorful cover painting is instructive. We're told Åkerfeldt gave the artist a number of references including Pieter Bruegel's \\"The Triumph of Death\\", Hieronymus Bosch (in general), and the Beatles' Yellow Submarine. The final picture depicts a tree sprouting the heads of each Opeth member with the noggin of ex-keyboardist and backing vocalist Per Wiberg, who left the band after recording his parts for the new record, toppling into \\"a pile of ex-members' skulls.\\" Beneath those skulls? The roots of the tree that point to the band's devilish roots in death metal. We're also told the nine stars in the sky represent Opeth's nine past albums, the sun representing Heritage. Then comes the line of people \\"want[ing] a piece\\" of the band, etc. It's fine to get conceptual, of course, but the forced, overripe symbolism of this image and its fussiness point to a problem with the record: Åkerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe. He refers to Opeth records as \\"observations\\" and, ultimately, for all its considerable beauty, Heritage too often feels like a passive, backward glance.","answer":"The review you've shared would indicate the album is poor in comparison to other offerings from Opeth. Although the review contains both positive and negative language usage throughout, the closing paragraphs offer a clearer classification of the album, with sentences such as: \\"Heritage lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant.\\" And, \\"Åkerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe. He refers to Opeth records as \\"observations\\" and, ultimately, for all its considerable beauty, Heritage too often feels like a passive, backward glance.\\" both being indicative of a negative view of the album when compared to the band's overall catalogue."},{"question":"Why are plants green? Give me a simple answer most elementary school children would be able to comprehend.  Incorporate a cooking analogy for photosynthesis.","answer":"Most plants are green because they make their own food.  When we make food we call it cooking or baking, but when plants make food it's called photosynthesis.  They keep an important ingredient they need for photosynthesis inside them.  This ingredient is called chlorophyll.  Chlorophyll mixes with sunlight to make food for the plant. Sunlight looks white to us, but has all the colors of the rainbow in it.  Plants don't use the color green from sunlight when they make food.  Since the color green doesn't mix with the chlorophyll during photosynthesis, green is the color we can see.

Make it less than 300 words.","answer":"\\"What a beautiful day to go fishing,\\" Tom thought as he clambered onto a fishing boat that morning. Tom had never been fishing but always loved the idea of it. By night, Tom was a bull rider and a really good one at that. Tom had won all the major competitions several times. Today, Tom decided that he was going to go fishing for the first time. As a bull rider, Tom lived fast and free, oftentimes doing extreme things like bull riding. Tom started the boat and got going. He stopped once he could no longer see the shore and threw out his line. Almost immediately, Tom got a bite on his line! It was a great white shark! Tom fought the mammoth shark for hours. The shark pulled his boat for miles and miles until finally, his line snapped. Tom, who had fallen over in the boat, stood up and looked around to see if he could see anyone or anything. He couldn't. Tom was lost at sea! Tom tried to look at the GPS, but it was broken. Tom flashed the boat lights and yelled as loud as he could to no avail. Tom panicked for a moment and lay down in the boat. \\"What to do?\\" Tom thought. He turned the boat on and began driving, hoping that he would run into shore before dark. Tom traveled for 10 hours through the night until finally making his way back to shore. Tom parked, hopped off the boat, and kissed the ground. He was so happy to be alive and on land!

Mention how summer school can be helpful.","answer":"Students have many reasons why they might want or need to graduate from high school early. Often life takes us down roads we haven't figured out just yet, and we find things are not unfolding just the way we had imagined. This is all a part of life. Sometimes it pays to be flexible. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to graduate early, then there are several ways to accomplish this. Remember that your high school diploma is more than just a piece of paper: it’s the key to a better future.There are numerous methods of graduating early and only you can determine which is best for your situation. Be sure and speak with parents, teachers, or guidance counselors in order to get some helpful advice on what to do. All of us need help from time to time to make the best decision, and this is true whether you are 16 or 60.The first thing to determine is whether or not your high school will allow you to graduate early. Each school district has its own policies and they differ from state to state. The second thing you should check on is how many credits you will need to graduate. Though you may not have enough to skip an entire grade in high school, you may have enough to skip one semester. Also be sure to find out which credits you need: whether that's math, PE, English, science, etc. If possible, you may be able to attend summer school to get these credits. You can find out at your school’s administrative office or on their website, exactly what classes are available for summer school attendees."},{"question":"Turn this into a 12 stanza poemHe continued through the level forest for several miles. Then hewent down a bank to the frozen path of a small stream. This was Henderson Creek and he knew he was ten miles from where the streamdivided. He looked at his watch. It was ten o’clock. He was travelingat the rate of four miles an hour. Thus, he figured that he would arrivewhere the stream divided at half-past twelve. He decided he would eathis lunch when he arrived there.The dog followed again at his heels, with its tail hanging low, asthe man started to walk along the frozen stream. The old sled trail couldbe seen, but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last sleds.In a month no man had traveled up or down that silent creek. The manwent steadily ahead. He was not much of a thinker. At that moment hehad nothing to think about except that he would eat lunch at thestream’s divide and that at six o’clock he would be in camp with theboys. There was nobody to talk to; and, had there been, speech wouldnot have been possible because of the ice around his mouth.Once in a while the thought repeated itself that it was very coldand that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along herubbed his face and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He didthis without thinking, frequently changing hands. But, with all hisrubbing, the instant he stopped, his face and nose became numb. Hisface would surely be frozen. He knew that and he was sorry that he hadnot worn the sort of nose guard Bud wore when it was cold. Such aguard passed across the nose and covered the entire face. But it did notmatter much, he decided. What was a little frost? A bit painful, thatwas all. It was never serious.Empty as the man’s mind was of thoughts, he was most observant.He noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and the bends. Andalways he noted where he placed his feet. Once, coming around abend, he moved suddenly to the side, like a frightened horse. He curvedaway from the place where he had been walking and retraced his stepsseveral feet along the trail. He knew the creek was frozen to the bottom. No creek could contain water in that winter. But he knew alsothat there were streams of water that came out from the hillsides andran along under the snow and on top of the ice of the creek. He knewthat even in the coldest weather these streams were never frozen, andhe also knew their danger. They hid pools of water under the snowthat might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a skin of icehalf an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow.Sometimes there was both water and thin ice, and when a man brokethrough he could get very wet.That was why he had jumped away so suddenly. He had felt theice move under his feet. He had also heard the noise of the snow-covered ice skin breaking. And to get his feet wet in such a temperaturemeant trouble and danger. At the very least it meant delay, because hewould be forced to stop and build a fire. Only under its protectioncould he bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins.He stood and studied the creek bottom and its banks. He decidedthat the flowing stream of water came from the right side. He thoughta while, rubbing his nose and face. Then he walked to the left. Hestepped carefully and tested the ice at each step. Once away from thedanger, he continued at his four-mile pace.","answer":"Through the forest, he trekked a while,Down a bank, on a frozen stream, with a smile.Henderson Creek, ten miles he knew,His watch read ten, his pace steady and true.Four miles an hour, his travel speed,At half-past twelve, the divide he'd heed.Lunch awaited at the stream's embrace,No thoughts to ponder, a peaceful space.The dog trailed behind, tail hanging low,Along the frozen stream, they continued to go.Sled tracks concealed beneath snow's deep cover,No man had passed, no sound did hover.He pressed onward, not much of a thinker,With lunch and camp as his mind's only blinker.Silence surrounded, no words to be spoken,Frozen ice prevented his voice from being awoken.The cold persisted, a thought would arise,Unfamiliar chills, an icy surprise.His mittened hand against his face he pressed,Yet, numbness followed, freezing each crest.His face would freeze, he was well aware,Regretting the nose guard he didn't wear.But it mattered little, frost was a mere pain,Not a grave concern, just a temporary strain.Thoughts absent, observant he remained,Noting creek changes, each curve, each bend.Mindful of his steps, where his feet would tread,A sudden shift, avoiding a hidden thread.He veered away from the treacherous sight,Retraced his path, cautious and contrite.Frozen was the creek, down to its core,But hidden streams lurked, water's silent roar.Underneath snow and ice, they slyly flowed,Pools concealed, a danger unbeknownst.Thin layers of ice sometimes deceived,A man's misstep, a chance to be relieved.That's why he leapt, avoiding the break,Ice shifting beneath, the noise awake.For wet feet in such cold spelled trouble and woe,Delay or danger, he didn't wish to bestow.He gazed at the creek, studied its terrain,Water flowed from the right, he could ascertain.After thought and reflection, he made his choice,To the left he ventured, heeding ice's voice.Careful steps, testing the frozen ground,Away from peril, onward he bound.At his steady pace, four miles he'd stride,A lone traveler, in nature's embrace, he'd abide."},{"question":"Write me a short story about two boys who get thirsty while swimming, but don't use the letter \\"e.\\"","answer":"Two boys swim in a pond.

They’ve given us some of the most heartfelt and iconic stories of all time, and Toy Story and Finding Nemo are not to be excluded. Both movies are certainly beloved by fans, but at the end of the day, there isn’t an argument as to which film is better: Toy Story. This analysis will focus on everything from plot, characters, and even cinematography––everything that makes Toy Story really stand out. After all, it stood out in the animation industry for a good reason, so let’s dive in (no, not into the sea).Toy Story captures Andy’s toys coming to life while he’s away. Woody, the protagonist, faces fierce competition when there’s a new toy in town: Buzz Lightyear. While there is some bitter rivalry at first, eventually, the two become friends. It teaches us how to adapt and unite as a community while capturing our attention with suspenseful escapes (Sid’s house, anyone?) and exciting action!Basically, Finding Nemo is by no means bad, but it just feels weak when compared to such a masterpiece.

Binoculars - Hold two tubes parallel and tape them together. You can use decorative duct tape with designs like camo, ducks, or mustaches.2. Didgeridoo - Tape two or more tubes together into one long tube and blow into one end to make sounds. You can watch videos of people playing Didgeridoos in Australia.3. Animals - Get four plastic forks and cut them in half. Glue the two halves back together at a 90-degree angle so they look like animal legs with the tines of the fork as claws. Then, glue the forks to the tubes like four limbs. Cut shapes out of paper to make animal faces and tape them to one end of the tube. Do the same with tails and put them on the other end.4. Ring garlands - Cut the tube into rings with a pair of scissors. Put a cut in one ring so you can put it through another ring like links in a chain. Tape or glue the ring shut and continue until you've used all the rings. Cover it with tissue paper or glitter to give it some color.5. Vases - Cut a circle out of cardboard and tape it so one end of the tube is covered. Then, cover the tube with clippings from magazines or construction paper. Now you can put paper flowers inside (Note that this vase will not hold water)."},{"question":"Based on the text below, answer the following questions.1) What does Gigantopithecus mean?2) What is the current population of Gigantopithecus?3) Why are Gigantopithecus remains hard to find?4) In which countries have remains of Gigantopithecus been identified?Gigantopithecus (/dʒaɪˌɡæntoʊpɪˈθikəs, ˈpɪθɪkəs, dʒɪ-/ jahy-gan-toh-pi-thee-kuhs, pith-i-kuhs, ji-;[2] lit. 'giant ape') is an extinct genus of ape from roughly 2 million to 350,000 years ago during the Early to Middle Pleistocene of southern China, represented by one species, Gigantopithecus blacki. Potential identifications have also been made in Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The first remains of Gigantopithecus, two third molar teeth, were identified in a drugstore by anthropologist Ralph von Koenigswald in 1935, who subsequently described the ape. In 1956, the first mandible and more than 1,000 teeth were found in Liucheng, and numerous more remains have since been found in at least 16 sites. Only teeth and four mandibles are known currently, and other skeletal elements were likely consumed by porcupines before they could fossilise.[3] Gigantopithecus was once argued to be a hominin, a member of the human line, but it is now thought to be closely allied with orangutans, classified in the subfamily Ponginae.Gigantopithecus has traditionally been restored as a massive, gorilla-like ape, potentially 200–300 kg (440–660 lb) when alive, but the paucity of remains make total size estimates highly speculative. The species may have been sexually dimorphic, with males much bigger than females. The incisors are reduced and the canines appear to have functioned like cheek teeth (premolars and molars). The premolars are high-crowned, and the fourth premolar is very molar-like. The molars are the largest of any known ape, and have a relatively flat surface. Gigantopithecus had the thickest enamel by absolute measure of any ape, up to 6 mm (a quarter of an inch) in some areas, though this is only fairly thick when tooth size is taken into account.Gigantopithecus appears to have been a generalist herbivore of C3 forest plants, with the jaw adapted to grinding, crushing, and cutting through tough, fibrous plants, and the thick enamel functioning to resist foods with abrasive particles such as stems, roots, and tubers with dirt. Some teeth bear traces of fig family fruits, which may have been important dietary components. It primarily lived in subtropical to tropical forest, and went extinct about 300,000 years ago likely because of the retreat of preferred habitat due to climate change, and potentially archaic human activity. Gigantopithecus has become popular in cryptozoology circles as the identity of the Tibetan yeti or the American bigfoot, humanlike creatures in local folklore.","answer":"1) The word Gigantopithecus mean means giant ape.2) There is no current population of Gigantopithecus because the species went extinct about 300,000 years ago.3) Gigantopithecus remains are hard to find because, presumably, porcupines consumed them before they could be fossilized.4) Remains of Gigantopithecus have been identified in China, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia."},{"question":"Who is Joe Hisaishi?

If you are new to freelancing, it's great to incorporate these tips and practices sooner rather than later. While it’s true you must stick up for yourself in any workplace, it can be especially true for freelancers. You are your own business, boss, and employee. If you feel that you could use some tactics to come across as more confident and assertive while remaining professional, keep reading. It's best to avoid noncommittal words and phrases like “maybe, sometimes, in my opinion, and sorry.” While this may be your way of speaking to sound polite, it can come across as “wishy-washy” to a client. Replace them with words like “yes, no, always, and exactly.”Research the client beforehand. If you are taking on a new client, be sure and research them or their company before starting the work or before your initial meeting. This may seem more obvious to some than others. This is part of a client-centered approach and ensures you are prepared to tailor your work to their needs. Make a checklist of questions. Whenever a question occurs to you, it’s important to jot it down and ask at your next interaction. This tells a client that you are paying attention, prepared, and respectful of their time. Have prepared responses. There are certain things that, as a freelancer, you should have a straightforward answer to. These things include your rate, experience, and how long it takes you to complete a project.  Don’t be guilted into anything. It can be tempting to overcommit at times, especially when it is for a client that is very valuable to you. However, committing to work that is beyond your bandwidth or skillset can negatively impact both you and the client. It’s better to be honest and reliable rather than to underdeliver. Much of speaking to clients with confidence is the work that goes on behind the scenes. It’s about being prepared so that each time you speak or interact, you will feel and come across as more confident during each interaction."},{"question":"Write a love poem addressed to Nami from One Piece.

Today, Disney and its army of lawyers filed a lawsuit against DeSantis and others over what it calls a “targeted campaign of government retaliation.” It’s the latest chapter in an ongoing war between the two.On April 26, Disney filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is directly named in the lawsuit as well as Meredith Ivey, the Acting Secretary of Florida’s Department of Economic Opportunity, and the DeSantis-appointed members of the Walt Disney World special district oversight board. This was the same board that discovered last month that Disney and its lawyers had legally stripped the committee of most of its power before its first meeting via a development agreement, angering DeSantis and his cronies.Why Disney is suing Ron DeSantis and FloridaThe new lawsuit comes just after the Florida governor’s appointed board—which are intended to oversee the previously named Reedy Creek Special District—had voted unanimously in a public meeting earlier Wednesday to declare the Disney-approved agreement “void and unenforceable.” This appears to have been the last straw for Disney and its legal team.“Today’s action is the latest strike: At the Governor’s bidding, the State’s oversight board has purported to ‘void’ publicly noticed and duly agreed development contracts, which had laid the foundation for billions of Disney’s investment dollars and thousands of jobs,” Disney wrote in its lawsuit against DeSantis and his board.Disney called the move “patently retaliatory, patently anti-business, and patently unconstitutional.” Mickey Mouse’s parents and their legal team also directly referenced the governor’s own words earlier this month, when he threatened that he might look at adding more taxes on hotels or toll roads into the park. He even suggested putting a state prison next to the park, according to Disney’s lawyers. The suggestion seemingly being that he and his allies “will not stop” going after the company and its large Florida theme park.","answer":"1. Disney is the plaintiff in the court case.2.

He had a pretty solid playing career, winning one World Series. As a manager, he won a World Series too, and has also racked up over 2,000 wins.Yet, I can’t shake the feeling that he gets too much credit. I bleed Cubby blue and I was never happier than when Dusty finally left the team. For me, those early 2000s years were the best years to be a Cubs fan and it was Dusty who ruined the era.The players we had were all quite good and there was a huge buzz going into each season. Names like Sammy Sosa, Kerry Wood, and Mark Prior spring to mind and defined the team back then. The first year Dusty did lead them to a winning record and the postseason but after 2003 it was all downhill.The team had the talent but they didn’t have the right manager. He misused the pitchers constantly and Mark Prior, one of the most promising pitching prospects in decades, had his career cut short due in large part to overwork. The same can be said of Kerry Wood who faced a similar fate. Baker became known for putting his pitchers under tremendous workloads and it just wore them down until they broke.The Cubs were set up for years if not a decade of success with some of the best arms in the game and he destroyed them. He was not even very good with managing relievers, always preferring to stick to the old-school approach of going with his gut.This is not the right approach for a manager. Even in the early 2000s, analytics were being used by teams to create a competitive advantage but Dusty refused. At one point he even made public comments that walking was bad because it clogged the bases. He just did not create an atmosphere conducive to success.In the end, he only lasted 4 years with the Cubs and I am very glad for that. He spoiled the team’s chances of post-season success and it took them a decade to recover. I won’t forget Dusty at all, but I also won’t give him credit when the negatives under his leadership far outweigh any of the positives."},{"question":"Gimi, how can I improve my cooking skills?","answer":"Excuse me what?

Inside its gnarled branches sat a mother cardinal on a nest of twigs covering two speckled little eggs. Danny watched from afar as she carefully tended to her clutch, keeping the eggs warm and safe. The days dragged on, and the brilliant red father cardinal continued to bring bugs and other little snacks to the mother so that she wouldn’t have to move from their blessed clutch. Their patience and dedication were rewarded when the eggs hatched into tiny, fluffy chicks. Springing into action, the mother cardinal struck out to find the insects and seeds her hungry brood needed to grow big. Then one day, Danny’s hungry cat Zoe escaped the house and started to prowl the backyard in search of a snack. The old cat’s sharp eyes soon found the cardinal's nest. The mother cardinal was no fool. She’d seen cats before and quickly changed her focus from finding food to defending her young from the nefarious predator.With the fierce determination of a mother, she swooped down darting towards the cat to ward it off. She fluttered her wings and chirped in the cat’s ear. Zoe was startled by the sudden attack, and backed away, feeling momentarily intimidated. The mother cardinal knew the cat’s resolve would soon return, so she continued to defend her nest, flying back and forth, trying to frighten the cat. She was determined not to let her chicks fall victim to Zoe’s insatiable hunger. Startled by the bird’s bravado, Zoe gave up and retreated, defeated by the mother cardinal's fierce determination. Seeing what had happened, Danny rushed out to retrieve his mischievous cat before it could do any real harm. Day after day, Danny watched the babies grow through his binoculars. Each morning, it seemed they were changing. Growing feathers, opening their eyes, and getting ready for flight. All the while, Danny kept cantankerous Zoe trapped in the house. By the ninth day, the chicks had grown into full-fledged cardinals, ready to take flight and begin their own lives.

Please reference the following information.The foil is a light thrusting weapon with a maximum weight of 500 grams. The foil targets the torso, but not the arms or legs. The foil has a small circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from direct stabs. As the hand is not a valid target in foil, this is primarily for safety. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). Touches that land outside the target area (called an off-target touch and signaled by a distinct color on the scoring apparatus) stop the action, but are not scored. Only a single touch can be awarded to either fencer at the end of a phrase. If both fencers land touches within a close enough interval of milliseconds to register two lights on the machine, the referee uses the rules of \\"right of way\\" to determine which fencer is awarded the touch, or if an off-target hit has priority over a valid hit, in which case no touch is awarded. If the referee is unable to determine which fencer has right of way, no touch is awarded.

Franklin used London as a base to travel. In 1771, he made short journeys through different parts of England, staying with Joseph Priestley at Leeds, Thomas Percival at Manchester, and Erasmus Darwin at Lichfield.[96] In Scotland, he spent five days with Lord Kames near Stirling and stayed for three weeks with David Hume in Edinburgh. In 1759, he visited Edinburgh with his son and later reported that he considered his six weeks in Scotland \\"six weeks of the densest happiness I have met with in any part of my life\\".[97]In Ireland, he stayed with Lord Hillsborough. Franklin noted of him that \\"all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides.\\"[98] In Dublin, Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the Irish Parliament rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor.[96] While touring Ireland, he was deeply moved by the level of poverty he witnessed. The economy of the Kingdom of Ireland was affected by the same trade regulations and laws that governed the Thirteen Colonies. He feared that the American colonies could eventually come to the same level of poverty if the regulations and laws continued to apply to them.[99]Franklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist Otto von Guericke for his early studies of electricity.

EmphasisCreate emphasis in your Excel dashboard to ensure it stands out. You can do this using contrasting colors and different text, such as varying sizes and bold text. Emphasis will help your dashboard be easier to use and navigate. Avoid using bright colors; instead, opt for subtle shades, etc. To separate rows, you can use subtle color contrast to make the dashboard easier to read. 2. Connect different elements. You can visually show different elements on your dashboard and connect them with your alignment. Visualizing data is easier for us when it is formatted properly. Ensure your data is displayed in a way that is easy to read and understand. The use of shapes and charts can be beneficial here. 3. Draw parallels and create associations. Your dashboard should be completely consistent concerning abbreviations and color usage. Standard abbreviations or shorthand, such as arrows and math functions, can make your dashboard easier to read and understand.4. Organise and create focal points. Ensure your dashboard is as helpful as possible by grouping content relevant to each other and creating focal points that catch the reader's eye and attention. An example of this is grouping Committed, receipted, and outstanding spend for a budget close to each other to ensure the reader knows that these metrics are dependent on each other and related to each other. 5. Balance big and small elements.If you have larger and smaller charts, then utilize them both. However, be sure to position them in a place that makes sense and align them so things look tidy. A large chart followed by a small chart followed by a medium chart looks tacky to try to align all 3 in one area."},{"question":"What were some notable temples to the goddess Artemis?","answer":"The most notable temple to Artemis was located in Ephesus, a grandiose building twice the size of the Parthenon.

Her mind was dangerously quiet. She set the glass jar carefully on the counter and turned. The four-year-old sat at the kitchen table. Clutched in her fist was the last half of her peanut butter and jelly sandwich. A glob of sticky red jam had escaped her sandwich. She was pushing it across the table with one small index finger. Her finger stilled, and she looked up and grinned.That youthful, feral smile dispelled the numbness that was spreading through her chest and filled her with warmth. There was no room for regret to take root. She didn’t think of the man who’d come and gone. The imagined fancy birthday disappeared as she watched her daughter's eyes sparkle. The money was gone. She could replace it. Now is what was important. Today. She pulled a chair and sat next to her grinning girl. Her daughter licked the strawberry jam from her finger and laughed. She laughed too."},{"question":"Can you give me some good journaling ideas?","answer":"1. Write down your daily goals - make this a part of your everyday routine.

Many of you who had come into contact with Craig will undoubtedly have fond memories and funny stories about him, as do I, which I'm sure we'll get a chance to share at the wake later tonight.One thing that I will say about Craig is, despite the untimely accident, he was very fond of dressing up his pet monkey, \\"Peaches\\", in a variety of clothing from the 1980s. He loved playing dress-up with Peaches and serving her tea and biscuits at noon; he loved that monkey like a daughter.It's unfortunate what happened that fateful day a month ago. Craig would never have put that pink tutu on Peaches if he knew Peaches would reject it so violently. I think even if Craig did know how Peaches would respond, he wouldn't take it personally, for he loved that simian so much.But that's all in the past now. I like to think that Craig is in a better place, one where he can have a sip of his margarita and sit on the heavenly beaches. I think Craig would probably be saving a space for the rest of us until we join him, and even a seat on his beach blanket for Peaches by his side.Now, let us all bow our heads in prayer for Craig, so that he may hear us wishing him well on his journey to the afterlife.

She got very excited whenever she passed a desk and could pick up thehomework from a student who had remembered to do the assignment.“A poem is your own special way of saying what you feel and what you see,” Mrs. Scottwent on, her lips moist.

Use a Trough Planter A raised garden bed is a natural choice for a vegetable garden using containers. By using a trough planter, you have a raised or standing height that allows users to harvest and tends to their crops easily without needing to hunch over or kneel. As well as being a practical gardening solution, trough planters also offer a great visual benefit for adding height to your pot. 2. Adding Potted Crops will Bring Productivity to any Patio Vegetable garden container ideas will give you the chance to increase your productivity on your patio. You can make use of your unused space and add a variety of crops such as tomatoes, beans, and pumpkins. And the great thing is you don't have to spend a lot of money on landscaping or dig up half your backyard for a fancy vegetable patch. Use your patio and seating space to add more symmetrical vibrance to your outdoor space. 3. Grow Potatoes in a Bag Potatoes are one of the easiest and simplest vegetables to grow and they are best grown in containers. If they are grown in a border, potatoes will spread into all the available soil not just in a small section where they are planted. When potatoes are planted in the ground, it can be difficult to harvest all of the crops. Placing them in a bag or container, it makes it much easier to harvest everything so that nothing is wasted. 4. Be Sure to Choose the Right Container Along with complementing your garden when using plant containers, you must get the right containers that are compatible with the plants you are growing. your containers should be 4 inches wider and deeper than the root ball of the plant. Shallow containers that are around 12 to 16 inches deep are great for shallow-rooted herbs and other annual vegetables. You can replenish the soil for each season when you replant them. If you are interested in growing larger plants such as aubergines or tomatoes, you would do your best by using one plant per container. 5. Design Raised Garden Bed Containers to Suit Your Outdoor Space Raised garden beds can make great vegetable garden containers if you have a large enough space to work with. The benefit of this is that you can have these containers made to fit your landscaping, no matter how large or small they need to be. There are many great materials out there to use for raised beds. One expert suggests using Corten steel due to its durability and capacity to be bent or folded into an unusual shape. The deep rust shade of the material is also very attractive and will look great with other materials like buff-colored gravel.

I’m playing a halfling ranger and my favored terrain is the forest, so please make sure there is an explanation as to why. My character is from a noble origin, but I'd like for her to have spent most of her time in the forest. Her name is Poppy Figglebottom.","answer":"Poppy Figglebottom was the firstborn child of the notorious Figglebottom House in the Neverending Forest. When Poppy was just eight years old she ventured into the forest on her own to play and never returned home. The entire city searched the woods for her, but she was nowhere to be seen. After many years of her absence, she was presumed dead.Over the years citizens would swear they spotted her roaming in the woods, covered in mud and moss hunting and foraging, only to run away when approached. Those sightings were largely considered to be false - hoaxes for attention from the Figglebottom family and a chance to earn some of the reward funds.Fifteen years after her mysterious disappearance she returned. She'd been hardened by the forest, as she was forced to live on her own and endure living in nature by herself. Poppy was welcomed back into the Figglebottom House with open arms but soon after she returned, her father fell ill. He died just three weeks after her arrival, leaving her in charge of the entire city.Even though she was back with her family in the home she was born in, she wasn't comfortable there. She yearned to be back in the forest with the creatures that helped her survive all those years. One night, shortly after midnight when everyone in the castle was sound asleep, she left.

We have a lot of communal grassy areas that are not currently being used. What are some ways I can improve these areas? I would like to make the complex more desirable to prospective renters and improve the quality of life for our existing tenants. I need a bullet-point list of 4 ideas, please.","answer":"No problem! Here are some ideas on how to use the land at your apartment complex:* A dog park: If your apartment is pet friendly, a dog park is a great way to utilize the free space you have. Dogs who live in apartments don't get to enjoy the freedom or have the space to run around as dogs with fenced-in yards do, and they are often required to be leashed when they are on the apartment grounds with their owners. A fenced dog park allows dogs to have more freedom, run around safely, and play and socialize with other dogs. The pet parents at your complex will thank you!* A picnic area: Having a communal picnic area at your apartment is a great idea. You can install a communal grill and picnic benches, giving your residents a place to gather and enjoy time outside instead of being cooped up inside. This also helps foster a sense of community where neighbors can get to know and befriend one another. If your tenants have their friends or family over for a gathering at the picnic area, this is a great way to show off your amenities to the wider community, which can in turn lead to more interest in your apartments. * A playground: A play area is a great way to attract renters with young children and will be a popular addition for children already residing in your apartments. There are many kinds of play equipment you can install, including swings, slides, and climbing equipment. Make sure that the playground has a soft surface such as sand or solid rubber to ensure safety. * A garden: One of your vacant grassy areas could be transformed into a beautiful garden. Whilst living in apartments, it's hard to find peace or privacy and sometimes you might just need somewhere relaxing to be alone with your thoughts. To achieve this, you could create a tranquil garden area for the residents to sit in and admire. Plant some trees and flower beds, install a fountain or water feature, and add some wind chimes and benches. This will help your apartment look more attractive and cared for to potential future residents."},{"question":"Write these sentences again but without using the word 'shirt'A third pointed out: “This costume choice is interesting as even during holiday scenes, Roman has worn button-up shirts mostly.

Make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of television. Consider both sides of the argument. Organise them in pros and cons.Television is one of the most popular devices that are used for entertainment all over the world. It has become quite common nowadays and almost every household has one television set at their place. In the beginning, we see how it was referred to as the ‘idiot box.’ This was mostly so because back in those days, it was all about entertainment. It did not have as many informative channels as it does now.Moreover, with this invention, the craze attracted many people to spend all their time watching TV. People started considering it harmful as it attracted the kids the most. In other words, kids spent most of their time watching television and not studying. However, as time passed, the channels of television changed. More and more channels were broadcasting with different specialities. Thus, it gave us knowledge too along with entertainment.Benefits of Watching TelevisionThe invention of television gave us various benefits. It was helpful in providing the common man with a cheap mode of entertainment. As they are very affordable, everyone can now own a television and get access to entertainment.In addition, it keeps us updated on the latest happenings of the world. It is now possible to get news from the other corner of the world. Similarly, television also offers educational programs that enhance our knowledge about science and wildlife and more.Moreover, television also motivates individuals to develop skills. They also have various programs showing speeches of motivational speakers. This pushes people to do better. You can also say that television widens the exposure we get. It increases our knowledge about several sports, national events and more.While television comes with a lot of benefits, it also has a negative side. Television is corrupting the mind of the youth and we will further discuss how.How Television is  Harming the YouthFirstly, we see how television is airing inappropriate content which promotes all types of social evils like violence, eve-teasing and more. Secondly, it is also harmful to our health. If you spend hours in front of the television, your eyesight will get weak. Your posture will cause pain in your neck and back as well.Additionally, it also makes people addicted. People get addicted to their TVs and avoid social interaction. This impacts their social life as they spend their time in their rooms all alone. This addiction also makes them vulnerable and they take their programs too seriously.The most dangerous of all is the fake information that circulates on news channels and more. Many media channels are now only promoting the propaganda of the governments and misinforming citizens. This causes a lot of division within the otherwise peaceful community of our country.Thus, it is extremely important to keep the TV watching in check. Parents must limit the time of their children watching TV and encourage them to indulge in outdoor games. As for the parents, we should not believe everything on TV to be true. We must be the better judge of the situation and act wisely without any influence.","answer":"First of all the cons:- Too much TV makes you lazy. You may become a couch potato. You opt for an easy and often boring life. - You may become addicted.- You will miss out on socialising with your friends.

You do not have to think as you watch. You save money. - There is a wide choice of programs and tv can be educational and teach new skills. - It can motivate you because it shows speeches by motivational speakers.- TV is a way of staying well informed. It increases your knowledge. It is educational.- You can watch international sports events live. - You can learn about new sports."},{"question":"How many main ideas for things to do does the following text mention?Build a tree house.

It originated in the Edo period at the beginning of the 17th century and was developed by a woman named Izumo no Okuni. Kabuki plays often depict moral conflicts, love stories, or tales of historical events, and they are performed on elaborate stages with rotating platforms and trapdoors. Kabuki is a significant part of Japanese culture, as it has shaped Japan's drama, music, and dance, and it provides a rich reflection of traditional Japanese life and philosophy."},{"question":"What century is the following text from?

I'm definitely overusing them. If you could list some tricks and why they might work, maybe I'd be inclined to try them. I just don't like to be told what to do without explanation.","answer":"I've made a list of tricks you can try to help you get your credit card spending under control. You've got this!1. Lock them up in an inconvenient location, such as a safe or in a file cabinet. Some people even freeze their cards in water to keep from using them! The idea is to give yourself extra time to think about the purchase before you make it.2. Leave them at home so that you are forced to use cash or come back later to purchase something. This also allows you extra time to reconsider.3. Close your account, but beware that this might negatively affect your credit score. You'll want to make sure you're not closing an account you really need.4. Shred your cards. You'll still need to pay your accounts, but the card won't be available. In the future, your credit card company can issue you a new card once you've learned to control your spending habits.5. Give yourself a shock by looking at the amount of interest you pay each year and the amount of time it will take to pay off the debt by paying the minimum. Your credit card statements contain this information.6. Reward yourself for reaching your goal of not using your credit cards. Start small, perhaps by indulging yourself a little after a week of not using your cards - but be sure to use cash so you don't undo the good you've done so far!7. Tell yourself no. If you've ever broken a bad habit in the past, you can use the same technique. If you use self-discipline to arrive to work on time, then you have the means to discipline yourself when it comes to credit cards."},{"question":"Come up with a theory that supports the idea that the universe is contained within a gigantic black hole.","answer":"Although current scientific evidence and belief does not support it, there is some merit to the idea that the universe as we see it is contained within a gigantic black hole, one that is so big that it contains all the stars, galaxies, and matter that we see around us.One consideration in support of this theory is the observation made by Hubble's Space Telescope that confirmed recently that the expansion of the universe - caused by the Big Bang - is neither slowing nor remaining constant, but is instead accelerating. Current hypotheses about the cause for this acceleration include the presence of an exotic form of energy, called dark energy, which is causing the speeding up of the expansion of the universe. However, scientists have yet to find any evidence that such dark energy exists.In the black hole theory of the universe, it could be argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe is leading all matter in the universe toward a black hole singularity since any object that falls into a black hole experiences increasing acceleration when falling toward a black hole's singularity - its center.Another observation in support of the universal black hole theory is the fact that a large portion of the universe's mass seems to be missing and unaccounted for. While dark matter has been posited as the missing piece of the puzzle, it is also plausible that the unaccounted-for matter that is missing could be in the form of a black hole singularity that exists somewhere in the universe but which we cannot readily see yet due to large distances between it and the instruments we use to observe the universe. Since the bulk of a black hole's mass exists as a single point within the black hole when gravity compresses a great amount of mass into it, it could be argued that the majority of the mass of the universe exists as a singularity within the black hole universe in which we reside.Overall, we may not be able to find the answers we seek even with extensive study into the observations we make of our universe. With current technology and the limitations imposed on us by the sheer size of the universe, we can only rely on indirect observations of phenomena to infer what is really happening in our universe."},{"question":"Answer the following questions using the text below:When was the NBA founded?How many teams is the NBA composed of?The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada).

The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June. As of 2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.[5][6][7]The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[8] which is recognized by the FIBA (International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States.

"},{"question":"List out the stages of the bee, just the names of the stages separated by commasThe life cycle of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, involves the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed by the emergence of a winged adult. The number of eggs laid by a female during her lifetime can vary from eight or less in some solitary bees, to more than a million in highly social species.[51] Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. Like the other members of Hymenoptera bees are haplodiploid; the sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised. After mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.[52][53][54][55]The egg is generally oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. Solitary bees, lay each egg in a separate cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. Social bee species provision progressively, that is, they feed the larva regularly while it grows. The nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.[56]In most species, larvae are whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have 15 segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but move within the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce a cocoon. The cocoon is semi-transparent and the pupa can be seen through it. Over the course of a few days, the larva undergoes metamorphosis into a winged adult. When ready to emerge, the adult splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae and breaks out of the cell.[56] ","answer":"egg, larva, pupation, adult"},{"question":"Wow, I didn’t know that.","answer":"Yes, always remember to use a non-stick, sterile bandage on a burn."},{"question":"Write a short story from the perspective of a plant that gains sentience.

End on an ominous note, as if the plant has transformed into something more cynical and overprotective.","answer":"I came into being a few weeks ago. I'm not sure how to explain it other than juxtaposing instinct with reasoning. Before, I would lean into the sun, grow my roots, and conduct photosynthesis instinctually as a product of my evolution. Now, I control those aspects of my nature. I could lean away from the sun and starve myself of light. I wouldn't, of course, but such is the nature of sentience in consciousness, to experience stimuli and choose how one responds to those stimuli. Take Julia, for example, my caretaker. She is ever-faithful to tend to my needs, providing me fertilizer, water, and light as needed. Julia is a dependable caretaker, and I would protect her with my life. In fact, I've been using my newfound sentience to take active steps toward that end.

She points out that this slow-cooker-made recipe is higher in protein, with about 50% dry matter, and lower in fat, with about 10% dry matter than you'd find in most recipes. She adds that, since every pet has very specific needs, you should only use this recipe as a starting point, then talk things over with your pet's doctor for more specifics suited to them. The ingredients you will need are: * 3/4ths minimum to 1 pound maximum of cubed, skinless, boneless chicken breasts or thighs. (Substitute with lean beef, turkey, or fish if necessary or preferred)* 1 ounce minimum to 3 ounces maximum of preferably chicken liver, hearts, or gizzards. Other animal livers are acceptable.* If this meal accounts for more than 10% of a dog's daily diet, include 1 tablespoon of bone meal (or 1,500 mg) per pound of meat* 1 to 2 whole eggs for a healthy source of fat * 8 ounces of brown or white rice* 16 ounces of green beans* WaterTake your slow cooker and add in the diced chicken, the chicken liver, gizzards, and hearts, along with the eggs. You will then add the bone meal, rice, and green beans. Denser ingredients should be at the bottom, with the lightest ingredients on top. Since the amount of water you'll need to use depends on how long you choose to cook the ingredients and how big your slow cooker is, there isn't a specific amount you need to add. Try to fill the cooker to about two-thirds of the way full, but not less than halfway, and if possible, use a six-or-seven quart cooker. When you add in the water, you should try to submerge the ingredients without fully covering them. Then, stir the contents.Put on the lid and set the temperature to low. Leave your crockpot on for around 4 to 8 hours, only as long as needed for the chicken breasts to fall apart. As it's cooking, you can stir and add water to make the stew moister or drier, but keep in mind that you can lose up to 20 to 30 minutes of cooking time if the lid is removed.

What this means is that Jeet Kune Do (which means \\"Way of the Intercepting Fist\\") is a martial art that takes from other martial arts that which is useful and discards that which is useless. It employs any means to win a fight in the context of hand-to-hand combat - kicking, punching, grappling, biting, eye gouging, and so on. It is what today's martial artists would call \\"mixed martial arts,\\" or MMA for short.But it is not necessarily a martial art as we know it. Most, if not all, martial arts are crystallizations made up of sets and forms that prohibit and restrict their practitioners and make them contort their bodies into unusual positions like the \\"horse stance\\" or \\"cat stance.\\" Real fighting entails using your body to its fullest potential; locking it up in forms and stances only restricts the body from realizing its full potential. For instance, while you're getting into your horse stance, your opponent might kick you in your exposed groin.Jeet Kune Do is about being fluid, stopping or intercepting an attack with your weapons (fist, foot, etc.), and ending the fight as quickly as possible. Being fluid means becoming like water; it is yielding, and yet it is powerful enough to move large objects and crash with ferocity. It is also a mindset: instead of anticipating an opponent's attack, you simply \\"react\\" to it using your weapons and the skills you developed through practice and training.Intercepting means stopping an attack with a counterattack as it is being initiated. One of the most relevant examples of this concept in Jeet Kune Do is the use of the \\"stop kick.\\" The stop kick is used against an opponent when the opponent is lunging forward toward you in an attack; the side thrust or front thrust kick can literally stop the opponent in their tracks and prevent them from advancing further while also striking them in turn. Training up to this concept looks something like this: 1) learning to block; 2) learning to strike; 3) learning to block then strike; 4) learning to block and strike at the same time; 5) learning to strike without blocking by moving off the line of attack and moving into the opponent where they are open or exposed."},{"question":"Write a summary of My Octopus Teacher.

Craig dives down to see the octopus but he's not scuba diving, he just holds his breath for a really long time. So he starts going to the ocean every day to see his octopus and she gets used to him and so they swim together and the octopus isn't afraid of him anymore. And then the octopus gets attacked by a shark and the shark bites her arm off! But it's okay because did you know octopuses can regrow their arms?! So the octopus goes into her house, I think it's called a den, for a long time and just regrows her arm. One time, she rides a shark because the shark is trying to eat her but she jumps on the shark's back and sticks there!

There are three parts to the script:1. The constants that define the ball's size and speed and the canvas's size.2. The draw() function. Every time the next frame of the animation is rendered, this function is called to draw the ball in its new position.3. The calls to window.requestAnimationFrame(draw). The call at the bottom of the code renders the first frame of the animation. Then, every time the draw() function finishes, it calls window.requestAnimationFrame(draw) again to draw the next frame.Here's what the full script looks like:  <script>    const movement_rate = 2; // number of pixels moved per frame    const ball_radius = 50;    const canvas_width = canvas_height = 400;    function draw() {        let canvas = document.getElementById(\\"animation_canvas\\");        let ctx = canvas.getContext(\\"2d\\");        ctx.fillStyle = \\"purple\\";        ctx.clearRect(0 - movement_rate, 0 - movement_rate, canvas_width + movement_rate, canvas_height + movement_rate);        ctx.translate(movement_rate, movement_rate);        ctx.beginPath();        ctx.arc(ball_radius, ball_radius, ball_radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);        ctx.fill();        window.requestAnimationFrame(draw);    }    window.requestAnimationFrame(draw);  <\/script>"},{"question":"Write a 3 paragraph story about the mice that tickles peoples toes with feathers while they sleep","answer":"Deep within a forest's heart, a mischievous troupe of mice possessed a magical skill: tickling toes with tiny feathers as people slumbered.

Any suggestions for things we can do? I'd prefer something less standard like a movie date or dinner date and I want it to be at home.","answer":"Absolutely! Here are a few creative suggestions for a date night at home you and your wife might enjoy:1. Unplug: Pretending the electricity is out can make for a fun date night. Some activities you can do without electricity are light candles, playing games, telling ghost stories, and using a flashlight for added dramatic effect.  2. Tasting party: A tasting party can be any number of themes, from wine and chocolate to ice cream and smoothies. Create an at-home tasting station with everything laid out and a sheet of paper to take tasting notes. You can make it even more fun by adding a guessing game, blindfolding one another, and guessing the flavor of what you are eating.3. Home cook-off: Create a fun competition between you and your wife by competing in cooking. For example, pick a particular ingredient you must incorporate into your cooking. 4. Karaoke night:  Sing all your favorite songs together or find karaoke versions of songs on YouTube. 5. Plan a Trip: Scout out locations for your dream trip and plan one together. You can add a spin to this by putting in a budget and seeing what kind of trip you can put together. 6. Interior design project: Pick a room and redesign it together. You can spend some time beforehand looking up some design ideas. Painting, building furniture, or redecorating a room can be some ideas to get started.

What are some age-appropriate ways to teach a small child about chores and helping? A list would help.","answer":"Teaching your child how to be helpful at a young age is beneficial to their development. It will also help them learn how to be more self-sufficient as they get older. Generally, it's a good idea to let them shadow you while you're doing chores and include them where you can. Here are some more specific ways to include your young child in age-appropriate ways and teach them how to help around the house:- If you're dusting, hand them a dust cloth and show them how to wipe a surface (remove any breakables for them first).- If you're vacuuming, let your child turn on the vacuum and/or let them help you steer it.- When drying dishes, give your child a dry kitchen towel and show them how to dry things off (they should only be handling plastic cups, containers, etc.) and then show them where to put dry items away.- When it's time to pick up toys or put dirty clothes in the hamper, let your little one help put things where they need to go.There are lots of little ways to include your child in daily chores. For their safety, always monitor them while they're helping and provide simple guidance where necessary. Do not let them help if it puts them in danger or exposes them to harsh chemicals in cleaning products, such as bleach. As your child gets older and learns how chores are done, you can advance their skills by showing them the next step in a task or introducing a new chore they can help with. Remember to only let them help at an age-appropriate level."},{"question":"Rewrite this e-mail with all PII marked as [REDACTED]Abigail Young,I'm writing to inform you that you, along with others who will be listed in this e-mail, are formally notified of civil legal proceedings where you will be required to give depositions.

Try to keep the writing somber, don't name any characters, and don't add any fantasy elements. The story can pick up at some point but must return to a somber state by the end","answer":"The boy made his way to the top of the hill, where the old mansion still stood. Long since abandoned, many stayed away out of fear. Some would approach, but upon exploring, they would have little reason to stay. A decayed garden, rotting halls, torn curtains, and a looming emptiness engulfed the rooms. But trapped in the gloom, the mansion held a library, once forgotten, now rediscovered. The boy had nowhere else to go, so he wandered the halls most days, leaving only to find food and water. His only source of entertainment was the library. That dreary, decrepit room filled with collapsed shelves and dusty covers would have been overlooked by anyone passing by, but not the boy. He knew that within those faded exteriors lay lands of wonder and excitement. The boy grabbed a book from the shelf, the cover so faded he couldn't even read the title. As he read the pages, his mind raced. With every turn, his excitement grew. As he reached the final chapter, he almost couldn't contain his joy anymore! How could this story possibly end? And then, slowly, it was over. This book, like many others on the shelf, was so badly damaged that many of its pages were illegible.

This effect is the result of light from the flash entering the subject's eye and reflecting off the blood-rich retina, the layer at the back of the eye responsible for sensing light. When the flash is used in low light conditions, the subject's pupils are typically dilated to let in more light for better vision. This also allows more of the flash's light to enter the eye and reflect off the retina. The reflected light, appearing red due to the blood vessels in the retina, then travels back to the camera and registers on the photo. Several techniques can help minimize the red-eye effect. Many cameras come with a 'red-eye reduction' feature, which works by emitting pre-flashes or continuous light before the actual flash. This causes the subject's pupils to contract, reducing the amount of light that can enter the eye and reflect off the retina. Another method is to increase the ambient lighting, causing the subject's pupils to contract naturally. Changing the angle between the camera, subject, and flash source can also help reduce the red-eye effect, as less light will reflect directly back into the camera lens."},{"question":"You have a 1 kB message in which to convince a hyper-advanced alien not to blow up the earth to harvest the metals in its core.

Can you give me five tips to become a better YouTuber? Please incorporate my skills into your answer.","answer":"No problem, here are five ways you can become a better YouTuber:1) Incorporate more editing. Video editing is one of your special skills, which means you shouldn't hide it. Make your videos flashy, fresh, and fun. Along with that, incorporating more editing will give you a personal style. People will start to recognize your videos based on the editing style. When this happens, you'll become more popular.2) Post your films on YouTube. Film is one of your special skills, meaning you should make films, if you haven't already, and post them on YouTube. Short films with good editing, two of your skills, can get good views on YouTube. Along with that, you're building a film portfolio.3) Try video essays. Video essays are right up your alley since your skills include writing and editing. Those two skills allow you to create engaging video essays. Your watch time will increase, meaning your videos will get recommended more. Along with that, viewers love it when creators put a lot of effort into their videos. Considering video essays take a long time, trying that genre can result in a lot of love.4) Make a podcast. Humor and writing are two essentials for podcasts. Make a podcast and post it on YouTube. As long as you incorporate good humor and talk about interesting topics, your podcast could take off and make you a popular YouTuber.5) Post gaming highlights. If you game often, you should consider recording it and posting the highlights on YouTube. These highlights are easy to make, and posting them can't hurt. You don't have to do a lot of editing to create these videos; however, if you want to incorporate your other skill, editing, you can. By combining both gaming and video editing, you can make awesome gaming highlights."},{"question":"Write a positive 5-star review for a local restaurant.

","answer":"Mirra was the strongest of the women living on the drier west side of the gray mountain slopes. Her frequent explorations among the old pines and her difficult hikes to the steep peaks kept her in excellent condition. Mirra was muscled and toned, but her nimbleness belied her great strength.  She could easily wrangle her grandmother’s herd of large brown mountain goats and had bested all the village men in the sword-fighting and stone-throwing contests. Onlookers would have seen an impressively tall woman, well-built, but nearly two feet taller than the slouching village housewives. Mirra’s dry, wispy brown hair was tied back neatly with a scrap of dark leather, a practical solution to keep it out of her sun-tanned and weathered face. Her hazel eyes were sad but came to life upon mentions of her beloved forest. Mirra was a simple woman, not wearing any jewelry or bright colors, save a light leather necklace with a single jasper charm in the shape of a wheeling bird. Mirra’s garments were simple and unassuming, but pragmatic. Her tanned, faded vest had many large pockets on each side, bulging from the aromatic dried herbs within, and her dark brown leggings were comfortable and dry, not too tight, tucked neatly into her stained and worn leather boots. Despite her impressive physical size and simple goat-herding life, Mirra diligently searched for the mountain blackberries. She would erupt into childlike glee, and break into a silly dance upon finding the rare patch. She’d eat until her hands and teeth were stained purple, then bring the remainder of her treasure home to share.

Sodium lauryl sulfate, used as a surfactant in toothpaste, alters taste perception. It can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness, giving food a bitter taste. In contrast, apples are known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste.[69] Distinguishing between the hypotheses that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium lauryl sulfate is still an unresolved issue and it is thought that the menthol added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors.[citation needed]Whitening toothpastesMany toothpastes make whitening claims. Some of these toothpastes contain peroxide, the same ingredient found in tooth-bleaching gels. The abrasive in these toothpastes, not the peroxide, removes the stains.[citation needed] Whitening toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay. To remove surface stains, whitening toothpaste may include abrasives to gently polish the teeth or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate to break down or dissolve stains. When used twice a day, whitening toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth appear whiter. Whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel. Teeth whitening gels represent an alternative.[70] A recent systematic review in 2017 concluded that nearly all dentifrices that are specifically formulated for tooth whitening were shown to have a beneficial effect in reducing extrinsic stains, irrespective of whether or not a chemical discoloration agent was added.[71] However, the whitening process can permanently reduce the strength of the teeth, as the process scrapes away a protective outer layer of enamel.[72]Herbal and natural toothpastesCompanies such as Tom's of Maine, among others, manufacture natural and herbal toothpastes and market them to consumers who wish to avoid the artificial ingredients commonly found in regular toothpastes. Many herbal toothpastes do not contain fluoride or sodium lauryl sulfate. The ingredients found in natural toothpastes vary widely but often include baking soda, aloe, eucalyptus oil, myrrh, camomile, calendula, neem, toothbrush tree, plant extract (strawberry extract), and essential oils.[38] A systemic review in 2014 found insufficient evidence to determine whether the aloe vera herbal dentifrice can reduce plaque or improve gingival health, as the randomized studies were found to be flawed with a high risk of bias.[73]According to a study by the Delhi Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research, many of the herbal toothpastes being sold in India were adulterated with nicotine.[74]Charcoal has also been incorporated in toothpaste formulas; however, there is no evidence to determine its safety and effectiveness.[75] A 2020 systematic metareview of 24 comparative Randomised controlled trials, involving 1,597 adults aged 18 to 65, showed herbal toothpaste was superior over non-herbal toothpaste, but not to fluoride toothpaste.[38]Government regulationIn the United States toothpaste is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a cosmetic, except for ingredients with a medical purpose, such as fluoride, which are regulated as drugs.[76] Drugs require scientific studies and FDA approval in order to be legally marketed in the United States, but cosmetic ingredients do not require pre-approval, except for color additives. The FDA does have labeling and requirements and bans certain ingredients.[77]","answer":"Whitening toothpastesMany toothpastes make whitening claims.

Make it understandable for a first grader.Make sure to point out the four parts of the Gospel story: Creation, the Fall, Redemption, and Restoration. Explain that for the first half of this year, we’ll be learning more about the Gospel, as well as how to share it. Using a whiteboard or poster board, show the students the Gospel Key Passages in order, and explain that each passage addresses one of these four aspects. The fifth Key Passage, the Great Commission, tells us how important it is to share the gospel with others. In order to understand the Gospel, we have to first understand who God is. There are so many things we could talk about, but tonight the children will be learning about God being the Creator. Review the memory verse that they learned in Small Groups: Genesis 1:1, “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” The rest of the passage describes how God created everything just by speaking it into existence. Go through the seven days of Creation. Ask the students if they can imagine God speaking and creating the oceans, mountains, plants, animals, sun, stars, etc. Not only that, but because He created everything, God is in control of everything. He’s in charge, and He knows how the world is supposed to work. When He created everything, He said that it was good. Once God had created everything else in the world, He made Adam and Eve. He created Adam by using dirt and breathing life into him, and he created Eve by taking one of Adam’s ribs. They were special, because God created them in His image. What does that mean? (Allow children to  answer) Explain that God created us to reflect His own qualities, like love, kindness, creativity, forgiveness, etc. After God had created man, He called his creation very good. Because God created people, He knows what’s best for us. He’s not being mean when He wants us to do things that don’t sound fun, or doesn’t want us to do things that do sound fun. He just wants us to live the way we were created to live, because that’s how we work best.

The crowds were excited to return to normal in the 1972 game. They were ready for exciting world-class tennis, unlike anything that had ever been seen before. As they funneled into their seats, US's Pam Teeguarden was feeling her nerves get to her. She sat in her locker room, rattled from her flight. The American atmosphere was filled with tension, and she was closer than ever to their biggest enemy. While her mind was focused on something else, her opponent, Kazuko Sawamatsu was determined.Kazuko had trained hard. She slammed tennis balls back and forth across the court as robots lobbed them at her with incredible speed. She felt the pain of their impact, she felt the scrapes as she skidded across the ground to hit barely-in-bounds returns, and she had honed her craft to new heights.The day came. Sawamatsu didn't even look at the ref or the crowds. Her eyes stared fixated on her opponent. Pam caught sight of a Russian hat in the stands, and her spine went rigid. The first serve snapped her out of it. Pam was in the game. The balls soared across the net as the women played the best tennis of their lives. Kazuko's strong early lead got her through the first game without much trouble, but that night Pam regained her composure.The next day Pam's furious serves rocked Sawamatsu. They had an erratic unpredictability to them that the cold machines she practiced with couldn't mimic. Stunned by Teeguarden's sudden shift, Sawamatsu dropped the second game to her rival.The score was 1-1, but the points for each player showed a slight edge to Sawamatsu at 10-9. Kazuko harnessed all her power and swung. The ball caught fire as it flew through the air. Teegaurden hit the ball, but the impossibly fast shot melted her racket strings and impacted the ground, leaving a crater on the court. After a few more serves, Teeguarden tripped in the hole. She could still technically play, but it was over. Sawamatsu emerged victorious as the Women's Singles Champion of the 1972 WTA Swiss Open."},{"question":"Can you develop a bullet-pointed list of some of the censuses of the state of West Virginia?

But indoor air pollution, caused by emissions from building materials or even air fresheners, can be just as harmful. Yet, there are no widely-accepted methods to detect the toxins. But researchers at the University of Turku in Finland hope to change that with the help of tiny glowing worms.For their study, the scientists used two types of nematodes, also known as roundworms. The millimeter-long transparent worms had been genetically modified.

In 1776, while the American colonies were at war with Great Britain but before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, a plot was hatched by loyalists to kill George Washington and other leaders within the Continental Army. It was formed by the British-appointed governor of New York William Tyron and the loyalist mayor of New York City David Matthews. (This was not Tyron’s only attempt at sabotaging the colonies: he was also found guilty of running a counterfeiting operation to undermine their already struggling economy.) The plan was to turn members of the Life Guard, Washington’s personal guard, against their commander in chief and assassinate him, leaving the colonies without a leader and giving the British the supreme advantage in the war.It is sometimes assumed that patriots were all loyal to the cause of independence from Britain, but this was not always the case. These were not hardened soldiers but were actually mainly civilians. Farmers, laborers, and others joined in the war effort. They were often not very well off, and the British preyed on that. Some soldiers switched sides when they believed that their side was losing. One of those people was Thomas Hickey.Hickey was a member of the Life Guard that was handpicked by Washington. Hickey was born in Ireland and joined the British Army during the Seven Years’ War. He deserted and joined the Connecticut militia when the American Revolution broke out. He went on to join the Life Guard. It is unclear when Hickey turned to the loyalist cause or if he was always a loyalist, but it is clear that he became part of the conspiracy to kill Washington.

Include Jack being somewhat bewildered by chopsticks. It should be in first person.","answer":"Chang had told me he wanted to meet up after work. I was expecting to meet up at a bar or something, so imagine my surprise when I turned up at the address and looked up to see all these swoopy letters I didn't understand. Now I wasn't so dense that I didn't realize this was some kind of restaurant, but I nevertheless hadn't ever been to one of these places. There was a takeout place back home called Wong's my folks and I patronized from time to time but they didn't have any seats or nothing. Still, I saw Chang wave me over the moment I walked in so at least I got the address right. I asked him about what he'd seen back at the warehouse on Thursday but he waved me off. Something about leaving business until after dinner. My curiosity was still burning in my mind about what he'd seen, but I figured I could eat.Soon a large plate of mixed vegetables and beef was placed before me. I'd have happily dug in right then and there, but they didn't give me a spoon or fork! Just two sticks to my side. I looked at Chang with confusion, and he just nodded and said \\"chopsticks\\", as if that was all I needed to know. I politely excused myself to the restroom. When I came back, I saw Chang with his own pair of sticks somehow perched between his fingers. I had no idea how but he was deftly eating with one hand and chatting with the waiter at the same time. In my pocket, I tried to mimic the same hand position as I made my way back to the seat. I didn't want Chang to think I was some sort of palooka. For the rest of the meal, I kept an eye on Chang, thankful he and the waiter seemed to know each other. That took the heat off my side of the conversation as I mangled the noodles in front of me, stopping and smiling anytime someone looked in my direction.

Give a short description of their attributes and the attire they wear. Give an example of each in a different video game.","answer":"No problem, here are three class archetypes in RPGs!1. Warrior - Warriors are possibly the most used class in RPGs. It is often known as the default choice and the warrior is typically known for their strength and ability to wield a sword. The warrior normally dons armor made out of some form of metal and also wields a sword and sometimes a shield. They have a muscular build compared to other members of the party and sometimes their opponents. They are not the most clever but can certainly get the job done, most of the time with brute force. Edelgard from Fire Emblem Three Houses is a more recent example of the Warrior class.2. Mage - Mages are probably the 2nd most common class. They typically wield a stave, staff, or some wand-type object but can also sometimes wield different weapons such as a hammer or knives. Their armor is typically a cloak and their defense is oftentimes weaker than other characters. Their magic is often consumable and can run out so they will either need to rest at an inn or use an ether to restore their MP. Black mages typically use offensive magic against their opponents such as fire or lightning while white mages use healing magic like Cure and can also heal status ailments such as poison.Vivi in Final Fantasy IX is one of the most iconic characters in the RPG genre.3. Thief - Thieves are most well-known for their speed as well as their ability to steal. This is typically a command that they will have from the moment they join your party. They are normally a more slender build and typically wield knives. They wear cloaks, sometimes with hoods and often prefer to hide and may also want to hide their identity. They are known much more for their support abilities than being able to attack like a Warrior, for instance. In certain games, thieves can steal very rare pieces of equipment from bosses or difficult enemies. Thieves have also been known to poison their enemies.Therion in Octopath Traveler 1 is an example of a thief. He can steal from enemies while you're in towns, which can be very helpful."},{"question":"How long did The Phantom of the Opera run on Broadway?","answer":"Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" musical ran on Broadway in New York City beginning January 26, 1988, until April 16, 2023, with more than 13,000 performances."},{"question":"What is the tone of this review : (explain)This article originally appeared in the October 2016 issue of ELLE.Unhappy people unsettle me. Angry, unhappy people who blame my gender for their problems make me downright anxious. When those people happen to be women, and they identify the proximate cause of their woes as me, or men in general, or society at large (which is usually just their fancy way of saying \\"men in general\\"), I get positively upset. (\\"Oh, so now you're the victim, and people should just suck it up and get over those centuries of suffering and misogyny?\\" my girlfriend asks when I share my feelings on the subject—which seems to me sort of a trick question, and mean.)Which brings me to The Bitch Is Back: Older, Wiser, and (Getting) Happier (William Morrow), a follow-up to the 2002 best-seller The Bitch in the House: 26 Women Tell the Truth About Sex, Solitude, Work, Motherhood, and Marriage. Before I get to my occasional sense of persecution and other ambivalent reactions to the latest book, a few disclaimers:(1) Cathi Hanauer, the book's editor, is an old friend, and I've always considered her kind, hardworking, a talented novelist, a cheerfully solicitous mother, a loving wife (to a lucky guy who wasn't me), and an all-around good egg. It wasn't until I read The Bitch 1 (as Hanauer calls the original collection) that I realized that she was also often pissed off and miserable. She and her fellow travelers had been raised to believe that they could have satisfying careers, loving marriages, and fully integrated and happy lives as spouses, mothers, earners, leaders, and whatever else they wanted to be with the full support of their broad-minded partners and society at large. And then they got jobs and spouses and had children—and got mad.(2) To point out to someone who's suffering that her unhappiness might be less the fault of society and more the result of something she is thinking or doing, well, that's a politically perilous move. Especially when the sufferer is part of a group that actually has been and often still is victimized, double especially when the pointer-outer belongs to the group that has historically been doing the victimizing. Yes, I'm a middle-aged white man. Unconscious privilege on my part? I think not. However, my girlfriend often begs to differ.(3) My uneasiness/wounded feelings/testimony on behalf of The Patriarchy notwithstanding, I enjoyed both books. The writers are smart, engaging, and—even when I think they're blind to their own idiocy or the problems they're creating for themselves—compelling thinkers and storytellers.In Bitch 2, Hanauer's shorthand for the second book, another 25 women (including 9 of the originals) grapple with the life choices they've made and ponder decisions that lie ahead. They wonder if cosmetic surgery is a betrayal of feminist principles or a recognition of professional reality. They explain why they left loveless marriages or put up with sexless ones. They regard a lust-fueled affair, appreciate their homemaker husbands, detail the rationale for declining to cut a Hawaiian vacation short to come home to Mom, who's suffered a stroke.You might not be surprised to learn that I wondered why, if the bitch has already had her say, she was back. When I telephoned Hanauer to ask, she told me Bitch 2 was about women owning their choices. Less about blame, more about taking responsibility. \\"If the first book is about anger and urgency,\\" she said, \\"this book is about wisdom, and the calm that comes after the storm. How did you channel all that anger from Bitch 1? How did you get to a better place?\\"She told me that she herself was less riled up than she used to be, more accepting, if ruefully so. We talked about children and love and the political and the personal and therapy and mutual friends and why I'm not married. Then I told her that while I appreciated the humor and insight in the book, I didn't think the women from Bitch 2 were all that calm. I detected an undercurrent—still—of man-blaming, a sense that 14 years later, heterosexual marriage was still to these writers about as good for them as oleander. That many still viewed men as clueless at best. The happiest women in the book, I observed, seemed to be the one whose husband handled the child-rearing and homemaking, the single woman who wrote that \\"you need to be a whole person to invite someone into your life,\\" and the lesbian who rediscovered her love for her wife while traveling in Paris.Hanauer said that she too noted the emotional generosity in those three essays, as well as the lingering bad-mouthing of men. Did any instances particularly stick out? she asked me.Actually, they did—and so I read a few aloud to her, including these two gems: \\"Men, by and large, demand more care and attention and daily propping up than dogs, and only the very best of them give a dog's worth of love back.\\"\\"During my pregnancy, I carried around phantom husbands. You will not be surprised to hear that one was supremely unhelpful.\\"\\"Men can't write that way about women, can they?\\" I asked Hanauer when I finished. \\"We're not allowed to, right?\\"I mean, I got it. There was a lot of vile woman-hating out there, particularly online and anonymously. And yes, I didn't know what it felt like to be a woman, when something as simple as walking to the grocery store felt like dodging a group of two-legged predators. But c'mon, did it help anyone for women to engage in the generalized gender-bashing that they'd seen men indulging in their whole lives?Hanauer laughed. \\"That's absolutely true,\\" she said. \\"Women can say things about men that men can't say about women, especially if the men are married. Why? I don't know if men are nicer, or more polite. Or if women are the underdogs, so we get to say shit. The enlightened men don't trash their wives in public, and if they do, it comes off as horrible, but if women [trash their husbands], it's like, 'You go, girl.' \\"That wasn't right, I thought. That wasn't fair.But then, what did I know?","answer":"Balanced - The author of this article, who is a man tries to understand things from the woman's perspective.

I was just told to stay here for a few days and not come out. The sounds of crashing waves and explosions were plentiful and it triggered my anxiety thinking about every possible situation. I just hoped everyone was ok. A few days passed and the explosions and earthquakes eventually stopped. I figured it was safe to come out. I opened the bunker door and sunlight shone through the door. The sounds of birds chirping and the ocean waves crashing ashore could be heard clearly. I walked up the stairs slowly, hoping everything was fine. The first thing I saw was the ocean, clearly visible and blue. Around me, though, were crumbling buildings and overgrowth. The road was cracked all over and vehicles were all laid around, all of them empty. On the ground, I saw Mom's favorite purse and the wallet I bought my Dad for his birthday. Scattered around were a lot of my parents' things. Clothes to the left and electronics to the right. Our car was right in front of me. I slowly picked up a couple of the things I could use and went back to the bunker. Everyone who was outside was gone. I had to survive.The first thing I had to do was figure out what supplies I'd need. I took stock of what was in the bunker and listed out what I'd need to get through the month. The food in the bunker would last a good while if portioned out and I already had medical kits to cover any injuries. So I listed the things I still needed to acquire somehow:-Secure a sustainable food supply-A weapon for protection-Fuel for the generator-Freshwater or a desalination machine That would be good for the time being. Everything else could come in time. I also had to figure out if I wanted to stay in this place. The bunker would be cozy for a few months but what about after that? It was not a stable, long-term plan. I was sure other survivors were out there planning the same thing as me. But that would have to come later. I had to focus on survival in the present moment."},{"question":"Can you give me a tl;dr on why the debt ceiling debate could put health insurance in jeopardy for millions?Here is the article:As Republicans and Democrats debate a plan to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance have wound up in the crosshairs. Republicans and Democrats appear to be at a stalemate over a GOP proposal to tie eligibility for Medicaid, the government-funded health insurance program for low-income and disabled adults, to a certain number of hours worked each month. For Republicans, the plan is part of a decadeslong push to link federal assistance to work requirements, while Democrats say the move would unfairly strip people of their health coverage and push more Americans into poverty.Under the Republican plan, included in a bill passed by the House last month, Medicaid recipients would have to document 80 hours a month of work, which at the federal minimum wage would amount to a minimum of 580 a month in income, or log hours doing community service or participating in a work training program. Recipients would lose their coverage if they don't meet the hourly or monthly income requirements for three consecutive months during the year. A number of groups would be exempt, including people under 19 years old or over 56, those who are going to school at least part-time or who are pregnant or deemed by a doctor to be physically or mentally “unfit for employment.” Also exempt from the work requirement would be people participating in a drug or alcohol program and those caring for a dependent child or an “incapacitated person.”","answer":"A major aspect of the debt ceiling debate concerns eligibility for Medicaid. Under the proposed plan, non-exempt recipients would have to either log eighty hours a month of work, log hours doing community service, or participate in a work training program. "},{"question":"Write about a man playing his first professional soccer match.

He is filled with nervousness and fear of ruining the game by not being able to support his team when they need it. They've practiced so hard for this first season, but sometimes it doesn't feel like it's enough. Kam is also feeling a little excited from hearing the crowd cheer. He also feels excited about getting out there and wanting to prove himself to his team. Kam starts to jump up and down to warm himself up.

So it was almost like the universe expressed a cruel sort of comedic irony the day it put Daniel in front of her at the register. Daniel had been arguing about the price of a particular menu item for about 5 minutes uninterrupted with Michelle. She tried for as long as she could to not be disrespectful, but once she reached her boiling point, it was over. She proceeded to curse and scream at Daniel who had no problem matching her energy. Other employees, and even some of the customers tried to break it up, but both Daniel and Michelle were too headstrong to back down. Even as the manager came and insisted that Michelle go to the back, it seemed as if she was hell-bent on giving Daniel a piece of her mind for coming in and aggravating her to this extent."},{"question":"Can you recommend eight dog breeds that are good for beginners? I don't want a large dog, so nothing that gets to typically 80+lb. ","answer":"No problem! Here are eight small to medium-sized dog breeds that are good for beginners:1. Golden Retrievers: Golden Retrievers are long-haired dogs that are generally friendly and easy to train. They tend to be very attached to their families and eager to please them, which makes this dog a good choice for those who have never trained a dog.2. Beagles: Beagles are small dogs that weigh under 30lb and are curious and active. They're perfect for someone looking for an exercise buddy.3. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel: These small dogs are easy to manage and are usually gentle and loving. 4. Cocker Spaniel: Cocker Spaniels are notoriously great with other animals and people and are fun and easy-going. They are also tolerant of children, making them ideal for families.5. Bichon Frise: These dogs are small and playful, though they do take some grooming maintenance. Much like the spaniel breeds, they are easy to manage due to their small size and willingness to please.6. Boxers: Although energetic and protective, Boxers are a common choice for first-time owners due to their willingness to learn and their ability to bond with their owners.7. Shih Tzus: Shih Tzus are small and affectionate dogs that are great for people who live in apartments or smaller homes. They're also good with children.8. Poodles: For first-time owners seeking a higher-energy dog, Poodles are intelligent, fun-loving, and quick to learn tricks! They can, however, be a lot for those who aren't looking to do a lot of activity with their pup.Please remember that dogs are all individuals, and these personality traits typical of the breeds are not a guarantee."},{"question":"Write a script for a YouTube video about Michael Pollan and corn. It can be in a tone that is sort of sensationalizing. Needs to be speaking to the audience, so referring to audience as “you” is good. ","answer":"Corn. It’s in everything, everywhere, forever! If you live in America, you probably eat corn on a regular basis. Even if you don’t eat corn, you’re still eating corn. Meat eaters, I’m looking at you. Most livestock in the United States are fed on corn feed. I'm definitely not the first person to talk about this! This video isn't just about corn. It's also about Michael Pollan, one of the leading food researchers and writers in America. In The Omnivore's Dilemma, he details his time traveling across America in pursuit of the truth of this cornerstone crop. In four meals, his research shows that the problems with corn go beyond just our health. American supermarkets are lined with more than 45,000 items that contain corn. That's not just food! Diapers, batteries, and the wax on magazines are all made of or contain corn! As I said earlier, meat also contains corn in some way! Many of the preservatives that keep our food fresh too. Our brands may be diverse, but it all leads back to corn - so much so that it can be tracked back by a chemical test by checking to see if a particular structure of carbon is present. Scientifically, if you were to test certain tissue, you'd be able to find this in American humans as well.Eating is good for you. Corn, at a base level, is not an evil food. It cannot be \\"bad\\". However, the evidence clearly shows that American foodways involving corn have been shaping dangerous and disastrous ecological devastation around the world.

Here are some games that you might enjoy after playing Limbo:- Inside (2016) shares a developer (Play Dead) with Limbo. Like Limbo, it has received critical acclaim and many awards. Its dark, ominous setting and minimalistic soundtrack will feel familiar to Limbo players. As with Limbo, there are many dangers that befall the player- character, and some are violent. Inside is rated \\"M\\" for mature and is not advisable for children.- Unravelled (2016) is a puzzle-platform game without the horror of Limbo. Instead, a cute yarn creature must solve puzzles and avoid predators by unraveling the yarn substance of its body. Similar to Limbo, the player must manipulate objects along the path, climb, swing, and cleverly avoid danger while picking up collectibles. It is a family-friendly experience. A sequel, Unravel Two, was released in 2018 with a two-player option. - Contrast (2013) takes place in a noir setting but with an added Limbo-like shadow manipulation. Dawn, the player character, can slide in and out of the shadows to solve puzzles and assist the storyline characters. Despite being told from the point of view of a child, the story contains some adult themes and violence.

Plus none of the ideas should suggest any special cutting tools or machines because I don’t know how to use any.","answer":"Sure! Here are some amazing t-shirt transformation ideas to repurpose your old tees without sewing:1. Pillow Talk: Turn your old t-shirts into comfy throw pillows with no sewing required! Simply cut the front and back panels of your shirts to the same size, stack them on top of each other, and tie each corner into a knot. Fluff it and enjoy your new DIY décor!2. Scarf it Up: Stay cozy and stylish with a t-shirt scarf. Cut your shirt into strips (width depends on your preference), pull each strip to stretch it out, and tie the strips together end-to-end. Wrap and twist to your heart's content!3. Tote-ally Awesome: Ditch the plastic and make a reusable shopping bag from your old tank tops. Cut off the sleeves and neckline, leaving the back intact. Put the bottom of the shirt in a knot and flip it inside out. Tote around your groceries (or anything else) in an eco-friendly style!4. T-Shirt Blanket: Transform your old tees into a cozy and stylish blanket that's perfect for snuggling up on the couch. Cut the shirts into squares of equal size and lay them out in a pattern of your choosing. Keep the squares together at the corners using simple knots. Before you know it, you'll have a personalized quilt that's as warm as it is sentimental.5. T-Shirt Headband: Give your hair accessories a unique twist by crafting a headband out of an old shirt. Cut a strip of fabric from the shirt (the thicker you want the headband to be, the wider your strip should be), and stretch it out until it curls on the edges. Keep the ends sticking up like bunny ears.6. T-Shirt Ice/Heat Pack: Next time you're nursing an injury or feeling sore after a workout, skip the drugstore purchases and grab an old t-shirt instead. Cut out a square or rectangle from the shirt, fill it with ice cubes or heat in the microwave, then knot the edges together to create a makeshift cold or hot pack."},{"question":"Please provide some suggestions for saving money. I'm already using public transportation and stopped buying new clothes every weekend.","answer":"Here are a few suggestions for ways to save money that anyone can use. 1. Cut down on your grocery bill - Most people when they start calculating a budget are very shocked to find out how much money they spend on groceries every month. The average American family of four tends to spend around 966 per month. It can be easy to fill the cart with a few extra treats for yourself, but all those small extras will add up to a very big total after a while. To help save money on groceries, you can try planning out your meals every week and take a good look at what you already have on hand before you shop. Another way to cut down on your grocery costs is to shop solo and leave the kids at home. 2. Cancel Your Automatic Subscriptions and Memberships - There's a good possibility that you are paying for several subscription services that you aren't using. Trendy subscription boxes, Amazon Prime, and various streaming services may not cost much on their own but they do add up quickly. Be sure to turn off auto-renew on the services you use so that you will not have a recurring charge every month. 3. Buy Generic - One of the simplest ways to save money is to stop buying brand-name items. In most cases, the only thing better about buying brand names is the advertising and packaging. Everything from food to cleaning supplies and paper products will have a generic alternative that you can try and you may find you like those products just as much if not more than the pricier name brand.

They include a bronze container for human remains and a set of human and animal figures carved from marble. However, the most extraordinary is a rare Eid Mar coin celebrating the assassination of Roman politician Julius Caesar.The coin's front features an image of Roman Senator Marcus Brutus. He and his brother-in-law, Cassius Longinus, plotted to kill Caesar in 44 BCE. The back of the coin has a cap flanked by two daggers. The cap was similar to the one given to formerly enslaved people. The daggers represent the weapons used to kill Caesar.The words EID MAR are engraved below. Latin for \\"Ides of March,\\" they correspond with March 15 on the Roman calendar.

Make it less than 75 words. ","answer":"Herman Melville once said, “It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.” But what does that truly mean? Essentially, Melville’s words mean that in this life, we should all aim to be unique, create our own individuality, and be original.

They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear. Headphones are also known as earphones[1] or, colloquially, cans.[2] Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place. Another type, known as earbuds or earpieces[1] consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are bone conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open.

Despite the competition, D&D has remained the market leader in the role-playing game industry.[12][13] In 1977, the game was split into two branches: the relatively rules-light game system of basic Dungeons & Dragons, and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (abbreviated as AD&D).[14][15][16] AD&D 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, a new system was released as D&D 3rd edition, continuing the edition numbering from AD&D; a revised version 3.5 was released in June 2003. These 3rd edition rules formed the basis of the d20 System, which is available under the Open Game License (OGL) for use by other publishers. D&D 4th edition was released in June 2008.[17] The 5th edition of D&D, the most recent, was released during the second half of 2014.[13]","answer":"The early success of Dungeons & Dragons, no doubt thanks to its association with powerful dragons such as myself, led to many new developing game systems. Despite plenty of competition, the game Dungeons & Dragons has remained at the top of the roleplaying industry, a similar role that we dragons have among the lesser mortals. In 1977, the game was sundered in two: basic Dungeons & Dragons, and the more advanced and well-designed Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (known as AD&D). AD&D 2nd Edition, with better pictures to capture the glorious essence of dragons, was published in the year of 1989. Then in the year 2000, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition was released with even better designs capturing my dragon brethren, while Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 was released soon after in 2003. It is the 3rd edition rules that created the foundation for the d20 system, which is fortunately available under the Open Game License (otherwise known as the OGL) for publisher use. Eventually, just as a wyrmling grows mighty, Dungeons & Dragons released its 4th edition in June of 2008. And now just as a proud adult dragon, the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons has been released during the latter half of the year 2014.
