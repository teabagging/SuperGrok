Two of the flowers are daisies. Three-fifths of the remaining flowers are tulips and the rest are sunflowers. How many sunflowers are there? Give the rationale and then the answer.Let's think step by step. One dozen of flowers is equal to 1 x 12 = 12 flowers. There are 12 - 2 = 10 flowers that are not daisies. So, 10 x 3 / 5 = 6 of the flowers are tulips. Therefore, there are 10 - 6 = 4 sunflowers.. The answer is: 4.When Erick went to the market to sell his fruits, he realized that the price of lemons had risen by 4 for each lemon. The price of grapes had also increased by half the price that the price of lemon increased by per grape. If he had planned to sell the lemons at 8 and the grapes at 7, and he had 80 lemons and 140 grapes in his basket, how much money did he collect from selling the fruits at the new prices? Give the rationale and then the answer.Let's think step by step. The new price for each lemon after increasing by 4 is 8 + 4 = 12. For the 80 lemons, Erick received 12 * 80 = 960. The price of each grape increased by 1 / 2 * 4 = 2. The new price at which Erick sold his grapes is 7 + 2 = 9. For the 140 grapes, Erick collected 140 * 9 = 1260. From the sale of all of his fruits, Erick received 1260 + 960 = 2220.. The answer is: 2220.Sam bought a heavy safe with a combination lock.

ExampleCONTEXT: Taxonomía El avión roquero fue descrito formalmente como Hirundo rupestris por el naturalista italiano Giovanni Antonio Scopoli en 1769, si bien luego fue clasificado en el nuevo género Ptyonoprogne en 1850 por el ornitólogo alemán Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach.Sus parientes más cercanos son los otros integrantes del género, que son el avión isabelino (P. fuligula), el avión oscuro (P. concolor) y el avión pálido (Ptyonoprogne obsoleta). El nombre del género se deriva del griego ptuon (φτυον), «abanico», en referencia a la forma de la cola cuando está abierta, y Procne (Πρόκνη), una doncella mitológica que fue transformada en una golondrina. El nombre específico, rupestris significa «de las rocas» y se deriva del latín rupes, «rocas». No se han reconocido subespecies, aunque se propuso la existencia de dos razas, P. r. centralasica y P. r. theresae, la primera habitante de Asia Central y la segunda, de los montes Atlas en Marruecos, pero las mínimas diferencias en tamaño y colorido no tienen un patrón geográfico definido. Se hallaron fósiles de la especie en el estrato del pleistoceno tardío en Bulgaria, y en el centro de Francia en sedimentos de entre 242 000 y 301 000 años de antigüedad.ANSWER: PtyonoprogneAnswer: ¿Qué género se asigna el avión roquero en 1850?Explanation: The question addresses the necessary ingredients to get to the answer from the context provided.

Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin.

For more than 100 years, libraries have played an important role in keeping America informed and educated. But how are these book-filled buildings changing with the times? You may be surprised to find out. Benjamin Franklin famously founded America's first lending library in 1731 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. And the public library system developed greatly in the late 1800's. Businessman Andrew Carnegie donated millions of dollars to help build free public libraries across the country. Between 1886 and 1919, Carnegie's donations helped build 1,679 new libraries! Carnegie believed in the opportunities that libraries could offer Americans young and old. He knew that the more libraries there were, the more people would have access to books, lectures, news and more. \\"There are now more public libraries in the United States than McDonald's restaurants,\\" said Clara Hayden, of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library.  Chances are that there is a public library in or near your community . After all, the United States is home to 9,225 public libraries. Today, libraries continue to develop and grow. Seven out of ten libraries offer free Internet access. This opens any doors for community members who cannot go online at home, including the opportunity to apply for jobs online. Libraries are also teaching kids about the fun of reading. One new program called Read! Play! ----- combines reading with playtime. As kids listen to a book being read aloud, they use Legos to build images from the story. \\"Today's libraries are always looking for creative programming to bring people into the library,\\" Lego's Michael McNally said. Benjamin Franklin once said, \\"The doors of wisdom are never shut.\\" As long as the doors of public libraries are open, his statement is most certainly true!  Question: Clara Hayden would agree that in America   _  .

If the building materials were located 200 miles from where they were building the nest, what is the total distance the birds covered in the trips?Step-by-step reasoning process: In one round trip, traveling to and from the building materials location, one bird covers 2 * 200 = 400 miles. If in one round trip one bird covers 400 miles, in 10 round trips, it covers 400 * 10 = 4000 miles. Since there were two birds collecting the materials, they covered a combined 4000 + 4000 = 8000 miles collecting the building materials in 10 round trips.The answer is 8000.Answer the following question.Jim decides to buy mayo in bulk. He can buy 1 gallon of mayo at Costco for 8 dollars. At the normal store, a 16-ounce bottle costs 3. How much money does he save by buying the gallon container?Step-by-step reasoning process: A gallon is 1 * 128 = 128 ounces. So he needs to buy 128 / 16 = 8 of the small bottles. That would cost 8 * 3 = 24 dollars. So he saves 24 - 8 = 16.The answer is 16.Answer the following question.Tom eats a pound of carrots and twice as much broccoli. If carrots have 51 calories per pound and broccoli has 1/3 that many calories, how many calories did he eat in total?Step-by-step reasoning process: He ate 2 * 1 = 2 pounds of broccoli. There are 51 / 3 = 17 calories in each pound of broccoli. So he ate 2 * 17 = 34 calories of broccoli. He ate 1 * 51 = 51 calories of carrots. So in total he ate 51 + 34 = 85 calories.The answer is 85.Answer the following question.In 5 years, Joey will be as old as Beth is now.

It isn't \\"clever\\" dialogue that cracks me up but rather the horrendous film making. B,G,B,&O is the type of movie I would have written when I was fifteen and thought Quinten Tarantino was the greatest film maker of all time. The fact that this is the type of stuff fifteen year old boys would make isn't as bad as the fact that fifteen year old boys could probabally make a film of the same quality as B,G,B,&O. Even though this movie is, in my opinion, one of the worst movies ever made I still have to suggest that everyone see it. The piss poor quality of this movie will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. One scene I really loved was when this guy at a diner tells a story about Johnny Cash being violated in prison. The guy delivers the entire rant doing an impression of Jules from Pulp Fiction.

Given the price, I really thought this would perform to the praise of the other reviewers. Here's why I am sorely disappointed:1) the \\"stainless\\" steel does in fact rust and corrode2) the rimmed bottom tray has no drains, no openings, so obviously no incline so water just sits and stagnates, and if you live in warm climates will in fact start to mildew3) check your water softness, because if your water is too hard it will leave calcium and other deposits which require DAILY cleaning otherwise it will be very unsightly.

Product review: Baldwin's prose is average; and, at the time, the issues dealt with here weren't at all banal, but Baldwin tackles them far to brashly. He offers a panoply of problems, but rarely offers a solution that's tantamount to his psuedo-genius. The protagonist simply goes into fits of self-loathing and predictable \\"White man oppresive, Black oppressed, so let's sink down to their level.\\" But I just can't get over the prose.

Review: I have been intrigued with Steve Coleman's music since the early 80's when he and Greg Osby and Cassandra Wilson were moving boundaries with their M-Base concepts. He also caught my fancy with his exceptional contributions to Dave Holland's exceptional music on \\"Triplicate\\" and \\"Extensions\\". The music on \\"Resistance is Futile\\" is even more advanced than anything Coleman has recorded in the past. This music is difficult to describe because it excels on every level. It swings one minute and is funky the next. It can be soft and gentle and then drive a groove like a locomotive. It is structured and melodic while being spontaneous and creative at the same time. I hope this is the future of Jazz - a magical collaboration of intelligent communications between leader and band mates. This music is vivid and colorful - and I loved every minute of it. Grab this hard to find CD and hang on to your hat. You will not be disappointed. Resistance is indeed, futile!!! Is the review positive or negative?Ans: Positive(Q).Title: Nice toy!

Your task is to generate label \\"True\\" if abstract is structured, otherwise generate \\"False\\". A structured abstract is composed of a topic sentence (or key sentence), relevant supporting sentences, and a closing (or transition) sentence. This structure is key to keeping your abstract focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image.One example: RanBP type proteins have been reported to increase the catalytic efficiency of the RanGAP-mediated GTPase reaction on Ran. Since the structure of the Ran-RanBP1-RanGAP complex showed RanBP1 to be located away from the active site, we reinvestigated the reaction using fluorescence spectroscopy under pre-steady-state conditions. We can show that RanBP1 indeed does not influence the rate-limiting step of the reaction, which is the cleavage of GTP and/or the release of product P(i). It does, however, influence the dynamics of the Ran-RanGAP interaction, its most dramatic effect being the 20-fold stimulation of the already very fast association reaction such that it is under diffusion control (4.5 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1)). Having established a valuable kinetic system for the interaction analysis, we also found, in contrast to previous findings, that the highly conserved acidic C-terminal end of RanGAP is not required for the switch-off reaction. Rather, genetic experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrate a profound effect of the acidic tail on microtubule organization during mitosis. We propose that the acidic tail of RanGAP is required for a process during mitosis.Solution is here: FalseExplanation: Output is appropriate for the given abstract because it is not structured.Now, solve this: Many viruses go through a maturation step in the final stages of assembly before being transmitted to another host. The maturation process of flaviviruses is directed by the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor membrane protein (prM), turning inert virus into infectious particles. We have determined the 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a recombinant protein in which the dengue virus prM is linked to the envelope glycoprotein E. The structure represents the prM-E heterodimer and fits well into the cryo-electron microscopy density of immature virus at neutral pH. The pr peptide beta-barrel structure covers the fusion loop in E, preventing fusion with host cell membranes. The structure provides a basis for identifying the stages of its pH-directed conformational metamorphosis during maturation, ending with release of pr when budding from the host.Solution:","answer":"False"},{"question":"Which of the following sentences is nonsensical?Options:- Sentence A: \\"The storage in every computer is unlimited.\\"- Sentence B: \\"A computer can run out of storage.\\"Hmmm, let me think.

Your task is to summarize them.Example input: A photo series on the popular Humans of New York Facebook page may have went viral and captured the nation’s attention last Tuesday, but for Daniel Kang, the post really hit home.    When Kang, a junior studying computer science at the University of Michigan, heard that the refugee pictured and his family were relocating to his hometown of Troy, Mich., he said he knew he had to help.    “I was really inspired by how intelligent he was and I knew a lot of people wanted to welcome him, so I thought, why not it be me?” he said.    On the Humans of New York Facebook page with over 16 million likes — including comments from President Obama — the seven-part picture series’ captions detail one Syrian scientist and his family’s tale of loss after a missile strike destroyed their home, forcing them to to flee to Turkey, now with plans of coming to the United States.    “Everything ended for us that day. That was our destiny. That was our share in life,” the scientist said. Battling stomach cancer, the loss of a home, career and seven family members, the man, whose name remains confidential to protect his identity as a refugee, expressed his hope for a new life in the United States.    “I learned today that I’m going to Troy, Michigan,” he said. “I know nothing about it. I just hope that it’s safe and that it’s a place where they respect science. I just want to get back to work. I want to be a person again. I don’t want the world to think I’m over. I’m still here.”    Knowing that refugees come to the United States with little more than they can carry, Kang quickly organized a crowdfunding campaign to help establish the man in his new home.    In four days, the GoFundMe page has raised over 16K in donations from over 700 people. On Saturday afternoon, actor Edward Norton also began a fundraiser for the scientist, raising even more for the refugee who says he “just wants to be a person again.”    “The response has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Kang. “A lot of people thanked me for doing a nice thing but I really feel like I was doing what anyone else would have done.”    Kang said he’s received many messages from people expressing their gratitude, those who want to reach out to the man personally, as well local companies interested in working with the scientist. This includes invitations to lecture at local colleges, research job opportunities and potential help from local medical facilities in treating the man’s stomach cancer.    “There’s definitely a lot of interest in helping him out,” he said.    The biggest concern, said Kang, are those skeptical of how the money will reach the man.    Kang, who has successfully crowdfunded in the past, is working closely with GoFundMe, the local refugee relocation agency Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, and is in communication with the Humans of New York staff to make sure all funding goes to the scientist.    In the end, Kang said he just hopes the scientist receives the welcome he deserves.    “If I could talk to him right now, I’d just tell him how sorry I am for everything he’s been through and that he’s coming to a great place. One of the things he said that resonated with me the most is that ‘I hope Troy is a place that appreciates science.’    I’d say out of all the cities in Michigan, Troy is the best place to raise a family, be a scientist and we can’t wait to have him.”    Oona Goodin-Smith is a student at Oakland University and a member of the USA TODAY College contributor network. ||||| I saw this story on one of my favorite sites, Humans of New York, and it moved me to tears. This man has suffered profound loss that would crush the spirit of many people and yet he still passionately wants a chance to contribute positively to the world. If we don’t welcome people like this into our communities and empower his dream of making an impact with his life, then we’re not the country we tell ourselves we are. Let’s reject the 'anti-human’ voices that tell us to fear refugees and show this man and his family what Americans are really made of. Let’s show that a country built by the energy and dreams of immigrants still believes in brave people who come here with hope for better life.    Everything we raise here will go to help this family so that the father can get the medical treatment he needs to live and pursue his work, and his family can build a new stable life after their tragedy, and…as the Scientist beautifully expresses…to support his dream of contributing to the world.    Thanks to Humans of New York for sharing these stories. Thanks to the team at CrowdRise for putting this together and figuring out how to get even the credit card transaction fees covered so we can get the maximum to the family.    Thanks to everyone who rallies together to create the power of the crowd. If enough of us kick in the price of two frappucinos, we can probably transform the experience of this family and show them that life can deliver healing and kindness, not just heartbreak.

Edward Norton ||||| DETROIT, MI -- Moved to tears by a Humans of New York feature on a Syrian refugee fleeing to Metro Detroit, Hollywood actor Edward Norton launched an online fundraiser that had raised nearly 450,000 for the widower and his four children as of Thursday afternoon.    \\"I didn't hear about it, but I want to thank him very much from the humanity perspective,\\" the man told NBC News after hearing about the fundraiser's success. \\"There are people outside who need that money much more than me.\\"    The man asked NBC to refer to him as \\"Abu Ammar,\\" a fake named used to protect his relatives who remain in Syria. He's known to many on the Internet simply as \\"The Scientist,\\" which is also his profession.    The refugee's family was scheduled to arrive in Troy, a Detroit suburb, Thursday. He and four surviving children spent the last two years in Instanbul, Turkey. They fled civil-war-torn Syria after the man's wife and one of his daughters were killed in a missile attack on April 6, 2013.    His is one of 12 families featured by Humans of New York and cleared to resettle in the U.S.    \\"I learned today that I'm going to Troy, Michigan,\\" the man told Humans of New York. \\"I know nothing about it. I just hope that it's safe and that it's a place where they respect science. I just want to get back to work. I want to be a person again. I don't want the world to think I'm over. I'm still here.\\"    The story made rounds throughout the Internet and even garnered a response from President Barack Obama's official Facebook page:    As a husband and a father, I cannot even begin to imagine the loss you've endured. You and your family are an inspiration. I know that the great people of Michigan will embrace you with the compassion and support you deserve. Yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we're proud that you'll pursue your dreams here. Welcome to your new home. You're part of what makes America great.    ,Norton, known for his roles in movies like \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"Birdman,\\" wrote in the description of his online fundraiser:    If we don't welcome people like this into our communities and empower his dream of making an impact with his life, then we're not the country we tell ourselves we are. Let's reject the 'anti-human' voices that tell us to fear refugees and show this man and his family what Americans are really made of. Let's show that a country built by the energy and dreams of immigrants still believes in brave people who come here with hope for better life.    (6/7) “I had no problems before the bombing.

Posted by Humans of New York on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 ||||| ISTANBUL — The grieving refugee who touched hearts as \\"The Scientist\\" on the Humans of New York blog only mustered a brief smile when told that a Hollywood star had helped raise 450,000 for him.    Hours before flying to Michigan to start a new life in the U.S. on Thursday, the cancer-stricken Syrian civil engineer glanced down.    \\"I didn't hear about it, but I want to thank him very much from the humanity perspective,\\" he said after NBC News revealed the crowdfunding appeal. Oscar-nominated actor Edward Norton was moved to tears after reading the refugee's biography on the photography site last week and launched the fundraiser.    \\"There are people outside who need that money much more than me,\\" The Scientist said, displaying the sort of compassion and humility that helped his story go viral.    The Scientist, who asked NBC News to refer to him as \\"Abu Ammar\\" to protect family in Syria, said his life was shattered by a bomb that killed his wife and daughter just under three years ago.    He was later diagnosed with stomach cancer, and has had to care for five remaining children.    They include a teenage son, who is still reeling after watching his mother die, and a daughter who carries inside of her shrapnel from the attack on April 6, 2013.    \\"When a bomb drops you don't know where it comes from,\\" he said. \\"There is no question our lives changed after that ... 180 degrees. I am mentally tired, in overwhelming sadness.\\"    “ As long as there are good people in the world … then we can stop this bloodshed”    On Thursday, Abu Ammar and four of his children flew to Troy, Michigan, as part of a United Nations refugee resettlement program.    For about two years, the family had been living close to destitution in Turkey. But the drive to succeed still lingers, Abu Ammar said.    \\"I've had ambitions since I was a child, and right now I'm still that same child with the same ambitions,\\" he said. \\"But I still have a message — sometimes when I'm talking to myself I say, 'No, I'm not supposed to die. I need to live long enough to realize my message to humanity.'\\"    Abu Ammar's story on Humans of New York, a popular blog started in 2010 that spawned a bestselling book, prompted an outpouring of compassion. Even President Barack Obama contributed, calling Abu Ammar and his family an \\"inspirations\\" on HONY's Facebook page.    \\"Yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we're proud that you'll pursue your dreams here.\\" Obama wrote. \\"Welcome to your new home. You're part of what makes America great.\\"    Last night President @BarackObama wrote a very sweet welcome note to the scientist in Tuesday's story. pic.twitter.com/ZGrn3gOdR7 — Brandon Stanton (@humansofny) December 10, 2015    Norton, who starred in \\"Birdman,\\" \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"American History X,\\" set out to help pay The Scientist's medical expenses.    \\"This man has suffered profound loss that would crush the spirit of many people and yet he still passionately wants a chance to contribute positively to the world,\\" Norton wrote.    The resettlement of Syrian and Muslim refugees in the United States is controversial, especially in the aftermath of attacks by Islamic extremists in Paris and San Bernardino. Some politicians — notably GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump — have called for a ban on Muslims entering the country.    Abu Ammar told NBC News he didn't know anything about the debate over Muslims and immigration raging in the U.S. He also didn't have a solution to the war raging in his home country.    \\"I don't like to get into politics because I am a man of science, and I can separate science and politics completely,\\" he said. \\"But as long as there are good people in the world, and everyone looks into his or her conscience, then we can stop this bloodshed.\\"    Abu Ammar added: \\"No one benefits from people dying, and wars overall never benefit anybody — so let's hope God can help everyone and put out this fire.\\" |||||Example output: A Syrian refugee whose moving story went viral earlier this month starts his new life in Troy, Michigan, on Thursday, NBC News reports. The refugee—who wants to keep his real name out of the media to protect family members still in Syria—is known as \\"The Scientist\\" on the blog Humans of New York, where he was first profiled. \\"I learned today that I’m going to Troy, Michigan,\\" The Scientist told HONY. \\"I know nothing about it. I just hope that it’s safe and that it’s a place where they respect science.\\" According to MLive, The Scientist left Syria in 2013 after a bomb killed his wife and one of his daughters. Since then, he's been diagnosed with stomach cancer and was barely scraping by in Turkey. Despite being \\"in overwhelming sadness,\\" he and his surviving children are hoping for a new start in the US, he tells NBC. Thanks to his story—which even got the attention of President Obama—The Scientist will have some help to get that new start. NBC reports actor Edward Norton was moved to tears after reading The Scientist's story and started a crowdfunding page that has raised nearly 450,000. \\"I didn't hear about it, but I want to thank him very much from the humanity perspective,\\" The Scientist says. \\"There are people outside who need that money much more than me.\\" A Michigan college student was also inspired to help after hearing The Scientist would be moving to his hometown, according to USA Today. His fundraising page has raised more than 16,000. \\"I’d say out of all the cities in Michigan, Troy is the best place to raise a family, be a scientist, and we can’t wait to have him,\\" Daniel Kang says.Example explanation: This is a good example.

It was practiced by such literary giants as Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy and Joseph Conrad. It fell out of favor in the last fifty years, but is now making a rebound thanks to the iPhone.    Apple is showcasing two new e-reading apps under their new and notable category on the main App Store homepage. PigeonHole and Serial Reader both deliver classic novels into bite sized snippets that are easy to digest and appeals to readers who only have a few minutes to read each day.    Not only are indie app developers getting involved in serializing classic novels, but major publishers such as Simon & Schuster are also getting involved. A few months ago they developed a new iPhone app called Crave, that lets you subscribe to your favorite author and receive bite sized updates of new novels every 24 hours.    Crave makes reading e-books more enjoyable for people who are too busy to breeze through a full length novel. Since only bite sized chunks are delivered on a daily basis, it is a great way to kill some time when you are waiting for transit to arrive, on your break or have a few minutes to spare during the day.    Not only does this app encourage women to read, but to also discover new authors. Every week a new author is added to the platform and this month there are e-books contributed by Colleen Hoover, Abbi Glines and K.A. Tucker.    Rooster is a new company that launched last year and charges users a monthly subscription to access serialized content, instead of charging a fee for each title. The co-founder and editorial director Yael Goldstein Love spoke to Good e-Reader today about the appeal of serialized subscription reading. While much of the content is currently in the public domain or sourced from the company’s other site, Daily Lit, a different model is underway in which classics are paired with contemporary content.    “We’ve been working directly with authors to try to create content that is specifically tailored for the Rooster experience.”    The shorter length of Rooster content is perfect for smartphone reading during snippets of time, something that speaks to the company’s model. Rather than luring consumers with a model that affords them the ability to read mountains of content for one price, Rooster’s clientele is expected to read serialized and novella-length works for far less than the cost of a typical e-book subscription plan.    I think serialized fiction is one of the those segments in publishing that is enjoying a resurgence, thanks to technology. Some companies are simply cutting up classic, royalty free novels into bite sized chunks, while others are taking modern novels, and just delivering a little bit at a time. I don’t think there is a definitive business model yet that will net someone a million dollars, but I like the fact more people are experimenting.     ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was:    - Slash pages from every domain on the web:            -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links)        -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain    - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph ||||| Trying to knock some classic books off your bucket list? Try Serial Reader, an app that delivers literature to your phone in daily snippets that you can read in 20 minutes. A bite-size section of the book will be delivered daily to your phone until you’ve made your way through something like “Moby Dick” — 20 minutes at a time. If you’re looking to avoid cliffhangers or you like to read ahead, this app might be frustrating. But if you’re looking for a way to fit more reading into your day, it’s a pretty elegant solution.    Users should know that the key word here is “classics” — you’re not going to find modern bestsellers. There’s a small selection now, but the app developer’s notes say the library is expanding daily. For those who are intimidated by thick, leather-bound tomes, Serial Reader is an good way to break it all down.    Free, for iOS devices. |||||A:","answer":"As daunting as it may seem, you can read Crime and Punishment—20 minutes at a time. Serial Reader is a free iOS app that breaks down dozens of the classics into manageable chunks that are sent to your iPhone or iPad each day at a time you choose, Chris Taylor reports at Mashable. At that rate, the aforementioned Dostoyevsky tome will take you 79 days to read. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein comes in at 28 days. And you could finish The Star Lord by Boyd Ellanby in just 10. \\"This just might be the reading mode of the future,\\" Taylor writes. Good e-Reader points out that serialized fiction first became popular in the newspapers of Victorian England. And after decades on the decline, it \\"is now making a rebound thanks to the iPhone.\\" Even publisher Simon & Schuster is getting in on the action with an app called Crave, which charges a fee, as do apps Pigeonhole and Rooster. What makes Serial Reader different is that it's free, according to the Washington Post. \\"Users should know that the key word here is 'classics,'\\" Hayley Tsukayama writes. \\"You’re not going to find modern bestsellers.\\" And if you're the type of reader who likes to skip ahead, she notes, Serial Reader can be frustrating. However, it's an \\"elegant solution\\" to the problem of finding time to read. Taylor says he found the 20-minute reading time to be an overestimate—it took him, \\"not a particularly fast reader,\\" about 15 minutes to complete a day's reading. Also, he notes, you can download an entire text if you choose. (Not into reading? This app will give you the \\"most intense game of solitaire\\" you've ever played.)"},{"question":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

Title: Same stuff, different year Review: Overweight, out-of-shape guys who pay no attention to what they eat may find this book revolutionary. The rest of us will be amazed that anybody would actually pay for a book that gives them widely-known and long-accepted nutrition and exercise information. (My copy was an unsolicited gift.) The only exceptional point is the recommendation to exercise six times a week (2 weight training days and 4 aerobics days). Unfortunately, for the vast majority of people, 6 days is just not practical and likely will lead to a lot of stress and feelings of failure, two things not good for your health.

The second competitor can eat 3 times more than the first competitor, while the third competitor can eat twice as much as the second competitor. How many hotdogs can the third competitor eat after 5 minutes?[Answer]The second competitor can eat 10 x 3 = 30 hotdogs per minute. The third competitor can eat 30 x 2 = 60 hot dogs per minute. Therefore, the third competitor can eat 60 x 5 = 300 hot dogs after 5 minutes. The answer is 300.Q: Joshua packs 12 bottles in each crate. He has a total of 130 bottles and 10 crates.

Specifically:* When I first used it, it would only accept a small number of pages before it would make a clicking sound and refuse to print. This problem can be corrected by adjusting the plastic tabs at the rear of the paper tray.* I have had the same problem with the printer crinkling envelopes that other users have had. This is a serious problem if you're using the printer for formal correspondence.* The printer runs hot after the first 20 or so copies, causing paper to curl. To some extent, this problem can be dealt with by turning the paper over in the tray, trying to take advantage of its natural curl to offset this effect, but it is impossible to offset it completely.These problems are irritating enough that I would not purchase a Brother printer again.

It's slightly schizophrenic as the words are in a more modern style while the tunes and arrangements remain fixed mainly in the R&B style that SSJ married to rock on Hearts of Stone. So if you're paying a lot of attention to the lyrics it can be awkward at times, but if you're just letting it rock you then it's got the same energy and verve as his other best works. If nothing else, buy it for the song \\"Time\\", with its loping bass, snaky groove in the verses and tight horn arrangement in the chorus. Billy Rush upped the amount of guitars on this and the next album (Love Is A Sacrifice), bringing it more into the 70s and 80s than the first three albums and it works really well.

When the owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter's car is gone, they expel Ellie. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie, but misses her on the road. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money, and agrees to have a second, formal wedding to Westley. On her wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story. When Peter comes to Ellie's home, Mr. Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses: a paltry 39.60. When Ellie's father presses him for an explanation of his odd behavior, Peter admits he loves Ellie, and storms out.

The term itself emerged in the 1880s, and it gained widespread currency when used after 1944 by opponents of these ways of thinking. The majority of those who have been categorized as social Darwinists did not identify themselves by such a label.Answer this question: the application of the theory of evolution and natural selection to human society was known as?CoT: The relevant information is: The term social Darwinism is used to refer to various ways of thinking and theories that emerged in the second half of the 19th century and tried to apply the evolutionary concept of natural selection to human society.Ans: the Green Bay Packers ( 1966 -- 1967 )Ques: The Pittsburgh Steelers (6 -- 2) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships, while the New England Patriots (5 -- 5), the Dallas Cowboys (5 -- 3), and the San Francisco 49ers (5 -- 1) have five wins. New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with ten, while the Buffalo Bills (0 -- 4) have the most consecutive appearances with four (all losses) from 1990 to 1993. The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances: 1972 -- 1974. The Denver Broncos (3 -- 5) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls. The Minnesota Vikings (0 -- 4) and the Bills have lost four. The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises: the Green Bay Packers (1966 -- 1967), the Miami Dolphins (1972 -- 1973), the Pittsburgh Steelers (1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979, the only team to accomplish this feat twice), the San Francisco 49ers (1988 -- 1989), the Dallas Cowboys (1992 -- 1993), the Denver Broncos (1997 -- 1998), and the New England Patriots (2003 -- 2004). Among those, Dallas (1992 -- 1993; 1995) and New England (2001; 2003 -- 2004) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls. The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII. The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens, who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position. Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl, including franchise relocations and renaming: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1964) and Lions (1957) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl.Answer this question: who won the super bowl 2 years in a row?CoT: This is the relevant information: The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises: the Green Bay Packers (1966 -- 1967), the Miami Dolphins (1972 -- 1973), the Pittsburgh Steelers (1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979, the only team to accomplish this feat twice), the San Francisco 49ers (1988 -- 1989), the Dallas Cowboys (1992 -- 1993), the Denver Broncos (1997 -- 1998), and the New England Patriots (2003 -- 2004).Ans: Atlanta , GeorgiaQues: People in Atlanta, Georgia celebrate St. Patrick's Day by holding a parade that courses through several blocks of a main portion of the city, particularly on Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta. In 2012, what was called the largest Irish flag in history was used in Atlanta's parade. The St. Patrick's Day parade has been held in Atlanta since 1858. In the 2014 parade, more than 200 units participated from across the South, and as far away as Ireland.Based on this passage, name a city that has a huge st patrick's day parade?CoT: The relevant information to answer the above question is: People in Atlanta, Georgia celebrate St. Patrick's Day by holding a parade that courses through several blocks of a main portion of the city, particularly on Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta.Answer: normal operation. Now, what could be the question and solution-maybe?Ques: Three flashing red lights around the Xbox 360 power button instead of the one to four green lights indicating normal operation represent an internal problem that requires service. This error was soon nicknamed the \\"Red Ring of Death\\", echoing Windows' Blue Screen of Death error. Warning signs may include freeze-ups, graphical problems in the middle of gameplay, such as checkerboard or pinstripe patterns on the screen, and sound errors; mostly consisting of extremely loud noises that can be affected by the volume control, and the console only responds to pressing the power button to turn it off. These events may happen once or several times until the hardware failure occurs, or not at all. If the console freezes occasionally, the error will not necessarily follow. The technical problems seem to affect some generations of consoles more than others, e.g. Xenon or Zephyr. Those problems may also cause some freezing screens.Answer this question based on the passage: what do the green lights on xbox 360 mean?CoT: To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: Three flashing red lights around the Xbox 360 power button instead of the one to four green lights indicating normal operation represent an internal problem that requires service.Ans: desert or semi-aridQues: Australia's climate is governed largely by its size and by the hot, sinking air of the subtropical high pressure belt. This moves north and south with the seasons. But it is variable, with frequent droughts lasting several seasons -- thought to be caused in part by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The climate varies widely due to its large geographical size, but by far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil. The northern part of the country has a tropical climate, varied between tropical rainforests, grasslands and desert.Answer this question: most of australia has one of the what climates?CoT: This is the relevant information: The climate varies widely due to its large geographical size, but by far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid.Ans: typically between 16 and 18 years of age","answer":"Ques: Passage: In the education systems of England, Northern Ireland, Wales and some other Commonwealth countries, sixth form (sometimes referred to as Key Stage 5) represents the final 1-3 years of secondary education (high school), where students (typically between 16 and 18 years of age) prepare for their A-level (or equivalent) examinations.Question: Based on this passage, how old are you when you finish sixth form?CoT: To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: In the education systems of England, Northern Ireland, Wales and some other Commonwealth countries, sixth form (sometimes referred to as Key Stage 5) represents the final 1-3 years of secondary education (high school), where students (typically between 16 and 18 years of age) prepare for their A-level (or equivalent) examinations."},{"question":"\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" is the national anthem of the United States of America.

Review: I saw this movie about week ago and it was great. Everyone was perfect for their roles and the acting was very dramatic. Mehki Pheifer did an excellent job as Oden (Othello with a different name) and Josh Hartnett was the perfect jealous person. The plot and screenplay were great and had a lot of good twists. This was a great adaption of Othello, and the director did a good job of making the movie seem modern but yet still Shakesperian.

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story.One example: Premise: Susie was sitting on her barstool.  Initial Context: She kept kicking the counter with her feet.  Original Ending: Suddenly, her kick sent her falling backwards. The chair hit the ground with a thud and broke.

If 50% of the female brunettes were under 5 feet tall, then how many female brunettes in Dana's high school senior class were under 5 feet tall?A: In Dana's senior class, the 60% of 200 students is 0.6 * 200 = 120 female students. Fifty percent of the females, or 0.5 * 120 = 60 of the female students were brunettes.

In conclusion, I will NEVER purchase this again. Is this product review negative?OPTIONS:- Yes- NoAnswer: YesProblem: OPTIONS:- Yes- NoQ: Title: THE best microphone I have ever had the chance to use.

She did mention ABA therapy but only slightly. She also came across rather arrogant in her views that if parents do not try this diet they have failed their child. I admit the diet does help but it is not a gauratee for every child. This author over emphasizes diet and under emphasizes therapy. What helps as much, if not more so, is lots of therapy, early intervention and the somewhat tedious but effective ABA therapy.

G. Hertzler), about the creation of the 1984 commercial for Apple Computer, which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \\"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial.Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \\"WOZ\\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple.The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\\" Wozniak then comments that \\"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe.Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gatesâ high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard. Gates' and Allen's early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the \\"Homebrew Computer Club\\". Jobs and Woz develop Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs' family home, with the help of Daniel (Marcus Giamatti) and Elizabeth (Melissa McBride). Eventually Mike Markkula (Jeffrey Nordling) invests in the company which allows it to expand and move forward. In 1977, Jobs, Woz, and Markkula demo the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire. This event is followed by the development of the IBM-PC with the help of Gates and Microsoft in 1981.The film also follows Jobs' relationship with his high school girlfriend and early Apple employee, Arlene (a pseudonym for Chrisann Brennan, portrayed by Gema Zamprogna, and the difficulties he had acknowledging the birth and existence of their daughter, Lisa. Around the time his daughter was born, Jobs unveiled his next computer, which he named, The Lisa. The Lisa was then followed in 1984 by the (Macintosh), a computer inspired by the Xerox Alto. The main body of the film finally concludes with a 30th birthday toast in 1985 to Steve Jobs shortly before he was fired by CEO John Sculley (Allan Royal), from Apple Inc.The film ends in 1997, with 42 year old Jobs' return to Apple (after its acquisition of NeXT Computer) and with his announcement at the MacWorld Expo of an alliance between Apple and Microsoft. It also indicates that Jobs is now married, has children, and has reconciled with Lisa.Question: Who narrates Gate's story?, Answer: BallmerSmiley is a mischievous boy who lives in the small country town of Murrumbilla.

On his way he meets Casy (John Carradine), a former preacher who has lost his faith. The pair find the farm deserted; Tom's share cropping family was evicted. Tom is reunited with his family at his uncle's farm, only to discover the family must also leave that farm the next day. The extended family of eight (plus Casy) packs up their belongings onto an old truck and head to California to look for work.Shortly after leaving, Grandpa (Charley Grapewin) dies of a stroke and the family buries him along the roadside.

The man runs away and the sheriff shoots at him, killing a bystander. Tom knocks out the sheriff and flees.The family leaves the camp and arrives at a farm that needs workers. Tom is wary. The farm is surrounding by a barbed-wire fence with plenty of armed guards. The family settles in a shack and picks peaches for five cents a box, earning barely enough to feed the family. After dinner, Tom takes a walk and encounters Casy in a camp just outside the farm. Casy is helping to lead a labor strike against the farm. Thugs from the farm kill Casy and Tom kills one of the attackers. Tom is hit in the face with a club, leaving a big gash.The family loads up the truck again, hiding Tom under a mattress. They head north, and stay at a U.S. government camp. Life is better. The camp has toilets, showers and is run by camp inhabitants. Warned ahead of time, the camp men stop thugs from starting a fight at the Saturday night dance that would provide an excuse for the local sheriff to take control of the camp.The sheriff arrives at the camp looking for Tom. Tom vows to his mother, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), that he will fight injustice wherever he finds it, and heads off into the night. She worries that she will never see him again.

Movie title: Enemy Mine Movie plot: Enemy Mine opens to a panorama of outer space along with an opening monologue by Willis Davidge (Dennis Quaid). In this monologue he says that all of Earth's nations had achieved peace by the end of the 21st century, and had begun working together to explore and colonize outer space. Unfortunately, Earth wasn't alone out there. Earth colonists encountered a race of alien nonhumanoids known as the Dracs, were laying claim to some of the richest star systems in the galaxy. Dispute over who was where, first, and who had 'legal right' to where, led to battle and finally war between Earth and the drac people.The scene shifts to an Earth space station out in space, far from the Solar System. Four Drac fighter ships approach to begin a raid. Earth's fighter pilots scramble to defend the station; among them are Davidge and his co-pilot, Joey Wooster (Lance Kerwin). The dogfight appears to be going well for the Earth defenders until six Drac fighter ships arrive to join the battle. One of the Drac fighters destroys an Earth fighter, Echo Six, killing its two pilots. Infuriated, Davidge recklessly pursues this Drac ship away from the rest of the battle, but this Drac pilot proves to be an ace flier, deftly dodging several laser volleys. Wooster tries to warn Davidge that their ship's engines are overheating and they are closing over the planet Fyrine IV, which is unexplored territory. But David is obsessed with destroying the Drac ship and its pilot. Finally he scores a hit to the Drac ship's wing, damaging it but not destroying it. Completely single-minded now, Davidge continues pursuing the Drac ship into the upper atmosphere of Fyrine IV. He sees the Drac pilot eject from its ship, and then loses sight of both pilot and ship in the thick fog of the upper atmosphere. Finally the fog cloud breaks to show the abandoned Drac fighter ship directly in front of Davidge's ship. With no time to move, he collides with the Drac ship, damaging his own ship to where he must make a crash landing of his own on Fyrine IV's surface....[A]: Jerry.[Q]: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Logan develops a supportive relationship with Beth's son, Ben, who is without positive male influence since the death of Beth's brother, Drake. Beth's former husband, Sheriff Deputy Keith Claytonâthe son of the town's judgeâis immediately suspicious of Logan. He is brusque and overbearing with the former Marine. He discourages Ben from playing the violin around him, leading to Ben to practicing in his tree house. When Ben returns bloodied from a charity baseball game, Beth and Keith have an argument, and Keith threatens to use his connections to take full custody of Ben.

During the battle there are backs and forths, but in the end of the battle the Goon Squad win a cash-prize, and the leader of the rival crew goes all in for a double or nothing battle,which DJ accepts much to the dismay of his brother who knows that if the opposing crew leader thinks he got hustled the crew won't be able to spend the money they win, the Goon Squad wins the second battle and the losing home crew responds by ambushing DJ and his crewmates after the show.

Nate, the physical plant director at Truth, aims to teach DJ responsibility and puts him to work doing maintenance as part of a work-study program. DJ sees April Palmer (Meagan Good), to whom he is immediately attracted. After registration, he moves into his dorm room, where he meets his new roommate Rich Brown (Ne-Yo). Rich meets DJ at a stepping competition on the green between the Truth chapters of rival fraternities Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi.

There are too many funny moments in this film and it would be a crime to give spoilers to any of them, so I would just suggest watching it.All the cast from the first movie continues to shine to the point that there isn't much left to add.

If this film were presented as a work of fiction, it would be engaging and entertaining. But it is not presented as a work of fiction. It makes the public believe it is based on serious investigation. It is a pity that the theory behind the film has been so superficially researched and does not stand up to close scrutiny.\\"I would further add that it is a shame that a director of the stature of James Cameron would allow himself to be in any way connected to this self-justifying, pseudo-historical poseur.

Much of it was intruded during the Precambrian age; it is the most abundant basement rock that underlies the relatively thin sedimentary veneer of the continents. Outcrops of granite tend to form tors and rounded massifs. Granites sometimes occur in circular depressions surrounded by a range of hills, formed by the metamorphic aureole or hornfels. Granite often occurs as relatively small, less than 100 km2 stock masses (stocks) and in batholiths that are often associated with orogenic mountain ranges. Small dikes of granitic composition called aplites are often associated with the margins of granitic intrusions. In some locations, very coarse-grained pegmatite masses occur with granite.Answer this question based on the passage: where can granite be found in the world?HW Chung: OK, some thoughts:","answer":"To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: Granite containing rock is widely distributed throughout the continental crust.

Pretty happy that I booked a window seat and fully prepared to do my pass-out-until-landing act.Arriving at my seat, I see an elderly couple occupying my seat and the aisle seat next to it. I point out the older woman is in my seat.Her husband mumbles something about her ankle being broken and that I can have their seat in the center section. Upon seeing that seat I guess the disgust was quite visible upon my face, because they quickly switched back to their own seats.I felt a bit like an asshole.I'm usually a pretty easy going guy and pretty pleasing to other people, however the idea of trading my paid window seat for a middle row seat on an 11-hour flight is asking a bit much...Also, I don't really understand why a window seat would be better with a broken ankle? And if that's so important to you, why don't you just shell out the few extra bucks to book a window seat?

Her mum asked me to tell her what I got her so she doesn’t get the same as me, so I sent her the list, and she told her. This led to a bit of an argument and her getting annoyed I spent that much (she has spent around £300 on me). I understand that we have other priorities to be saving for, such as saving to move in together, and saving for a car, as well as a couple of holidays we have, and I don’t feel like the amount I spent is unwarranted as she asked for a lot of the things I got and I feel like the others are quite meaningful.So AITA for spending more than I should have?

It is so amazing to watch all the special effects and intricicies of the little insects, each one with his own unique personality and look. My favorite character was the spider. she was so ultra-hip!The only thing I didn't like about this film was the incorporation of the humans. The little boy and the two meanie aunts were cool. But at the end of the film where he ends up in NY and all the real life humans come scampering out of nowhere like roaches, it's all too much \\"culture shock\\" for the eyes.

Throughout the day, she refills the container with 10 more wipes after using up 20. By nighttime, she only has 60 wipes left. How many wipes were in the container in the morning?[Answer]Let w be the number of wet wipes Elsie had in the morning. Throughout the day, she used w - 20 wet wipes. Once that happened, she had to refill the container resulting in w - 20 + 10 = w - 10 wet wipes. By nighttime, she had w - 10 = 60 wipes. So then, w = 60 + 10 = 70. She started with w = 70 wipes.

All 4 students (now including the student who came first) had an average completion time of 30 seconds, meaning the sum of their completion times is 4 * 30 = 120 seconds. The student who came first spent 120 - 105 = 15 seconds in the race.

One section that measures 40 feet by 40 feet will be covered with concrete, and the rest needs to be covered in grass seeds. Each bag of grass seeds covers 56 square feet. How many bags of grass seeds does Amanda need?Answer: First find the area of the lot by multiplying the width and the length: 120 ft * 60 ft = 7200 sq ft. Then find the area of the square covered in concrete: 40 ft * 40 ft = 1600 sq ft. Then subtract the concrete area from the total area to find the grassy area: 7200 sq ft - 1600 sq ft = 5600 sq ft. Finally, divide this area by the area each bag covers to find the number of bags: 5600 sq ft / 56 sq ft / bag = 100 bags. The answer is 100.[Question]George wants to borrow 100 from a loan shark.

Title: Not recommended for experienced MMORPG'ers Review: It's about 2 weeks before release and the current beta version is horribly buggy. Framerates (on my high end computer) are pathetic (averaging about 15 - occasionally dipping below 5fps). Gameplay is, to be generous, very boring and very tedious. Graphics are good, but not great. Character development is shallow, all characters are basically the same. One bright spot is crafting - which is somewhat deep - but mindnumbingly boring.I'd wait a couple months before I bought this dog. Maybe after an update or two it will be worth buying.This would be a good beginner ORPG for a young teen or someone who has never experienced MMORPG's before. Experienced gamers should avoid Horizons.

Write the numbers of the sentences needed to answer the given question. Separate multiple sentence numbers with a comma (\\", \\"). E.g. \\"1, 2\\" would be the correct response if Sent 1 and Sent 2 are needed to answer the given question (do not include sentences that contain no information that is necessary to answer the question).

The phrase \\"appease Democrats\\" is mentioned in Sent 2, about accepting offer that is mentioned in Sent 1 to \\"keep the government open\\". So, Sent 1 and Sent 2 are the sentences needed to answer this question.Problem: Paragraph- Sent 1: (CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed.Sent 2: The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro.Sent 3: Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record.Sent 4: With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released.Sent 5: Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate.Sent 6: The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said.Sent 7: Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy.Sent 8: Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state.Sent 9: He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet.Sent 10: Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days.Sent 11: He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\"Sent 12: The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

If there are 4 hearts on a card, calculate the total cost of the cows when they are sold at 200 each.Answer: If there are 4 hearts on a card, a standard deck of 52 playing cards will have 208 hearts. There are twice as many cows in Devonshire as there are hearts on a standard deck of 52 playing cards, meaning there are 2 * 208 = 416 cows in Devonshire. The total cost of the cows when they are sold at 200 each is 416 * 200 = 83200. The answer is 83200.[Question]Aston has accidentally torn apart his comics and needs to put all the pages back together. Each comic has 25 pages and Aston has found 150 pages on the floor. He puts his comics back together and adds them back into his box of comics. If there were already 5 untorn comics in the box, how many comics are now in the box of comics?[Answer]Aston had torn and has now fixed a total of 150 pages on the floor / 25 pages per comic = 6 comics. Adding this to the comics that were never torn means there are 6 fixed comics + 5 untorn comics = 11 comics in the box of comics. The answer is 11.Q: Lily goes to the supermarket. She has 60. She needs to buy 6 items: celery, cereal, bread, milk, potatoes, and coffee. She finds a stalk of celery for 5, cereal for 50% off 12, bread for 8, and milk for 10% off 10. She finds potatoes for 1 each and buys 6. How many dollars does she have left to spend on coffee?A: Lily spends 5 + 8 = 13 on celery and bread. Lily spends 12 * (50 / 100) = 6 on cereal. Lily gets 10% off the milk, so she pays 100% - 10% = 90% of its original price. Lily spends 10 * 90% = 9 on milk. She spends 1 * 6 = 6 on potatoes. Thus, she has 60 - 13 - 6 - 9 - 6 = 26 left over for coffee. The answer is 26.Question: James hires a seamstress to fix all his shirts and pants. He has 10 shirts and 12 pairs of pants. It takes 1.5 hours to fix a shirt and twice as long for pants. The tailor charges 30 per hour. How much does it cost?Answer: It takes 10 * 1.5 = 15 hours to fix his shirts. It takes 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours per pair of pants. So it takes 3 * 12 = 36 hours for the pants. That means in total it takes 15 + 36 = 51 hours. So it cost 51 * 30 = 1530 to fix everything. The answer is 1530.[Question]Stacy went to a store to buy some pairs of shorts. Each pair normally cost 10, but there's a discount of 10% on the total cost for people who purchase 3 or more pairs at once. How much can she save by buying 3 pairs at once as opposed to purchasing them individually at different times?[Answer]Without the discount, each pair cost 10 so 3 pairs cost 3 * 10 = 30. With a discount of 10% on the total cost, she can pay only 30 - (30 * (10 / 100)) = 27. By buying 3 at once in order to get the discount, she can save 30 - 27 = 3. The answer is 3.[Question]There is 80 mg of caffeine in a cup of coffee. Lisa does not want to drink more than 200 mg of caffeine per day.

She wanted to have 200, so she is 40 mg over her goal because 240 - 200 = 40mg.

As each wall has a thickness of 2 bricks, he will need 100 bricks * 2 = 200 bricks per wall. If the complete fence contains four walls, he will require a total of 200 * 4 = 800 bricks.The answer: 800What was the question?Question: Cooper is building a brick fence around all four sides of his property. Each of the four walls of his fence is 20 bricks long, 5 bricks high, and 2 bricks deep. How many bricks does Cooper need to complete his fence?If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, Ephraim bought 30 ducks / 2 = 15 ducks. Since Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, Kolton bought 45 ducks + 15 ducks = 60 ducks. The total number of ducks the three bought is 60 ducks + 15 ducks + 30 ducks = 105 ducks. The average number of ducks each bought is 105 ducks / 3 people = 35 ducks / person.The answer: 35Reverse engineering the question: A teacher asked Adelaide, Ephraim, and Kolton to buy ducks and monitor their growth patterns and features for their science class.

How much does the discounted subscription cost if a subscription normally costs 80?Reasoning and answer: The ping pong balls cost 10000 * .10 = 1000. So the discount is 1000 * .30 = 300. So he pays 1000 - 300 = 700.The answer: 700What was the question?Question: Ping pong balls sell for .10 each. Johnny buys 10000 for a prank. He gets a 30% discount for buying in such large bulk.

Fan de Patrick Senécal, je me suis jeté sur Oniria avec délectation.  Las! Pour tout dire, je ne suis pas allée au bout.  A mi-chemin, j'étais assomé par cette impression irritante de suivre des caricatures de personnages dans un bouquin qui tournait désespérément en rond, sans que rien n'évolue vraiment. Je me suis alors mis à papillonner jusqu'à la fin sans avoir l'impression d'avoir perdu quoi que ce soit. J'ai donc laissé tomber. Ce qui n'est pas dans mes habitudes, surtout quand on parle d'un de mes auteurs favoris.  Heureusement, depuis, Patrick a écrit Le Vide qui est son meilleur roman à ce jour.

Last week, she created a poem with 20 stanzas. If each stanza has 10 lines, and each line has 8 words, calculate the total number of words in the poem. Give the rationale and then the answer.Let's think step by step. If each line that Salem created in her poem has 8 words, the total number of words in a stanza, which is 10 lines, is 8 words / line * 10 lines / stanza = 80 words / stanza. With 20 stanzas, each containing 80 words per stanza, the total is 80 words / stanza * 20 stanzas = 1600 words in all the stanzas(poem).. The answer is: 1600.Toby is filling his swimming pool for the summer. The pool normally takes 50 hours to fill. He knows his hose runs at 100 gallons per hour. Water costs 1 cent for 10 gallons. How many dollars does it cost to fill the pool? Give the rationale and then the answer.Let's think step by step. The pool holds 5000 gallons of water because 50 x 100 = 5000. Every gallon costs .001 because .01 / 10 = .001. It costs 5 to fill the pool because 5000 x .001 = 5.. The answer is: 5.Betty is 60 years old, and she is the oldest person in the family. Her daughter is 40 percent younger than she is, and her granddaughter is one-third her mother's age. How old is the granddaughter? Give the rationale and then the answer.","answer":"Let's think step by step. Betty's daughter is 40 / 100 * 60 = 24 years younger than she is. That means her daughter is 60 - 24 = 36 years old. So the granddaughter is 1 / 3 * 36 = 12 years old..

If the original number has a factor, say of 7, then when it’s squared, the square will have a factor of 7^2. Another way to say that is: any positive integer all of whose prime factors have even powers must be a perfect square of some other integer. Look at the prime factorization of 432432 = (2^4)*(3^3)The factor of 2 already has an even power —- that’s all set. The factor of 3 currently has an odd power. If n = 3, then 432*n would have an even power of 2 and an even power of 3; therefore, it would be a perfect square. Thus, n = 3 is a choice that makes 432*n a perfect square.

ExamplePassage: The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War. The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.Answer: When was the French and Indian War?Explanation: This question is based on the following sentence in the passage- The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War. It is a common convention to write (start year-end year) beside a historical event to understand when the event happened.

ExerciseThe Neolithic 1 (PPNA) period began roughly 10,000 years ago in the Levant. A temple area in southeastern Turkey at Göbekli Tepe dated around 9,500 BC may be regarded as the beginning of the period. This site was developed by nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, evidenced by the lack of permanent housing in the vicinity and may be the oldest known human-made place of worship. At least seven stone circles, covering 25 acres (10 ha), contain limestone pillars carved with animals, insects, and birds. Stone tools were used by perhaps as many as hundreds of people to create the pillars, which might have supported roofs. Other early PPNA sites dating to around 9,500 to 9,000 BCE have been found in Jericho, Israel (notably Ain Mallaha, Nahal Oren, and Kfar HaHoresh), Gilgal in the Jordan Valley, and Byblos, Lebanon.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.Example Input: Article: A car that runs on coffee is unveiled(shown to the public for the first time)today but at between 25 and 50 times the cost of running a car on petrol, the invention won't please any motor industry accountants. Nicknamed the Car-puccino, it has been created using a 1988 Volkswagen Scirocco bought for PS400 and it was chosen because it looked like the time-traveling DeLorean in the movieBack To The Future.The car will be driven the 210 miles between Manchester and London powered only by roasted coffee granules  .It has been built by a team from the BBC1 science programme Bang Goes The Theory and will go on display at the Big Bang science fair in Manchester to show how fuels other than traditional petrol can power vehicles. The team calculates the Car-puccino will do three miles per kilo of ground coffee   -- about 56 cups of espressos   per mile.The journey will use about 70 kilos of ground coffee which, at supermarket prices of between PS13 and PS26 a kilo depending on brand and quality, will cost between PS910 and PS1,820, or between 25 and 50 times the PS36 cost of petrol for the journey.In total, the trip will cost 11,760 espressos, and the team will have to take 'coffee breaks' roughly every 30 to 45 miles to pour in more granules.They will also have to stop about every 60 miles to clean out the 'coffee filters' to rid them of the soot and tar which is also generated by the process.So despite a top speed of 60mph, the many stops mean the going will be slow, with the journey taking around ten hours. Sadly, the inventors will still have to pay duty on their coffee fuel---even though tax collectors at Her Majesty's Revenue and Custom haven't yet worked out how much. Nick Watson, producer of Bang Goes The Theory, said, \\"Coffee, like wood or coal, has some carbon content so you can use it as a fuel.The coffee needs to be very dry and in granules to allow the air to move through the pile of coffee as it burns.The brand doesn't matter.\\" He said the same technology could be used to power a car on other unusual fuels, such as woodchips or nut shells, construction or agricultural waste.  Answer: It should be very dry.Example Output: Which is the right way to choose the coffee used as fuels to run the Car-puccino?Example Input: Article: Columbus made four voyages to the west between 1492 and 1504 in his vain search for a sea route to Asia. The mystery of why he failed to find it haunted  him and filled him with sadness. Wherever he went to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, South America, Panama, down the coast of Central America--it was always the same story. Instead of golden palaces, there were grass huts and palm-leaf tents. Instead of silk-robed merchant princes, he found \\"Indians\\" who did not have so much as a shirt on their backs. When Columbus explored the West Indies in 1493,he heard tales of a fierce Indian tribe who literally devoured its defeated enemies after a battle. These people were called by many names in the area, including Calina, Canima, Carib, and Caniba. Columbus recorded the name of the American natives as Canibales in Spanish, a word which came to refer, within a few years, to any eater of human flesh. In the similar fashion, the word Caribbean, a title for the sea as well as for the region, came into English. At times Columbus knew that this new land was not China, not Japan, not the Spice Islands. He seemed to accept it as a part of the earth that the geographers of Europe had never heard of before. It was another world--and he called it exactly that--but Columbus also insisted until he died that land he had reached was an unknown part of Asia.  Answer: Columbus' voyagesExample Output: What is the best title for this text?Example Input: Article: For years I fought with the bird's nest that sat on top of my head-my Medusa  hair.No matter what I did and how hard I tried, in no way could I make my unruly  hair to my satisfaction. Growing up in a Russian-Jewish home with parents who thought North American styling products were something illegal such as drugs, I was never allowed to put them in my hair. \\"Why buy hair gel? Your hair is so beautiful naturally.\\" my mother would say.The teens at school did not agree.From boys' not wanting to kiss me when we played spin the bottle in Grade 7 to being called the mop, I suffered from my hair. When I got to university, I believed my hair was a wall that stood between me and everything---finding a part-time job, getting a boyfriend, etc. If only I could find a way to manage the curls and put it behind bars, I told myself, I would feel secure and sexy.I tried everything: rollers, hairspray, gels and, at one point, an iron.Then, in my second year, a miracle happened.I was asked to be a hair model for Japanese hair straightening, a process by which the molecules of my curls would be broken and reset in a bone-straight position.I was the perfect candidate, the hairdresser told me.Although they said how hair relaxing could damage the scalp  , for the next five years I didn't find them to be true. All of the hairdresser's promises were fulfilled: With my hair straight and smooth, I was no longer the \\" mop\\". However, there was extreme damage done to my wallet. To keep up the straightening cost  700 every six months, and that was considered cheap. While some people thought I was crazy, I was willing to do anything to never again feel like that anxious, curly-headed girl in Grade 7.But when I moved out of my parents' house at age 26 and rented an apartment, the upkeep of my new image became too costly. I couldn't hide from my inner Medusa any longer.It was time to hug her and let her fly.Seeking a choice, I turned to the Internet, Google.After hours of searching, I hit upon a \\"curly haired\\" salon, a place designed for girls like me. I doubted these so-called \\"Curl Ambassadors\\" could do anything without using machine of some sort, and though I bought the service called the \\"Curly-Doo\\", I suspected I'd have the same unruly mop at the end of the appointment. I dragged my feet so hard getting there that I arrived 45 minutes late.I secretly hoped they would turn me away.Instead, my stylist simply said: \\"You are very late.Let me see your hair\\". At that moment, my world and beliefs about myself were turned upside down along with my hair. As my head was in a basin full of freezing-cold water, then covered with a jelly-like jam, I wondered what I had got myself into. \\"Do you really think this will work?\\" I asked the stylist, Jones.\\" My curls are a disaster.\\" \\"No curly hair is hopeless,\\" she replied.\\"They just haven't found a way to work with it, that's all.\\" After the hour was over, Jones had completed her work.She had styled my hair using only her hands, water and a mixture of organic jam.I couldn't believe what I was seeing in the mirror: a naturally curly, Medusa-free me.You could argue that hair is just hair. Yet, it is just such physical features that have such a large influence on how we view ourselves. According to Jones,75 percent of the population have a wave or curl in their hair and don't know what to do with it.Men cut theirs short.Women flat-iron theirs to death.When I read through a beauty magazine or take the subway to work, it makes me sad to see so many people repressing their natural beauty. Since then, my world has changed.I have always been outgoing, but these days I seem to be more outspoken and confident than ever.On top of that, friends and co-workers tell me I am looking better than ever, but they don't know the source of the change. I don't need to tell them. My Medusa hair speaks for herself.  Answer: North American styling products harmed her hair.Example Output:","answer":"What can we learn about the writer's hair in the first place?"},{"question":"Someone expressing anger will shake their fists to do what?Options:- twerk- illustrate point- cool off- punch- write letterLet's think carefully first.

The bulb is supposed to put off a heat level that matches the same heat an animal laying on the floor would put off, but it produced very little heat. The glue on the trap was very sticky, and I'm sure a flea would have been stuck very well if a flea had been attracted enough to it to get stuck. I have used this for a month and caught absolutely nothing. The flea problem is gone fortunately, but that was done with a combination of bathing the animals, vacuuming every day, and using flea powers/flea sprays on the carpet and furniture.

Unfortunatley, that meant you could now waste four pieces of bread at a time, rather than only two. What a time saver. It is a wonderful example of horrible engineering and thoughtless design. If you set it on one, you get warm bread. Two gets is almost too toasted and when one of the kids turned it up to 9, the smoke alarms went off. It is basically useless unless you like to sit and baby-sit to pop it at just the right time. It also \\"roasted\\" inconsistently. NO matter what one edge of the bread always came out a little black. The design could use some work too. It is very wide if you put the long part against a wall.

Article: It is common for older people to forget things. Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds.

Article: Q My daughter is a junior in high school and has been on an individualized education program since fourth grade. She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has overcome. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? --Deborah AFirst let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/ SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found atfairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \\"Disclosing\\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially demonstrate, for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also demonstrate an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. --Ms. Kravis Question: What is Ms. Kravis' attitude toward one's declaring his/ her learning disability? - Supportive - Opposed - Doubtful - Unconcerned(Answer)SupportiveQues: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Article: When families gather for Christmas dinner, some will stick to formal traditions dating back to grandma's generation. Their tables will be set with the good dishes and silver, and the dress code will be Sunday best. But in many other homes, this china-and-silver elegance has given way to a stoneware   and stainless informality, with dresses assuming an equally casual-Friday look. For hosts and guests, the change means greater simplicity and comfort. For makers of fine china in Britain, it spells economic hard times. Last week _ , the largest employer in Stoke-on-Trent, announced that it is eliminating 1,000 jobs -- one-fifth of its total workforce. That brings to more than 4, 000 the number of positions lost in 18 months in the pottery   region. Wedgwood and other pottery factories made cuts earlier. Although a strong pound and weak markets in Asia play a role in the downsizing, the layoffs in Stoke have their roots in earthshaking social shifts. A spokesman for Royal Doulton admitted that the company \\"has been somewhat slow in catching up with the trend\\" toward casual dining. Families eat together less often, he explained, and more people eat alone, either because they are single or they eat in front of television. Even dinner parties, if they happen at all, have gone casual. In a time of long work hours and demanding family schedules, busy hosts insist, rightly, that it's better to share a takeout pizza on paper plates in the family room than to wait for the perfect moment or a \\"real\\" dinner party. Too often, the perfect moment never comes. Iron a fine-patterned tablecloth? Forget it. Polish the silver? Who has time? Yet the loss of formality has its down side. The fine points of etiquette   that children might once have learned at the table by observation or instruction from parents and grandparents (\\" Chew with your mouth closed.\\" \\"Keep your elbows off the table. \\") must be picked up else-where. Some companies now offer etiquette seminars for employees who may be able professionally but inexperienced socially.

Context_4 : Trench Town (also Trenchtown) is a neighborhood located in the parish of St. Andrew which shares municipality with Kingston, the capital and largest city of Jamaica. In the 1960s Trench Town was known as the Hollywood of Jamaica. Today Trench Town is the location of the Trench Town Culture Yard Museum, a National Heritage Site presenting the unique history and contribution of Trench Town to Jamaica. Trench Town is the birthplace of rocksteady and reggae music, as well as the home of reggae and Rastafari ambassador Bob Marley. The neighborhood gets its name from its previous designation as Trench Pen, 400 acres of land once used for livestock by Daniel Power Trench, an Irish immigrant of the 18th century (descendants of the Earls of Clancarty). The Trench family abandoned the land in the late 19th century. It is a common misconception that the name comes from the large open storm-water drain that runs through the neighbourhood in the middle of Collie Smith Drive. Trench Town is home to the communities of Wilton Gardens [Rema], Federal Gardens, Arnette Gardens [Jungle], Havana, Buckers and others. Trench Town today is also the home of two of Jamaica's top Premier League football club teams, Arnette Gardens and Boys' Town.

It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, an average of 200 km to the east of the Mariana Islands, in the Western Pacific East of Philippines. It is a crescent-shaped scar in the Earth's crust, and measures about 2550 km long and 69 km wide on average. It reaches a maximum-known depth of 10994 m (± 40 m ) at a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep, at its southern end, although some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at 11034 m . If Mount Everest were dropped into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over 1.6 km underwater. In 2009, Marianas Trench was established as a United States National Monument.

It is a common first name and surname among Muslims and Arab Christians, a derivative of the name Abraham or Avram from Judaism and Christianity in the Middle East. In Lebanon and Maghreb, Brahim is a common diminutive for the first name Ibrahim. Context_10 : Krischan and similar are surnames deriving from a German dialect of the word Christian. Alternative spellings include Krischon, Krizan, Kryschan, and Krishan. The Krischan surname is German in origin. The name is also used as a first name mostly in German speaking countries serving as a variant of the more common first name Christian. It is also speculated that the name is largely east German in origin considering the likelihood of Slavic influence in the spelling. Much of eastern Germany throughout history was at one point or another settled by Slavic tribes and the influence of Slavic languages becomes evident in various personal, place and surnames of the region. fact_1 :  The band consists of members Josh Ramsay (lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, pianist, songwriter, and occasional drummer), Matt Webb (lead guitarist and backing vocalist), Mike Ayley (bass guitarist and backing vocalist), and Ian Casselman (drummer, percussionist, and backing vocalist). fact_2 : Alice in Chains is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who then recruited bassist Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley. fact_3 :  Mike Starr was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez.

Product review: I have to take issue with those who would decry this book. I think it's truely a noteworthy addition to the JLA of today. I, for one, LOVE the depth and imagination that is going into today's comics. The Watchtower Era JLA is the pinicle of said depth. Just when I think they've pushed the philosophical and metaphysical boundaries to their limit, they push harder. This book, while not perfict (It doesn't quite fit on my shelf, for one) is a great example of the writing that has made this title what it is today. Much like The Matrix raised my expectations of special effects and Sci-Fi, so does today's JLA raise my expectations of a good comic book. Heaven's Ladder is a great book, with a lot of depth, good art work, and wonderful character interactions. This book really leaves you feeling good.

Anna is such a great character and it is east like her. It's like she's a rich girl but doesn't act like a rich girl. She has problems with her parents and with boys, and the guy that she likes the most just fell in love with her best friend. Then she moves from New York City to Beverly Hills, where the coolest girls in her new high school decide that they totally hate her. How they try to ruin her life is amazing to read. One bad thing after another happens to Anna, but she never gives in. What's also great about this book is that it is funny. I know that some other people here said how funny it is, but it really is. The book ends on a big question, so I just can't wait to buy the next one. Get yourself on the A-List by reading this book!

In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.Context_1 : Patrick Carey (1916 in London – 1996) is a British filmmaker. His mother, Mia Carey, was a well known actress at the Gate Theatre, Dublin. She starred in one of the first films of the newly set up Irish Film Society, \\"Manon's Acre\\", set in north Dublin. His brother was Denis Carey (actor). The family moved back to Ireland in 1923 when his father took up a government post in the Department of Finance. Carey became well known in the genre of short documentary films, with a lyrical gift for dramatic visualization of natural scenery: his two most well known films being \\"Yeats Country\\" (1965), exploring the relationship between the vision of poet W.B. Yeats and the landscape of Co. Sligo, and \\"Oisin\\" (1970) a film which focuses entirely on the imagery created by the natural world, without either words or music. Both films were nominated for an Academy Award In \\"Errigal\\" (1970) a brilliant weave of folklore and narrative is set against the stunning dominance of the Donegal mountains. Of \\"Errigal\\", Carey wrote 'The mountains are the characters in the story, the drama is in the battle of the elements. I have tried to convey the feeling of personality in a landscape, supported only by music and natural sounds'. Context_2 : Mother Carey is a supernatural figure personifying the cruel and threatening sea in the imagination of 18th- and 19th-century English-speaking sailors. She was a similar character to Davy Jones (who may be her husband). Context_3 : Seven \\"\\" core sets have been released since 2009: Magic 2010, Magic 2011, Magic 2012, Magic 2013, Magic 2014, Magic 2015, and Magic Origins. Unlike \\"10th Edition\\" and previous core sets, roughly half of each core set was entirely new cards. Beginning with \\"Magic 2010\\", Wizards decided to introduce new cards into the Core Set so that they could be relevant for both new players as well as veterans. Starting with \\"Magic 2011\\", core sets have included \\"returning mechanics\\", or non-evergreen keywords with cards printed in just one core set. All of these core sets were released in the summer of the year prior to the year in the title - for example, \\"Magic 2010\\" was released in 2009. Context_4 : Books of secrets were compilations of technical and medicinal recipes and magic formulae that began to be printed in the sixteenth century and were published continuously down to the eighteenth century. They constituted one of the most popular genres in early modern scientific publishing. The books of secrets contained hundreds of medical recipes, household hints, and technical recipes on metallurgy, alchemy, dyeing, making perfume, oil, incense, and cosmetics. The books of secrets supplied a great deal of practical information to an emerging new, middle-class readership, leading some historians to link them with the emerging secularistic values of the early modern period and to see them as contributing to the making of an ‘age of how-to.’ Context_5 : Mother Carey's Chickens is a novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin published in 1911 by Houghton Mifflin. Context_6 : Panic is a 2005 thriller by Jeff Abbott about an unsuspecting young documentary film maker, Evan, whose life is turned upside down when he realizes that his parents have been working as spies throughout their lives. One morning his mother phones him and asks him to come to her urgently, but when he arrives at her home she has just been murdered and he barely manages to escape with his life. Evan is suspected of having received from his mother a copy of a list of members and clients of a secret organisation called \\"The Deeps\\" and the chase is on. Evan must struggle through his mother's death and meets C.I.A. agents, cold-hearted killers, and double-crossers, and friends - trying to find his father, get his revenge on the people who murdered his mother, and uncover all the secrets about the lie he believed was his life. He also tries to save a lovely girl named Carrie whom he has recently met and fallen in love with, but doesn't know whose side she is on, \\"The Deeps\\" or the C.I.A. Context_7 : Sweetwater Creek is a novel by Anne Rivers Siddons. Published in 2005, it is the story of a girl named Emily who survives her mother's abandonment and her older brother's suicide. She finds purpose in training her father's spaniels and takes refuge in the magic of Sweetwater Creek. A new friend enters Emily's life in the person of Lulu, a troubled daughter of privilege whose secrets threaten to destroy Emily's beautiful new world. Context_8 : Secrets of Life is a 1956 American documentary film written and directed by James Algar. The documentary follows the changing world of nature, the sky, the sea, the sun, planets, insects and volcanic action. The documentary was released on November 6, 1956, by Buena Vista Distribution. Context_9 : Mother Carey's Chickens is a 1938 drama film starring Anne Shirley and Ruby Keeler. The film was directed by Rowland V. Lee and based upon a 1917 play by Kate Douglas Wiggin and Rachel Crothers, which in turn was adapted from Wiggins' novel of the same title. Context_10 : Summer Magic is a 1963 Walt Disney Productions film starring Hayley Mills, Burl Ives, and Dorothy McGuire in a story about a Boston widow and her children taking up residence in a small town in Maine.

At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers. She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week. Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week. After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","answer":"After one week, Susy has 100 + 40 = 140 followers. In the second week, Susy gains 40 / 2 = 20 new followers. In the third week, Susy gains 20 / 2 = 10 new followers. In total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140 + 20 + 10 = 170 total followers. After one week, Sarah has 50 + 90 = 140 followers. After the second week, Sarah gains 90 / 3 = 30 followers. After the third week, Sarah gains 30 / 3 = 10 followers. So, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140 + 30 + 10 = 180 total followers.

Review title: Disappointing in some ways Product review: Although we have a history of liking Boynton books, this was not very interesting for my child, age 2.5. This book has seven bedtime stories set up on two pages each. Each page spread is one story, somewhere between 16 and 20 lines of text. That's it, not much of a story. The rhymes are cute, but in two of the stories the rhyme seems very forced. The pictures, as always, are great. But the \\"stories\\" are more like nursery rhymes, an alternative to Mother Goose.What do we like about it? The tab system that lets my child count as we go through the book. She also recognized a couple of characters from the Going to Bed Book, which I think is a better bedtime Boynton book, in the pajamas page.I think if you've been reading more substantial story books, like Seuss or Sendak, or other classics, this is probably too elementary, unless you are still doing short books at night.

Your task is to summarize them.[EX Q]: GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) — A beloved priest who was killed in the Northern California city of Eureka was beaten to death with a wooden stake and a metal gutter pipe, his autopsy shows.    FILE - In this May 2012 file photo provided by Lynn Enemark shows the Rev. Eric Freed giving First Communion in St. Bernard Catholic Church in Eureka, Calif. Free was found slain New Year's Day in the... (Associated Press)    Humboldt County Coroner Dave Parris said Monday that investigators don't want to release more details of how the Rev. Eric Freed was beaten, pending further investigation.    But at his arraignment, Gary Lee Bullock, 44, of Humboldt County, was charged with murder with a special allegation of torture. He is also charged with burglary, arson and auto theft.    Bullock pleaded not guilty and bail was set at 1.2 million, according to court records.    \\"I don't think we have a clear motive we are willing to speak about at this point,\\" said Police Chief Andrew Mills. \\"There was significant evidence at the scene to suggest he tried to set the house on fire.\\"    Meanwhile, a funeral Mass was held Monday for Freed at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Eureka. Parishioner Lynn Enemark said more than 1,000 people filled the church to overflowing. Bishop Robert F. Vasa officiated, and priests from around California attended.    Authorities have said Bullock was released from jail on a disorderly conduct charge several hours before Freed was killed in the rectory at St. Bernard Catholic Church. The jail is near the church.    Mills said Bullock was visible on surveillance video from outside the church and rectory, and the attacker got inside the rectory by breaking a side window.    The slaying occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, Parris said. A more precise time of death must await further analysis of the evidence.    A passing security guard saw Bullock on church grounds at about 2 a.m. New Year's Day and called police. An officer confronted Bullock in front of the rectory, checked his jail papers, did a field sobriety test, and determined he was mentally competent to be in public, then directed him to a shelter several blocks away, police have said.    The security guard, who does not work for the church, saw Bullock again at about 3:30 a.m. and told him again to be on his way but did not call police again.    Freed's body was discovered when he didn't show up to say Mass the morning of New Year's Day.    Bullock was arrested Thursday by sheriff's deputies outside Garberville. Deputies said his stepfather was driving him to Garberville to turn himself in. ||||| EUREKA - One by one, hundreds approached Rev. Eric Freed's open casket to say their final good-byes.    White candles and poinsettias lined the alter in each of the three vigils that took place at St. Bernard Catholic Church on Sunday.    Freed was a man that meant so many things to so many people. He touched the lives of his parishioners at St. Bernard, his students and colleagues at Humboldt State University and an entire community.    For Eureka resident Willa Grant, Freed was helping her become Catholic. As a Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA) member, Freed taught Grant how to believe again.    \\"He renewed my faith in faith,\\" Grant said. \\"He was very joyous in his faith. He never did the Mass like someone reading a shopping list.\\"    Grant said Freed was never judgmental and helped make her everyday life better by letting go of anger - a lesson Freed preached about.    She also said Freed spoke a lot about breaking the divisions between people and religions.    \\"I felt that Father Eric not only welcomed my faith,\\" Grant said. \\"But he welcomed my doubts. And that's big.\\"    Many of the lives Freed touched were the students and his cohorts at HSU.    Sara Hart, taught with Freed for the last six years and spoke at the 4 p.m. vigil that included many of his students.    Hart said Freed was a great friend to her and her family and that he had impact on countless lives.    \\"He was one of those very rare people who has really learned to have the faith of a mustard seed,\\" Hart said. \\"And the impact of that is going to be with us for a long time.\\"    Bishop Robert Vasa of the Diocese of Santa Rosa, spoke at the 7:30 p.m. vigil.    Although Vasa did not assign Freed to St. Bernard's he got to know Freed when he visited Eureka.    Vasa recalled a time the two of them went to dinner and said that Freed's energy was obvious, immediately.    \\"He was so enamored with the Japanese culture and calligraphy. He couldn't help but turn over the place mat and say, 'Well this means this and this means this,'\\" Vasa said. \\"I can see how the Humboldt State students and the parishioners would just be affected in the best possible way by the contagious joy and enthusiasm for the Gospel.\\"    Freed was indeed enamored with the Japanese culture.    Dance Farrell, who knew Freed for eight years, said he would write his homilies in Japanese.    Freed's stole, which was draped over his casket, also contained embroidered Japanese characters.    At the 7:30 p.m. vigil, the Knights of Columbus - who traveled from numerous areas including local chapters, Fort Brag and Sacramento - made Freed an honorary fourth degree member.    In Freed's absence, Vasa said that Rev. Loren Allen will be returning to St. Bernard's beginning next weekend's Masses.    Freed was Allen's assistant and they worked with each other for three years.    \\"I wanted someone to come back who knew the place and the people,\\" Vasa said. \\"(Allen) can focus his energies on the people and work to help them move forward in a very difficult grief process. (The grief process) doesn't get completed today. It starts today.\\"    Freed's burial will be held today at 11:30 a.m. at Sacred Heart Church in Eureka. A reception at St. Bernard Church will follow the burial services at St. Bernard's Cemetery. Lorrie Reyes can be reached evenings at 707-441-0579 or lreyes@times-standard.com.

The singer, whose real name is Melanie Brown, is friends with Ivan and Ange, the adult children of Rwanda's 56-year-old president Paul Kagame. He has invited her and her three children to spend Christmas at his palace in East Africa.    But the Daily Mirror 'playing the role of the Grinch in Mel B's African Christmas fairytale' says there's a problem. Kagame \\"could face a war crimes trial\\" for allegedly arming Congo rebel group M23 which is said to have forced 140,000 people from their homes.    A \\"damning\\" report released by the UN last year suggested Kagame had supported the insurgents to the hilt. The document, which was leaked last October, said the Congolese rebels were receiving \\"direct military orders\\" from Rwanda's army chief and Kagame's defence minister.    Stephen Rapp, the head of the US war crimes office, has warned that Kagame \\"could be prosecuted for helping the insurgents carry out atrocities\\".    The Daily Telegraph says that Kagame has many friends in the West, but he divides opinion. He is widely considered to be \\"the most dynamic and effective leader in Africa today, and also ruthless, repressive and intolerant of criticism\\".    Kagame has strongly denied the allegation he aided M23 saying: \\"We are not supplying even one bullet. We have not and we will not\\".    It's unlikely that Mel B and her three children will be discussing any of these allegations over the Christmas turkey. She took to Twitter to express her excitement at her African adventure.    \\"Christmas is different every year,\\" she wrote. \\"Last year we were in Australia and it was lovely but this year we've decided to go to Rwanda. We've got this amazing trip planned and we're staying with the president, Paul Kagame.\\"    She added: \\"I know his son and daughter because they live in New York and they're adorable people. They invited us out there. \\"We will probably have our own Christmas in LA with stockings, presents and a big roast dinner, then we shall go off to spend time with the president.\\"    Blogger FleetStreetFox said Mel B's Christmas plans were the latest example of unwitting celebrities getting mixed up in politics.    Supermodel Naomi Campbell caused a storm when she revealed that Liberian dictator Charles Taylor had given her diamonds and Mariah Carey was widely criticised for singing for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, a son of the late Libyan dictator. · ||||| Get celebs updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

The former Spice Girl has been invited to stay with Rwandan president Paul Kagame, who could face a war crimes trial for allegedly arming Congo rebel group M23 – said to have forced 140,000 people to flee their homes.    Scary Spice Mel is friends with the 56-year-old’s grown up children Ivan and Ange, who asked her to their family palace in East Africa.    The mum-of-three said: “Christmas is different every year. Last year we were in Australia and it was lovely but this year we’ve decided to go to Rwanda. We’ve got this amazing trip planned and we’re staying with the ­president, Paul Kagame.    “I know his son and daughter because they live in New York and they’re adorable people. They invited us out there.    “We will probably have our own Christmas in LA with ­stockings, presents and a big roast dinner, then we shall go off to spend time with the president.    “I said to the kids do you want to go to Africa and see lions, tigers and bears, or stay at home and watch TV all day? It was a no brainer.”    Kagame has been praised for ­overhauling Rwanda’s economy, healthcare and ­education system since he became president in 2000.    (Photo: Reuters)    He previously commanded the rebel force which ended the country’s 1994 genocide.    But a damning UN report last year suggested the Rwandan military had supported M23.

His detergent pods come 39 to a pack. How many packs of detergent pods will he need to do a full year of laundry?Answer: He uses 3 detergent pods a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, so he uses 3 * 52 = 156. His detergent has 39 pods per pack and he needs 156 pods, so he will need 156 / 39 = 4 packs of detergent pods.

Half of them play basketball. Two-fifths play volleyball and one-tenth play both basketball and volleyball. How many students in this class do not play either game?A: Half of the students are playing basketball, which means 20 / 2 = 10 students play basketball. Two - fifths plays volleyball, which leaves us with 20 * 2 / 5 = 8 students. One - tenth play both games, which means 20 * 1 / 10 = 2 students. There are 10 + 8 = 18 students who play basketball or volleyball. Among these 18 students, 2 of them are playing both games, so that means 18 - 2 = 16 students play only one of the two games. So finally, 20 - 16 = 4 students do not play either game. The answer is 4.Question: Mehki is 10 years older than Jordyn. Jordyn's age is double Zrinka's age.

I think that the acting was good and Walken was a great fit in the roles like Chazz too. It may have lacked a little in the dramatics but overall the dialogue and the the poolhall atmosphere was portrayed nicely. If you are a huge pool buff or a huge pool movie buff, this may not be high on your list but still it is very well made and honestly could have been worse.

What's the combined age of the siblings?A: 240What is the step-by-step reasoning process?Step-by-step reasoning process: If Aaron is 15 years old, and his sister is 3 times as old as him, then the sister is 3 * 15 = 45 years old. Together, Aaron and his sister have a total age of 45 + 15 = 60 years. Henry is four times as old as the sister, meaning he is 45 * 4 = 180 years old. The three siblings together have a total age of 60 + 180 = 240 years.Consider the Q and A. Q: There are 24 toys in the box and ¼ of them are action figures. The remaining toys are all dolls.

According to several sources, including Jim Burt of the Giants, it began on October 28, 1984, when the Giants beat the Washington Redskins 37 -- 13, and Burt performed the action on Bill Parcells after being angry over the coach's treatment of him that week. Burt insisted that Harry Carson dumped the Gatorade on Parcells, because Carson was a favorite and would n't get in trouble. Former Chicago Bears defensive tackle Dan Hampton claims he invented the shower, also in 1984, when the Bears dunked Mike Ditka upon clinching the NFC Central -- but that took place a month later in November. The phenomenon gained national attention in the 1986 Giants season. Parcells was doused after 17 victories that season, culminating with Super Bowl XXI.Answer this question based on the passage: when did dumping gatorade on a coach start?Answer: The relevant information is: The tradition began with the New York Giants football team in the mid-1980s.

Your task is to summarize them.[Q]: This will appear next to all of your comments    This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| 06:40    Colombia is just waking up to the news of the Nobel peace prize for President Juan Manuel Santos. It comes as a surprise for many Colombians who believed his chances had been scuttled by the rejection of the peace deal his government had hammered out with Farc rebels after four years of talks in a referendum on 2 October.    According to Kristian Herbolzheimer, of peace consultancy Conciliation Resources, given the “toxic dynamic” of local politics after the referendum, the prize’s consequences domestically are “unpredictable”.    Critics of Santos had derided the president for allegedly being motivated by winning the Nobel prize in his search for peace in Colombia. Last night someone who voted no in the plebiscite told me she was happy because the result of the vote meant Santos wouldn’t get the prize.    Carlos Holmes Trujillo, a member of the opposition Democratic Centre party and the committee designated to search for a way out of the crisis, told local radio that the prize is “a well-deserved recognition by the international community of the efforts he has been making for peace”.    The former president Álvaro Uribe, who campaigned vehemently against the peace deal with the Farc and has been a constant critic of Santos, has been tweeting since 5am (11am UK time) but has made no mention of the peace prize for his arch-rival. Also no reaction yet from Farc leadership who are in Havana.    César Rodriguez Garavito, the director of Dejusticia, a Colombian thinktank, says the Nobel prize will boost efforts to reach a new peace deal. Those who led the campaign for rejecting the peace accord in last week’s referendum are in talks with the government to make changes to the agreement that will make it more palatable to the half of Colombian voters who rejected it.    “It doesn’t change the results of the plebiscite, but it reminds the parties that what is at stake is the end of the war, not political calculations,” said Garavito. “It’s a recognition of the titanic efforts to reach peace.” |||||[A]: Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has won this year's Nobel Peace Prize for what the Nobel Committee calls \\"his resolute efforts to bring the country's more than 50-year-long civil war to an end,\\" the AP reports. Santos and Rodrigo Londono, leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia left-wing rebel group, signed a historic deal late last month to end a 52-year conflict that had killed more than 220,000 people—only for voters to reject the deal in a shock referendum result the following week. A Nobel Committee spokeswoman said that despite the rejection, Santos \\"brought the bloody conflict significantly closer to a peaceful solution,\\" and the committee hopes the prize will help give him the strength to keep striving for peace. The Syrian White Helmets, volunteer rescue workers who operate in rebel-held areas of Syria, had been considered the favorite to win the prize, the Guardian reports. \\"Congratulations to the people and President of Columbia. We sincerely wish them peace,\\" the group tweeted.[Q]: Hans Bishop        In a phase I study that included 51 adult patients with ALL,1 the CR rate with JCAR015 was 77% in those with morphologic disease (n = 31) and 90% in those with minimal disease (n = 20).

More patients in the morphologic disease cohort experienced CRS compared with those in the minimal disease group (42% vs 5%). When CRS did occur, 12 patients received tocilizumab, 11 received steroids, and 10 received both.

After less than a week, the FDA has lifted a clinical hold placed on the phase II ROCKET study that is exploring the CAR T-cell therapy JCAR015 for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), according to a statement from the developer of the immunotherapy, Juno Therapeutics.The trial was placed on hold to address 3 deaths from cerebral edema that occurred following the addition of fludarabine as part of a preconditioning regimen given prior to JCAR015. Under the new protocol design, which was accepted and approved by the FDA, preconditioning will consist of cyclophosphamide alone.Two of the deaths that led to the pause occurred in early July, which triggered the hold, with the first incidence noted in May, although the cause of this event could not be determined. Quickly following the hold, Juno submitted plans to omit fludarabine to the FDA, along with a revised patient informed consent form, investigator brochure, and trial protocol along with a copy of information presented to the agency. Typically, the FDA reviews clinical trial changes within 30 days.Prior to the hold, JCAR015 had been granted an FDA breakthrough therapy designation for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. This designation was based upon early findings showing a high complete response (CR) rate with the CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. ||||| Immunotherapy is treatment that uses certain parts of a person’s immune system to fight diseases such as cancer. This can be done in a couple of ways:    Stimulating your own immune system to work harder or smarter to attack cancer cells    Giving you immune system components, such as man-made immune system proteins    Some types of immunotherapy are also sometimes called biologic therapy or biotherapy.    In the last few decades immunotherapy has become an important part of treating some types of cancer. Newer types of immune treatments are now being studied, and they’ll impact how we treat cancer in the future.    Immunotherapy includes treatments that work in different ways. Some boost the body’s immune system in a very general way. Others help train the immune system to attack cancer cells specifically.    Immunotherapy works better for some types of cancer than for others. It’s used by itself for some of these cancers, but for others it seems to work better when used with other types of treatment.    What the immune system does    Your immune system is a collection of organs, special cells, and substances that help protect you from infections and some other diseases. Immune cells and the substances they make travel through your body to protect it from germs that cause infections. They also help protect you from cancer in some ways.    The immune system keeps track of all of the substances normally found in the body. Any new substance that the immune system doesn’t recognize raises an alarm, causing the immune system to attack it. For example, germs contain substances such as certain proteins that are not normally found in the human body. The immune system sees these as “foreign” and attacks them. The immune response can destroy anything containing the foreign substance, such as germs or cancer cells.    The immune system has a tougher time targeting cancer cells, though. This is because cancer starts when cells become altered and start to grow out of control. The immune system doesn’t always recognize cancer cells as foreign.    Clearly there are limits on the immune system’s ability to fight cancer on its own, because many people with healthy immune systems still develop cancer. Sometimes the immune system doesn’t see the cancer cells as foreign because the cells aren’t different enough from normal cells. Sometimes the immune system recognizes the cancer cells, but the response might not be strong enough to destroy the cancer. Cancer cells themselves can also give off substances that keep the immune system in check.    To overcome this, researchers have found ways to help the immune system recognize cancer cells and strengthen its response so that it will destroy them.    Types of cancer immunotherapy    The main types of immunotherapy now being used to treat cancer include:    Monoclonal antibodies: These are man-made versions of immune system proteins. Antibodies can be very useful in treating cancer because they can be designed to attack a very specific part of a cancer cell. These are man-made versions of immune system proteins. Antibodies can be very useful in treating cancer because they can be designed to attack a very specific part of a cancer cell.    Immune checkpoint inhibitors: These drugs basically take the ‘brakes’ off the immune system, which helps it recognize and attack cancer cells.    Cancer vaccines: Vaccines are substances put into the body to start an immune response against certain diseases. We usually think of them as being given to healthy people to help prevent infections. But some vaccines can help prevent or treat cancer. Vaccines are substances put into the body to start an immune response against certain diseases.

Some of these are discussed in “What’s new in cancer immunotherapy research?” |||||     Stan Collender takes a work call while receiving an infusion of the immunotherapy drug pembroluzimab at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance in April. Collender is taking part in a national trial of the drug for patients with a rare skin cancer. (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center)    A new type of cancer drug designed to unleash the immune system is revolutionizing treatment for advanced melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. But some patients who initially respond to the therapy relapse, and researchers are anxious to figure out how and why the delayed resistance occurs.    \\"Does the immune system stop working, or does the cancer change so that it's no longer responding to the immune system?\\" said Antoni Ribas, director of the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program at the University of California at Los Angeles.    New research by Ribas and others, published online Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides some answers. The study, which outlines key mechanisms in how melanoma becomes resistant to immunotherapy, found that genetic changes in tumors allowed them to avoid recognition by the immune system or become less sensitive to its attacks.    \\"We are convinced that when late relapse occurs, it is the the tumor that has evolved and changed,\\" Ribas said. \\"Now we have to figure out: What do we do about it?\\"    The UCLA study involved 78 patients treated with pembrolizumab, the drug given to former president Jimmy Carter. Forty-two of the patients responded but 15 relapsed. Of those, four met the criteria for inclusion in the study.    The researchers, led by Ribas and Jesse Zaretsky, a doctoral student in Ribas's lab, analyzed pairs of tissue samples taken from the individuals before they started treatment and after they relapsed. While the genomes of the post-relapse tumors were very similar to those of their initial tumors, researchers found some significant changes that allowed the cancer to fight back.    [Immunotherapy drugs prove their mettle against an array of cancers]    In one case, a tumor had lost a gene called B2M, making it harder for T cells, the workhorses of the immune system, to recognize the cancer. In two other cases, genetic mutations in the tumors interfered with genes called JAK1 and JAK2, which limited the immune system's effectiveness in killing cancer cells.    The fourth patient's tissue didn't have those genetic alterations, which indicates other mechanisms of resistance may be discovered in the future, Zaretsky said.    Cancer's ability to mutate and become resistant to treatments isn't new; the disease has long frustrated patients and physicians by rendering chemotherapy and targeted drug therapies impotent. But researchers are now intensely interested in how such resistance develops against the new class of immunotherapy agents called checkpoint inhibitors. These treatments don't attack the tumors themselves but instead spur the body's own immune systems to go after the cancer.    The UCLA researchers acknowledged that the study was small and that tumor resistance requires much more study. By learning more about the mechanisms involved, they hope to figure out how to combine treatments to delay resistance or block it entirely.    \\"This is part of an evolving story to examine why some patients do not respond to [immunotherapy] drugs, or why some patients respond at the beginning and later relapse,\\" said Suzanne Topalian, director of the melanoma program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. \\"Treatment resistance is a key issue now. We really need to understand it to improve the impact of these drugs.\\"    About 30 to 50 percent of patients with advanced melanoma respond to checkpoint inhibitors, depending on whether they previously have been treated for their disease.    [Bloomberg, others give Hopkins big donation to research immunotherapy]    \\"We are at the start of a new field of study,\\" said Ribas, who was involved in the original trial for pembrolizumab, also known as Keytruda. The drug drew worldwide attention last December when Carter announced that all signs of his advanced melanoma had disappeared. He had been treated with surgery and radiation as well as the drug.    Keytruda, made by Merck, is similar to another immunotherapy drug, Opdivo, which is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Both block a protein called PD-1, which in turn allows the immune system to attack the tumors cancer.

But just a few days later, the agency gave Juno Therapeutics the green light to resume testing JCAR015 on leukemia patients. Such a re-evaluation often takes the FDA more than 30 days to complete, according to Quartz. So why did the process move so quickly for JCAR015? It could be because it's an immunotherapy drug, per Quartz. From the American Cancer Society: \\"Immunotherapy is treatment that uses certain parts of a person’s immune system to fight diseases.\\" And, Quartz notes, it's a promising new cancer treatment that has really taken off in the last five years. With JCAR015, white blood cells are removed from a patient, modified, and then re-injected so they can target cancer cells. Fifty-one patients participated in phase 1 of the JCAR015 study, which had a \\"complete response rate\\" (meaning no detectable cancer remains) of 77% to 90%, depending on the stage of a patient's disease, according to OncLive. The deaths, which occurred during phase 2, were caused by a reaction between JCAR015 and the chemotherapy drug fludarabine, which was given in combination with the JCAR015 and caused fatal brain swelling. Going forward, Juno will remove fludarabine from the trial. \\"Although we have experienced a setback … we are optimistic that we will achieve results comparable to those in the phase I trial,\\" says Juno CEO Hans Bishop, per OncLive. \\"These results should provide the basis for an accelerated approval.\\" Immunotherapy is being studied as a treatment for a variety of malignancies, including melanoma, lung cancer, and the type of oral cancer Poison drummer Rikki Rocket had. Promising as it may be, however, some cancers seem to evolve to outsmart immunotherapy, the Washington Post reports. (A new study says alcohol consumption can cause at least seven types of cancer.)[Q]: The Runaways    March 17, 2010    An all-girl rock band is named and trained by a rock manager of dubious sexuality, goes on the road, hits the charts, has a lesbian member and another who becomes a sex symbol, but crashes from drugs. This is the plot of a 1970 film named \\"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,\\" which inadvertently anticipated the saga of the Runaways five years later. Life follows art.    \\"The Runaways\\" tells the story of a hard-rock girl band that was created more or less out of thin air by a manager named Kim Fowley. His luck is that he started more or less accidentally with performers who were actually talented. Guitarists Joan Jett and Lita Ford are popular to this day, long after the expiration of their sell-by dates as jailbait. The lead singer, Cherie Currie, co-starred in the very good \\"Foxes\\" (1980) with Jodie Foster, had drug problems, rehabbed, and \\"today is a chain-saw artist living in the San Fernando Valley.\\" The ideal art form for any retired hard rocker.        The movie centers on the characters of Jett (Kristen Stewart), Currie (Dakota Fanning) and the manager Fowley (Michael Shannon). Jett was the original driving force, a Bowie fan who dreamed of forming her own band. Fowley, known in the music clubs of Sunset Strip as a manager on the prowl for young, cheap talent, told her to give it a shot, and paired her with Currie, whose essential quality is apparently that she was 15. That fit Fowley's concept of a jailbait band who would appeal because they seemed so young and so tough. He rehearses them in a derelict trailer in the Valley, writing their early hit \\"Cherry Bomb\\" on the spot.        Shannon is an actor of uncanny power. Oscar nominated for a role as an odd dinner guest in \\"Revolutionary Road\\" (2008), he was searing as he turned paranoid in William Friedkin's \\"Bug\\" (2006). Here he's an evil Svengali, who teaches rock 'n' roll as an assault on the audience; the girls must batter their fans into submission or admit they're losers. He's like a Marine drill sergeant: \\"Give me the girl. I'll give you back the man.\\" He converts Cherie, who begins by singing passively, into a snarling tigress.        The performance abilities of the Runaways won respect. The rest was promotion and publicity. The film covers the process with visuals over a great deal of music, which helps cover an underwritten script and many questions about the characters. We learn next to nothing about anyone's home life, except for Currie, who is provided with a runaway mother (Tatum O'Neal), a loyal but resentful sister (Riley Keough) and a dying, alcoholic father (Brett Cullen). Although this man's health is important in the plot, I don't recall us ever seeing him standing up or getting a clear look at his face.        So this isn't an in-depth biopic, even though it's based on Currie's 1989 autobiography. It's more of a quick overview of the creation, rise and fall of the Runaways, with slim character development, no extended dialogue scenes, and a whole lot of rock 'n' roll. Its interest comes from Shannon's fierce and sadistic training scenes as Kim Fowley, and from the intrinsic qualities of the performances by Stewart and Fanning, who bring more to their characters than the script provides.        Another new movie this week, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" from Sweden, has a role for a young, hostile computer hacker. Stewart has been mentioned for the inevitable Hollywood remake. Reviewing that movie, I doubted she could handle such a tough-as-nails character. Having seen her as Joan Jett, I think she possibly could.            Note: Many years ago, while I was standing at a luggage carousel at Heathrow Airport, I was approached by a friendly young woman. \\"I'm Joan Jett,\\" she told me. \\"I liked 'Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.'\\"        Just sayin'. ||||| The strength and beauty of \\"The Runaways\\" are that it tells the truth. It doesn't always tell the literal truth about the pioneering all-girl rock band, the Runaways, though it gets the basic facts and most of the details right. More crucially, it conveys precisely what it was like to be young in the mid-1970s, a peculiar juncture in American social history. Back then, there was an almost post-apocalyptic feeling in the air, that all norms had been tossed aside, that nothing mattered, that the whole country and the world had spun out of control.    Other films have attempted to convey this. Ang Lee's \\"The Ice Storm\\" got a piece of this feeling, but it couldn't get all of it. Its failure was that it was, in a sense, too good a movie, too artful. \\"The Runaways,\\" by contrast, is precisely the kind of gritty, seamy and occasionally awkward picture that the 1970s deserve. And in getting that one thing right - in capturing that strange combination of despair and frustrated energy - it gets everything right. It explains why kids needed rock 'n' roll, and why the Runaways still mean so much to those who remember them.    Based on \\"Neon Angel,\\" the memoir of lead singer Cherie Currie, \\"The Runaways\\" tells the story of the creation of the band, focusing mainly on Joan Jett, who became the group's rhythm guitarist and principal songwriter, and Currie, who was discovered by Jett and producer Kim Fowley at Los Angeles nightclub when she was 15. They liked her look (\\"a little Bowie, a little Bardot\\") and had no idea whether she could sing. She could.    To be a teenager can feel like being stuck in mud. The world is alive with promise and excitement, but you can't get to it. You have no power. But music gives the feeling of power, the illusion of it, and sometimes that's enough to keep you sane. Currie (Dakota Fanning) and Jett (Kristen Stewart) start off as rock-obsessed high school misfits, Currie with a falling-apart family and an obsession with David Bowie, and Jett with her leather gear and a dream of becoming a female rocker - of a variety that did not yet exist. \\"The Runaways\\" shows how rock 'n' roll can save your life and almost wreck it.    Jett done perfectly    The soundtrack includes artists that influenced the Runaways (such as Suzi Quatro), original Runaways recordings and live re-creations of Runaways songs, with Fanning singing lead vocals. It all sounds terrific, though it must be said that Fanning isn't half the singer Currie was. Where Fanning excels is in suggesting the misery and confusion under the assumed air of teenage cool, and the gradual loss of herself to all the pressures and the drugs. She becomes the prime whipping girl for Fowley, ably played by Michael Shannon as an almost demonic presence, part sadistic idiot, part rock 'n' roll seer.    Stewart, known mainly for mumbling and stumbling through the \\"Twilight\\" movies, is the revelation here. She has made a meticulous study of Jett - of her posture, her manner, her expressions, even in the way thoughts cross her eyes. And she has Jett's stage manner down, the way this seemingly shy person assumes total authority when she gets up to play. The visuals help - the costuming and art direction are spot-on.    Unlikely pair    At the heart of \\"The Runaways\\" is Fanning and Stewart and their portrait of an unlikely friendship between two very different teenage girls - a friendship that, for a time, becomes very close indeed. It's also a showbiz story, of one girl who just didn't want success bad enough, and another who recognized her chance and clung to it like a lifeline.    Some will complain, understandably, that \\"The Runaways\\" ultimately tells a downbeat story that drifts and fades into a diminuendo. It feels ungainly, as though something else - something big - should be happening. But no, the filmmaker knew exactly what she was doing: It just wouldn't be the '70s if it didn't leave audiences with a cocaine hangover.    This article appeared on page E - 1 of the San Francisco Chronicle ||||| Late in The Runaways, Michael Shannon’s cold-blooded Svengali Kim Fowley dismisses the seminal ’70s all-girl punk band of the title as nothing more than a failed conceptual project. Those are the bitter words of a star-maker cavalierly tossed aside by his own creation, but there’s an element of truth to them as well. Like the Sex Pistols, The Runaways combined raw punk anarchy and cynical commercial calculation. They were prefabricated yet authentic, the product of estrogen-fueled rage and a sleazy music-industry lifer intent on exploiting ripe teenage sexuality. There is a fascinating film to be made about Fowley’s slick commoditization of adolescent rebellion, but in her numbingly familiar feature-length debut, writer-director Floria Sigismondi apparently isn’t interested in Fowley so much as she is in giving rock ’n’ roll movie conventions a distaff spin.    A disturbingly precocious, scantily clad Dakota Fanning stars as Cherie Currie, a spooky David Bowie super-fan who more or less stumbles into a gig as the Runaways’ lead singer. The dead-eyed talent vacuum that is Kristen Stewart co-stars as Joan Jett, a snarling badass whose tomboy attitude and songwriting perfectly complemented Currie’s purring sex kitten onstage, on record, and in bed.    Yes, The Runaways is as filled with softcore underage lesbian sex as it is with rock-movie clichés, from the montage of rapid-fire ecstatic magazine and newspaper covers that take the group from obscurity to superstardom (in Japan, at least, where the locals have a weakness for young girls in tight pants) to the use of blurry, distorted visuals to convey Currie’s ever-deteriorating mental state during the proverbial nightmare descent into booze and pills. Shannon plays Fowley as the P.T. Barnum of the Sunset Strip, a prankish provocateur whose tough love for his protégés looks an awful lot like emotional and verbal abuse. Shannon gives the film an unpredictable, live-wire energy, but as it staggers into its third act, Shannon more or less disappears from the proceedings, and the film focuses intently on Currie (whose memoir inspired the film) and Jett (who executive-produced). The Runaways were the first major all-girl punk band. In honor of this distinction, they’re now the first major all-girl punk band to inspire a bleary, excessive, and altogether mediocre big-screen biography. ||||| \\"Come on, you filthy pussies, let's rock and roll.\\"    That trash talk is aimed at Kristen Stewart, 19, and Dakota Fanning, 16, stars of Twilight: New Moon, by Michael Shannon, in fierce, flamboyant form as evil-genius manager Kim Fowley. Kim is cursing the girls as members of the Runaways, a pioneering band of five jailbait rockers from broken homes that he wants to turn into the female Beatles.    Peter Travers reviews The Runaways in his weekly video podcast, \\"At the Movies With Peter Travers.\\"    Stewart gives as good as she gets. She's playing Joan Jett, 15, the shag-haired guitarist, singer and songwriter who co-founded the Runaways in 1975 and went on – after the L.A. band dissolved in 1979 – to achieve star status as a solo act. Fanning has it tougher as Cherie Currie, 15, a blond Valley girl molded by Kim into the band's lead singer and jerk-off fantasy. Cherie is so naive she almost breaks down. In a killer scene early in the film, written and directed by — music-video whiz Floria Sigismondi, Kim preps the girls for life in a man's game. Rehearsing in a crummy trailer, the girls are hit by bottles, cans, dirt and dog shit tossed by Kim and his toadies. Cherie is told to sell the sexual heat in a song Kim and Joan create for her: \\"Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom, I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb.\\"    The \\"Cherry Bomb\\" scene is a raunchy blast of rock history. And Fanning and Stewart, who do their own singing, seize the moment. As Kim tells Cherie the dirty secrets of rock, \\"Fuck you, fuck authority, I want an orgasm!\\" she shows him what a wild child can be.    Fanning scores a knockout. And Shannon, as the \\"Frankenstein motherfucker,\\" is a fireball of potent perversity. Sadly, The Runaways fades into dull predictability. Joan must wait for Cherie to screw up on drugs and sex (the make-out session between Stewart and Fanning is delicate to a fault) so she can step in and front the band. Stewart is just getting rolling when the movie ends. But face it, The Runaways is based on Neon Angel, Currie's 1989 memoir. She's the only one who gets a backstory.    Get more news, reviews and interviews from Peter Travers on The Travers Take.    The result is a walk on the wimp side. Guitarist Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) and drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) barely register in their own band. And Alia Shawkat shows up as an amalgam of Runaways bassists. Jett served as a producer, but the script never shows what drives her. What's left are colorful scenes of life on the road, especially in Japan, where the girls hit it big with a live album. But there's no sense of rock anarchy. Say what you will about the Runaways – they never played it safe. The movie does. |||||[A]:","answer":"Critics praise the performances in The Runaways, about Joan Jett's seminal '70s band, but whether the flick succeeds is up for debate. Some takes: \\"Say what you will about the Runaways,\\" Peter Travers writes in Rolling Stone, but \\"they never played it safe. The movie does.\\" He wants more out of the verboten relationship between Dakota Fanning's Cherie Currie and Kristen Stewart's Jett. Still, \\"Fanning scores a knockout.\\" The movie \\"gets everything right\\" about the decade's \\"strange combination of despair and desperate energy,\\" writes Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle. And Stewart \\"is the revelation here,\\" not Fanning. The highlight is Michael Shannon's \\"fierce and sadistic training scenes as Kim Fowley,\\" the group's \\"evil Svengali\\" manager, Roger Ebert writes in the Chicago Sun-Times. Granted, Stewart and Fanning \\"bring more to their characters than the script provides.\\" And there's \\"a whole lot of rock 'n' roll.\\" Beyond the \\"softcore underage lesbian sex,\\" there's not much to recommend, writes Nathan Rabin for the Onion AV Club. \\"The Runaways were the first major all-girl punk band.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.Let me give you an example: Context: Architecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend 'Venite Ad Me Omnes'. Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.  Question: To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?The answer to this example can be: Saint Bernadette SoubirousHere is why: This is the correct answer. Because the question is asking for the name of the person and following sentence from the passage answers it: It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858.OK. solve this:Context: On the basis of remarkable antitumor activity, programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab were approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in the second-line setting following progression on either CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or BRAF/MEK inhibitors (for BRAF mutated melanoma). Given hypothesized risk of triggering exacerbations of autoimmune diseases and/or chronic viral infections, clinical trials (including regulatory studies) evaluating checkpoint blocking antibodies PD-1 and CTLA-4 have excluded patients with autoimmune diseases, chronic hepatitis B/C virus (HBV/HCV), and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Herein, we describe two patients with advanced melanoma and concomitant HCV/HIV infections treated with PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. Patient 2 with HIV/HCV coinfection progressed after 2 doses of pembrolizumab. Patient 1 who had HCV alone was treated with pembrolizumab with initial partial response. HCV viral load remained stable after 9 cycles of pembrolizumab following which 12-week course of HCV-directed therapy was commenced, resulting in prompt reduction of HCV viral load below detectable levels. Response is ongoing and HCV viral load remains undetectable. In both patients, no significant toxicities were observed when pembrolizumab was initiated. We argue for the further investigation of checkpoint inhibition in cancer patients with underlying chronic viral infections in the context of carefully designed clinical trials.
