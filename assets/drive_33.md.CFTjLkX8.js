CNA number and length are linked to patient survival, suggesting clinical relevance. We have identified genes that tend to be mutated in samples that have few or many CNAs, which we term CONIM genes( COpy Number Instability Modulators). CONIM proteins cluster into a densely connected subnetwork of physical interactions and many of them are epigenetic modifiers. Therefore, we investigated how the epigenome of the tissue-of-origin influences the position of CNA breakpoints and the properties of the resulting CNAs. We found that the presence of heterochromatin in the tissue-of-origin contributes to the recurrence and length of CNAs in the respective cancer type.Introduction:Genomic alterations in cancer show considerable heterogeneity across different tumor types and even across patients with the same type of cancer. For point mutations, we are beginning to understand the determinants of this variation: the epigenomic profile of the tissue-of-origin highly influences local mutation rates along the chromosome( Schuster-Böckler and Lehner, 2012; Polak et al., 2015; Supek and Lehner, 2015), different mutagens induce characteristic mutational signatures( Alexandrov et al., 2013), and tissue-specific exposure to environmental factors affects the selection of mutations during tumourigenesis( Schaefer and Serrano, 2016). The driving forces behind copy number alterations( CNAs), that is, amplifications or deletions of genomic regions, are much less understood than the causes of point mutations. Furthermore, we do not know why some cancer types are associated with many CNAs and other types with only a few. This is partly due to the fact that CNAs tend to affect several genes at the same time[in the dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas( TCGA; http://cancergenome. nih. gov/) used in this analysis, 59 genes on average are affected by a single CNA]. Therefore, it is often difficult to tell whether, and on which of the genes in the amplified or deleted region, selection is acting. In addition, cancer samples usually carry a much lower number of CNAs( on average 46 CNAs in the patient samples considered in this study) than single nucleotide variants( SNVs; usually 10. 000s per cancer genome). The sparse number of CNAs hinders the detection of statistical associations between CNAs and genetic and epigenetic features, work that has previously been carried out for SNVs( Schuster-Böckler and Lehner, 2012; Polak et al., 2015; Supek and Lehner, 2015). Like other alterations, CNAs show a large variation in position, length and number across cancer types( Zack et al., 2013). Authors have reported that CNA breakpoints are preferentially located in close proximity to DNA-methylation-depleted G-quadruplex sequences( De and Michor, 2011). This suggests that DNA secondary structure contributes to the CNA distribution. In addition, CNAs that are close to telomeres are longer than those found in internal regions. This suggests that there are several different mechanisms of CNA generation( Zack et al., 2013). It has also been observed that DNA contact points in genome-wide chromosome conformation capture( HiC) proximity maps are more likely to become CNA breakpoints. Thus, the length distribution of CNAs reflects chromosomal interactions( Fudenberg et al., 2011). The observation that certain genes tend to be mutated in CNA-rich( TP53 and SPOP[Ciriello et al., 2013; Boysen et al., 2015]) or CNA-poor( CTCF and ARID1A[Ciriello et al., 2013]) cancers implies that, besides epigenetic factors, the genetic background of the cell influences CNA variation. Here, we make use of the wealth of cancer genomics data provided by TCGA, to understand how the genetic background influences the CNA count per sample. We identify mutations in genes that are statistically linked to the number of CNAs in cancer patients. We refer to the identified gene set as CONIM genes( COpy Number Instability Modulators; Figure 1A). The encoded proteins form a densely interacting network of epigenetic modifiers and DNA repair genes. To test whether this network is associated with the cancer-type-specific preference for CNAs in certain regions, we investigate how the chromatin organisation in the healthy tissue-of-origin relates to the occurrence of CNAs in cancer. 10. 7554/eLife. 16519. 003Figure 1. Mechanisms of CNA number modulation and clinical importance.( A) Schematic showing how CONIM gene mutations can result in a higher or lower CNA number.( B) We performed Kaplan-Meier statistics on data from lower grade glioma( LGG) patients with deviating CNA numbers and lengths. LGG patients with fewer CNAs have a significantly better survival prognosis as compared to patients with many CNAs.( C) LGG patients with shorter CNAs have a significantly better survival prognosis when compared to patients with longer CNAs. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 16519. 003Discussion:Here, we describe a new class of cancer-related genes: the CONIM genes. They are characterised by being associated with the amount of chromosomal gain or loss in a cancer cell, but only about 24% of these genes have previously been associated with cancer. Our study highlights their possible role as copy number instability modulators and suggests a mechanism for how they contribute to cancer development. Mutations in all but one of the CONIM genes are associated with a smaller number of CNAs. One explanation for this observation could be that mutations in CONIM genes tend to occur late during cancer development. This is supported by the low VAFs of CONIM genes that we observe in two cancer types. When many alterations have already been accumulated, high proliferation rates increase the risk of further damage which – at this point – would be detrimental to the cancer. The exception is TP53, which is associated with a higher number of CNAs when mutated. Inactivation of TP53 decreases sensitivity to apoptosis, and therefore more DNA damage( including CNAs) is tolerated. Previously, an inverse relation between the number of CNAs and the number of point mutations has been described( Ciriello et al., 2013), subdividing tumors into two groups: one CNA-rich and one mutation-rich. The CNA-rich group has been associated with recurrent mutations in TP53 and the mutation-rich( and CNA-depleted) group with mutations in ARID1A and CTCF. These three genes are also in our CONIM gene list. Several other studies investigated relations between point mutations and CNA numbers in single cancer types: a higher number of CNAs has been reported in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer( Boysen et al., 2015). Lower CNA numbers have been detected in CASP8-mutated oral squamous cell carcinoma( Pickering et al., 2013) and in CTNNB1-mutated endometrial cancer( Kandoth et al., 2013). Unlike CASP8 and CTNNB1, which are part of our CONIM list, SPOP did not pass our pan-cancer CNA enrichment filter criteria because the effect of SPOP on CNAs is highly cancer-type-specific. However, SPOP was recovered by our cancer-type-specific alternative detection pipeline( see Materials and methods). Our study goes beyond these previous studies by also considering the influence on CNA occurrence of the epigenome in the tissue from which the cancer originated. As the inverse relation between CNA and point mutations might affect the detection of CONIM genes, we apply different strategies to correct for this potential confounder( regressing out mutation rates, removing highly mutated samples and applying a mutation-number-matched permutation test). We found that the greater amount of CONIM genes associated with lower CNA number, the enrichment of epigenetic modifiers and the high connectivity can be reproduced with different CONIM gene detection pipelines. We also tested whether a gene that is associated with an elevated point mutation rate would automatically end up in our CONIM gene list due to the inverse relation between CNA and mutation counts. POLE has been described in the literature to cause a hypermutation phenotype when somatically mutated( Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013). We can confirm that samples with POLE mutations have higher point mutation counts as compared to randomly selected samples( carrying mutations in genes with similar mutation frequencies as POLE). However, we do not find a reduced number of CNAs in POLE mutated samples. The most strongly enriched pathway among CONIM genes is ATM-dependent DNA repair. ATM is required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in heterochromatic regions, a process which is characterised by slow repair kinetics( Goodarzi et al., 2010). ATM-mediated phosphorylation of KAP1( KRAB-associated protein 1) triggers local decondensation of heterochromatin and thereby facilitates efficient repair. This suggests that it is not only the amount of cellular heterochromatin but also the cell’s ability to decondense it that is important. Other studies have begun to investigate the causes of variation in the frequency of CNAs throughout the genome by comparing distributions of CNAs to those of genomic and epigenomic features( De and Michor, 2011; Fudenberg et al., 2011; Zack et al., 2013). These analyses have suggested, among other features, the involvement of chromatin formation in determining the distribution of CNAs. However, none of the previous studies have systematically compared tissue-of-origin chromatin conformation to cancer-type-specific recurrence of CNAs( in a similar manner as it has been done for epigenetic marks and point mutations[Polak et al., 2015]). Our study complements these previous efforts by showing that not just the distribution of SNVs but also the CNA breakpoint distribution seem to be influenced by local chromatin structure. Here, we establish a link between heterochromatin enrichment and the variation in CNA number, length, and position across cancer types. In accordance with other studies, density of chromatin( for example, differences in mechanical forces or exposure to mutagens resulting from the localisation of dense chromatin at the nuclear periphery[Misteli, 2007]) determines where CNAs occur or persist( the high degree of condensation might hinder the detection and repair of DNA damage[Peterson and Côté, 2004]). These factors are governed by the properties of the tissue-of-origin( which contribute to the variability in the number, length and distribution of CNAs over cancer types) and could be influenced by abnormal activity of epigenetic modifiers through mutation or differential expression( contributing to the variation on the patient-level). With respect to possible mechanisms of heterochromatin formation interruption, it is worth mentioning that CONIM genes encode rather more H3K9me3 ‘readers’ than ‘writers’. Interestingly, we found that the local epigenome not only impacts where a DNA breakpoint occurs but also the length of the resulting CNAs. CNAs originating from H3K9me3-enriched regions tend to be longer than those without neighboring H3K9me3 marks. This increased average length is probably due to the fact that a greater degree of packaging of the interphase genome into heterochromatin facilitates long-range contacts between distant parts of the DNA, which then serve as end points for CNAs. This interpretation is in agreement with the observation that the chromatin shapes the length distribution of CNAs( Fudenberg et al., 2011). It has previously been reported that CNAs originating from telomeres are longer than chromosome-internal CNAs( Zack et al., 2013). We found that breakpoints in H3K9me3-enriched regions are associated with longer CNAs than other breakpoints, independent of their positions with respect to the chromosome ends. As telomeres in fact form heterochromatin( Blasco, 2007), our findings might explain the previously observed position-dependent length differences. Regarding the link between cancer-type-specific CNA numbers or lengths and heterochromatin proportions in the corresponding tissue-of-origin, ovarian cancer may not follow the same trend as other cancer types due to very high mutation fractions in TP53( 94%[Lawrence et al., 2014]). In accordance with previous studies( Ciriello et al., 2013), we show that TP53 deficiency is strongly associated with high CNA numbers. More research needs to be done on the mechanistic details of CNA breakpoint generation by chromatin disorganisation. To this end, our study highlights several interesting candidate genes that could be valuable drug targets as our analyses suggest that CNA number and size are clinically relevant. In summary, our observations suggest that the epigenome impacts CNA occurrence in a tissue- and patient-specific manner. CNA breakpoints are overrepresented in heterochromatic regions, so the epigenome of the tissue from which a cancer originates has a large impact on where CNAs arise during carcinogenesis. In addition, we identified genes in which mutations are associated with differential CNA number and length. Interestingly, this gene set is enriched in chromatin-modifying genes, which could suggest that these genes influence CNA properties through chromatin modifications.","answer":"Cancer is a genetic disease that develops when a cell’s DNA becomes altered . There are several different types of DNA alterations and one that is frequently seen in cancer cells is known as a “copy number alteration” ( or CNA for short ) . These CNAs arise when breaks in the DNA are repaired incorrectly , leading to some pieces of DNA being multiplied while others are lost . Ultimately , CNAs contribute to cancer growth either by providing extra copies of genes that drive tumour development or by deleting genes that normally protect against cancer . However , it is not known why patients with some types of cancer tend to have more CNAs than others and why some DNA regions are particularly susceptible to this type of alteration . Cramer et al . asked whether cancer patients have any other genetic mutations that might be linked with having many or few CNAs . Analysing datasets from almost 6000 patients with 20 different types of cancer showed that mutations in several genes are linked to a higher or lower number of CNAs in patients . Cramer et al . called the proteins encoded by these genes “copy number instability modulators” ( or CONIMs for short ) . Further investigation revealed that several of these CONIM proteins can change the way DNA is packaged inside cells . Furthermore , many of the regions of DNA that are vulnerable to CNAs in cancer cells are tightly packaged within healthy cells . These data suggest that the three-dimensional arrangement of DNA in cells influences where CNAs occur . The next step following on from this work is to find out exactly how the CONIM proteins influence the formation of CNAs ."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Synthetic aperture radar interferometry is an imaging technique for measuring the topography of a surface, its changes over time, and other changes in the detailed characteristic of the surface. By exploiting the phase of the coherent radar signal, interferometry has transformed radar remote sensing from a largely interpretive science to a quantitative tool, with applications in cartography, geodesy, land cover characterization, and natural hazards. This paper reviews the techniques of interferometry, systems and limitations, and applications in a rapidly growing area of science and engineering. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) from Earth-orbiting spacecraft provides a new tool to map global topography and deformation of the Earth's surface. Radar images taken from slightly different viewing directions allow the construction of digital elevation models of meter-scale accuracy. These data sets aid in the analysis and interpretation of tectonic and volcanic landscapes. If the Earth's surface deformed between two radar image acquisitions, a map of the surface dis- placement with tens-of-meters resolution and subcentimeter accuracy can be con- structed.

As part of this discussion, we present a biased view of what constitutes best practices for use of InSAR observations in geodetic modeling. Finally, we provide a basic primer on the ties between different mission design parameters and their relationship to the character of the resulting observations. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used for Earth remote sensing for more than 30 years. It provides high-resolution, day-and-night and weather-independent images for a multitude of applications ranging from geoscience and climate change research, environmental and Earth system monitoring, 2-D and 3-D mapping, change detection, 4-D mapping (space and time), security-related applications up to planetary exploration. With the advances in radar technology and geo/bio-physical parameter inversion modeling in the 90s, using data from several airborne and spaceborne systems, a paradigm shift occurred from the development driven by the technology push to the user demand pull. Today, more than 15 spaceborne SAR systems are being operated for innumerous applications. This paper provides first a tutorial about the SAR principles and theory, followed by an overview of established techniques like polarimetry, interferometry and differential interferometry as well as of emerging techniques (e.g., polarimetric SAR interferometry, tomography and holographic tomography). Several application examples including the associated parameter inversion modeling are provided for each case. The paper also describes innovative technologies and concepts like digital beamforming, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and bi- and multi-static configurations which are suitable means to fulfill the increasing user requirements.

It also acts as a peripheral membrane protein, as does the L protein [51] , an activity that could play a role in its presumed, but not yet demonstrated function as matrix [52] . Until recently, it had not been appreciated that N has a wide variety of other activities, some of which can be linked, not only to fundamental requirements of replication, but also to the interference with an array of the intracellular processes of the normal cell. Thus, an interaction between the amino terminus of the hantavirus N protein and the cellular protein Daxx has been proposed, with the suggestion of potential pro-apoptotic consequences [51] . N is also reported to interact with actin microfilaments, and the SUMO-1 protein [53, 54] . Using reporter-gene based assays, Connie Schmaljohn and her colleagues have reported that Hantaan virus' nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B). The effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS [55] . In the cytoplasm of infected cells, N protein can be found in cellular P bodies where it sequesters and protects 5' caps. It may locate the caps through its interaction with DCP1, a key constituent of P bodies. During hantavirus infection, the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies, through their interaction with N and DCP1. The N protein demonstrates preferential protection of mRNAs engineered to prematurely terminate their encoded protein in comparison to native mRNAs [56] . N protein has been increasingly linked to viral replication and translation, sometimes in previously unanticipated ways. It is among a growing family of diverse viral proteins that can serve as a nonspecific -RNA chaperone‖, an activity that should facilitate the L polymerase's access to vRNA for transcription and replication, in that it can transiently dissociate misfolded RNA structures [57] . Some of N protein's effects on translation might not immediately be recognized to be adaptive in nature. It can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex, simultaneously presenting the ribosome with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eIF 4E, binding to the 43S pre-initiation complex as does eIF 4G, while replacing the helicase activity of eIF 4A, which is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure [56, 58] . These three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation. In P bodies, N protein's ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides, along with its activity in protecting capped RNAs from degradation likely facilitates the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation by L polymerase (-cap snatching‖). Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi [27] . The N proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions, and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that N tracks along microtubules but not with actin filaments [52] . The ultimate destination for N, for its assembly into viral particles is the Golgi, and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), also known as vesicular-tubular cluster [52] . A dominant negative inhibitor, dynamitin, associated with dynein-mediated transport, reduced N's accumulation in the Golgi. Later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to Old World hantaviruses such as HTNV, but that the New World hantavirus ANDV is instead associated with actin filaments [59] . However, recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the New World hantavirus SNV [60] . Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression ( Table 2 ). The pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is the topic of a continuously-updated review in the series UpToDate [61] . By the time symptoms appear in HCPS, both strong antiviral responses, and, for the more virulent viral genotypes, viral RNA can be detected in blood plasma or nucleated blood cells respectively [63, 64] . At least three studies have correlated plasma viral RNA with disease severity for HCPS and HFRS, suggesting that the replication of the virus plays an ongoing and real-time role in viral pathogenesis [65] [66] [67] . Several hallmark pathologic changes have been identified that occur in both HFRS and HCPS. A critical feature of both is a transient (~ 1-5 days) capillary leak involving the kidney and retroperitoneal space in HFRS and the lungs in HCPS. The resulting leakage is exudative in character, with chemical composition high in protein and resembling plasma. The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses. It is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. The virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia, a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections [62, 63] . By the time that secondary viremia emerges, the agents of the more severe forms of HFRS and HCPS have begun to achieve sufficient mass as to induce, through PAMP-PRR interactions and other means, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [64] . For HCPS, that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs, yet, for unknown reasons, spares the retroperitoneum and, in general, the kidney. In HFRS the situation is reversed, and yet it is often not appreciated that the expected preferential tissue tropism of HFRS-associated viruses and their HCPS-associated counterparts for the renal and pulmonary beds, respectively, is not as one would predict through the manifestations of the two diseases. Local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms, with those abnormalities sometimes culminating in shock and death. Yet it is not hypoxemia, due to the prominent pulmonary edema, that leads to death in most fatal cases of HCPS, but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators that leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome [64, 65] . It is tempting to speculate that mediators produced in the lung in connection with the inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in HCPS, a disadvantageous consequence of the close anatomic juxtaposition of the two organs. Thus, at least three classes of potential mechanisms, some overlapping and all certainly nonexclusive of the others, could be presumed to underlie the pathogenesis of HCPS. These include:(1) Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) with the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 [43] . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells [66] and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells [67] . (2) Direct viral effects. The observed correlation between viral load and disease severity leaves the possibility open that hantavirus particles or RNA can themselves have toxic effects on cells or on signaling. Some investigators have favored direct viral toxicity, acting through the inhibition of endothelial cell barrier function, as an explanation for much of the capillary leak, although there is widespread agreement that multiple mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis likely operate simultaneously in the affected patient [68] . A potentially important clue toward the mechanism by which hantavirus infections deplete blood platelets and, in some cases cause hemorrhagic manifestations, was advanced by the recent discovery that pathogenic hantaviruses are able to recruit platelets to adhere to endothelial cell surfaces, with β3 integrin used as a critical binding element [69] . (3) Pathogenic effects caused by the activities of specific viral macromolecules. We have reviewed some of the activities associated with the Gn, Gc and N, virally-encoded polypeptides in previous sections. Testing models of pathogenesis can be done more effectively when there is an animal model that mimics key aspects of the disease. There is no such model that closely mimics HFRS, but animal models exist for both the asymptomatic carriage of PUUV and SNV by their native carrier rodents, the bank vole Myodes glareolus and the deer mouse P. maniculatus; as well as a Syrian hamster model using ANDV or the related Maporal virus from Venezuela, for which an HCPS-mimetic disease is observed [70] [71] [72] [73] . The ANDV-Syrian hamster model has a number of features in common with the human disease, as well as some differences. Unlike the neurologic diseases that have been possible to elicit with HTNV, the hamster model for HCPS appears to be caused by capillary leak that results in pulmonary edema and the production of a pleural effusion with exudative characteristics. Typically the hamsters die between 11 and 14-d post-inoculation, reflecting a slightly accelerated incubation period in comparison to human infections. As with human HCPS, the microscopic examination of the lung reveals abundant fibrin deposition, thickened alveolar septa, and viral antigen expressed abundantly in the microvascular endothelium. ANDV-infected hamsters fitted with physiologic monitoring devices exhibited diminished pulse pressures, tachycardia, and hypotension that appear to closely mimic the shock that is believed to be the proximate cause of demise in patients who succumb to HCPS [65, 74] . Compared to the human disease, ANDV-infected hamsters exhibit exceptionally high titers of live ANDV in their tissues, with much of the viral replication occurring in hepatocytes, which are spared in the human disease. Titers of live ANDV in some cases exceed 10 8 /g, whereas hantavirus isolates from human tissues have been notoriously difficult to obtain. Despite the universal occurrence of mildly-elevated hepatic enzymes in patients with HCPS, hepatic enzymes do not appear to be present at elevated levels in the blood of diseased hamsters even immediately before death [75] . The protracted incubation period associated with hantavirus disease gives the host considerable time to mount a mature immune response against the virus. Thus, in contradistinction to infections of comparable severity and related symptomatology associated with arenaviruses and filoviruses, hantavirus infections of humans are associated with antibody responses of significant titer by the time symptoms commence. Despite this observation, it appears to be possible that natural variation in individual neutralizing antibody responses among patients with SNV infections can be linked to disease severity, suggesting that administration of antiviral antibodies could prove effective therapeutically [76] . In the case of ANDV infection, new evidence has emerged indicating that the apparent clearance of the virus from the blood does not result in the complete removal of antigenic stimulus by the virus, suggesting that the virus may persist, perhaps in some as-yet undetermined immunologically privileged site [77] . A role for T cell-mediated pathological responses in HFRS and HCPS has been the source of speculation for a variety of reasons. The severity of SNV-associated HCPS may have made it more apparent that the onset of pulmonary edema, tachycardia and hypertension seemed to be all but universally temporally associated with the appearance of a spectrum of highly-activated cells of the lymphoid lineage in the peripheral blood. Cells with a close morphologic similarity to these -immunoblasts‖ were detected in the congested, heavy lungs of patients who came to autopsy, as well as in lymphoid organs and in the portal triads [63, [78] [79] [80] . These observations led to speculation that some component of hantavirus pathogenesis could be linked to the appearance of antiviral T cells that could stimulate or contribute to the appearance of a -storm‖ of mediators and the associated capillary leak phenotype. Subsequent studies have borne out the expectation that a significant fraction of the immunoblast population in patients with HCPS are T cells with specificity for specific class I HLA-presented epitopes of viral antigens, including Gn, Gc and N [77, [81] [82] [83] . Presumably, the antiviral activities of such cells, manifested in part through their elaboration of mediators in the affected interstitium, can contribute to the endothelial/capillary leak that lies at the heart of hantavirus pathogenesis. Because early cases of HCPS often came to autopsy, it became possible to examine necropsied tissues for expression of cytokines. The study by Mori et al. (1999) revealed high relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-1, IL-6, providing evidence in favor of a -cytokine storm‖ model for pathogenesis [64] . The authors believed, based on the morphology of cytokine-secreting cells, that both monocytes and lymphocytes were contributing to the production of cytokines. That proinflammatory mediators are found in elevated levels in the plasma as well as the renal interstitium of patients with acute hantaviral illness has been recognized for some time as well [84, 85] . While diagnosis of HCPS as well as HFRS is best accomplished with IgM serology, in the acute stage of SNV infection, RT-PCR can also be used if blood cells or blood clot are used instead of plasma or serum, where sensitivity even using nested PCR primers drops to about 70% [86] [87] [88] . In a facility at which many cases of HCPS are treated, the University of New Mexico medical center in Albuquerque, a diagnostic service has long been offered in which the patient's hematologic findings are analyzed to establish the probability that a patient has HCPS.Question: As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments, what does the N-protein of hantavirus do?","answer":"it limits the access of the RNA to host nucleases"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a tractable system that encodes a single LSH/DDM1 homolog( NCU06306). We report that the Neurospora LSH/DDM1 enzyme is encoded by mutagen sensitive-30( mus-30), a locus identified in a genetic screen over 25 years ago. We show that MUS-30-deficient cells have normal DNA methylation, but are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. MUS-30 is a nuclear protein, consistent with its predicted role as a chromatin remodeling enzyme, and levels of MUS-30 are increased following DNA damage. MUS-30 co-purifies with Neurospora WDR76, a homolog of yeast Changed Mutation Rate-1 and mammalian WD40 repeat domain 76. Deletion of wdr76 rescued DNA damage-hypersensitivity of Δmus-30 strains, demonstrating that the MUS-30-WDR76 interaction is functionally important. DNA damage-sensitivity of Δmus-30 is partially suppressed by deletion of methyl adenine glycosylase-1, a component of the base excision repair machinery( BER); however, the rate of BER is not affected in Δmus-30 strains. We found that MUS-30-deficient cells are not defective for DSB repair, and we observed a negative genetic interaction between Δmus-30 and Δmei-3, the Neurospora RAD51 homolog required for homologous recombination. Together, our findings suggest that MUS-30, an LSH/DDM1 homolog, is required to prevent DNA damage arising from toxic base excision repair intermediates. Overall, our study provides important new information about the functions of the LSH/DDM1 family of enzymes.Introduction:Many chromatin-based processes require the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, which can alter local chromatin structure by repositioning, removing, or restructuring nucleosomes[1–3]. Mammalian LSH( Lymphoid-specific helicase; also known as HELLS, PASG, and SMARCA6) and Arabidopsis DDM1( Decreased DNA methylation 1) are the founding members of the LSH/DDM1 subfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers–one of 24 subfamilies that comprise the larger SNF2 enzyme family[4, 5]. In vitro, DDM1 is able to hydrolyze ATP and reposition nucleosomes on a short DNA template, demonstrating that the LSH/DDM1 subfamily includes bona fide chromatin remodeling enzymes[6]. Moreover, molecular and genetic studies have implicated LSH and DDM1 in a number of important cellular processes. Lsh was originally identified as lymphocyte-specific; however, the gene is ubiquitously expressed in mammals[7–9]. In particular, high levels of Lsh are found in proliferating cells, suggesting that the protein might function during DNA synthesis or cell division. Subsequent studies revealed that Lsh is essential for development. Mice bearing homozygous deletions of Lsh die within 24 hours of birth, reportedly due to a host of developmental defects[8, 10]. Additional studies in chimeric mice or with tissue explants revealed that LSH is essential for both male and female meiosis[11, 12], as well as for proliferation of T-lymphocytes[13]. Thus, LSH is essential for gametogenesis and for proper development of the immune system. Notably, LSH has also been implicated in cancer[7, 14–18]. An in-frame Lsh deletion in the putative catalytic domain is frequently identified in human leukemias[7], and transplantation of hematopoietic precursors from Lsh-/- mice produced abnormal hematopoiesis and elevated rates of erythroleukemia in recipients[14]. Despite its role in these important processes, the molecular functions of LSH are not well understood. Lsh mutant mice exhibit significantly reduced DNA methylation( 5mC) at many sites in the genome[19–26]. Similarly, Arabidopsis thaliana ddm1 mutants display reduced DNA methylation and developmental defects, suggesting that at least some LSH/DDM1 functions are conserved across eukaryotic kingdoms[27–33]. Recently, studies in both plants and animals have uncovered a role for LSH/DDM1 in maintenance of genome stability. Arabidopsis DDM1-deficient mutants are hypersensitive to a variety of DNA damaging agents, including MMS( methyl methanesulfonate)[34, 35]. Similarly, mammalian Lsh-/- cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage and are unable to mount a robust DNA damage response[36]. There is some controversy regarding the relationship between the DNA methylation and DNA damage phenotypes of LSH/DDM1-deficient cells. The DNA damage-sensitivity phenotype of ddm1 plants was proposed to be an indirect effect of DNA hypomethylation[35], whereas in animals, stable knockdown of Lsh in immortalized lung fibroblasts led to hypersensitivity to DNA damage before a reduction in DNA methylation levels was observed[36]. Notably, an LSH homolog was also implicated in genome maintenance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism that lacks DNA methylation. The yeast gene, named IRC5( Increased repair centers-5), was uncovered in a high throughput screen for deletion strains that accumulate spontaneous DNA repair foci[37]. Thus, LSH-family enzymes are important for genome stability in fungi, plants, and animals, but precisely how LSH/DDM1 homologs control DNA methylation or genome stability is not clear. LSH-family members are absent from several model systems including Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe[5], but the model fungus Neurospora crassa encodes a single LSH/DDM1 homolog( NCU06306; also called Chromatin Remodeling Factor 5)[5, 38]. N. crassa is a particularly attractive model for studies of chromatin structure and function because its complement of chromatin modifications and chromatin-associated proteins is similar to higher eukaryotes. For example, hallmarks of heterochromatin such as histone H3 lysine-9 methylation( H3K9me3), Heterochromatin protein-1 and DNA methylation are shared between Neurospora and higher eukaryotes, but are all absent from S. cerevisiae[39–42]. To gain insights into the functions of the LSH/DDM1 subfamily, we performed molecular, genetic and genomic analyses to investigate N. crassa NCU06306/CRF5. We found that this LSH/DDM1 homolog is not required for DNA methylation, but is essential for survival from DNA damage. ncu06306/crf5-1 is allelic to the previously described mutagen sensitive-30( mus-30). The encoded protein is localized to the nucleus and interacts with WDR76, a conserved WD40 domain-containing protein. Based on genetic interactions with known DNA repair components, we propose that the Neurospora LSH/DDM1 homolog functions to limit genome instability resulting from toxic base excision repair intermediates.Discussion:Chromatin remodelers can impact genome maintenance by regulating specific types of DNA repair, facilitating DNA replication, and enhancing propagation of DNA damage signals[3]. LSH/DDM1 homologs have been implicated in genome maintenance from yeast to humans, but how these proteins contribute to genome maintenance is not understood. Plant ddm1 mutants are hypersensitive γ-radiation, UV-light, and MMS[34, 35]. Similarly, Lsh-/- cells are hypersensitive to a number of DNA damaging agents and display muted induction of γH2A. X as well as diminished recruitment of γH2A. X-binding proteins following DNA damage. Based on these observations, it was concluded that LSH promotes efficient DSB repair.[36]. Our study provides additional evidence that LSH/DDM1 proteins are key regulators of genome stability and provides new insights into the role of an LSH/DDM1 family member in genome maintenance. We propose that N. crassa MUS-30 plays an important role in preventing genome instability when replication forks encounter toxic base excision repair intermediates. This idea is supported by our findings that: 1) deletion of mag-1 can partially rescue the MMS-sensitivity of Δmus-30 strains, 2) Δmus-30 and Δmei-3 interact genetically, 3) MUS-30 is not required for normal BER or DSB repair, and 4) MUS-30 interacts with WDR76. It is not known if other LSH/DDM1 enzymes in other systems act to maintain genome stability independently of DSB repair, but data from yeast and animals are compatible with the idea. A high throughput study in yeast found that irc5Δ strains accumulate spontaneous Rad52-GFP foci in the absence of exogenous DNA damage and exhibit elevated recombination rates with non-sister chromatids[37]. In animals, Lsh expression is highest in proliferating tissues and was correlated with the onset of S-phase[7–9, 13]. Moreover, Burrage and colleagues showed that DNA damage in LSH-deficient cells triggers normal cell cycle arrest, followed by rapid cell death once S-phase resumes[36]. Thus, it is possible that mammalian LSH and yeast Irc5 function during S-phase to prevent collapsed replication forks at specific types of DNA lesions. Our protein interaction studies provide additional evidence supporting a conserved role for LSH/DDM1 in different systems. We found that N. crassa MUS-30 interacts with a well conserved protein, WDR76. Not only is the WDR76 protein conserved in fungi and animals, its interaction with LSH/DDM1 family members appears to be conserved across species. Proteomic analysis of Cmr1, the yeast WDR76 homolog, identified Irc5p as a putative Cmr1-interacting protein[77]. In addition, while this manuscript was in preparation, it was reported that mammalian LSH co-purifies with WDR76[76]. Our observation that mus-30 and wdr76 interact genetically provides compelling evidence that physical interaction of MUS-30 and WDR76 is functionally important. Although the specific functions of WDR76 and its homologs are unknown, it was recently reported that both Cmr1 and mammalian WDR76 form DNA damage-dependent foci that are distinct from DSB repair centers[75, 76]. Thus, the interaction between WDR76 and MUS-30 provides additional evidence that MUS-30 is not directly involved in DSB repair. Interestingly, in the presence of the replication inhibitor HU, cmr1Δ exhibits positive genetic interactions with gene deletions of replication fork protection components[76]. We found a similar positive genetic interaction between mus-30 and wdr76 in the presence of MMS. These data could indicate that WDR76 somehow acts to destabilize stalled replication forks. Yeast Cmr1 localizes to a unique sub-nuclear compartment that was hypothesized to promote protein degradation, consistent with this possibility[76]. Alternatively, it was proposed that yeast Cmr1 negatively regulates the DNA damage response[76]. WDR76 may target MUS-30 and other components of the DNA damage response for degradation. Increased activity of other DNA repair components in the Δwdr76 strain could explain why the Δmus-30 phenotype is rescued by the wdr76 deletion. In plants and animals, LSH and DDM1 proteins have been extensively investigated for their role in regulating DNA methylation. It was suggested that changes in 5mC may lead to differential expression of DNA repair genes in A. thaliana ddm1 mutants[35]. In contrast, it was proposed that mammalian LSH controls DNA repair and DNA methylation through distinct mechanisms[36]. Indeed, knock down of Lsh-knockdown caused hypersensitivity to DNA damage prior to methylation loss, demonstrating that loss of DNA methylation is not indirectly responsible for the hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Here, we found normal DNA methylation levels in mus-30 strains by comprehensive MethylC-seq, clearly demonstrating that loss of 5mC does not drive DNA damage-sensitivity in Δmus-30 strains. It remains possible, however, that loss of DNA methylation in LSH/DDM1-deficient cells results in part from defective DNA repair functions. Future work is needed to fully understand how LSH/DDM1 family members function to regulate DNA methylation and contribute to genome stability.","answer":"Inside cells , eukaryotic DNA exists in a highly packaged structure called chromatin .

up shell may break out and the wind internal to the bubble may expand into the igm ( ( * ? ? ?* chevalier & clegg 1985 ) ) .many theoretical and observational studies have investigated the mechanical feedback from star formation and its efficiency in transfering energy and material to regions far removed from the site of star formation ( ( * ? ? ?* e.g. , de young & heckman 1994 ) ; ( * ? ? ?* suchkov et al . 1994 ) ; ( * ? ? ?* mac low & ferrara 1999 ) ; ( * ? ? ?* strickland & stevens 2000 ) ; ( * ? ? ?* heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) ; ( * ? ? ?* dahlem 1997 ) ; ( * ? ? ?* ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) ; ( * ? ? ?* cecil , bland -

formation - induced shocks is supported by observations of diffuse x  ray emission in the centers of all four galaxies . the shock ionized component is responsible for a small fraction , about 3%4% , of the total h@xmath9 luminosity ( table  [ tab1 ] , column  7 ) , but is spread over a significant fraction of the area covered by the h@xmath9 emission , about 15%25% .    the availability of multi  color ( uv  to i ) and h@xmath9 images allows us to place contraints on the characteristics of the ionizing stellar population , and , once coupled with models , on the expected amount of mechanical energy coming out of the starburst .the h@xmath9 luminosity predicted from the mechanical starburst output can then be compared with the _ observed _ h@xmath9 luminosity associated with shocks .the last column of table  [ tab1 ] shows the predicted - to - observed h@xmath9 luminosities from shocks , with the range marking starbursts of different durations , from 10  myr ( left - hand - side figure ) to 100  myr ( right - hand side figure ) . in this column , a figure smaller then 1 means that the starburst does not produce enough mechanical energy to account for the observed h@xmath9 luminosity of shocks , while a figure larger than 1 means the starburst can support the observed shock luminosity .    for the three dwarfs ,between 70% and 100% of the mechanical energy is deposited within the immediate surroundings of the starburst , roughly within the inner 0.21  kpc .furthermore , starbursts with durations shorter than @xmath030  myr do not produce enough mechanical energy to account for the observed h@xmath9 luminosity of shocks .it is worth reminding that we adopted a conservative criterion for identifying shocked gas in the galaxies , thus the limitation on the minimum duration of the starbursts is quite stringent .in addition , the result is independent of whether the parent galaxy is isolated or in interaction with other galaxies . since the vast majority of the starburst mechanical output is recovered in the immediate surroundings of the starburst itself , it is not unlikely that the shocks can trigger renewed star formation .this inference could help explain the long star formation timescales required by the high luminosity of the h@xmath9 emission associated with shocks , and the even longer timescales derived from the stellar population studies .for the giant spiral , only between 35% and 75% of the available mechanical output is recovered in the surrounding ism , for a variety of starburst conditions .thus , there are no restrictions on the current starburst coming from the characteristics of the shocked gas .in addition , the non  photoionized gas is located in two main bubbles , and there is a striking absence of extended features ( shells or filaments ) .this suggests a confined starburst .the characteristics of the stellar populations and ism in the starbursts of four nearby galaxies suggest a strong coupling between the starbursts and the surrounding ism .this is particularly true for the three dwarf galaxies in the sample . herethe amount of observed h@xmath9 luminosity associated with shocks corresponds to about 70%100% of the total mechanical output from the starbursts , and places a lower limit of about 30  myr to the duration of the starbursts ( i.e. , these can not be \` bursts ' ) .such large fractions of mechanical energy available in the immediate surroundings of starbursts may suggest triggered star formation as a mechanism to explain the long duration timescales inferred from stellar population studies ( @xmath15100300  myr ) , in the absence of direct , recent triggers .the author would like to thank the local organizing committee , and in particular thaisa storchi -

In particular, phonetic feedback is rare in speech enhancement research even though it includes valuable top-down information. We use the technique of mimic loss to provide phonetic feedback to an off-the-shelf enhancement system, and find gains in objective intelligibility scores on CHiME-4 data. This technique takes a frozen acoustic model trained on clean speech to provide valuable feedback to the enhancement model, even in the case where no parallel speech data is available. Our work is one of the first to show intelligibility improvement for neural enhancement systems without parallel speech data, and we show phonetic feedback can improve a state-of-the-art neural enhancement system trained with parallel speech data.IntroductionTypical speech enhancement techniques focus on local criteria for improving speech intelligibility and quality. Time-frequency prediction techniques use local spectral quality estimates as an objective function; time domain methods directly predict clean output with a potential spectral quality metric BIBREF0. Such techniques have been extremely successful in predicting a speech denoising function, but also require parallel clean and noisy speech for training. The trained systems implicitly learn the phonetic patterns of the speech signal in the coordinated output of time-domain or time-frequency units. However, our hypothesis is that directly providing phonetic feedback can be a powerful additional signal for speech enhancement. For example, many local metrics will be more attuned to high-energy regions of speech, but not all phones of a language carry equal energy in production (compare /v/ to /ae/).Our proxy for phonetic intelligibility is a frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) acoustic model trained on clean speech; the loss functions we incorporate into training encourage the speech enhancement system to produce output that is interpretable to a fixed acoustic model as clean speech, by making the output of the acoustic model mimic its behavior under clean speech. This mimic loss BIBREF1 provides key linguistic insights to the enhancement model about what a recognizable phoneme looks like.When no parallel data is available, but transcripts are available, a loss is easily computed against hard senone labels and backpropagated to the enhancement model trained from scratch. Since the clean acoustic model is frozen, the only way for the enhancement model to improve the loss is to make a signal that is more recognizable to the acoustic model. The improvement by this model demonstrates the power of phonetic feedback; very few neural enhancement techniques until now have been able to achieve improvements without parallel data.When parallel data is available, mimic loss works by comparing the outputs of the acoustic model on clean speech with the outputs of the acoustic model on denoised speech. This is a more informative loss than the loss against hard senone labels, and is complimentary to local losses. We show that mimic loss can be applied to an off-the-shelf enhancement system and gives an improvement in intelligibility scores. Our technique is agnostic to the enhancement system as long as it is differentiably trainable.Mimic loss has previously improved performance on robust ASR tasks BIBREF1, but has not yet demonstrated success at enhancement metrics, and has not been used in a non-parallel setting. We seek to demonstrate these advantages here:We show that using hard targets in the mimic loss framework leads to improvements in objective intelligibility metrics when no parallel data is available.We show that when parallel data is available, training the state-of-the-art method with mimic loss improves objective intelligibility metrics.Related WorkSpeech enhancement is a rich field of work with a huge variety of techniques. Spectral feature based enhancement systems have focused on masking approaches BIBREF2, and have gained popularity with deep learning techniques BIBREF3 for ideal ratio mask and ideal binary mask estimation BIBREF4.Related Work ::: Perceptual LossPerceptual losses are a form of knowledge transfer BIBREF5, which is defined as the technique of adding auxiliary information at train time, to better inform the trained model. The first perceptual loss was introduced for the task of style transfer BIBREF6. These losses depends on a pre-trained network that can disentangle relevant factors. Two examples are fed through the network to generate a loss at a high level of the network. In style transfer, the perceptual loss ensures that the high-level contents of an image remain the same, while allowing the texture of the image to change.For speech-related tasks a perceptual loss has been used to denoise time-domain speech data BIBREF7, where the loss was called a \\"deep feature loss\\". The perceiving network was trained for acoustic environment detection and domestic audio tagging. The clean and denoised signals are both fed to this network, and a loss is computed at a higher level.Perceptual loss has also been used for spectral-domain data, in the mimic loss framework. This has been used for spectral mapping for robust ASR in BIBREF1 and BIBREF8. The perceiving network in this case is an acoustic model trained with senone targets. Clean and denoised spectral features are fed through the acoustic model, and a loss is computed from the outputs of the network. These works did not evaluate mimic loss for speech enhancement, nor did they develop the framework for use without parallel data.Related Work ::: Enhancement Without Parallel DataOne approach for enhancement without parallel data introduces an adversarial loss to generate realistic masks BIBREF9. However, this work is only evaluated for ASR performance, and not speech enhancement performance.For the related task of voice conversion, a sparse representation was used by BIBREF10 to do conversion without parallel data. This wasn't evaluated on enhancement metrics or ASR metrics, but would prove an interesting approach.Several recent works have investigated jointly training the acoustic model with a masking speech enhancement model BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13, but these works did not evaluate their system on speech enhancement metrics. Indeed, our internal experiments show that without access to the clean data, joint training severely harms performance on these metrics.Mimic Loss for EnhancementAs noted before, we build on the work by Pandey and Wang that denoises the speech signal in the time domain, but computes a mapping loss on the spectral magnitudes of the clean and denoised speech samples. This is possible because the STFT operation for computing the spectral features is fully differentiable. This framework for enhancement lends itself to other spectral processing techniques, such as mimic loss.In order to train this off-the-shelf denoiser using the mimic loss objective, we first train an acoustic model on clean spectral magnitudes. The training objective for this model is cross-entropy loss against hard senone targets. Crucially, the weights of the acoustic model are frozen during the training of the enhancement model. This prevents passing information from enhancement model to acoustic model in a manner other than by producing a signal that behaves like clean speech. This is in contrast to joint training, where the weights of the acoustic model are updated at the same time as the denoising model weights, which usually leads to a degradation in enhancement metrics.Without parallel speech examples, we apply the mimic loss framework by using hard senone targets instead of soft targets. The loss against these hard targets is cross-entropy loss (L_{CE}). The senone labels can be gathered from a hard alignment of the transcripts with the noisy or denoised features; the process does not require clean speech samples. Since this method only has access to phone alignments and not clean spectra, we do not expect it to improve the speech quality, but expect it to improve intelligibility.We also ran experiments on different formats for the mimic loss when parallel data is available. Setting the mapping losses to be L_1 was determined to be most effective by Pandey and Wang. For the mimic loss, we tried both teacher-student learning with L_1 and L_2 losses, and knowledge-distillation with various temperature parameters on the softmax outputs. We found that using L_1 loss on the pre-softmax outputs performed the best, likely due to the fact that the other losses are also L_1. When the loss types are different, one loss type usually comes to dominate, but each loss serves an important purpose here.We provide an example of the effects of mimic loss, both with and without parallel data, by showing the log-mel filterbank features, seen in Figure FIGREF6. A set of relatively high-frequency and low-magnitude features is seen in the highlighted portion of the features. Since local metrics tend to emphasize regions of high energy differences, they miss this important phonetic information. However, in the mimic-loss-trained systems, this information is retained.ExperimentsFor all experiments, we use the CHiME-4 corpus, a popular corpus for robust ASR experiments, though it has not often been used for enhancement experiments. During training, we randomly select a channel for each example each epoch, and we evaluate our enhancement results on channel 5 of et05.Before training the enhancement system, we train the acoustic model used for mimic loss on the clean spectral magnitudes available in CHiME-4. Our architecture is a Wide-ResNet-inspired model, that takes a whole utterance and produces a posterior over each frame. The model has 4 blocks of 3 layers, where the blocks have 128, 256, 512, 1024 filters respectively. The first layer of each block has a stride of 2, down-sampling the input. After the convolutional layers, the filters are divided into 16 parts, and each part is fed to a fully-connected layer, so the number of output posterior vectors is the same as the input frames. This is an utterance-level version of the model in BIBREF8.In the case of parallel data, the best results were obtained by training the network for only a few epochs (we used 5). However, when using hard targets, we achieved better results from using the fully-converged network. We suspect that the outputs of the converged network more closely reflect the one-hot nature of the senone labels, which makes training easier for the enhancement model when hard targets are used. On the other hand, only lightly training the acoustic model generates softer targets when parallel data is available.For our enhancement model, we began with the state-of-the-art framework introduced by Pandey and Wang in BIBREF0, called AECNN. We reproduce the architecture of their system, replacing the PReLU activations with leaky ReLU activations, since the performance is similar, but the leaky ReLU network has fewer parameters.Experiments ::: Without parallel dataWe first train this network without the use of parallel data, using only the senone targets, and starting from random weights in the AECNN. In Table TABREF8 we see results for enhancement without parallel data: the cross-entropy loss with senone targets given a frozen clean-speech network is enough to improve eSTOI by 4.3 points. This is a surprising improvement in intelligibility given the lack of parallel data, and demonstrates that phonetic information alone is powerful enough to provide improvements to speech intelligibility metrics. The degradation in SI-SDR performance, a measure of speech quality, is expected, given that the denoising model does not have access to clean data, and may corrupt the phase.We compare also against joint training of the enhancement model with the acoustic model. This is a common technique for robust ASR, but has not been evaluated for enhancement. With the hard targets, joint training performs poorly on enhancement, due to co-adaptation of the enhancement and acoustic model networks. Freezing the acoustic model network is critical since it requires the enhancement model to produce speech the acoustic model sees as “clean.”Experiments ::: With parallel dataIn addition to the setting without any parallel data, we show results given parallel data. In Table TABREF10 we demonstrate that training the AECNN framework with mimic loss improves intelligibility over both the model trained with only time-domain loss (AECNN-T), as well as the model trained with both time-domain and spectral-domain losses (AECNN-T-SM). We only see a small improvement in the SI-SDR, likely due to the fact that the mimic loss technique is designed to improve the recognizablity of the results. In fact, seeing any improvement in SI-SDR at all is a surprising result.We also compare against joint training with an identical setup to the mimic setup (i.e. a combination of three losses: teacher-student loss against the clean outputs, spectral magnitude loss, and time-domain loss). The jointly trained acoustic model is initialized with the weights of the system trained on clean speech. We find that joint training performs much better on the enhancement metrics in this setup, though still not quite as well as the mimic setup. Compared to the previous experiment without parallel data, the presence of the spectral magnitude and time-domain losses likely keep the enhancement output more stable when joint training, at the cost of requiring parallel training data.ConclusionWe have shown that phonetic feedback is valuable for speech enhancement systems. In addition, we show that our approach to this feedback, the mimic loss framework, is useful in many scenarios: with and without the presence of parallel data, in both the enhancement and robust ASR scenarios. Using this framework, we show improvement on a state-of-the-art model for speech enhancement. The methodology is agnostic to the enhancement technique, so may be applicable to other differentiably trained enhancement modules.In the future, we hope to address the reduction in speech quality scores when training without parallel data. One approach may be to add a GAN loss to the denoised time-domain signal, which may help with introduced distortions. In addition, we could soften the cross-entropy loss to an L_1 loss by generating \\"prototypical\\" posterior distributions for each senone, averaged across the training dataset. Mimic loss as a framework allows for a rich space of future possibilities. To that end, we have made our code available at http://github.com/OSU-slatelab/mimic-enhance.Fig. 1. Operations are listed inside shapes, the circles are operations that are not parameterized, the rectangles represent parameterized operations. The gray operations are not trained, meaning the loss is backpropagated without any updates until the front-end denoiser is reached.Fig. 2.

Approximately 12 % of CRCs are characterized by microsatellite instability ( MSI ) , a hallmark of a DNA mismatch repair defect . We investigated the safety of adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy for MSI(+ ) CRC and compared the prognosis of MSI(+ ) and MSI(- ) CRC patients receiving adjuvant therapy . METHODS Previously , a prospect i ve series consisting of 1044 consecutive CRCs has been collected and the MSI status of each sample determined . Patients with stage C cancer who had received adjuvant chemotherapy ( n = 95 ) were followed up for 7 - 63 months ( median , 31 months ) after surgery . RESULTS No unexpected or serious adverse effects were observed when 5-FU-based chemotherapy was used as adjuvant treatment for MSI(+ ) CRC . Three- year recurrence-free survival was 90 % and 43 % in the MSI(+ ) ( n = 11 ) and MSI(- ) ( n = 84 ) groups , respectively ( P = 0.020 ) . CONCLUSIONS Adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy is feasible for both MSI(+ ) and MSI(- ) CRCs , and patients with MSI(+ ) CRC who receive adjuvant therapy have an excellent prognosisTitle 2:Value of mismatch repair, KRAS, and BRAF mutations in predicting recurrence and benefits from chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.Abstract 2:PURPOSE It is uncertain whether modest benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colorectal cancer justify the toxicity , cost , and inconvenience . We investigated the usefulness of defective mismatch repair ( dMMR ) , BRAF , and KRAS mutations in predicting tumor recurrence and sensitivity to chemotherapy . PATIENTS AND METHODS Immunohistochemistry for dMMR and pyrosequencing for KRAS/BRAF were performed for 1,913 patients r and omly assigned between fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy and no chemotherapy  in the Quick and Simple and Reliable ( QUASAR ) trial . RESULTS Twenty-six percent of 695 right-sided colon , 3 % of 685 left-sided colon , and 1 % of 407 rectal tumors were dMMR . Similarly , 17 % of right colon , 2 % of left colon , and 2 % of rectal tumors were BRAF mutant . KRAS mutant tumors were more evenly distributed : 40 % right colon , 28 % left colon , and 36 % rectal tumors . Recurrence rate for dMMR tumors was half that for MMR-proficient tumors ( 11 % [ 25 of 218 ] v 26 % [ 438 of 1,695 ] recurred ; risk ratio [ RR ] , 0.53 ; 95 % CI , 0.40 to 0.70 ; P < .001 ) . Risk of recurrence was also significantly higher for KRAS mutant than KRAS wild-type tumors ( 28 % [ 150 of 542 ] v 21 % [ 219 of 1,041 ] ; RR , 1.40 ; 95 % CI , 1.12 to 1.74 ; P = .002 ) but did not differ significantly between BRAF mutant and wild-type tumors ( P = .36 ) . No marker predicted benefit from chemotherapy with efficacy not differing significantly by MMR , KRAS , or BRAF status . The prognostic value of MMR and KRAS was similar in the presence and absence of chemotherapy . CONCLUSION MMR assays identify patients with a low risk of recurrence . KRAS mutational analysis provides useful additional risk stratification to guide use of chemotherapyTitle 3:Microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity at chromosomal location 18q: prospective evaluation of biomarkers for stages II and III colon cancer--a study of CALGB 9581 and 89803.Abstract 3:PURPOSE Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) develops as a result of a series of accumulated genomic changes that produce oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene loss . These characteristics may classify CRC into subsets of distinct clinical behaviors . PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied two of these genomic defects-mismatch repair deficiency ( MMR-D ) and loss of heterozygosity  at chromosomal location 18q (18qLOH)-in patients enrolled onto two phase III cooperative group trials for treatment of potentially curable colon cancer . These trials included prospect i ve secondary analyses to determine the relationship between these markers and treatment outcome . A total of 1,852 patients were tested for MMR status and 955 ( excluding patients with MMR-D tumors ) for 18qLOH .  RESULTS Compared with stage III , more stage II tumors were MMR-D ( 21.3 % v 14.4 % ; P < .001 ) and were intact at 18q ( 24.2 % v 15.1 % ; P = .001 ) . For the combined cohort , patients with MMR-D tumors had better 5-year disease-free survival ( DFS ; 0.76 v 0.67 ; P < .001 ) and overall survival ( OS ; 0.81 v 0.78 ; P = .029 ) than those with MMR intact ( MMR-I ) tumors . Among patients with MMR-I tumors , the status of 18q did not affect outcome , with 5-year values for patients with 18q intact versus 18qLOH tumors of 0.74 versus 0.65 ( P = .18 ) for DFS and 0.81 versus 0.77 ( P = .18 ) for OS . CONCLUSION We conclude that MMR-D tumor status , but not the presence of 18qLOH , has prognostic value for stages II and III colon cancerTitle 4:Prognostic and predictive roles of high-degree microsatellite instability in colon cancer: a National Cancer Institute-National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Collaborative Study.Abstract 4:PURPOSE The role of high-degree microsatellite instability ( MSI-H ) as a marker to predict benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear . PATIENTS AND METHODS To help define its impact , we conducted an analysis of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ( NSABP ) patients who were r and omly assigned to a surgery-alone group ( untreated cohort ) and patients assigned to an adjuvant fluorouracil ( FU ) -treated group ( treated cohort ) .  MSI-H and other potential markers were assessed ( TGF-BRII , p53 , thymidylate synthase , and Ki67 ) . RESULTS In all , 98 ( 18.1 % ) of 542 patients exhibited MSI-H , and there was a strong inverse relationship between MSI-H and mutant p53 status ( P < .001 ) . The prognostic analyses showed increased recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) for MSI-H patients versus MSS/MSI-L patients ( P = .10 ) , but showed no difference in overall survival ( OS ; P = .67 ) . There was a potential interaction between MSI-H and mutant p53 in terms of improved RFS ( P = .03 ) . In the predictive marker analysis , we observed no interaction between MSI status and treatment for either RFS ( P = .68 ) or OS ( P = .62 ) . Hazard ratios ( HR ) for RFS for MSI-H versus MSS/MSI-L patients were 0.77 ( 95 % CI , 0.40 to 1.48 ) in the untreated- patients group and 0.60 ( 95 % CI , 0.30 to 1.19 ) in the treated- patients group . HRs for OS were 0.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.44 to 1.51 ) and 1.02 ( 95 % CI , 0.56 to 1.85 ) for the respective groups . There was a trend toward improved RFS in patients with MSI-H and mutant p53 . CONCLUSION These results do not support the use of MSI-H as a predictive marker of chemotherapy benefitTitle 5:Defective mismatch repair as a predictive marker for lack of efficacy of fluorouracil-based adjuvant therapy in colon cancer.Abstract 5:PURPOSE Prior reports have indicated that patients with colon cancer who demonstrate high-level microsatellite instability ( MSI-H ) or defective DNA mismatch repair ( dMMR ) have improved survival and receive no benefit from fluorouracil ( FU ) -based adjuvant therapy compared with patients who have microsatellite-stable or proficient mismatch repair ( pMMR ) tumors . We examined MMR status as a predictor of adjuvant therapy benefit in patients with stages II and III colon cancer . METHODS MSI assay or immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins were performed on 457 patients who were previously r and omly assigned to FU-based therapy ( either FU + levamisole or FU + leucovorin ; n = 229 ) versus no postsurgical treatment ( n = 228 ) . Data were subsequently pooled with data from a previous analysis . The primary end point was disease-free survival ( DFS ) . RESULTS Overall , 70 ( 15 % ) of 457 patients exhibited dMMR . Adjuvant therapy significantly improved DFS ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.67 ; 95 % CI , 0.48 to 0.93 ; P = .02 ) in patients with pMMR tumors . Patients with dMMR tumors receiving FU had no improvement in DFS ( HR , 1.10 ; 95 % CI , 0.42 to 2.91 ; P = .85 ) compared with those r and omly assigned to surgery alone . In the pooled data set of 1,027 patients ( n = 165 with dMMR ) , these findings were maintained ; in patients with stage II disease and with dMMR tumors , treatment was associated with reduced overall survival ( HR , 2.95 ; 95 % CI , 1.02 to 8.54 ; P = .04 ) . CONCLUSION Patient stratification by MMR status may provide a more tailored approach to colon cancer adjuvant therapy . These data support MMR status assessment for patients being considered for FU therapy alone and consideration of MMR status in treatment decision makingTitle 6:Tumor microsatellite-instability status as a predictor of benefit from fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer.Abstract 6:BACKGROUND Colon cancers with high-frequency microsatellite instability have clinical and pathological features that distinguish them from microsatellite-stable tumors . We investigated the usefulness of microsatellite-instability status as a predictor of the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil in stage II and stage III colon cancer . METHODS Tumor specimens were collected from patients with colon cancer who were enrolled in r and omized trials of fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy .  Microsatellite instability was assessed with the use of mononucleotide and dinucleotide markers . RESULTS Of 570 tissue specimens , 95 ( 16.7 percent ) exhibited high-frequency microsatellite instability . Among 287 patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy  , those with tumors displaying high-frequency microsatellite instability had a better five-year rate of overall survival than patients with tumors exhibiting microsatellite stability or low-frequency instability ( hazard ratio for death , 0.31 [ 95 percent confidence interval , 0.14 to 0.72 ] ; P=0.004 ) . Among patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy  , high-frequency microsatellite instability was not correlated with increased overall survival ( hazard ratio for death , 1.07 [ 95 percent confidence interval , 0.62 to 1.86 ] ; P=0.80 ) . The benefit of treatment differed significantly according to the microsatellite-instability status ( P=0.01 ) . Adjuvant chemotherapy improved overall survival among patients with microsatellite-stable tumors or tumors exhibiting low-frequency microsatellite instability , according to a multivariate analysis adjusted for stage and grade ( hazard ratio for death , 0.72 [ 95 percent confidence interval , 0.53 to 0.99 ] ; P=0.04 ) . By contrast , there was no benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in the group with high-frequency microsatellite instability . CONCLUSIONS Fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy benefited patients with stage II or stage III colon cancer with microsatellite-stable tumors or tumors exhibiting low-frequency microsatellite instability but not those with tumors exhibiting high-frequency microsatellite instability","answer":"In both treated and untreated patients , high‐level MSI improved disease‐free survival compared with low‐level MSI , suggesting a prognostic role but not supporting the hypothesis of a predictive effect of MSI ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

identified with the hipparcos catalogue ( esa 1997 ) and we found 767 stars in common . however , the sample had to be cleaned under various aspects .for instance , for some stars not all data were available or some hipparcos parallaxes were not accurate enough . in fig .1 the colour - magnitude diagram of the remaining stars is shown . despite the efforts of clla to avoid them the sampleis still contaminated by giants and subgiants , which can be detected now due to the improved accuracies of the absolute magnitudes .we have removed all stars lying above a line in the cmd defined by the zero age main sequence of stars with solar metallicity shifted upwards by @xmath1 = 0.8 mag .furthermore we have determined an overall correction factor of the photometric distance scale of clla by analyzing parallax differences @xmath2 .a linear regression analysis @xmath3 gives a coefficient @xmath4 = 0.113@xmath5 0.007 , indicating an upward correction of the photometric distances by 11% .jahrei et al .( 1997 ) have already found a similar correction on the basis of a smaller sample of subdwarfs .we have determined reliable space velocities of 560 nearby subdwarfs .these are shown in fig .  2 versus the metallicities of the stars as scatter plots .the populations of thick disk and halo stars can be clearly distinguished by the widths of the distributions and the mean rotational velocities . since our sampleis based originally on a proper motion survey , the sample is biased in the sense that low velocity stars are underrepresented .this can be seen clearly as a trough in the u -

The murine polyomavirus( Py) binds to the lipid receptor ganglioside GD1a and traffics to the endoplasmic reticulum( ER) where it enters the cytosol and then the nucleus to initiate infection. How Py reaches the ER is unclear. We show that Py is transported initially to the endolysosome where the low pH imparts a conformational change that enhances its subsequent ER-to-cytosol membrane penetration. GD1a stimulates not viral binding or entry, but rather sorting of Py from late endosomes and/or lysosomes to the ER, suggesting that GD1a binding is responsible for ER targeting. Consistent with this, an artificial particle coated with a GD1a antibody is transported to the ER. Our results provide a rationale for transport of Py through the endolysosome, demonstrate a novel endolysosome-to-ER transport pathway that is regulated by a lipid, and implicate ganglioside binding as a general ER targeting mechanism.Introduction:Viruses must navigate through the complex endocytic machineries of the host cell to successfully cause infection. Although some viruses evade or escape degradative compartments such as the endolysosome to infect cells, others rely on this organelle to facilitate infection[1]. How these processes are regulated is poorly understood. The non-enveloped murine polyomavirus( Py) is transported from the cell surface to the nucleus where transcription and replication of the viral DNA genome lead to lytic infection and cell transformation. The successful arrival of one viral particle to the nucleus is sufficient to cause infection[2]. Py is composed of 72 pentamers of the outer structural protein VP1, which associate with the internal proteins VP2 and VP3 and encapsulate the DNA genome[3]. To initiate infection, VP1 binds to the glycolipid receptor ganglioside GD1a on the plasma membrane and is transported to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum( ER)[4]. Transport to the ER is essential for infection as inactivation of ER-resident factors blocks infection significantly[5]–[7]. Py then penetrates the ER membrane, likely enabling it to reach the cytosol and then the nucleus. The precise mechanism controlling the transport of Py from the plasma membrane to the ER, a decisive step in the virus entry pathway, remains to be clarified. Other members of the polyomavirus family including SV40 and the human BK virus also bind to ganglioside glycolipids[4],[8]–[10]. This is in contrast to many viruses that rely on glycoproteins as entry receptors[1],[11]. Upon internalization, most gangliosides are transported to the early and late endosomes, reaching the lysosome where they are eventually hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes. Although a small fraction of gangliosides can reach the Golgi from the plasma membrane, their retrograde transport to the ER has not been observed[12]. Using a combination of live cell fluorescence microscopy, biochemistry, and cell infection studies, we show that Py is transported to the endolysosome and that the low pH environment is critical for infection. Strikingly, we find that GD1a sorts Py from the endolysosome to the ER. Binding to GD1a is likely the key event to direct Py to the ER as an artificial particle coated with GD1a antibody binds to GD1a and is transported to the ER. Our results provide an explanation for trafficking of Py through the endolysosome, demonstrate an endolysosome-to-ER transport pathway that is controlled by a lipid, and implicate ganglioside binding as a general ER targeting mechanism.Discussion:Using live cell imaging approaches, our study indicates that Py is transported through the early and late endosomes, finally reaching the lysosome. The kinetic analysis suggested that the rate of Py transport to the endosomal compartments is significantly slower than the rate observed for classic ligand-receptor complexes, such as the low-density lipoprotein( LDL)-LDL receptor and transferrin-transferrin receptor complexes. For instance, whereas Py begins to accumulate in the late endosome and lysosome 0. 5–2 hrs post-infection, the entire process of delivering the LDL-LDL receptor complex to the late endosome( where LDL is released from the receptor) followed by recycling of the receptor to the plasma membrane is accomplished in 12 min[28]. Similarly, endocytosis of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex to the late endosome and recycling of this complex to the cell surface is completed in 16 min[29]. Factors that account for the slow rate of Py internalization are presently unclear. A previous study suggested that transport of ganglioside from the cell surface to the lysosome takes place in approximately 10–15 minutes[30]. Thus it is unlikely that the intrinsic rate of ganglioside transport to the endolysosome accounts for Py's slow internalization into this compartment. Instead, it is likely that the relatively large size of the viral particle hinders the transport process. We observed that a small portion of Py remained associated with the early endosomes for a prolonged period of time. In this context, it is interesting to note that a study had shown previously the existence of two populations of early endosomes[31]. Some cargoes are transported in vesicles called the static early endosomes, while other cargoes are transported in rapidly maturing early endosomes called the dynamic early endosomes. Sorting of Py to these dynamic early endosomes may represent the infectious route, while Py trapped within the static early endosomes for an extended period of time would lead to non-productive infection. A significant level of Py eventually reaches the late endosome and lysosome. This observation suggests that transport to these compartments provides a strategic advantage to Py during infection. Indeed, we found that the low pH in the endolysosome imparts a conformational change in Py that enables it to more efficiently undergo an ER remodeling reaction which is crucial for the ER-to-cytosol membrane penetration event[5],[25]. That blocking acidification of the endolysosome by bafilomycin A1 decreased Py infection is consistent with the results of one study[21]. However, another study found that elevating endolysosomal pH with NH4Cl did not affect virus infection[13], in contrast to findings that NH4Cl blocks virus infection in[21] and our present study( not shown). This discrepancy may be due to differences in methodology, and the high infection levels in[13] may render Py infection resistant to NH4Cl treatment. The nature of the low pH-induced Py conformational change is presently unknown, although it is likely irreversible as it was detected after neutralization. One possibility is that, as calcium ions have been proposed to stabilize Py structure[32], low pH-induced protonation of the Glu and Asp residues that ligate calcium ions may trigger the release of calcium, effectively destabilizing the virus. In addition to Py, human JC and BV virus infection are also sensitive to elevation of the endolysosomal low pH[33],[34], implicating the endolysosome as part of their infection pathway. By contrast, SV40 infection is pH independent[33]. This finding is consistent with the observation that SV40 is transported to a pH-neutral compartment called the caveosome prior to reaching the ER[35]. Whether GM1, the receptor for SV40[4], sorts SV40 from the caveosome to the ER requires further study. Our data indicate that, in addition to its role in cell surface binding of Py, GD1a also plays a critical function in the intracellular trafficking of Py. As GD1a is transported normally to the endolysosome, GD1a likely carries Py from the plasma membrane to the endolysosome. However, delivery of Py to the endolysosome does not appear to be GD1a's critical function as Py can be transported to the endolysosome in ganglioside-deficient cells. This finding suggests that non-ganglioside receptors such as glycoproteins can also deliver Py to the endolysosome( Figure 7). Instead, our analysis demonstrates that the crucial role of GD1a is to sort Py from the endolysosome to the ER to facilitate infection; Py bound to non-ganglioside receptors is likely trapped in the endolysosome. Proteins that traffic from the ER to the late endosome/lysosome normally pass through the trans Golgi. In this context, we have not observed co-localization of Py with the Golgi( not shown), similar to a previous report[9]. Whether Py-containing vesicle that is sorted out of the endolysosome fuses directly with the ER membrane or with another vesicle which then fuses with the ER membrane, is unknown. The proposed endolysosome-to-ER transport pathway is not without precedent. For example, under a pathological condition where gangliosides in the lysosome are not degraded, these lipids are transported to the ER and induce the unfolded protein response[36]. Furthermore, during replication of the intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus, the Brucella containing vacuole which represents a phagosome fuses with the late endosomes and recruits late endosomal markers. This vacuolar maturation process is required to traffic to the ER to enable subsequent bacterial replication[37]. Interestingly, the reverse pathway in which molecules are transported from the ER to the endolysosome independent of the Golgi was recently described in the trafficking of toll-like receptors[38]. These findings collectively implicate the existence of a previously unappreciated transport pathway between the endolysosome and the ER. It remains unclear whether GD1a sorts Py out of the early endosome or the late endosome/lysosome. Our data show that transport to the late endosome is crucial for Py infection, and that GD1a decreased Py co-localization with the late endosome and lysosome. The simplest interpretation of these findings is that Py is sorted out of the late endosome/lysosome. However, it is conceivable that a block in transport to the late endosome interfered with upstream sorting processes in the early endosome. Further analysis is required to distinguish between these two possibilities. Lipid rafts/caveolae were shown previously to play a role in the GD1a-mediated Py infection pathway in the rat glioma C6 cells[9]. In this context, we did not detect any significant co-localization of Py with caveolae in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Nonetheless, it remains possible that the endolysosome and the raft/caveolae-mediated pathways intersect to facilitate Py infection. In fact, recent findings demonstrate a complex crosstalk system between these two pathways traditionally viewed as independent[39],[40]. What might be the molecular mechanism by which GD1a sorts Py from the endolysosome to the ER? Because the 360 VP1 molecules of Py provide 360 GD1a binding sites, each virus likely binds to multiple gangliosides on the cell surface. In addition, as gangliosides are normally internalized and transported to the endolysosome, Py may recruit even more GD1a during its transport to the endolysosome. This process clusters multiple molecules of GD1a on a single viral particle. GD1a clustering may lead to two potential sorting mechanisms. First, clustering results in the formation of a hydrophobic platform within the bilayer, which can stimulate transmembrane signaling to recruit cytoplasmic factors that mediate budding of Py-containing vesicles from the endosomal membrane. Because gangliosides are only inserted into a single leaflet, any potential transmembrane signaling would be facilitated by interactions with a transmembrane protein. Alternatively, ganglioside clustering may alter the physical properties of the membrane beneath the virus, causing membrane invagination followed by budding. This concept was recently demonstrated for shiga toxin, where toxin binding to its ceramide-based glycolipid GB3 receptor induced tubular membrane invaginations[41]. Many bacterial toxins, such as CT[26], also bind to ganglioside receptors and are transported to the ER. Their receptor-binding B subunits are often pentameric, enabling each toxin to bind to five ganglioside molecules. Thus toxin-induced clustering of gangliosides likely targets the toxin to the ER, as was recently implicated for CT[42]. We used an artificial particle designed to bind and cluster GD1a, and showed that it can be transported to the ER. This finding supports the principle that ganglioside binding and clustering provides the fundamental mechanism for ER targeting. In conclusion, using a model murine fibroblast cell line( NIH 3T3), we have demonstrated that Py is transported to the endolysosome and then sorted to the ER by the lipid molecule GD1a to cause infection. As Py induces tumors in a variety of cell types, including cells of the mammary gland, salivary gland, and thymus[43], future experiments will clarify whether the endolysosome-to-ER pathway is observed similarly in these other cell types.","answer":"To cause infection , viruses must reach appropriate compartments within the cell where they undergo a programmed series of conformational changes that enable the viral genome to be exposed and released .

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), particularly mGluR2/3, mGluR5 and mGluR7, have received much attention in medication development for the treatment of drug addiction and other neuropsychiatric diseases. However, little is known as to whether mGluR ligands also alter natural sexual behavior, a possible unwanted effect when used in humans. In the present study, we used classical copulatory behaviors to evaluate the effects of LY379268 (a selective mGluR2/3 agonist), MPEP (a selective mGluR5 antagonist) and AMN082 (a selective mGluR7 agonist), on male sexual performance in rats. We found that systemic administration of LY379268 (1, 3 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect, while MPEP (20 mg/kg, but not 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and AMN082 (10, 20 mg/kg, but not 3 mg/kg) produced a significant and dose-dependent reduction in both sex-seeking and sex-performance behaviors, manifested as an increase in mount or intromission latency and time required for ejaculation, and a reduction in mount or intromission frequency. This inhibition lasted for about 30-60 min. These findings suggest that compounds that target mGluR5 or mGluR7, but not mGluR2/3, may have short-term inhibitory effects on male sexual performance.

We report that in yeast, such IB formation is a factor-dependent process subjected to age-related decline. A genome-wide, high-content imaging approach, identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ltn1 of the ribosome quality control complex( RQC) as a key factor required for IB formation, ubiquitination, and detoxification of model mHtt. The failure of ltn1∆ cells to manage mHtt was traced to another RQC component, Tae2, and inappropriate control of heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, activity. Moreover, super-resolution microscopy revealed that mHtt toxicity in RQC-deficient cells was accompanied by multiple mHtt aggregates altering actin cytoskeletal structures and retarding endocytosis. The data demonstrates that spatial sequestration of mHtt into IBs is policed by the RQC-Hsf1 regulatory system and that such compartmentalization, rather than ubiquitination, is key to mHtt detoxification.Introduction:The Huntington disease( HD) is predominantly inherited, with a single gene, HTT, encoding the Huntingtin protein, at its origin( MacDonald, 1993). Mutated and aggregation-prone poly-glutamine-expanded( Poly( Q)) Huntingtins( mHtt) are causing HD by toxic gain-of-functions and, possibly, dominant-negative mechanisms, which are typically manifested in aged individuals( Ross and Tabrizi, 2011). While the formation of mHtt inclusion bodies( IBs) correlates with toxicity and disease, such formation might, in effect, be a protective response to limit proteotoxicity( Ross and Tabrizi, 2011; Arrasate et al., 2004): For example, IB formation predicts improved survival in neurons( Arrasate et al., 2004) and the IB-forming mHtt103QP protein( Figure 1a; exon-1 with 97Q repeats) are not, or only mildly, cytotoxic even when produced at high levels in young yeast cells( Dehay and Bertolotti, 2006; Duennwald et al., 2006). In contrast, when the innate proline-rich region adjacent the poly( Q) stretch of exon-1 is removed, the protein, mHtt103Q, forms multiple small, highly cytotoxic aggregates/oligomers( Figure 1a)( Dehay and Bertolotti, 2006; Duennwald et al., 2006; Meriin et al., 2002). These aggregates are associated with the actin cytoskeleton( Song et al., 2014) and interfere with the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome-system( UPS) by sequestering the Hsp40 chaperone Sis1( Park et al., 2013). Chaperones, peptides, and prion-like proteins that either prevent/modify oligomer production( Behrends et al., 2006; Dehay and Bertolotti, 2006; Krobitsch and Lindquist, 2000; Muchowski et al., 2000; Gokhale et al., 2005) or convert small aggregates/oligomers into IBs( Kayatekin et al., 2014; Wolfe et al., 2014) can suppress the toxicity of the proline-less exon-1, suggesting that small aggregates and oligomers are likely culprits in mHtt103Q-derived toxicity( Arrasate et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2011). 10. 7554/eLife. 11792. 003Figure 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11792. 003 Ubiquitination is another process suggested to prevent mHtt toxicity in both mammals( Steffan, 2004) and yeast( Willingham et al., 2003). IBs of mHtt contain ubiquitin in mice( Davies et al., 1997) and the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, hE2-25K, interacts with mHtt, which has been shown to be ubiquitinated in both humans and flies( Kalchman et al., 1996; Steffan, 2004). However, an E3 ubiquitin ligase directly responsible for mHtt ubiquitin-tagging, IB formation, and detoxification has not been identified.Discussion:The conserved Listerin( Ltn1) E3 ligase is a key factor involved in targeting protein products derived from defective mRNA or aborted translation for degradation by the 26S proteasome( Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010; Brandman et al., 2012). Upon translation stalling, ribosome recycling factors dissociate 80S ribosome-nascent chain complexes to 60S ribosome-nascent chain-tRNA complexes, which are recognized by Ltn1 and Tae2( Shen et al., 2015; Shao et al., 2015; Shao et al., 2013). Both nascent chains and, for example, K12- and R12-arrested polypeptides are substrates for Ltn1-dependent ubiquitin tagging, which signal their destruction by the 26S proteasome( Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010; Brandman et al., 2012; Preissler et al., 2015). Herein, we report on another pivotal role of Ltn1 in protein quality control – detoxification of mutant Huntingtin through a Tae2/Hsf1-dependent sequestration of mHtt103QP into actin-associated inclusions( Figure 3h). As depicted in Figure 3h, the effect of Ltn1 on mHtt103QP aggregation appears to act through Tae2, which in turn is known to negatively control Hfs1 activity( Brandman et al., 2012). Thus, the presence of Tae2 is known to cause hyperactivation of Hsf1 when LTN1 is deleted( Brandman et al., 2012), which could be enough to inhibit IB formation. On the other hand, mutations reducing Hsf1 activity also inhibited IB formation suggesting that maintaining a proper, intermediate, range of Hsf1 activity is required to efficiently sequester mHtt103QP into IBs( Figure 3h). In worms, elevated production of small heat shock proteins through Hsf1 activity has been shown to delay the onset of polyglutamine-expansion protein aggregation( Hsu, 2003) and reducing hsf-1 activity accelerates aging( Hsu, 2003; Morley and Morimoto, 2004). Reciprocally, hsf-1 overexpression extends worm lifespan( Hsu, 2003).( Baird et al., 2014). The data presented here, however, demonstrate that both Hsf1 elevation and Hsf1 deficiency in cells expressing the Huntingtin disease protein is detrimental( Figure 3h), suggesting, again, that a fine balance of Hsf1 activity has to be maintained to assuage proteotoxicity. This notion might explain why alterations in Hsf1 levels in mammalian cells have been shown to either inhibit mHtt IB formation( Fujimoto et al., 2005) or lower the concentration threshold at which HTT forms IB( Bersuker et al., 2013). These results raise the question of whether age-dependent penetrance of HD could be due to a reduced Hsf1 activity in aging tissues or a malignant hyperactivation of Hsf1. The latter scenario could be the result of an age-dependent increase in translational processivity errors, which could titrate the RQC complex eliciting a Tae2-dependent activation of Hsf1( Figure 3h), possibly through Tae2-directed tagging of incomplete translation products with carboxyl-terminal Ala and Thr extensions.( Shen et al., 2015). The exact mechanism behind Hsf1-dependent modulation of mHtt IB formation might be complex in that Hsf1 targets other genes than heat shock genes. It has been shown in worms that over-expression of hsf-1, with or without the C-terminal trans-activation domain, elevates the levels of pat-10, a troponin-like protein, that increase actin cytoskeleton integrity leading to lifespan extension and resistance to proteotoxic stress( Baird et al., 2014). Thus, it is possible that Hsf1 may regulate mHtt IB formation/toxicity in the yeast model system through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics since we found that mHtt103QP is associated with dense actin structures and that genes involved in actin dynamics are required to harness the latent toxicity of mHtt103QP. In addition, our data cannot rule out the possibility that the expression of mHtt in general raises proteostasis stress in the cell leading to Hsf1 activation and that such activation is epistatically affecting the effect of Ltn1-deficieny.","answer":"Huntington’s disease is a neurological disease that is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called Htt . Individuals with this mutation gradually lose neurons as they age , resulting in declines in muscle coordination and mental abilities . The mutant Htt proteins tend to form clumps inside cells , but it is not clear if these clumps are the cause of the disease symptoms or whether they have a protective effect . Yang et al . used yeast as a model to investigate whether the mutant Htt proteins need other molecules to allow them to form clumps . The experiments identified several new molecules that are required for mutated Htt to form clumps . Some of these are components of a system called the Ribosome Quality Control ( RQC ) complex , which monitors newly made proteins and labels abnormal ones for destruction . However , Yang et al . ’s findings suggest that the RQC complex regulates the formation of Htt clumps through a different pathway involving a protein called heat shock factor 1 . In this case , cells would need to fine-tune heat shock factor 1 activity to make mutant Htt proteins clump together to protect cells from damage . Future experiments should expand Yang et al . ’s findings to animal models of Huntington’s disease and identify which other molecules contribute to the formation of Htt clumps . One challenge will be to find out why older neurons fail to form clumps of Htt proteins , and whether this can be overcome by drugs that boost the activity of the molecules that Yang et al . identified ."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Prostaglandins, produced both by neurons and glia, may serve as mediators of glial and neuronal functions. We examined the influence of cyclopentenone prostaglandins and their precursors on activated glia. As models of glial activation, production of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) was studied in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat microglia, a murine microglial cell line BV-2, and IL-1beta-stimulated rat astrocytes. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins were potent inhibitors of iNOS induction and were more effective than their precursors, prostaglandins E2 and D2. 15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) was the most potent prostaglandin among those tested. In activated microglia, 15d-PGJ2 suppressed iNOS promoter activity, iNOS mRNA, and protein levels. The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus. Thus, our data suggest the existence of a novel pathway mediated by cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which may represent part of a feedback mechanism leading to the cessation of inflammatory glial responses in the brain.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"troglitazone\\", \\"15d-PGJ2\\", \\"cyclopentenone prostaglandins\\", \\"Prostaglandins\\", \\"prostaglandin\\", \\"nitric-oxide\\", \\"prostaglandins E2 and D2\\", \\"15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2\\", \\"Cyclopentenone prostaglandins\\", \\"15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"iNOS\\", \\"iNOS promoter\\", \\"NFkappaB\\", \\"PPARgamma\\", \\"inducible nitric-oxide synthase\\", \\"PPAR\\", \\"IL-1beta\\", \\"peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Background Self-management interventions improve various outcomes for many chronic diseases. The definite place of self-management in the care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been established. We evaluated the effect of a continuum of self-management, specific to COPD, on the use of hospital services and health status among patients with moderate to severe disease. Methods A multicenter, randomized clinical trial was carried out in 7 hospitals from February 1998 to July 1999. All patients had advanced COPD with at least 1 hospitalization for exacerbation in the previous year. Patients were assigned to a self-management program or to usual care. The intervention consisted of a comprehensive patient education program administered through weekly visits by trained health professionals over a 2-month period with monthly telephone follow-up. Over 12 months, data were collected regarding the primary outcome and number of hospitalizations; secondary outcomes included emergency visits and patient health status. Results Hospital admissions for exacerbation of COPD were reduced by 39.8% in the intervention group compared with the usual care group ( P = .01), and admissions for other health problems were reduced by 57.1% ( P = .01). Emergency department visits were reduced by 41.0% ( P = .02) and unscheduled physician visits by 58.9% ( P = .003). Greater improvements in the impact subscale and total quality-of-life scores were observed in the intervention group at 4 months, although some of the benefits were maintained only for the impact score at 12 months. Conclusions A continuum of self-management for COPD patients provided by a trained health professional can significantly reduce the utilization of health care services and improve health status. This approach of care can be implemented within normal practice.Literature Review:","answer":"Even though there are reports that educational programs for COPD patients can significantly reduce the utilization of healthcare services and improve health status BIB002 , they have not been as actively promoted as much as programs for asthma patients BIB001 . Single-topic programs are available (e.g., smoking cessation, long-term oxygen therapy, rehabilitation), but there are insufficient integrated educational materials incorporating all the aspects of disease management BIB002 . Educational programs should improve people's knowledge about the disease process and its treatment and should also motivate patients to change behavior and lifestyle, with the goal of improving their quality of life BIB002 . 5 Notes about normal and pathological ranges and changes in the measured physiological signals"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

In preceding studies, we demonstrated that choline carboxylates ChC (m) with alkyl chain lengths of m = 12-18 are highly water-soluble (for m = 12, soluble up to 93 wt % soap and 0 ° C). In addition, choline soaps are featured by an extraordinary lyotropic phase behavior. With decreasing water concentration, the following phases were found: micellar phase (L (1)), discontinuous cubic phase (I (1) ' and I (1) \\"), hexagonal phase (H (1)), bicontinuous cubic phase (V (1)), and lamellar phase (L (α)). The present work is also focused on the lyotropic phase behavior of choline soaps but with shorter alkyl chains or different alkyl chain properties. We have investigated the aqueous phase behavior of choline soaps with C (8) and C (10) chain-lengths (choline octanoate and choline decanoate) and with a C (18) chain-length with a cis-double bond (choline oleate). We found that choline decanoate follows the lyotropic phase behavior of the longer-chain homologues mentioned above. Choline octanoate in water shows no discontinuous cubic phases, but an extended, isotropic micellar solution phase. In addition, choline octanoate is at the limit between a surfactant and a hydrotrope. The double bond in choline oleate leads also to a better solubility in water and a decrease of the solubilization temperature. It also influences the Gaussian curvature of the aggregates which results in a loss of discontinuous cubic phases in the binary phase diagram. The different lyotropic mesophases were identified by the penetration scan technique with polarizing light microscope and visual observations. To clarify the structural behavior small (SAXS) and wide (WAXS) angle X-ray scattering were performed. To further characterize the extended, isotropic micellar solution phase in the binary phase diagram of choline octanoate viscosity and conductivity measurements were also carried out.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

It is now well appreciated that chronic gut inflammation is characterized by enhanced production of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen. Some of these oxidants are known to modulate the expression of a variety of genes that are involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. For example, certain oxidants are known to activate the nuclear transcription factor kappa B, which regulates the expression of a variety of different adhesion molecules, cytokines, and enzymes. Oxidants are also known to activate another transcription factor, activator protein-1. This transcription factor is composed of products from the fos and jun proto-oncogene family and is believed to be important in regulating cell growth and proliferation. Finally, oxidants are believed to promote intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, and the B-cell lymphoma / leukemia-2 gene product is believed to inhibit this phenomenon in an antioxidant-dependent manner. Taken together, these observations suggest that nontoxic concentrations of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and in modulating apoptosis.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"intestinal epithelial cell\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"enzymes\\", \\"adhesion molecules\\", \\"activator protein - 1\\", \\"nuclear transcription factor kappa B\\", \\"cytokines\\", \\"B - cell lymphoma / leukemia - 2 gene product\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"fos and jun proto - oncogene family\\", \\"transcription factors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

Previous studies have highlighted the necessity for entity linking systems to capture the global coherence. However, there are two common weaknesses in previous global models. First, most of them calculate the pairwise scores between all candidate entities and select the most relevant group of entities as the final result. In this process, the consistency among wrong entities as well as that among right ones are involved, which may introduce noise data and increase the model complexity. Second, the cues of previously disambiguated entities, which could contribute to the disambiguation of the subsequent mentions, are usually ignored by previous models. To address these problems, we convert the global linking into a sequence decision problem and propose a reinforcement learning model which makes decisions from a global perspective. Our model makes full use of the previous referred entities and explores the long-term influence of current selection on subsequent decisions. We conduct experiments on different types of datasets, the results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art systems and has better generalization performance.Entity SelectorIn the entity selector module, we choose the target entity from candidate set based on the results of local and global encoder. In the process of sequence disambiguation, each selection result will have an impact on subsequent decisions. Therefore, we transform the choice of the target entity into a reinforcement learning problem and view the entity selector as an agent. In particular, the agent is designed as a policy network which can learn a stochastic policy and prevents the agent from getting stuck at an intermediate state BIBREF12 . Under the guidance of policy, the agent can decide which action (choosing the target entity from the candidate set)should be taken at each state, and receive a delay reward when all the selections are made. In the following part, we first describe the state, action and reward. Then, we detail how to select target entity via a policy network.The result of entity selection is based on the current state information. For time t , the state vector S_t is generated as follows: S_t = V_{m_i}^toplus {V_{e_i}^t}oplus {V_{feature}^t}oplus {V_{e^*}^{t-1}}   (Eq. 15) Where oplus  indicates vector concatenation. The V_{m_i}^t and V_{e_i}^t respectively denote the vector of m_i and e_i at time t . For each mention, there are multiple candidate entities correspond to it. With the purpose of comparing the semantic relevance between the mention and each candidate entity at the same time, we copy multiple copies of the mention vector. Formally, we extend V_{m_i}^t in mathbb {R}^{1times {n}} to V_{m_i}^t{^{prime }} in mathbb {R}^{ktimes {n}} and then combine it with V_{e_i}^t in mathbb {R}^{ktimes {n}} . Since V_{m_i}^t and V_{m_i}^t0 are mainly to represent semantic information, we add feature vector V_{m_i}^t1 to enrich lexical and statistical features. These features mainly include the popularity of the entity, the edit distance between the entity description and the mention context, the number of identical words in the entity description and the mention context etc. After getting these feature values, we combine them into a vector and add it to the current state. In addition, the global vector V_{m_i}^t2 is also added to V_{m_i}^t3 . As mentioned in global encoder module, V_{m_i}^t4 is the output of global LSTM network at time V_{m_i}^t5 , which encodes the mention context and target entity information from V_{m_i}^t6 to V_{m_i}^t7 . Thus, the state V_{m_i}^t8 contains current information and previous decisions, while also covering the semantic representations and a variety of statistical features. Next, the concatenated vector will be fed into the policy network to generate action.According to the status at each time step, we take corresponding action. Specifically, we define the action at time step t is to select the target entity e_t^* for m_t . The size of action space is the number of candidate entities for each mention, where a_i in lbrace 0,1,2...krbrace  indicates the position of the selected entity in the candidate entity list. Clearly, each action is a direct indicator of target entity selection in our model. After completing all the actions in the sequence we will get a delayed reward.The agent takes the reward value as the feedback of its action and learns the policy based on it. Since current selection result has a long-term impact on subsequent decisions, we don't give an immediate reward when taking an action. Instead, a delay reward is given by follows, which can reflect whether the action improves the overall performance or not. R(a_t) = p(a_t)sum _{j=t}^{T}p(a_j) + (1 - p(a_t))(sum _{j=t}^{T}p(a_j) + t - T)   (Eq. 16) where p(a_t)in lbrace 0,1rbrace  indicates whether the current action is correct or not. When the action is correct p(a_t)=1 otherwise p(a_t)=0 . Hence sum _{j=t}^{T}p(a_j) and sum _{j=t}^{T}p(a_j) + t - T respectively represent the number of correct and wrong actions from time t to the end of episode. Based on the above definition, our delayed reward can be used to guide the learning of the policy for entity linking.After defining the state, action, and reward, our main challenge becomes to choose an action from the action space. To solve this problem, we sample the value of each action by a policy network pi _{Theta }(a|s) . The structure of the policy network is shown in Figure 3. The input of the network is the current state, including the mention context representation, candidate entity representation, feature representation, and encoding of the previous decisions. We concatenate these representations and fed them into a multilayer perceptron, for each hidden layer, we generate the output by: h_i(S_t) = Relu(W_i*h_{i-1}(S_t) + b_i)   (Eq. 17) Where W_i and  b_i are the parameters of the i th hidden layer, through the relu activation function we get the h_i(S_t) . After getting the output of the last hidden layer, we feed it into a softmax layer which generates the probability distribution of actions. The probability distribution is generated as follows: pi (a|s) = Softmax(W * h_l(S) + b)   (Eq. 18) Where the W and b are the parameters of the softmax layer. For each mention in the sequence, we will take action to select the target entity from its candidate set. After completing all decisions in the episode, each action will get an expected reward and our goal is to maximize the expected total rewards. Formally, the objective function is defined as: begin{split}J(Theta ) &= mathbb {E}_{(s_t, a_t){sim }P_Theta {(s_t, a_t)}}R(s_1{a_1}...s_L{a_L}) &=sum _{t}sum _{a}pi _{Theta }(a|s)R(a_t)end{split}   (Eq. 19) Where P_Theta {(s_t, a_t)} is the state transfer function, pi _{Theta }(a|s) indicates the probability of taking action a under the state s , R(a_t) is the expected reward of action a at time step t . According to REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm BIBREF13 , we update the policy gradient by the way of equation 9. Theta leftarrow Theta + alpha sum _{t}R(a_t)nabla _{Theta }log pi _{Theta }(a|s)   (Eq. 20) As the global encoder and the entity selector are correlated mutually, we train them jointly after pre-training the two networks. The details of the joint learning are presented in Algorithm 1.[t] The Policy Learning for Entity Selector [1] Training data include multiple documents D = lbrace D_1, D_2, ..., D_Nrbrace  The target entity for mentions Gamma = lbrace T_1, T_2, ..., T_Nrbrace  Initialize the policy network parameter Theta  , global LSTM network parameter Phi  ; D_k in D Generate the candidate set for each mention Divide the mentions in D_k into multiple sequences S = lbrace S_1, S_2, ..., S_Nrbrace  ; S_k in S Rank the mentions M = lbrace m_1, m_2, ..., m_nrbrace  in S_k based on the local similarity; Phi 0 in Phi 1 Sample the target entity Phi 2 for Phi 3 with Phi 4 ; Input the Phi 5 and Phi 6 to global LSTM network; Phi 7 End of sampling, update parameters Compute delayed reward Phi 8 for each action; Update the parameter Phi 9 of policy network: Theta leftarrow Theta + alpha sum _{t}R(a_t)nabla _{Theta }log pi _{Theta }(a|s) Update the parameter Phi  in the global LSTM networkDiscussion on different RLEL variantsTo demonstrate the effects of RLEL, we evaluate our model under different conditions. First, we evaluate the effect of sequence length on global decision making. Second, we assess whether sorting the mentions have a positive effect on the results. Third, we analysis the results of not adding globally encoding during entity selection. Last, we compare our RL selection strategy with the greedy choice.A document may contain multiple topics, so we do not add all mentions to a single sequence. In practice, we add some adjacent mentions to the sequence and use reinforcement learning to select entities from beginning to end. To analysis the impact of the number of mentions on joint disambiguation, we experiment with sequences on different lengths. The results on AIDA-B are shown in Figure 4. We can see that when the sequence is too short or too long, the disambiguation results are both very poor. When the sequence length is less than 3, delay reward can't work in reinforcement learning, and when the sequence length reaches 5 or more, noise data may be added. Finally, we choose the 4 adjacent mentions to form a sequence.In this section, we test whether ranking mentions is helpful for entity selections. At first, we directly input them into the global encoder by the order they appear in the text. We record the disambiguation results and compare them with the method which adopts ranking mentions. As shown in Figure 5a, the model with ranking mentions has achieved better performances on most of datasets, indicating that it is effective to place the mention that with a higher local similarity in front of the sequence. It is worth noting that the effect of ranking mentions is not obvious on the MSNBC dataset, the reason is that most of mentions in MSNBC have similar local similarities, the order of disambiguation has little effect on the final result.Most of previous methods mainly use the similarities between entities to correlate each other, but our model associates them by encoding the selected entity information. To assess whether the global encoding contributes to disambiguation rather than add noise, we compare the performance with and without adding the global information. When the global encoding is not added, the current state only contains the mention context representation, candidate entity representation and feature representation, notably, the selected target entity information is not taken into account. From the results in Figure 5b, we can see that the model with global encoding achieves an improvement of 4% accuracy over the method that without global encoding.To illustrate the necessity for adopting the reinforcement learning for entity selection, we compare two entity selection strategies like BIBREF5 . Specifically, we perform entity selection respectively with reinforcement learning and greedy choice. The greedy choice is to select the entity with largest local similarity from candidate set. But the reinforcement learning selection is guided by delay reward, which has a global perspective. In the comparative experiment, we keep the other conditions consistent, just replace the RL selection with a greedy choice. Based on the results in Figure 5c, we can draw a conclusion that our entity selector perform much better than greedy strategies.Reinforcement LearningIn the last few years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex sequential decision-making problems. It is well known for its great success in the game field, such as Go BIBREF37 and Atari games BIBREF38 . Recently, reinforcement learning has also been successfully applied to many natural language processing tasks and achieved good performance BIBREF12 , BIBREF39 , BIBREF5 . Feng et al. BIBREF5 used reinforcement learning for relation classification task by filtering out the noisy data from the sentence bag and they achieved huge improvements compared with traditional classifiers. Zhang et al. BIBREF40 applied the reinforcement learning on sentence representation by automatically discovering task-relevant structures. To automatic taxonomy induction from a set of terms, Han et al. BIBREF41 designed an end-to-end reinforcement learning model to determine which term to select and where to place it on the taxonomy, which effectively reduced the error propagation between two phases. Inspired by the above works, we also add reinforcement learning to our framework.Question: what are the mentioned cues?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"output of global LSTM network at time V_{m_i}^t5 , which encodes the mention context and target entity information from V_{m_i}^t6 to V_{m_i}^t7\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"Where oplus  indicates vector concatenation. The V_{m_i}^t and V_{e_i}^t respectively denote the vector of m_i and e_i at time t . For each mention, there are multiple candidate entities correspond to it. With the purpose of comparing the semantic relevance between the mention and each candidate entity at the same time, we copy multiple copies of the mention vector. Formally, we extend V_{m_i}^t in mathbb {R}^{1times {n}} to V_{m_i}^t{^{prime }} in mathbb {R}^{ktimes {n}} and then combine it with V_{e_i}^t in mathbb {R}^{ktimes {n}} . Since V_{m_i}^t and V_{m_i}^t0 are mainly to represent semantic information, we add feature vector V_{m_i}^t1 to enrich lexical and statistical features. These features mainly include the popularity of the entity, the edit distance between the entity description and the mention context, the number of identical words in the entity description and the mention context etc. After getting these feature values, we combine them into a vector and add it to the current state. In addition, the global vector V_{m_i}^t2 is also added to V_{m_i}^t3 . As mentioned in global encoder module, V_{m_i}^t4 is the output of global LSTM network at time V_{m_i}^t5 , which encodes the mention context and target entity information from V_{m_i}^t6 to V_{m_i}^t7 . Thus, the state V_{m_i}^t8 contains current information and previous decisions, while also covering the semantic representations and a variety of statistical features. Next, the concatenated vector will be fed into the policy network to generate action.\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

The function of the zeta-globin promoter was studied using a series of zeta-globin promoter deletion constructs to drive luciferase expression in transiently transfected human erythroleukemia cells. The promoters were used without enhancers, or with enhancers derived from the beta-globin locus control region and the alpha-globin HS-40 enhancer. When transfected into K562 cells, which express zeta-globin, comparable amounts of activity were obtained from the-557 and-417 zeta-luciferase constructs and the alpha-luciferase constructs when no enhancers or the alpha-globin locus enhancers were used. When the constructs were transfected into OCIM1 cells, which do not express zeta-globin, the zeta-globin promoters were at best 20% as active as the alpha-globin promoters. When sequences from-417 to-207 5' to the zeta-globin mRNA cap site were deleted, up to 95% of the zeta-globin promoter activity was lost in K562 cells. Reinsertion of these sequences into zeta-luciferase constructs missing the-417 to-207 region showed that the sequences lack classical enhancer activity. Point mutation of a GATA-1 site at-230 reduced promoter activity by 37%. Point mutation of a CCACC site at-240 had no effect. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the-230 GATA-1 site has a relatively low affinity for GATA-1. These experiments show the presence of a strong positive-acting element, located between-417 and-207 bp 5' to the zeta-globin mRNA cap site, is necessary for high-level promoter activity in K562 cells. This element requires GATA-1 and additional unknown factors for maximal activity.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"transiently transfected human erythroleukemia cells\\", \\"OCIM1 cells\\", \\"K562 cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [\\"CCACC site\\", \\"sequences from - 417 to - 207 5u0027\\", \\"zeta - globin promoter deletion constructs\\", \\"promoters\\", \\"alpha - luciferase constructs\\", \\"- 417 and - 207 bp 5u0027\\", \\"beta - globin locus control region\\", \\"zeta - globin promoter\\", \\"alpha - globin promoters\\", \\"zeta - globin mRNA cap site\\", \\"zeta - luciferase constructs\\", \\"positive regulatory element\\", \\"human zeta - globin gene\\", \\"GATA - 1 site\\", \\"- 230 GATA - 1 site\\", \\"- 557 and - 417 zeta - luciferase constructs\\", \\"positive - acting element\\", \\"alpha - globin HS - 40 enhancer\\", \\"alpha - globin locus enhancers\\", \\"zeta - globin promoters\\", \\"GATA - 1\\", \\"enhancers\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"GATA - 1\\", \\"luciferase\\", \\"additional unknown factors\\", \\"zeta - globin\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"zeta - globin mRNA\\", \\"zeta - globin mRNA cap site\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data on NOM, with the intention of formulating standardized protocols on which to base future investigations. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted. A highly sensitive literature search identified all relevant studies published between January 2004 and December 2016. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed independently by two authors, and resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. In total, 15 studies, including 920 patients, met the inclusion criteria; 575 (62.5%) of these patients underwent NOM after cCR, with the remaining patients forming a surgical control group. The weighted mean follow-up was 39.4 (12.7) months in the NOM group and 39.8 (5.1) months in the surgery group. The pooled regrowth rate in the NOM group was 21.3% at a mean of 15.6 (7.0) months. Surgical salvage was possible and was undertaken in 93.2% of these patients. Overall survival in the NOM group was 91.7%, while disease-free survival was 82.7%. For the comparison proctectomy group, pooled rates of local recurrence, overall survival, and disease-free survival were 8.4, 92.4, and 87.5%, respectively. NOM may be a feasible option for surgically eligible rectal cancer patients with cCR after nCRT. Before such a strategy can be widely implemented, further prospective data are required with standardized definitions, diagnostic criteria, and management protocols, with an emphasis on shared patient-provider decision making and patient-centered outcomes.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"Rectal Cancer\\", \\"decision making\\", \\"rectal cancer\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"regrowth\\", \\"Complete Clinical Response\\", \\"cCR\\", \\"complete clinical response\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"surgically\\", \\"investigations\\", \\"Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy\\", \\"proctectomy\\", \\"follow-up\\", \\"neoadjuvant chemoradiation\\", \\"Surgical salvage\\", \\"nCRT\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"diagnostic criteria\\", \\"PRISMA\\", \\"Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\\", \\"definitions\\", \\"standardized protocols\\", \\"management protocols\\", \\"systematic review\\", \\"guidelines\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"authors\\", \\"reviewer\\", \\"patient-provider\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"studies\\", \\"Data extraction\\", \\"data\\", \\"patient-centered outcomes\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

When running on structure-sequence alignment problems without long-range intersections, i.e. C = 0, the algorithm achieves the same asymptotic computational complexity of the Smith-Waterman sequence-sequence alignment algorithm.The algorithm is based on fractional programming and its running time is O(n2log n). In practice, normalized local alignment is only 3-5 times slower than the standard Smith-Waterman algorithm.","answer":"quadratic"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

Both diseases may share common etiologic agents which may either affect or modulate the process of both diseases . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between systemic bone mineral density ( BMD ) and periodontal disease among older people . MATERIAL S AND METHODS Among all 4,542 inhabitants aged 70 years according to a registry of residents in Niigata city in Japan , 600 people were selected r and omly . One hundred and eighty-four subjects who did not have diabetes mellitus , whose blood sugar was < 140 mg/dl , who had more than 20 teeth , who were non-smokers , and who did not take medication for osteoporosis , were included in the study . Four dentists performed clinical evaluations on probing attachment level ( PAL ) .  We also utilized the data on BMD of the heel , which we measured using an ultrasound bone densitometer . Follow-up clinical surveys were done by measuring PAL after 3 years .  Finally , 179 subjects who could participate in both the baseline and the follow-up examinations were included in the analysis . After dividing the subjects into an osteopenia group ( OG ) and non-osteopenia group ( NOG ) , we evaluated the relationship between BMD and the number of progressive sites which had > or =3 mm additional attachment loss during 3 years after controlling the known confounding factors . RESULTS The mean number of progressive sites for the OG and the NOG , respectively , were 4.65+/-5.51 and 3.26+/-3.01 in females and 6.88+/-9.41 and 3.41+/-2.79 in males . Two-way analysis of variance was performed to discriminate among effects of gender , BMD , and gender-BMD interaction . A significant effect of BMD ( OG or NOG , p=0.043 ) with a significant interaction ( p=0.038 ) was observed . Furthermore , BMD was associated with the number of progressive sites which had > or =3 mm additional attachment loss during the 3 years ( p=0.001 ) by multiple linear regression analysis . CONCLUSIONS This study suggested that there was a significant relationship between periodontal disease and general BMDTitle 2:Longitudinal Study of Bone Density and Periodontal Disease in MenAbstract 2:Bone loss is a feature of both periodontitis and osteoporosis , and periodontal destruction may be influenced by systemic bone loss . This study evaluated the association between periodontal disease and bone mineral density ( BMD ) in a cohort of 1347 ( 137 edentulous ) older men followed for an average of 2.7 years . Participants were recruited from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study . R and om half-mouth dental measures included  clinical attachment loss ( CAL ) , pocket depth ( PD ) , calculus , plaque , and bleeding . BMD was measured at the hip , spine , and whole-body , by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry , and at the heel by ultrasound . After adjustment for age , smoking , race , education , body mass index , and calculus , there was no association between number of teeth , periodontitis , periodontal disease progression , and either BMD or annualized rate of BMD change . We found little evidence of an association between periodontitis  and  skeletal BMD among older menTitle 3:[Osteoporosis: a risk factor in periodontal disease].Abstract 3:Many studies have attempted to define the relationship between osteoporosis and periodontal disease . Most studies support a positive association between these common diseases ; however , many are cross-sectional in nature , include relatively small sample sizes , and have inadequate control of potential confounding factors , such as age , gender , hormone intake , race , and smoking , limiting our underst and ing of the nature of the relationship between these diseases . Prospect i ve studies are needed to confirm or refute a causal relationTitle 4:Bone mineral density in periodontally healthy and edentulous postmenopausal women.Abstract 4:( Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic disease among postmenopausal women . Reduced masticatory function caused by tooth loss may be a contributing risk factor of osteoporosis . The present study examined the effect of dentate state on skeletal bone mineral density ( BMD )  in postmenopausal women . Fourteen periodontally healthy dentate subjects ( group H ; mean age : 64.0 + 5.5 years ) and 12 edentulous subjects ( group E ; mean age : 67.1 + 2.9 years ) were r and omly selected from the clinics of the departments of Periodontology and Gerodontology , respectively . Informed consent was obtained from all participants . BMD of the lumbar spine ( L2-L4 ) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry . In addition , occlusal force was measured in 11 group H subjects and 8 group E subjects by using an occlusal diagnostic system . Risk factors associated with osteoporosis including age , calcium intake , physical activity , and cigarette smoking and causes of tooth loss were assessed by interview and question naire sent to all participants . The BMD of group H was 1.07 t 0.21 g/cm2 and that of group E was 0.89 + 0.17 g/cm2 , which was significantly different(P < 0.05 ) . The occlusal force of group H and E patients was 312.4 + 148 N and 56.3 + 36 N , respectively , which was significantly different ( P < 0.05 ) . Risk factors such as calcium intake , physical activity , and smoking did not differ significantly between the 2 groups . Thus , the periodontally healthy dentate women , who showed about 6 times higher occlusal force than edentulous women , maintained significantly higher BMD of the lumbar spine than edentulous women . Our results suggest that sufficient masticatory function with periodontally healthy dentition may inhibit or delay the progress of osteoporotic change in skeletal bone or that edentulous women may be more susceptible to osteoporosisTitle 5:Mandibular bone mineral density as a predictor of skeletal osteoporosis.Abstract 5:A considerable amount of work has been performed on methods of detecting individuals with low bone mass at an early stage . Some research ers have considered if dental radiographs could have a role in the detection of individuals with osteoporosis . A basic requirement for this would be that bone mass in the jaw relates significantly to that of other skeletal sites in which osteoporosis is a significant problem . The first aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between m and ibular bone mineral density ( BMD ) and that of other skeletal sites commonly used for bone densitometry in the detection of osteoporosis . The second aim was to assess the validity of m and ibular BMD as a predictor of BMD in these other sites . 40 edentulous females underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) of the lumbar spine ( L2-L4 ) , DXA of the right femoral neck , single photon absorptiometry ( SPA ) of the proximal and distal forearm and DXA of the m and ible . Significant correlations were observed between BMD in the m and ibular body , ramus and symphysis and all other skeletal sites ( p < 0.02 ) . Five patients ( 12.5 % ) had age matched Z-scores of -1.0 or lower in all three non-m and ibular sites ( lumbar spine , femoral neck and forearm ) . Using these patients as the proportion of the population with a positive finding of \\" low bone mass \\" , the sensitivity and specificity of m and ibular BMD in predicting low bone mass for these patients was determined . Where a diagnostic threshold for low m and ibular BMD was set at one st and ard deviation below the mean , the m and ibular body BMD measurement gave high sensitivity ( 0.8 ) and specificity ( 0.97 ) , the symphysis BMD low sensitivity ( 0.4 ) but a high specificity ( 0.77 ) , while the ramus BMD had a moderate level of sensitivity ( 0.6 ) and high specificity ( 0.91 ) . It is concluded that m and ibular BMD assessed by DXA correlates significantly with BMD measurements of other important skeletal sites . The higher correlation coefficients and the greater sensitivity and specificity for the body of m and ible suggest that this site should be used for any potential clinical application of dental radiographs in detection of osteoporosisTitle 6:Periodontal conditions in 70-year-old women with osteoporosis.Abstract 6:The aim of the present study was to examine the periodontal conditions in an age cohort of 70-year-old women and compare an osteoporosis group with a control group with normal bone mineral density . 210 women 70 years old and r and omly sample d from the population register of the community of Linköping were examined .  Bone mineral density ( BMD ) of the hip was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry .  19 women were diagnosed with osteoporosis ( BMD below 0.640 g/cm2 in total hip ) . 15 of them accepted to participate in the study . As a control group 21 women with normal bone mineral density ( BMD exceeding 0.881 g/cm2 ) were r and omly selected from the initial population . The clinical examination included registration of the number of remaining teeth , dental plaque and periodontal conditions .

If so , then a relationship should exist between measures of systemic bone mineral density and periodontal tissue destruction . The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to evaluate the association between systemic bone mineral density and the clinical signs of periodontal tissue destruction in a large population of elderly dentate women . METHODS A total of 292 dentate women ( average age 75.5 years ) were r and omly selected for a cross-sectional periodontal sub study from participants at the Pittsburgh Field Center of the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures ( SOF ) , a prospect i ve study of a cohort of elderly women ( age > or = 65 years at baseline ) to determine risk factors for fractures . Bone mineral density ( BMD ) was measured using single photon absorptiometry ( radius , calcaneus ) and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( hip , spine ) . Oral health examinations , including periodontal probings and an assessment of bleeding on probing  , were made using an NIDR probe at 3 buccal sites of all teeth . Multiple regression models were used to assess the association between bone mineral density and measures of periodontal disease status while controlling for potential confounders . Periodontal status variables examined included : average loss of periodontal attachment ( LOA ) ; number of sites with at least 4 mm LOA ; number of sites with at least 6 mm LOA ; number of sites with bleeding on probing ; and deepest probing depth per person . RESULTS This study found no statistically significant association between the 5 indicators of periodontal disease and measures of systemic BMD at 8 anatomic sites after controlling for age , smoking , and number of remaining natural teeth . Some suggestive findings support a weak association between generalized osteopenia and periodontal disease .

Actuators of this active process are sensory outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, whereas the inner hair cells transduce the resulting motion into electric signals that propagate via the auditory nerve to the brain. However, how the outer hair cells modulate the stimulus to the inner hair cells remains unclear. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and experimental measurements near the cochlear apex to study the way in which length changes of the outer hair cells deform the organ of Corti. We develop a geometry-based kinematic model of the apical organ of Corti that reproduces salient, yet counter-intuitive features of the organ’s motion. Our analysis further uncovers a mechanism by which a static length change of the outer hair cells can sensitively tune the signal transmitted to the sensory inner hair cells. When the outer hair cells are in an elongated state, stimulation of inner hair cells is largely inhibited, whereas outer hair cell contraction leads to a substantial enhancement of sound-evoked motion near the hair bundles. This novel mechanism for regulating the sensitivity of the hearing organ applies to the low frequencies that are most important for the perception of speech and music. We suggest that the proposed mechanism might underlie frequency discrimination at low auditory frequencies, as well as our ability to selectively attend auditory signals in noisy surroundings.Introduction:Our ability to hear is due to an intricate mechanotransduction process that takes place inside the inner ear. Sound-evoked waves on the basilar membrane, an elastic structure stretching along the cochlear canal, cause the deflection of mechanosensitive hair bundles of the sensory cells, thus gating ion channels in the cell membrane and producing electrical signals that are ultimately transmitted to the brain[1]. The transfer of basilar-membrane motion to deflection of the hair bundles is shaped by the structurally complex organ of Corti( Fig 1( A)), the outer hair cells of which can provide mechanical force[2]. Changes in transmembrane voltage cause these cells to change length, a phenomenon referred to as electromotility[3, 4]. Furthermore, the hair bundles of outer hair cells can also generate mechanical force[5, 6]. Both mechanisms may contribute to an active modulation of the sound-evoked motion of the organ of Corti[7–9]. The active mechanical feedback by outer hair cells is essential for the extraordinary sensitivity, tuning, and dynamic range of mammalian hearing organs, and damage to the outer hair cells consequently results in hearing loss[10–12]. Although this feedback presumably operates on a cycle-by-cycle basis, outer hair cells can also exhibit quasi-static length changes that occur on much slower timescales. In particular, outer hair cells respond to acoustic stimulation through static contraction and sometimes elongation. Moreover, the static length change is largest when the frequency of the stimulation matches the characteristic frequency of the cochlear location of the outer hair cell[13, 14]. Although discovered almost thirty years ago, the biophysical relevance of such static length changes of outer hair cells for the functioning of the organ of Corti remains unresolved. Another main uncertainty regarding the feedback by outer hair cells concerns the micromechanics of the organ of Corti in the low-frequency apical region of the cochlea that is responsible for detecting frequencies below a few kHz that are most important for speech and music[15, 16]. Recent in vitro experimental studies have indeed shown that the apical organ of Corti deforms in a complex and unexpected way[16–21]. When stimulated electrically, the outer hair cells contracted and pulled the reticular lamina, in which the hair bundles of outer hair cells are anchored, towards the basilar membrane. Surprisingly, the lateral portion of the organ of Corti composed of the Hensen cells moved in the opposite direction, away from the basilar membrane, at an amplitude larger than that of the reticular lamina[20]. No vibration could be detected from the adjacent portion of the basilar membrane[16]. The mechanisms producing this complex motion of the organ remain unclear. Here we set out to identify the origin of the complex internal motion of the organ of Corti at the cochlear apex and the influence of static length changes of outer hair cells. We show that a plausible assumption about the apical organ of Corti, namely that each cross-section is incompressible, highly constrains the organ’s internal motion. The deformation of the organ of Corti that results from length changes of the outer hair cells can then be described through a mathematical model that is based on the organ’s geometry. We develop this model and verify it through comparison with existing[16, 20] as well as newly acquired experimental data, where length changes of the outer hair cells were induced by current injections inside scala media. Our results reveal that static length changes of the outer hair cells can sensitively determine how much of the sound-evoked motion is transferred to the reticular lamina, thus providing a novel mechanism for outer hair cells to regulate hearing sensitivity.Discussion:We have developed a model for the deformation of the organ of Corti that is based on the organ’s geometry as well as on the plausible assumption that the organ of Corti near the cochlear apex is incompressible. The model involves only two parameters that are not derived from the geometry, namely the extensibility of the Deiter’s cells and of the outer edge of the Hensen cells. Qualitative comparison of model predictions with experimental data highly constrains these parameters, and the resulting model predictions agree excellently with further data on the displacement of the outer hair cells and the vertical vibration at different depths in the organ of Corti. A limitation of our model stems from the fact that we have considered the organ of Corti as composed only of spring-like elastic elements and neglected viscous and inertial impedances. However, as the deformation frequency is lowered, the relative importance of the latter components decreases. For frequencies up to several hundred Hertz, the organ of Corti’s impedance( albeit with the tectorial membrane removed) is found to be dominated by stiffness, rather than viscosity[27]. This corresponds to the characteristic frequencies found at the apical locations studied here, which is why our results can provide a valid approximation also for the acoustic response. We also note that our assumption of unimportant viscous and inertial impedance regards only the part of the organ of Corti between the basilar membrane and the reticular lamina, but not the subtectorial space. The latter presumably contributes the major viscous damping to the cochlear partition, and this damping may be counteracted by a cycle-by-cycle length change of outer hair cells[29–31]. Our model generically produces the non-intuitive counterphasic motion of the reticular lamina and the Hensen cells that was recently observed experimentally[17, 18, 20, 21]. Importantly, our analysis suggests that this behaviour does not result from perilymph being pressed against the Hensen cells, as hypothesized recently[21]. Instead, our model and our measurements evidence that the entire body of Hensen cells is being pulled upwards by the contracting outer hair cells. Generally, the experimental data are reproduced if the base of the outer hair cell is allowed to move somewhat more than its apex, such that the largest displacements then occur inside the organ of Corti. Intriguingly, this is corroborated by our own recent in vivo measurements using optical coherence tomography[16]. What is the origin of this internal motion? In our model, the vibrational pattern is achieved through Deiter’s cells that are fairly compliant, at least in response to quasi-static or low-frequency forcing by outer hair cells[32, 33]. Alternatively, or in addition, large displacements at the bases of outer hair cells could also occur as a consequence of a locally very compliant basilar membrane[16]. We have not detected basilar-membrane motion lateral of the organ of Corti in response to current stimulation[16, 34]. However, our interferometric measurements from different depths inside the Hensen cells indicate that some basilar-membrane motion may be present in a limited region underneath the organ, while the decrease in amplitude with depth suggests that some stretching occurs as well. Conservation of the cross-sectional area of the organ of Corti may then require counterphasic displacement of the arcuate zone of the basilar membrane, as observed by Nuttall et al. in more basal regions in response to electrical stimulation[35]. We did not include this mode of deformation in our model, as no corresponding data are available for the cochlear apex. Current theories of cochlear function suggest that the mechanical activity of outer hair cells serves to amplify the motion of the basilar membrane[2] or the reticular lamina[36, 37] in order to render faint sounds more easily detectable for the stereocilia of inner hair cells. In this light, it seems surprising that the largest motion would occur in the interior of the organ. However, our geometrical analysis and experiments suggest that this motion pattern is associated with a nonlinear dependence of the reticular-lamina motion on the resting length of the outer hair cells. In consequence, we find that the resting length of the outer hair cells can control the magnitude of vibration of the reticular lamina that is evoked by an oscillating length change of the outer hair cells. Experimental evidence for this effect comes from the observed nonlinear dependence of sound-evoked motion on an imposed endocochlear potential in vitro[20]. It has been suggested previously that static length changes of the outer hair cells might influence the operating point of hair bundles[38], or of the micromechanics of the organ of Corti as a whole[39], but the details of such a mechanism have remained unclear. Our analysis shows that the incompressibility of the organ of Corti together with a high level of compliance at the base of outer hair cells yields a novel and intriguingly simple mechanism for the outer hair cells to regulate hearing sensitivity through their static length change. While we have thus shown the availability of such a mechanism, further experimental work and improved imaging techniques are needed to verify it in the living cochlea. Our geometrical model quantifies the internal motion of the organ of Corti. The actual sound-evoked and active motion of the cochlear partition is a linear combination of the internal deformation and an overall net displacement. While internal motion is due to active amplification by outer hair cells, the net displacement of the organ can be caused both by sound stimulation as well as by the mechanical activity of outer hair cells. In a recently proposed ratchet mechanism, or unidirectional amplification, the outer hair cells may cause only internal deformation of the organ of Corti without displacement of the basilar membrane[24], in agreement with some recent experimental observations[16]. Further modeling that integrates the geometric model presented here with an analysis of the different forces produced by outer hair cells and their effects on the overall motion of the organ of Corti, as well as further experimental results on the linear or nonlinear response of the reticular lamina and the basilar membrane to varying sound intensity, are needed to clarify these issues. Our findings are particularly relevant for two lines of further research. First, our results could shed new light on the role of the static and frequency-dependent motile response of outer hair cells to acoustic stimulation whose biophysical origin and function in the cochlea remain poorly understood[13, 14]. Because our model shows that a sustained length change of outer hair cells can sensitively regulate the reticular lamina’s vibration, the tuned sound-evoked static length changes of outer hair cells can serve as an effective tuning mechanism that can circumvent the poor mechanical tuning of the basilar membrane in the cochlear apex[2]. As set out above, elongated outer hair cells will transfer only little of their oscillating length change to the reticular lamina. The mechanical sound signal elicited by a pure tone may, however, cause outer hair cells at the characteristic position to contract such that their additional oscillatory response to sound is leveraged into a large vibration of the reticular lamina and thus of the hair bundles of the inner hair cells. This effect can thus endow the motion of the reticular lamina with a frequency selectivity that is independent of the mechanical tuning of the basilar membrane which is comparatively poor in the cochlear apex[2]. Second, the discussed principle could present a potential mechanism for efferent medial olivocochlear( MOC) nerve fibers that innervate the outer hair cells to modulate the auditory stimulus[40]. This efferent feedback is thought to play an important role, for instance, in our ability to understand speech in noisy environments. Our results show that efferently-mediated static length changes of the outer hair cells can modify the transfer of outer hair cell activity to reticular-lamina motion. Experiments have indeed observed efferently-induced modifications in the auditory nerve signal that is not found in the mechanics of the basilar membrane, suggesting that inner hair cell stimulation is in part directly due to outer hair cell activity[41]. This effect was present throughout the cochlea, and was particularly prominent in low-frequency regions. A mechanism as the one described here could underlie these observations.","answer":"Outer hair cells are highly specialized force producers inside the inner ear: they can change length when stimulated electrically . However , how exactly this electromotile effect contributes to the astonishing sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the inner ear has remained unclear .

While we tend to define protein evolution in terms of sequence level mutations, insertions and deletions, it is hard to translate these processes to a more complete picture incorporating a polypeptide's structure and function. By considering how protein structures change over time we can gain an entirely new appreciation of their long-term evolutionary dynamics. In this work we seek to identify how populations of proteins at different stages of evolution explore their possible structure space. We use an annotation of superfamily age to this space and explore the relationship between these ages and a diverse set of properties pertaining to a superfamily's sequence, structure and function. We note several marked differences between the populations of newly evolved and ancient structures, such as in their length distributions, secondary structure content and tertiary packing arrangements. In particular, many of these differences suggest a less elaborate structure for newly evolved superfamilies when compared with their ancient counterparts. We show that the structural preferences we report are not a residual effect of a more fundamental relationship with function. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our results, using significant variation in the algorithm used to estimate the ages. We present these age estimates as a useful tool to analyse protein populations. In particularly, we apply this in a comparison of domains containing greek key or jelly roll motifs.Introduction:The current wealth of freely available genetic sequences offers the potential to uncover the evolutionary history of genes and their products, proteins. While there exist no remains of primitive proteins, extant protein information can be used to estimate a protein family's history. This approach is particularly well suited to structural information. Protein structures are far more conserved than their sequences and thus preserve a deep phylogenetic signal[1]. Furthermore, for the majority of globular proteins, a stable three-dimensional structure is thought to be a requirement for many aspects of its function. By maintaining the precise positioning of functional residues while also minimising other undesirable interactions a protein's structure is intimately linked to the role it plays within the cell[2]. Moreover, phylogenetic trees built using the structural content of species' proteomes have been shown to produce more reliable topologies than trees constructed using their protein sequences[3]. These observations support the use of structure as a fundamental molecular unit when studying the evolution of proteins. Furthermore, they suggest that any conversation on the evolution of proteins must first understand the major driving forces behind such changes from a structural perspective. In order to visualise the landscape and diversity of structure space protein structures have been clustered within a hierarchical taxonomy[4],[5]. The SCOP database is one such manual classification scheme which, at the superfamily level, attempts to cluster together protein domains with a common evolutionary origin, based primarily on strong functional and structural similarity[6]. The superfamily classification lies in between the family level, largely defined by a domain's amino acid sequence, and the fold, a structural consensus of a domain's topology. In this work we primarily consider sets of structural domains classified as superfamilies in SCOP 1. 75. Despite the potential for rich diversity within the structural universe it is surprising how sparse this space remains[7]. The current repertoire of proteins with known structure fall into less than 1, 200 unique SCOP folds and the majority of these contain only one sequence family[8]. While this is unlikely to represent the true diversity of naturally occurring proteins and current projections for the size of protein fold space range from around 2, 000[9] to over 10, 000[10], it is thought that the vast majority of extant proteins will fall into only around 1, 000 common folds[11]. Furthermore, the landscape of this core fold space is highly heterogeneous, with a few so called ‘superfolds’ densely populated by sequence families[12]. The unique composition of this space is a consequence of protein evolution through neutral drift and active selection together with a complex interplay of other factors such as genome structure, mutational mechanisms, function and the need for interactions, all of which close off portions of the configuration space. However, little is known about the exact nature by which the range of protein structures we see today have evolved[2]. One way in which we can seek to explore the forces behind such a history is to consider annotating the protein structure universe with an estimate of its evolutionary age[7],[13],[14]. The age of a population of proteins is the estimated node age of its first ancestor across a phylogeny of completely sequenced genomes. This method has been implemented for both structural superfamilies[13],[15] and sequence families[7],[14], although the latter tend to involve a much reduced phylogenetic tree and evolutionary scale. Methods for predicting the internal node of the ancestor for a given family or superfamily also vary. A maximum parsimony model for superfamily evolution has been largely adopted for this step[13],[15],[16], although alternatives include Dollo parsimony: taking the most recent common ancestor[7],[13]. These parsimony models take as input a phylogenetic species tree and the occurrence profile of each structural superfamily across this set of species. The occurrence profile for a superfamily is simply its presence or absence on each of the genomes[16]. Parsimony attempts to reconstruct the most likely series of gain and loss events at internal nodes of the tree which explain the occurrence profile at its leaves. The likelihood of these events is based on simple assumptions relating to the evolution of protein domains. The principle underlying all types of parsimony is that the scenario of events involving the least evolutionary change is preferred. Gain events can represent de novo superfamily gain, lateral gene transfer of a superfamily between genomes, and a false positive assignment of a superfamily to a genome. Loss events can represent the loss of a superfamily and also false negative assignments to a genome. Maximum parsimony methods allow for a weighting of the likelihood of loss events relative to gain events, while Dollo parsimony considers a gain event to be so rare it is most likely to have occurred only once in the evolution of a superfamily. Since lateral gene transfer is rare between Eukaryotes but may be quite common among Prokaryotes it has been suggested that maximum parsimony is an appropriate model for Prokaryotic genomes while Dollo parsimony should be used for Eukaryotes[16],[17]. Previous studies have shown a significant positive correlation between the age of a domain's structure and its length[7],[14]. These results remain pronounced over different methods for calculating the age of a superfamily or protein sequence. This seemingly fundamental relationship between the age of a structure and its length has supported the idea that the primitive protein universe was populated mainly by small folds[7]. In fact, the recent success in using structural fragments to predict protein structures( see, for example[18]) has further stimulated debate as to whether the evolutionary origins of the current fold space are in fact short peptide fragments that have combined to form larger folds[19]. It has also been reported that class domains tend to be significantly older than superfamilies belonging to other classes[13]. domains also tend to be significantly longer than other classes but they are also distinguishable in other respects[20]. They are unique among the classes in containing a majority of parallel-strands as opposed to the antiparallel structure which characterise all- and classes. folds also contain a large number of the so-called ‘superfolds’: folds containing large numbers of different superfamilies and a high proportion of all determined structures[12]. Such superfolds include P-loop NTPases, Rossmann folds and TIM barrels[11]. In this work we present phylogenetic profiles and evolutionary ages for superfamilies representing the current known structural universe. We show that these age estimates are largely robust to different evolutionary models, datasets and phylogenetic trees. We compare the structural characteristics of two protein populations: new-borns, with biologically recent structural ancestors, and ancients, with ancestors at the root of the tree of life. Our results identify several characteristics that differ between the two populations. These differences support known relationships, such as the propensity of and longer superfamilies to be ancient, and also postulate several previously unseen characteristics which correlate with age. While these structural relationships are marked we considered the possibility that they were the result of an asymmetry in the functional annotation of fold space. Here we show that our structural partitions result in far more dramatic age differences than functional groupings and as such the relationships between structure and age are not a residual effect of functional preferences.Discussion:In this work we estimate the evolutionary age of structural superfamilies. Our results are highly robust to different evolutionary assumptions in estimating ages, as well as alternative topologies and a smaller number of species in the phylogenetic trees. The results presented here indicate that newly evolving superfamilies tend to be, in general, shorter and structurally more simple than ancient structures. They appear, on average, to have a less hydrophobic core and a greater surface area to volume ratio. They differ from ancient superfamilies in terms of their amino acid composition, containing more polar residues, and tend to contain more additional stabilising features such as disulphide bonds and aromatic residues. Ancient superfamilies on the other hand are dominated by superfamilies and are enriched for many fundamental cellular functions. In particular, the still extant LUCA folds contain a comprehensive repertoire of proteins relating to RNA synthesis and maintenance rather than those used in DNA synthesis, and thus LUCA may have contained a ribosome mechanism for protein synthesis. The age of a superfamily could also be described as the depth at which it can be traced back through evolution. As such, there are several interpretations of our results, in particular in the case of what we have termed new-born superfamilies. Firstly, it could be that an entirely new domain was formed at some point in evolution. This could indicate that the evolution of a new superfamily as a transition from an already existing structure is a rare event, or that evolutionary transitions through fold space, when they occur, are more often reductive. It could also suggest that, through evolutionary drift, there is a tendency towards an increasingly elaborate structure. Secondly, a superfamily with a low age estimate might have originated earlier in evolution but the family recognition profiles have failed to identify homologues in distantly related species. In this case, such a superfamily may lack a representative deposition of solved structures, or be rapidly evolving and highly divergent. Certainly, characteristics such as a high solvent accessibility are correlated with the rate of sequence evolution[33]. Nevertheless, by using multiple profiles to build their Hidden Markov Models, SUPERFAMILY improves detection of sequence-divergent families compared to pairwise comparison and single profile searches[34]. As a greater coverage of proteins in such superfamilies are solved structurally, the likelihood of an incorrect low age estimate will decrease. Thirdly, a young superfamily may be the result of an unfound evolutionary link between superfamilies. As such the structural ancestor of these superfamilies may be earlier than their given age estimates. In order to address this possibility we have shown that the preferences are preserved at both the superfamily and fold level of the SCOP hierarchy. Finally, what appears to be a young superfamily may actually be ancient but has been lost at several more internal nodes than a parsimonious scenario suggests. This could be the result of functional specialisation within a superfamily. At present our understanding of the evolutionary history of individual superfamilies is not advanced enough to alter the evolutionary model behind age estimation for each superfamily. Our work concerning the robustness of the dataset overall to differing gain weights suggest that our results will be upheld within a moderate level of variation between different superfamilies. In this study we consider the structural universe of proteins and show that the age preferences of structural characteristics are not a residual effect derived from functional preferences. This result alone justifies the use of protein structures as a fundamental evolutionary unit. Using our age estimates we examined the specific case of greek key and jelly roll motifs, and identified a significant difference between their ages of origin. Given their similarity in topology it is possible that some superfamilies containing these motifs were involved in evolutionary transitions, where a greek key acted as a scaffold during the innovation of a jelly roll topology. This example demonstrates that these ages can be used to examine specific properties or motifs of interest, as well as explore more general fold space preferences for proteins at different stages in their evolution.","answer":"Proteins are the molecular workers of the cell .

These structurally robust organelles experience strenuous cellular processes such as cell division or ciliary beating while performing their function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stability of microtubule triplets, as well as centriole architectural integrity remain poorly understood. Here, using ultrastructure expansion microscopy for nanoscale protein mapping, we reveal that POC16 and its human homolog WDR90 are components of the microtubule wall along the central core region of the centriole. We further found that WDR90 is an evolutionary microtubule associated protein. Finally, we demonstrate that WDR90 depletion impairs the localization of inner scaffold components, leading to centriole structural abnormalities in human cells. Altogether, this work highlights that WDR90 is an evolutionary conserved molecular player participating in centriole architecture integrity.Introduction:Centrioles and basal bodies( referred to as centrioles from here onwards for simplicity) are conserved organelles important for the formation of the centrosome as well as for templating cilia and flagella assembly( Bornens, 2012; Breslow and Holland, 2019; Conduit et al., 2015; Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011). Consequently, defects in centriole assembly, size, structure and number lead to abnormal mitosis or defective ciliogenesis and have been associated with several human pathologies such as ciliopathies and cancer( Gönczy, 2015; Nigg and Holland, 2018; Nigg and Raff, 2009). For instance, centriole amplification, a hallmark of cancer cells, can result from centriole fragmentation in defective, over-elongated centrioles( Marteil et al., 2018). Centrioles are characterized by a nine-fold radial arrangement of microtubule triplets, are polarized along their long axis, and can be divided in three distinct regions termed proximal end, central core and distal tip( Hamel et al., 2017). Each region displays specific structural features such as the cartwheel on the proximal end, which is crucial for centriole assembly( Nakazawa et al., 2007; Strnad et al., 2007) or the distal appendages at the very distal region, essential for membrane docking during ciliogenesis( Tanos et al., 2013). The central core region of the centriole is defined by the presence of a circular inner scaffold thought to maintain the integrity of microtubule triplets under compressive forces( Le Guennec et al., 2020). Using cryo-tomography, we recently showed that the inner centriole scaffold forms an extended helix covering ~70% of the centriole length and that is rooted at the inner junction between the A and B microtubules( Figure 1A, B). This connection consists of a stem attaching the neighboring A and B microtubules and three arms extending from the same stem toward the centriolar lumen( Le Guennec et al., 2020; Figure 1A, B). The stem of the inner scaffold has been detected in Paramecium tetraurelia, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and human centrioles, suggesting that it represents an evolutionary conserved structural feature. The molecular identity of some components of the inner scaffold has been uncovered using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy( U-ExM), which allows nanoscale localization of proteins within structural elements( Gambarotto et al., 2019). Notably, the centriolar proteins POC1B, FAM161A, POC5 and Centrin have been shown to localize to the inner scaffold along the microtubule blades in human cells( Le Guennec et al., 2020). Moreover, these proteins form a complex that can bind to microtubules through the microtubule-binding protein FAM161A( Le Guennec et al., 2020; Zach et al., 2012). Importantly, a subset of these proteins has been shown to be important, such as POC5 for centriole elongation( Azimzadeh et al., 2009) as well as POC1B for centriole and basal body integrity( Pearson et al., 2009; Venoux et al., 2013). This observation highlights the role of the inner scaffold structure in providing stability to the entire centriolar microtubule wall organization. However, the exact contribution of the inner scaffold to microtubule triplets stability and how the inner scaffold is connected to the microtubule blade is unknown. We recently identified the conserved proteins POC16/WDR90 as proteins localizing to the central core region in both Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and human centrioles( Hamel et al., 2017). Impairing POC16 or WDR90 functions has been found to affect ciliogenesis, suggesting that POC16/WDR90 may stabilize the microtubule wall, thereby ensuring proper flagellum or cilium assembly( Hamel et al., 2017). Interestingly, POC16 has been proposed to be at the inner junction between the A and B microtubules( Yanagisawa et al., 2014) through its sequence identity with FAP20, an axonemal microtubule doublet inner junction protein of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella( Dymek et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2019; Owa et al., 2019; Yanagisawa et al., 2014). As the stem connects the A- and B-microtubules interface, these observations suggest that POC16/WDR90 may connect the inner scaffold to the microtubule triplet through this stem structure( Figure 1C), thus ensuring integrity of the centriole architecture. In this study, using a combination of cell biology, biochemistry and Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy( U-ExM) approaches, we establish that the conserved POC16/WDR90 proteins localize on the centriolar microtubule wall in the central core region of both Chlamydomonas and human cells. We further demonstrate that WDR90 is a microtubule-binding protein and that loss of this protein impairs the localization of inner scaffold components and leads to slight centriole elongation, impairment of the canonical circular shape of centrioles as well as defects in centriolar architecture integrity.Discussion:What maintains centriole barrel stability and roundness is a fundamental open question. Centrioles are microtubule barrel structures held together by the A-C linker at their proximal region and a recently discovered inner scaffold in the central/distal region( Le Guennec et al., 2020). The presence of such an extended scaffold covering 70% of the centriolar length has led to the hypothesis that this structure is important for maintaining centriole integrity( Le Guennec et al., 2020). Our work demonstrates that POC16/WDR90 family proteins constitute an evolutionary conserved central core microtubule triplet component that is essential for maintaining the inner centriolar scaffold components in human centrioles. The depletion of WDR90 leads to centriolar defects and impairment of microtubule triplets organization resulting in the loss of the canonical circular shape of centrioles. We also found that this overall destabilization of the centriole can lead to microtubule triplet breakage. Whether this phenotype arises as a consequence of the loss of the inner scaffold or due to the destabilization of the inner junction of the microtubule triplet is still an opened question that should be addressed in the future. Moreover, although unlikely, we cannot exclude that fragile centrioles such as the ones found in WDR90-depleted cells could be affected and further distorted by the technique of expansion microscopy. We also demonstrate using expansion microscopy that POC16/WDR90 is a component of the microtubule triplet restricted to the central core region. In addition and based on the sequence and structural similarity to the DUF667 domain of FAP20 that composes the inner junction in flagella, we propose that POC16/WDR90 localizes at the inner junction of the A and B microtubule of the centriolar microtubule triplet. The fact that WDR90 localization is restricted to the central core region led us to hypothesize that another protein, possibly FAP20 as it has been previously reported at centrioles( Yanagisawa et al., 2014), could mediate the inner junction between A- and B-microtubule in the proximal region of the centriole. Moreover, in POC16/WDR90 proteins, the DUF667 domain is followed by a WD40 domain sharing a similarity with the flagellar inner B-microtubule protein FAP52/WDR16( Owa et al., 2019) leading us to propose that the WD40 domains of POC16/WDR90 might also be located inside the B-microtubule of the triplet. However, whether this is the case remains to be addressed in future studies. In addition, WDR90 is potentially not the only protein that forms the inner junction. Indeed, we and others also previously show that FAM161A( Le Guennec et al., 2020; Zach et al., 2012), similarly to WDR90, is a microtubule-binding protein close to the inner microtubule wall of the centriole, raising the possibility that both might compose the stem and link the microtubule triplets to the inner scaffold. It will be interesting in the future to study whether these two proteins interact. Our work further establishes that WDR90 is recruited to centrioles in G2 phase of the cell cycle concomitant with centriole elongation and inner central core assembly. We found that WDR90 depletion does not impair centriole duplication nor microtubule wall assembly, as noted by the presence of the proximal marker HsSAS-6 and the distal cap CP110. In stark contrast, WDR90 depletion leads to a strong reduction of inner scaffold components at centrioles, as well as some centriole destabilization. Although several examples of centriole integrity loss have been demonstrated in the past, the molecular mechanisms of centriole disruption are not understood. For instance, Delta- and Epsilon-tubulin mutants have been shown in several model organisms to affect centriole integrity( Dutcher et al., 2002; Dutcher and Trabuco, 1998; Garreau de Loubresse et al., 2001; O'Toole et al., 2003) with notably in human cells where Delta- and Epsilon-tubulin null mutant cells were shown to lack microtubule triplets and have thus unstable centrioles that do not persist to the next cell cycle( Wang et al., 2017). Remarkably, these centrioles can elongate with a proper recruitment of the cartwheel component HsSAS-6 and the distal marker CP110 but fails to recruit POC5, a result that is similar to our findings with WDR90-depleted cells. As Delta- and Epsilon-tubulin null human mutant cells can solely assemble microtubule singlets( Wang et al., 2017), we speculate that WDR90 might not be recruited in these centrioles, as the A- and B-microtubule inner junction would be missing. As a consequence, the inner scaffold proteins may not be recruited, as already shown for POC5, leading to the observed futile cycle of centriole formation and disintegration( Wang et al., 2017). It would therefore be interesting to study the presence of WDR90 in these null mutants as well as the other components of the inner scaffold in the future. Our work also showed that WDR90 as well as POC5 depletion affects centriole length in human cells. Altogether, these results emphasize the role of these two proteins in overall centriole length regulation and suggest an unexpected role of the inner scaffold structure in centriole length control. It would be of great interest to understand if and how the absence of the inner scaffold can affect the length of the centriole without affecting distal markers such as CP110, which remains unchanged in our experiments. It is very likely that the concomitant elongation of the centriole with the appearance of inner scaffold components in G2 can act on the final length of this organelle. Given the importance of centriole integrity in enabling the proper execution of several diverse cellular processes, our work provides new fundamental insights into the architecture of the centriole, establishing a structural basis for centriole stability and the severe phenotypes that arise when lost.","answer":"Cells are made up of compartments called organelles that perform specific roles . A cylindrical organelle called the centriole is important for a number of cellular processes , ranging from cell division to movement and signaling . Each centriole contains nine blades made up of protein filaments called microtubules , which link together to form a cylinder . This well-known structure can be found in a variety of different species . Yet , it is unclear how centrioles are able to maintain this stable architecture whilst carrying out their various different cell roles . In early 2020 , a group of researchers discovered a scaffold protein at the center of centrioles that helps keep the microtubule blades stable . Further investigation suggested that another protein called WDR90 may also help centrioles sustain their cylindrical shape . However , the exact role of this protein was poorly understood . To determine the role of WDR90 , Steib et al . – including many of the researchers involved in the 2020 study – used a method called Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy to precisely locate the WDR90 protein in centrioles . This revealed that WDR90 is located on the microtubule wall of centrioles in green algae and human cells grown in the lab . Further experiments showed that the protein binds directly to microtubules and that removing WDR90 from human cells causes centrioles to lose their scaffold proteins and develop structural defects . This investigation provides fundamental insights into the structure and stability of centrioles . It shows that single proteins are key components in supporting the structural integrity of organelles and shaping their overall architecture . Furthermore , these findings demonstrate how ultrastructure expansion microscopy can be used to determine the role of individual proteins within a complex structure ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection. On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway  (Guibas et al., 2018) . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections (Vasileiou et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation. Another mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Sajjan et al., 2008; Kast et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018) . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Another recent area of interest is the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome. The development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases is usually linked to specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment (Diver et al., 2019) . In the event of a viral infection such as RV infection, the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present (Molyneaux et al., 2013; Kloepfer et al., 2014; Kloepfer et al., 2017; Jubinville et al., 2018; van Rijn et al., 2019) . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation (Marks et al., 2013; Chao et al., 2014) . Moreover, a viral infection may also alter the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth (Siegel et al., 2014; Mallia et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the destabilization is further compounded by impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a Wang et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2019) . All these may gradually lead to more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles (Teo et al., 2018) . These changes may in turn result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between virus and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Wark et al., 2013; Singanayagam et al., 2018) . To counteract these effects, microbiome-based therapies are in their infancy but have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome (Bakken et al., 2011) . Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection. Viral infections can cause the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier. Ciliary proteins FIGURE 2 | Changes in the upper airway epithelium contributing to viral exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. The upper airway epithelium is the primary contact/infection site of most respiratory viruses. Therefore, its infection by respiratory viruses may have far reaching consequences in augmenting and synergizing current and future acute exacerbations. The destruction of epithelial barrier, mucociliary function and cell death of the epithelial cells serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. The opening of tight junction increasing the leakiness further augments the inflammation and exacerbations. In addition, viral infections are usually accompanied with oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. Finally, the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promotes growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome. Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection. Viral specific trait contributing to exacerbation mechanism (with literature evidence) Oxidative stress ROS production (RV, RSV, IFV, HSV)As RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation (see text for abbreviations). that aid in the proper function of the motile cilia in the airways are aberrantly expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells which are the major target for RV infection (Griggs et al., 2017) . Such form of secondary cilia dyskinesia appears to be present with chronic inflammations in the airway, but the exact mechanisms are still unknown (Peng et al., , 2019 Qiu et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, it was found that in viral infection such as IFV, there can be a change in the metabolism of the cells as well as alteration in the ciliary gene expression, mostly in the form of down-regulation of the genes such as dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) and multiciliate differentiation And DNA synthesis associated cell cycle protein (MCIDAS) (Tan et al., 2018b . The recently emerged Wuhan CoV was also found to reduce ciliary beating in infected airway epithelial cell model (Zhu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, viral infections such as RSV was shown to directly destroy the cilia of the ciliated cells and almost all respiratory viruses infect the ciliated cells (Jumat et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) . In addition, mucus overproduction may also disrupt the equilibrium of the mucociliary function following viral infection, resulting in symptoms of acute exacerbation (Zhu et al., 2009) . Hence, the disruption of the ciliary movement during viral infection may cause more foreign material and allergen to enter the airway, aggravating the symptoms of acute exacerbation and making it more difficult to manage. The mechanism of the occurrence of secondary cilia dyskinesia can also therefore be explored as a means to limit the effects of viral induced acute exacerbation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional modulation of biological processes, and implicated in a number of diseases (Tan et al., 2014) . miRNAs are found to be induced by viral infections and may play a role in the modulation of antiviral responses and inflammation (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018) . In the case of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, circulating miRNA changes were found to be linked to exacerbation of the diseases (Wardzynska et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is likely that such miRNA changes originated from the infected epithelium and responding immune cells, which may serve to further dysregulate airway inflammation leading to exacerbations. Both IFV and RSV infections has been shown to increase miR-21 and augmented inflammation in experimental murine asthma models, which is reversed with a combination treatment of anti-miR-21 and corticosteroids (Kim et al., 2017) . IFV infection is also shown to increase miR-125a and b, and miR-132 in COPD epithelium which inhibits A20 and MAVS; and p300 and IRF3, respectively, resulting in increased susceptibility to viral infections (Hsu et al., 2016 (Hsu et al., , 2017 . Conversely, miR-22 was shown to be suppressed in asthmatic epithelium in IFV infection which lead to aberrant epithelial response, contributing to exacerbations (Moheimani et al., 2018) . Other than these direct evidence of miRNA changes in contributing to exacerbations, an increased number of miRNAs and other non-coding RNAs responsible for immune modulation are found to be altered following viral infections (Globinska et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2018; Hasegawa et al., 2018) . Hence non-coding RNAs also presents as targets to modulate viral induced airway changes as a means of managing exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Other than miRNA modulation, other epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation may also play a role in exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Recent epigenetic studies have indicated the association of epigenetic modification and chronic airway inflammatory diseases, and that the nasal methylome was shown to be a sensitive marker for airway inflammatory changes (Cardenas et al., 2019; Gomez, 2019) . At the same time, it was also shown that viral infections such as RV and RSV alters DNA methylation and histone modifications in the airway epithelium which may alter inflammatory responses, driving chronic airway inflammatory diseases and exacerbations (McErlean et al., 2014; Pech et al., 2018; Caixia et al., 2019) . In addition, Spalluto et al. (2017) also showed that antiviral factors such as IFNγ epigenetically modifies the viral resistance of epithelial cells. Hence, this may indicate that infections such as RV and RSV that weakly induce antiviral responses may result in an altered inflammatory state contributing to further viral persistence and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Spalluto et al., 2017) .Question: What do the necroptotic factors such as RIP3 do?","answer":"further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Risk stratification at hospital admission is of vital importance for medical decision making and resource allocation. There is no sophisticated tool for this purpose. This study aimed to develop neural network models with predictors selected by genetic algorithms (GA). Methods: This study was conducted in Wuhan Third Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020. Predictors were collected on day 1 of hospital admission. The primary outcome was the vital status at hospital discharge. Predictors were selected by using GA, and neural network models were built with the cross-validation method. The final neural network models were compared with conventional logistic regression models. Results: A total of 246 patients with COVID-19 were included for analysis. The mortality rate was 17.1% (42/246). Non-survivors were significantly older (median (IQR): 69 (57, 77) vs. 55 (41, 63) years; p < 0.001), had higher high-sensitive troponin I (0.03 (0, 0.06) vs. 0 (0, 0.01) ng/L; p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (85.75 (57.39, 164.65) vs. 23.49 (10.1, 53.59) mg/L; p < 0.001), D-dimer (0.99 (0.44, 2.96) vs. 0.52 (0.26, 0.96) mg/L; p < 0.001), and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (306.5 (268.75, 377.25) vs. 194.5 (160.75, 247.5); p < 0.001) and a lower level of lymphocyte count (0.74 (0.41, 0.96) vs. 0.98 (0.77, 1.26) x 10(9)/L; p < 0.001) than survivors. The GA identified a 9-variable (NNet1) and a 32-variable model (NNet2). The NNet1 model was parsimonious with a cost on accuracy; the NNet2 model had the maximum accuracy. NNet1 (AUC: 0.806; 95% CI [0.693-0.919]) and NNet2 (AUC: 0.922; 95% CI [0.859-0.985]) outperformed the linear regression models. Conclusions: Our study included a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Several risk factors were identified considering both clinical and statistical significance. We further developed two neural network models, with the variables selected by using GA. The model performs much better than the conventional generalized linear models.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\", \\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

However, there have been several reports of its adverse reactions, namely photosensitivity with intense inflammatory rashes and subsequent skin cancer development. To assess the effects of photosensitizing drugs voriconazole and hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) on the enhancement of UV-induced inflammatory responses and UV-induced tumorigenesis , we utilized Xpa-knockout mice , which is DNA repair-deficient and more susceptible to UV-induced inflammation and tumor development than wild-type mice . Administration of voriconazole prior to broadband UVB exposure significantly upregulated multiple inflammatory cytokines compared with the vehicle- or HCTZ-administered groups. voriconazole administration along with chronic UVB exposure produced significantly higher number of skin tumors than HCTZ or vehicle in Xpa-knockout mice. Furthermore, the investigation of UVB-induced DNA damage using embryonic fibroblasts of Xpa-knockout mice revealed a significantly higher 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine level in cells treated with voriconazole N-oxide, a voriconazole-metabolite during UV exposure.

Sinapic acid is a member of the phenylpropanoid family and is abundant in cereals, nuts, oil seeds, and berries. It exhibits a wide range of pharmacological properties. In this study, we investigated the hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects of sinapic acid on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) -induced chronic liver injury in rats. Sinapic acid remarkably prevented DMN-induced loss of body weight. This was accompanied by a significant increase in levels of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and liver malondialdehyde content. Furthermore, sinapic acid reduced hepatic hydroxyproline content, which correlated with a reduction in the expression of type I collagen mRNA and histological analysis of collagen in liver tissue. Additionally, the expression of hepatic fibrosis-related factors such as α-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), were reduced in rats treated with sinapic acid. Sinapic acid exhibited strong scavenging activity. In conclusion, we find that sinapic acid exhibits hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects against DMN-induced liver injury, most likely due to its antioxidant activities of scavenging radicals, its capacity to suppress TGF-β1 and its ability to attenuate activation of hepatic stellate cells.

To assess the effects of peripheral venous catheter dressings and securement devices on the incidence of peripheral venous catheter failure. We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE; EMBASE and CINAHL for any randomised controlled trials comparing different dressings or securement devices used to stabilise peripheral venous catheters. The reference lists of included studies were also searched for any previously unidentified studies. We included six randomised controlled trials (1539 participants) that compared various dressings and securement devices (transparent dressings versus gauze; bordered transparent dressings versus a securement device; bordered transparent dressings versus tape; and transparent dressing versus sticking plaster). Trial sizes ranged from 50 to 703 participants. The quality of evidence ranged from low to very low. Catheter dislodgements or accidental removals were lower with transparent dressings compared with gauze (two studies, 278 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.92, P=0.03%). However, the relative effects of transparent dressings and gauze on phlebitis (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.47-1.68) and infiltration (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.48-1.33) are unclear. A single study identified less frequent dislodgement or accidental catheter removal with bordered transparent dressings compared to a securement device (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.63) but more phlebitis with bordered dressings (RR 8.11, 95% CI 1.03-64.02). A comparison of a bordered transparent dressing and tape found more peripheral venous catheter failure with the bordered dressing (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.08-3.11) but the relative effect on dislodgement was unclear. There is no strong evidence to suggest that any one dressing or securement product for preventing peripheral venous catheter failure is more effective than any other product. All of the included trials were small, had high or unclear risk of bias for one or more of the quality elements we assessed, and wide confidence intervals, indicating that further randomised controlled trials are necessary. There is a need for suitably powered, high quality trials to evaluate the newer, high use products and novel - but expensive - securement methods, such as surgical grade glue.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"infiltration\\", \\"phlebitis\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"accidental catheter removal\\", \\"stabilise\\", \\"very low\\", \\"found\\", \\"accidental removals\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"treatment\\", \\"venous catheterisation\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"dislodgement\\", \\"dislodgements\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"EMBASE\\", \\"CINAHL\\", \\"reference\\", \\"lists\\", \\"Cochrane Wounds Group Register\\", \\"Cochrane systematic review\\", \\"MEDLINE\\", \\"meta-analysis\\", \\"Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [\\"transparent dressing\\", \\"Catheter\\", \\"tape\\", \\"sticking plaster\\", \\"securement device\\", \\"transparent dressings\\", \\"venous catheters\\", \\"gauze\\", \\"Devices\\", \\"venous catheter\\", \\"securement devices\\"], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"participants\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"unidentified studies\\", \\"studies\\", \\"randomised controlled trials\\", \\"high quality trials\\", \\"trials\\", \\"single study\\", \\"Trial\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"Peripheral\\", \\"bordered\\", \\"wide\\", \\"peripheral\\", \\"ends\\", \\"further\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Implications for the use of unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins as therapeutic agents. The selectins are calcium-dependent C-type lectins that bind certain sialylated, fucosylated, sulfated glycoprotein ligands. L-selectin also recognizes endothelial proteoglycans in a calcium-dependent manner, via heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains enriched in unsubstituted glucosamine units. We now show that these HS chains can also bind P-selectin, but not E-selectin. However, while L-selectin binding requires micromolar levels of free calcium, P-selectin recognition is largely divalent cation-independent. Despite this, HS chains bound to P-selectin are eluted by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), but only at high concentrations. Porcine intestinal mucosal (mast cell-derived) heparin (PIM-heparin) shows similar properties, with no binding to E-selectin, calcium-dependent binding of a subfraction to L-selectin and to P-selectin, and calcium-independent binding of a larger fraction to P-selectin, the latter being disrupted by high EDTA concentrations. Analysis of defined heparin fragment pools shows a size dependence for interaction, with tetradecasaccharides showing easily detectable binding to L- and P-selectin affinity columns. L-selectin binding fragments include more heavily sulfated and epimerized regions and, as with the endothelial HS chains, they are enriched in free amino groups. The P-selectin binding component includes this fraction as well as some less highly modified regions. Thus, endothelium-derived HS chains and mast cell-derived heparins could play a role in modulating the biology of selectins in vivo. Notably, P- and L-selectin binding to sialyl-Lewisx and to HL-60 cells (which are known to carry the native ligand PSGL-1) is inhibited by unfractionated pharmaceutical heparin preparations at concentrations 12-50-fold lower than those recommended for effective anticoagulation in vivo. In contrast, two low molecular weight heparins currently considered as clinical replacements for unfractionated heparin are much poorer inhibitors. Thus, patients undergoing heparin therapy for other reasons may be experiencing clinically significant inhibition of L- and P-selectin function, and the current switchover to low-molecular weight heparins may come at some loss of this effect. Low-dose unfractionated heparin should be investigated as a treatment option for acute and chronic diseases in which P- and L-selectin play pathological roles.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) generally have a high risk of relapsing locally after primary tumor resection. The search for new predictive markers of local recurrence thus represents an important goal for the management of this disease. We studied the copy number variations (CNVs) of 24 oncogenes (MDM4, MYCN, ALK, PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, DHFR, EGFR, MET, SMO, FGFR1, MYC, ABL1, RET, CCND1, CCND2, CDK4, MDM2, AURKB, ERBB2, TOP2A, AURKA, AR and BRAF) using multiplex ligation probe amplification technique to verify their role as predictive markers of recurrence. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 43 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) were used; 23 patients had relapsed and 20 were disease-free after 5 years. Amplification frequencies were analyzed for all genes and MDM4 was the only gene that showed significantly higher amplification in non recurrent patients than in recurrent ones (0.65 vs. 0.3; Fisher's test p=0.023). Recurrence-free survival analysis confirmed the predictive role of MDM4 (log-rank test p=0.041). Our preliminary results indicate a putative role for the MDM4 gene in predicting local recurrence of bladder cancer. Confirmation of this hypothesis is needed in a larger cohort of NMIBC patients.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"TOP2A\\", \\"RET\\", \\"KIT\\", \\"KDR\\", \\"CCND2\\", \\"AR\\", \\"FGFR1\\", \\"SMO\\", \\"MDM2\\", \\"BRAF\\", \\"CCND1\\", \\"ERBB2\\", \\"MET\\", \\"ABL1\\", \\"CDK4\\", \\"MYCN\\", \\"ALK\\", \\"oncogenes\\", \\"MYC\\", \\"DHFR\\", \\"AURKB\\", \\"AURKA\\", \\"MDM4\\", \\"PDGFRA\\", \\"EGFR\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

SPOP( Speckle-type POZ Protein) was one of the most frequently mutated genes in primary prostate cancer, suggesting SPOP is a potential driver of prostate cancer development and progression. However, how SPOP mutations contribute to prostate cancer pathogenesis remains poorly understood. SPOP acts as an adaptor protein of the CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that generally recruits substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. ER-localized isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2( INF2) mediates actin polymerization at ER-mitochondria intersections and facilitates DRP1 recruitment to mitochondria, which is a critical step in mitochondrial fission. Here, we revealed that SPOP recognizes a Ser/Thr( S/T)-rich motif in the C-terminal region of INF2 and triggers atypical polyubiquitination of INF2. These ubiquitination modifications do not lead to INF2 instability, but rather reduces INF2 localization in ER and mitochondrially associated DRP1 puncta formation, therefore abrogates its ability to facilitate mitochondrial fission. INF2 mutant escaping from SPOP-mediated ubiquitination is more potent in prompting mitochondrial fission. Moreover, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants increase INF2 localization in ER and promote mitochondrial fission, probably through a dominant-negative effect to inhibit endogenous SPOP. Moreover, INF2 is important for SPOP inactivation-induced prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. These findings reveal novel molecular events underlying the regulation of INF2 function and localization, and provided insights in understanding the relationship between SPOP mutations and dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics in prostate cancer.Introduction:Large-scale exome/genome sequencing studies have recently revealed that recurrent mutations in the SPOP gene occur in up to 15% of prostate cancers[1–4]. Interestingly, the SPOP mutant subset of prostate cancers had some notable molecular features, including mutual exclusivity with ERG gene rearrangement, elevated levels of DNA methylation, homogeneous gene expression patterns, frequent deletion of CHD1 and overexpression of SPINK1 mRNA, supporting the concept that SPOP mutation tumors represent a distinct molecular subclass of prostate cancer[4] SPOP is one of the adaptor proteins of the CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. It selectively recruits substrates via its N-terminal MATH domain, whereas its BTB and BACK domains mediate oligomerization and interaction with CUL3[5]. SPOP has been linked to the ubiquitination and degradation of several substrates, including the steroid receptor coactivator 3( SRC-3), androgen receptor( AR), DEK, ERG, SENP7 and several others[6–11]. All prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations identified so far affect evolutionarily conserved residues in the MATH domain, suggesting that these mutations may alter the interaction of SPOP with its substrates[1–4]. Inactivation of SPOP by knockdown or overexpression of prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants leads to increased prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, implying SPOP is a tumor suppressor[2, 8–10]. However, limited numbers of SPOP substrates have been identified and functionally explored. Mitochondria are highly motile organelles that undergo constant fission and fusion, and are actively transported to specific subcellular locations[12]. Unbalanced mitochondrial fission and fusion events are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and frequently linked to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cancer[12, 13]. The majority of studies that have explored mitochondrial morphology in tumor cells support a pro-tumorigenic role for mitochondrial fission and tumor suppressor role for mitochondrial fusion[14]. Mitochondrial fragmentation has been observed in various types of tumor cells[15–17]. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission decreases cell proliferation, migration and invasion in various cancer models including lung, colon, breast, thyroid cancer and glioblastoma[16–20]. While cancer is a disease characterized by multiple genetic aberrations, little is known about whether cancer-associated mutations can directly affect mitochondrial dynamics, and how this impacts upon tumor phenotypes. Inverted formin 2( INF2) is a unique vertebrate formin protein that accelerates both actin polymerization and depolymerization[21]. In mammalian cells, INF2 can be expressed as two C-terminal splice variants: the prenylated( CAAX) isoform, which is tightly bound to endoplasmic reticulum( ER)[22], and the nonCAAX isoform, which is cytoplasmic[23]. Recent studies have persuasively showed in mammalian cells that actin polymerization mediated by ER-localized INF2 CAAX isoform is required for mitochondrial fission[24]. By contrast, the cellular function of the nonCAAX isoform of INF2 has been less characterized. Suppression of INF2-nonCAAX isoform in cells causes Golgi dispersal, suggesting INF2 might be involved in maintenance of Golgi architecture[23]. Mutations in INF2 are linked to two human genetic diseases: focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis( FSGS), a degenerative kidney disease[25], and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease( CMTD), a neurological disorder[26]. However, little is known about how INF2 protein is physiologically regulated. In this study, we demonstrate that SPOP suppresses mitochondrial fission by promoting atypical ubiquitination and relocalization of ER-localized INF2. Moreover, this effect is abrogated by the prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations. Thus, our results provide a functional link between SPOP mutations and dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics in prostate cancer.Discussion:Although SPOP mutation is now recognized as a distinct molecular feature in a subtype of prostate cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood[4]. Previous studies showed that SPOP inactivation increased cell proliferation primarily in AR-positive prostate cancer cells, but increased prostate cell migration and invasion in an AR-independent manner[2, 9, 10]. These effects were partly dependent on stabilization of SPOP substrates such as AR and ERG[9, 10]. ERG up-regulation leads to transactivation of its target genes, including ADAMTS1, CXCR4, OPN and MMP9, all of which play important roles in promoting cell migration and invasion[9, 10]. In this study, we revealed that the ER-localized isoform of the INF2 is ubiquitinated and regulated by SPOP. SPOP inactivation-induced prostate cancer cell migration and invasion is partly mediated by INF2 and mitochondrial fission( Fig 9). In the past few years, there is accumulating evidence that mitochondrial fission and fusion play active roles in regulation of cell movement, migration and invasion[14, 31]. For example, there are higher levels of DRP1 and less Mfn1( a GTPase for mitochondrial fusion) in the metastatic breast cancer cells compared with non-metastatic breast cancer cells. 18 Silencing DRP1 or overexpression of Mfn1 results in mitochondrial fusion, and significantly suppresses migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells[18]. Similar effect has been detected in glioblastoma and lung or thyroid cancer[17, 19, 20]. The possible mechanism for mitochondrial fission-enhanced cell movement is that mitochondria are usually trafficked to sites of high-energy demand, and in migrating cells, mitochondria are more frequently located at their leading edge where demands high energy[14, 32]. Our study, for the first time, links prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations to mitochondrial dynamics-related cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that aberrant activation of MAPK signaling by K-Ras( G12V) mutation in pancreatic cancer activates DRP1 via ERK-mediated phosphorylation, and DRP1-meditated mitochondrial fission is crucial for Ras-driven transformation[33]. Similarly, BRAF( V600E), the most common mutation in melanoma, correlates with DRP1 phosphorylation in melanoma tumor tissues, whereas MAPK inhibition reverses DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, and sensitizes cells to mitochondrial-targeting drugs[34]. Therefore, cancer-associated mutations may promote mitochondrial fission through multiple signaling pathways in different tumors. It also should be noted that SPOP can ubiquitinate the cytoplasmic INF2 non-CAAX isoform similar as the ER-localized INF2 CAAX isoform( Fig 2F). A recent study revealed that a proportion of cytoplasmic INF2 was localized in focal adhesion( FA) and the protruding edge of migrating cells[35]. We cannot rule out the possibility that SPOP-mediated ubiquitination of INF2 non-CAAX isoform also affects cell migration and invasion. Ubiquitination has critical functions in nearly all aspects of biological processes. Although ubiquitination is traditionally thought to only target proteins for degradation, recent studies suggest additional roles of ubiquitination in nonproteolytic functions involved in protein function regulation[36]. It is well known that K48-linked polyUb ubiquitin chains are sufficient to target substrates to the 26S proteasome for degradation and that K63-linked polyUb ubiquitin chains have been demonstrated to regulate a variety of nonproteolytic cellular functions, though the roles of other atypical ubiquitin linkages through M1, K6, K11, K27, K29 or K33 or mixed linkages within the same chain remain poorly understood[36]. Previous studies demonstrated that the mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase MITOL regulates mitochondrial-ER membrane bridges through K63-linked ubiquitination of mitochondrial Mfn2( a GTPase for mitochondrial fission), suggesting that atypical ubiquitination plays roles in mitochondrial dynamics[37]. In this study, we demonstrated SPOP catalyzes synthesis of mixed-linkage polyUb chains( K27, K29, K33, K48 and K63) on INF2, which does not trigger INF2 degradation. Instead, these forms of ubiquitination cause INF2 dissociation from ER and impair its ability to promote mitochondrial fission. Until now, the majorities of known SPOP substrates are ubiquitinated and degraded by SPOP. But a previous study showed that SPOP is able to ubiquitinate the PcG protein BMI1 and the histone variant MacroH2A. These ubiquitinations do not affect the overall stability of BMI1 or MacroH2A, but facilitates PcG-mediated transcriptional repression and deposition of MacroH2A during stable X chromosome inactivation process[38]. These data and others reinforce a notion that SPOP can promote both degradative or non-degradative ubiquitination towards different substrates. Moreover, it is also possible that unknown deubiquitinase( s) might exist to recycle INF2 from cytoplasmic speckles to ER. Another interesting aspect of our work that needs further investigation is the potential molecular mechanism that accounts for nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of SPOP. One study demonstrated that hypoxia condition promotes SPOP cytoplasmic accumulation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma( ccRCC) cells[39]. However, our preliminary results found that hypoxia treatment did not affect SPOP localization at least, in prostate cancer cells( S7 Fig). Considering that SPOP-mediated suppression of mitochondrial fission is strictly dependent on its cytoplasmic localization, elucidation the molecular mechanisms of cytoplasmic accumulation of SPOP is an important direction to pursue in the future. Moreover, three prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants( Y87N, F125V and F133L) nearly lost their cytoplasmic localization compared with wild-type SPOP. It is possible that these mutations impair the capacity of SPOP to interact with proteins which facilitate cytoplasmic retention of SPOP. Our results showed that deletion of the NLS sequence forced prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants to localize in cytosol as puncta, but these mutants cannot alter the ER localization of INF2 like SPOP-WT( Fig 7B). So it is possible that the direct interaction with some cytoplasmic substrates of SPOP, including but not limited to INF2, may cause a pool of SPOP to accumulate in cytosol by blocking access to Importin proteins. Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants lost the capacity to interact with its cytoplasmic binding partner, and localized exclusively in the nucleus. Taken together, our data suggest SPOP might exert its tumor-suppressive roles both in nucleus and cytoplasm.","answer":"Prostate cancer is the leading cause of global cancer-related death .

circumscribed nests of epithelioid and spindled cells .these subtypes generally stain positive for s-100 , collagen type iv , and nerve growth factor , and do not stain for epithelial membrane antigen or markers of histiocytic differentiation .these lesions are best considered nerve sheath myxomas , as they demonstrate features of peripheral nerve differentiation including consistent s-100 positivity .cellular neurothekeomas were first described by rosati in 1986 , but the histogenesis of the neoplasm remains ill -

Using high-resolution ultrasound , we examined the role of endothelial mediators in radial artery dilatation in response to transient ( short period of reactive hyperemia ) and sustained ( prolonged period of reactive hyperemia , h and warming , or an incremental infusion of acetylcholine into the distal radial artery ) hyperemia . After short episodes of reactive hyperemia , FMD was abolished by local infusion of the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor NGmonomethyl-l-arginine ( 5.3±1.2 % versus 0.7±0.7 % , P < 0.001 ) . In contrast , basal vessel diameter and dilatation after prolonged episodes of reactive hyperemia , h and warming , and distal infusion of acetylcholine were not attenuated by nitric oxide synthesis inhibition . Inhibition of cyclooxygenase or local autonomic nervous system blockade also had no effect on FMD .  Patients with hypercholesterolemia exhibited reduced FMD in response to transient hyperemia , but the response to sustained hyperemia was normal . These data suggest heterogeneity of endothelial responses to blood flow that are dependent on the characteristics of the flow stimulus . Dilatation after brief episodes of hyperemia is mediated by release of nitric oxide , whereas dilatation during sustained hyperemia is unaffected by NO synthesis inhibition . Hypercholesterolemia seems to differentially affect these pathways with impairment of the nitric oxide – dependent pathway and preservation of non nitric oxide – mediated dilatation to sustained flow stimuliTitle 2:Flow-mediated vasodilation is not impaired when HDL-cholesterol is lowered by substituting carbohydrates for monounsaturated fat.Abstract 2:Low-fat diets , in which carbohydrates replace some of the fat , decrease serum cholesterol . This decrease is due to decreases in LDL-cholesterol but in part to possibly harmful decreases in HDL-cholesterol . High-oil diets , in which oils rich in monounsaturated fat replace some of the saturated fat , decrease serum cholesterol mainly through LDL-cholesterol . We used these two diets to investigate whether a change in HDL-cholesterol would change flow-mediated vasodilation , a marker of endothelial function . We fed thirty-two healthy volunteers two controlled diets in a weeks ' r and omised cross-over design to eliminate variation in changes due to differences between subjects . The low-fat diet contained 59.7 % energy ( en% ) as carbohydrates and 25.7 en% as fat ( 7.8 en% as monounsaturates ) ; the oil-rich diet contained 37.8 en% as carbohydrates and 44.4 en% as fat ( 19.3 en% as monounsaturates ) . Average ( sd ) serum HDL-cholesterol after the low-fat diet was 0.21 ( sd 0.12 ) mmol/l ( 8.1 mg/dl ) lower than after the oil-rich diet .  Serum triacylglycerols were 0.22 ( sd 0.28 ) mmol/l ( 19.5 mg/dl ) higher after the low-fat diet than after the oil-rich diet .  Serum LDL and homocysteine concentrations remained stable . Flow-mediated vasodilation was 4.8 ( SD 2.9 ) after the low-fat diet and 4.1 ( SD 2.7 ) after the oil-rich diet ( difference 0.7 % ; 95 % CI -0.6 , 1.9 ) . Thus , although the low-fat diet produced a lower HDL-cholesterol than the high-oil diet , flow-mediated vasodilation , an early marker of cardiovascular disease , was not impairedTitle 3:Measures of Reliability in Sports Medicine and ScienceAbstract 3:Abstract Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test , assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals . Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical setting s. The main measures of reliability are within-subject r and om variation , systematic change in the mean , and retest correlation . A simple , adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical ( st and ard ) error of measurement : the st and ard deviation of an individual ’s repeated measurements . For many measurements in sports medicine and science , the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation ( percentage of the mean ) . A biased , more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement : the 95 % likely range of change of an individual ’s measurements between 2 trials . Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning , motivation or fatigue ; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation . Retest correlation is difficult to interpret , mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants . Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring individuals , comparison of tests or equipment , estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment . Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials . Studies aim ed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex design s and analyses that research ers seldom perform correctly . A wider underst and ing of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the st and ard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplinesTitle 4:Reproducibility of the flow-mediated dilation response to acute exercise in overweight men.Abstract 4:Flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) has been established as a reliable noninvasive measurement of endothelial function . The reproducibility of FMD under resting conditions has previously been reported ; however , the reproducibility of FMD in response to exercise remains to be investigated . On two separate days , we determined if flow-mediated dilation is reproducible in response to acute exercise in nine overweight men . Following pre-exercise FMD measurements , subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill for 45 min at 50 % of their VO(2)peak . Subsequently ,  FMD  was measured immediately , and every hour for 3 h thereafter . Reproducibility of FMD following exercise was assessed utilizing : ( 1 ) a two-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , ( 2 ) Intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC ) , ( 3 ) Pearson correlations ( r ) , and ( 4 ) coefficient of variation ( CV % ) and coefficient of variation prime ( CV ' ) for FMD at each time-period . Four acceptable reproducibility assessment s were required to confirm FMD reproducibility in response to acute exercise . No differences ( F(1,8 ) = .01 ; p = 0.942 ) in FMD were observed between trials collapsing for time . All the ICC(FMD ) fell within the reproducible criterion set and are as follows : pre-exercise 0.602 , immediately post 0.840 , 1 h post 0.632 , 2 h post 0.724 and 3 h post 0.631 . The correlation and the average CV% for FMD between trials was 0.579 % and 25.2 % , respectively . The FMD response to an acute bout of moderate treadmill exercise appears to be as reproducible as FMD measured during resting conditions . The findings of the present study support the use of FMD as an outcome variable in response to acute exerciseTitle 5:A rapid and reproducible on line automated technique to determine endothelial functionAbstract 5:Objective : To evaluate clinical ly a new on line , automated technique to measure flow mediated dilatation ( FMD ) as a marker of endothelial function . Design : Prospect i ve study . Patients : 12 healthy volunteers and 12 patients with significant , angiographically documented coronary artery disease . Interventions : Brachial arteries were imaged using a st and ard vascular ultrasound system with a 5–12 MHz linear transducer . Arterial diameter was measured on line ( in real time ) by connecting the ultrasound system to a personal computer equipped with a frame grabber and artery wall detection software ( VIA ) specially developed by the authors ’ group . By using this new technique , FMD was measured following 4.5 minutes of ischaemia of the proximal forearm in all subjects on two separate days . Results : The mean ( SD ) day to day variability in FMD measurements was 0.90 (0.48)%,which compares very favourably with current methods . The FMD measurement was available within seconds of completing the scan . Conclusions : Personal computer based automated techniques to assess FMD involve image acquisition and recording after which a second ( off line ) image interpretation session is required . The need for off line analysis makes current methods time consuming and increases the variability of measurement . This on line , automated analysis technique for FMD assessment reduces the variability and greatly increases the speed of measurement . Using this system may mean that fewer patients will be required in clinical trials assessing the effects of interventions on endothelial function . Adopting this method may also facilitate the screening of larger numbers of subjects for endothelial dysfunctionTitle 6:Variability of flow-mediated dilation measurements with repetitive reactive hyperemiaAbstract 6:To capture the response of an acute intervention , multiple post intervention measurements of flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) must be performed . The effect of repetitive reactive hyperemia on endothelial function and the measurement of FMD are unknown . The purpose of this investigation was ( 1 ) to examine the effect of repetitive reactive hyperemia on brachial artery FMD and ( 2 ) to determine whether brachial artery FMD is stable during a 2-h morning period . We investigated FMD in 20 apparently healthy college students on three r and omized treatment days every 30 min ( T30 ) , 60 min ( T60 ) , and 120 min ( T120 ) throughout a 2-h morning period ( 08.00 h to 10.00 h ) . An ANOVA ( p > 0.05 ) and ICC ( > 0.40 ) were both needed to confirm no difference among repetitive reactive hyperemia treatments . In response to repetitive reactive hyperemia , there was no difference ( p = 0.307 ; ICC > 0.40 ) within the first and last FMD measurements of each treatment condition or between treatment conditions ( p = 0.344 ; ICC > 0.40 ) . FMD was similar ( p = 0.348 ) throughout the 2-h morning period . In conclusion , repetitive reactive hyperemia over a 2-h period has no effect on FMD measurements in apparently healthy college students . In addition , this study found no time trends for FMD measurements during the 2-h morning period to allow for pre/post intervention FMD measurementsTitle 7:Evaluation of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the human peripheral circulation.Abstract 7:Flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) in the brachial artery measured by ultrasound , and the increase in forearm blood flow ( FBF ) induced by local infusion of a muscarinic-receptor agonist have both frequently been used to evaluate endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( EDV ) in the human forearm . The present study intended to evaluate the relationship between these techniques and to investigate if vasodilation induced by the muscarinic receptor-agonist methacholine ( MCh ) was owing to production of nitric oxide ( NO ) . FMD during hyperaemia was assessed by ultrasound and FBF was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during local infusion of MCh or L-arginine in the human forearm . Both these methods were applied in 26 individuals . In another 12 individuals forearm arterial and venous plasma concentrations of nitrate/nitrite ( NOx ) were measured together with FBF before and during local MCh infusion . While the change in brachial artery diameter induced by sublingually given nitroglycerine and the vasodilatory response to sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) given locally in the forearm were significantly correlated ( r = 0.70 , P < 0.01 ) , FMD showed no relationship with the vasodilation evoked by MCh ( r = -0.03 ) or L-arginine ( r = 0.04 ) . The five-fold increase in FBF during MCh infusion was associated with a significant increase in venous plasma NOx concentrations ( P < 0.05 ) and a more than 11-fold increase in forearm NOx-release ( P < 0.01 ) . Thus , a significant relationship between the two methods regarding the evaluation of endothelium-independent vasodilation evoked by NO-donors was found , but no relationship was found between the two methods regarding the evaluation of endothelium-dependent vasodilation . Furthermore , vasodilation induced by MCh in the forearm seems to be induced by NO-release","answer":"These data demonstrate that adherence to current expert consensus guidelines and applying contemporary techniques for measuring brachial artery FMD decreases its measurement error"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

TEL is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors that interacts with the mSin3 and SMRT corepressors to regulate transcription. TEL is biallelically disrupted in acute leukemia, and loss of heterozygosity at the TEL locus has been observed in various cancers. Here we show that expression of TEL in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells inhibits cell growth in soft agar and in normal cultures. Unexpectedly, cells expressing both Ras and TEL grew as aggregates. To begin to explain the morphology of Ras-plus TEL-expressing cells, we demonstrated that the endogenous matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin-1 was repressed by TEL. TEL bound sequences in the stromelysin-1 promoter and repressed the promoter in transient-expression assays, suggesting that it is a direct target for TEL-mediated regulation. Mutants of TEL that removed a binding site for the mSin3A corepressor but retained the ETS domain failed to repress stromelysin-1. When BB-94, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, was added to the culture medium of Ras-expressing cells, it caused a cell aggregation phenotype similar to that caused by TEL expression. In addition, TEL inhibited the invasiveness of Ras-transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that TEL acts as a tumor suppressor, in part, by transcriptional repression of stromelysin-1.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"cell\\", \\"cancers\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"acute leukemia\\", \\"cells\\", \\"cultures\\", \\"NIH 3T3 cells\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Several investigations which have taken treatment time into account have shown that the pharmacokinetic parameters , the therapeutic efficacy and even the toxicity of a large number of products may vary according to the administration schedule . The present study was carried out in order to evaluate any circadian changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of ketoprofen , a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) . This randomised crossover study consisted of a single oral dose of ketoprofen 100mg administered to 8 healthy male volunteers , mean age 27.2 years , at 07.00 hours , 13.00 hours , 19.00 hours or 01.00 hours in 4 study periods during the first 3 months of the year . The order of administration was randomised , with each subject acting as his own control . A total of 14 blood and 4 urine samples were taken over a 12-hour period . The peak plasma concentration was twice as high after drug administration at 07.00 hours ( 13.4 +/- 1 mg/L ) than after other administration times ( 13.00 hours : 6.9 +/- 1 ; 19.00 hours : 7.2 +/- 0.7 ; 01.00 hours : 6.3 +/- 0.5 mg/L ) [ p less than 0.001 ] . The time to reach peak concentration was much longer after drug administration at 01.00 hours ( 135 +/- 16.7 min ) than at 07.00 ( 73.1 +/- 14.1 min ) , 13.00 ( 75 +/- 16.5 min ) or 19.00 hours ( 82.5 +/- 12.7 min ) [ p less than 0.05 ] . The lag time was significantly longer at 01.00 hours than at 13.00 hours ( p less than 0.01 ) . The absorption rate constant after treatment at 01.00 hours was less than at the other times of administration ( p less than 0.05 ) . The bodyweight-corrected area under the curve ( AUC0-12 ) was greater after 07.00 hours than after 13.00 ( p less than 0.01 ) or 19.00 hours ( p less than 0.05 ) and greater after 01.00 hours than after 13.00 hours ( p less than 0.05 ) . The elimination half-life was significantly longer after administration at 01.00 hours than after 19.00 hours ( p less than 0.05 ) , while the total clearance was lowest at 07.00 hours . Cosinor analysis demonstrated statistically significant circadian rhythms for all pharmacokinetic parameters described above . The amount of ketoprofen eliminated in the urine was delayed , and was significantly greater after the administration at 01.00 hours than 07.00 hours or 19.00 hours ( p less than 0.01 ) .

[9] , and others [46] formalizing earlier ideas [59, 38] .However, since their inception, these areas have developed largely independently.We explore their relationships (see also [58, 37] ) and highlight opportunities for the transfer of ideas.In identifying these ties, we hope to strengthen this promising, close connection between neuroscience and machine learning, prompting further investigation.We have identified commonalities between predictive coding and VAEs, discussing new frontiers resulting from this perspective.Reuniting these areas may strengthen the connection between neuroscience and machine learning.Further refining this connection could lead to mutual benefits: neuroscience can offer inspiration for investigation in machine learning, and machine learning can evaluate ideas on real-world datasets and environments.Indeed, despite some push back [17] , if predictive coding and related theories [18] are to become validated descriptions of the brain and overcome their apparent generality, they will likely require the computational tools and ideas of modern machine learning to pin down and empirically compare design choices.","answer":"connections between predictive coding and VAEs + new frontiers"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

BACKGROUND: We previously discovered that tetracyclines increase the expression of lipid phosphate phosphatases at the surface of cells. These enzymes degrade circulating lysophosphatidate and therefore doxycycline increases the turnover of plasma lysophosphatidate and decreases its concentration. Extracellular lysophosphatidate signals through six G protein-coupled receptors and it is a potent promoter of tumor growth, metastasis and chemo-resistance. These effects depend partly on the stimulation of inflammation that lysophosphatidate produces. METHODS: In this work, we used a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer to determine the impact of doxycycline on circulating lysophosphatidate concentrations and tumor growth. Cytokine/chemokine concentrations in tumor tissue and plasma were measured by multiplexing laser bead technology. Leukocyte infiltration in tumors was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of IL-6 in breast cancer cell lines was determined by RT-PCR. Cell growth was measured in Matrigel™ 3D culture. The effects of doxycycline on NF-κB-dependent signaling were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Doxycycline decreased plasma lysophosphatidate concentrations, delayed tumor growth and decreased the concentrations of several cytokines/chemokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-9, CCL2, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, G-CSF, LIF, VEGF) in the tumor. These results were compatible with the effects of doxycycline in decreasing the numbers of F4/80(+) macrophages and CD31(+) blood vessel endothelial cells in the tumor. Doxycycline also decreased the lysophosphatidate-induced growth of breast cancer cells in three-dimensional culture. Lysophosphatidate-induced Ki-67 expression was inhibited by doxycycline. NF-κB activity in HEK293 cells transiently expressing a NF-κB-luciferase reporter vectors was also inhibited by doxycycline. Treatment of breast cancer cells with doxycycline also decreased the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and the mRNA levels for IL-6 in the presence or absence of lysophosphatidate. CONCLUSION: These results contribute a new dimension for understanding the anti-inflammatory effects of tetracyclines, which make them potential candidates for adjuvant therapy of cancers and other inflammatory diseases.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"CCL11\\", \\"CXCL9\\", \\"LIF\\", \\"Ki-67\\", \\"IL-1u03b2\\", \\"G-CSF\\", \\"CCL2\\", \\"IL-6\\", \\"NF-u03baB\\", \\"CXCL1\\", \\"VEGF\\", \\"IL-9\\", \\"CXCL2\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

The latent membrane protein LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is often present in EBV-associated malignancies including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Previous work demonstrates that the LMP1 gene of EBV is sufficient to transform certain established rodent fibroblast cell lines and to induce the tumorigenicity of some human epithelial cell lines. In addition, LMP1 plays pleiotropic roles in cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, depending on the background of the target cells. To examine the roles of LMP1 in cell proliferation and growth regulation in primary culture cells, we constructed a recombinant retrovirus containing an LMP1 gene. With this retrovirus, LMP1 was shown to stimulate the proliferation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF cells). It has a mitogenic activity for MEF cells, as demonstrated by an immediate induction of cell doubling time. In addition, it significantly extends the passage number of MEF cells to more than 30 after retroviral infection, compared with less than 5 for uninfected MEF cells. Furthermore, LMP1 cooperates with a p16-insensitive CDK4(R24C) oncogene in transforming MEF cells. Our results provide the first evidence of the abilities of the LMP1 gene, acting alone, to effectively induce the proliferation of primary MEF cells and of its cooperativity with another cellular oncogene in transforming primary cells.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"MEF cells\\", \\"fibroblast cell lines\\", \\"cell\\", \\"cells\\", \\"malignancies\\", \\"epithelial cell lines\\", \\"culture cells\\", \\"embryonic fibroblasts\\", \\"nasopharyngeal carcinoma\\", \\"Hodgkinu0027s lymphoma\\", \\"cellular\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

In contrast, SARS-CoV (lineage B βCoV) and MERS-CoV (lineage C βCoV) may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as diarrhea, lymphopenia, deranged liver and renal function tests, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of ∼10% and ∼35%, respectively [5, 6] . On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [7] . Subsequent virological testing showed that a novel CoV was detected in these patients. As of 16 January 2020, 43 patients have been diagnosed to have infection with this novel CoV, including two exported cases of mild pneumonia in Thailand and Japan [8, 9] . The earliest date of symptom onset was 1 December 2019 [10] . The symptomatology of these patients included fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea. Among 41 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan, 13 (32%) required intensive care and 6 (15%) died. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computerized tomography scans [10] . We recently reported a familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection in a Shenzhen family with travel history to Wuhan [11] . In the present study, we analyzed a 2019-nCoV complete genome from a patient in this familial cluster and compared it with the genomes of related βCoVs to provide insights into the potential source and control strategies. The complete genome sequence of 2019-nCoV HKU-SZ-005b was available at GenBank (accession no. MN975262) ( Table 1 ). The representative complete genomes of other related βCoVs strains collected from human or mammals were included for comparative analysis. These included strains collected from human, bats, and Himalayan palm civet between 2003 and 2018, with one 229E coronavirus strain as the outgroup. Phylogenetic tree construction by the neighbour joining method was performed using MEGA X software, with bootstrap values being calculated from 1000 trees [12] . The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) was shown next to the branches [13] . The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and were in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site [14] . All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [15] . Multiple alignment was performed using CLUSTAL 2.1 and further visualized using BOX-SHADE 3.21. Structural analysis of orf8 was performed using PSI-blast-based secondary structure PREDiction (PSIPRED) [16] . For the prediction of protein secondary structure including beta sheet, alpha helix, and coil, initial amino acid sequences were input and analysed using neural networking and its own algorithm. Predicted structures were visualized and highlighted on the BOX-SHADE alignment. Prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using the TMHMM 2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Secondary structure prediction in the 5 ′ -untranslated region (UTR) and 3 ′ -UTR was performed using the RNAfold WebServer (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/ RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) with minimum free energy (MFE) and partition function in Fold algorithms and Table 2 . Putative functions and proteolytic cleavage sites of 16 nonstructural proteins in orf1a/b as predicted by bioinformatics. Putative function/domain Amino acid position Putative cleave sitecomplex with nsp3 and 6: DMV formationcomplex with nsp3 and 4: DMV formationshort peptide at the end of orf1a basic options. The human SARS-CoV 5 ′ -and 3 ′ -UTR were used as references to adjust the prediction results. The single-stranded RNA genome of the 2019-nCoV was 29891 nucleotides in size, encoding 9860 amino acids. The G + C content was 38%. Similar to other (Table 2 ). There are no remarkable differences between the orfs and nsps of 2019-nCoV with those of SARS-CoV (Table 3) . The major distinction between SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV is in orf3b, Spike and orf8 but especially variable in Spike S1 and orf8 which were previously shown to be recombination hot spots. Spike glycoprotein comprised of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP). We found that the S2 subunit of 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV (Figure 2 ). Thus the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 would be an important preventive and treatment modality for testing in animal models before clinical trials [18] . Though the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV (Figure 3(A) ), the core domain of RBD (excluding the external subdomain) are highly conserved (Figure 3(B) ). Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction with the host receptor. Further investigation of this soluble variable external subdomain region will reveal its receptor usage, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis. Unlike 2019-nCoV and human SARS-CoV, most known bat SARSr-CoVs have two stretches of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) when compared with that of human SARS-CoV. But some Yunnan strains such as the WIV1 had no such deletions and can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor. It is interesting to note that the two bat SARS-related coronavirus ZXC21 and ZC45, being closest to 2019-nCoV, can infect suckling rats and cause inflammation in the brain tissue, and pathological changes in lung & intestine. However, these two viruses could not be isolated in Vero E6 cells and were not investigated further. The two retained deletion sites in the Spike genes of ZXC21 and ZC45 may lessen their likelihood of jumping species barriers imposed by receptor specificity. A novel short putative protein with 4 helices and no homology to existing SARS-CoV or SARS-r-CoV protein was found within Orf3b ( Figure 4 ). It is notable that SARS-CoV deletion mutants lacking orf3b replicate to levels similar to those of wildtype virus in several cell types [19] , suggesting that orf3b is dispensable for viral replication in vitro. But orf3b may have a role in viral pathogenicity as Vero E6 but not 293T cells transfected with a construct expressing Orf3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time points [20] . Orf3b was also shown to inhibit expression of IFN-β at synthesis and signalling [21] . Subsequently, orf3b homologues identified from three bat SARSrelated-CoV strains were C-terminally truncated and lacked the C-terminal nucleus localization signal of SARS-CoV [22] . IFN antagonist activity analysis demonstrated that one SARS-related-CoV orf3b still possessed IFN antagonist and IRF3-modulating activities. These results indicated that different orf3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SARS-related-CoV orf3b function and pathogenesis. The importance of this new protein in 2019-nCoV will require further validation and study. Orf8 orf8 is an accessory protein found in the Betacoronavirus lineage B coronaviruses. Human SARS-CoVs isolated from early-phase patients, all civet SARS-CoVs, and other bat SARS-related CoVs contain fulllength orf8 [23] . However, a 29-nucleotide deletion,Bat SL-CoV ZXC21 2018Bat which causes the split of full length of orf8 into putative orf8a and orf8b, has been found in all SARS-CoV isolated from mid-and late-phase human patients [24] . In addition, we have previously identified two bat SARS-related-CoV (Bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C) and proposed that the original SARS-CoV full-length orf8 is acquired from these two bat SARS-related-CoV [25] . Since the SARS-CoV is the closest human pathogenic virus to the 2019-nCoV, we performed phylogenetic analysis and multiple alignments to investigate the orf8 amino acid sequences. The orf8 protein sequences used in the analysis derived from early phase SARS-CoV that includes full-length orf8 (human SARS-CoV GZ02), the mid-and late-phase SARS-CoV that includes the split orf8b (human SARS-CoV Tor2), civet SARS-CoV (paguma SARS-CoV), two bat SARS-related-CoV containing full-length orf8 (bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C), 2019-nCoV, the other two closest bat SARS-related-CoV to 2019-nCoV SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45), and bat SARS-related-CoV HKU3-1 ( Figure 5(A) ). As expected, orf8 derived from 2019-nCoV belongs to the group that includes the closest genome sequences of bat SARS-related-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45.  Interestingly, the new 2019-nCoV orf8 is distant from the conserved orf8 or Figure 5(B) ) which was shown to trigger intracellular stress pathways and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes [26] , but this is absent in this novel orf8 of 2019-nCoV. Based on a secondary structure prediction, this novel orf8 has a high possibility to form a protein with an alpha-helix, following with a betasheet(s) containing six strands ( Figure 5(C) ). The genome of 2019-nCoV has overall 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-related-CoV SL-CoVZXC21 (MG772934.1), and 82% with human SARS-CoV BJ01 2003 (AY278488) and human SARS-CoV Tor2 (AY274119). The phylogenetic trees constructed using the amino acid sequences of orf1a/b and the 4 structural genes (S, E, M, and N) were shown (Figure 6(A-E) ). For all these 5 genes, the 2019-nCoV was clustered with lineage B βCoVs. It was most closely related to the bat SARS-related CoVs ZXC21 and ZC45 found in Chinese horseshoe As shown in Figure 7 (A-C), the SARS-CoV 5 ′ -UTR contains SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, S5, SL5A, SL5B, SL5C, SL6, SL7, and SL8. The SL3 contains trans-cis motif [27] . The SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, S5, SL5A, SL5B, and SL5C structures were similar among the 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV and the bat SARS-related ZC45. In the 2019-nCoV, part of the S5 found was inside Figure 7 Continued the orf1a/b (marked in red), which was similar to SARS-CoV. In bat SARS-related CoV ZC45, the S5 was not found inside orf1a/b. The 2019-nCoV had the same SL6, SL7, and SL8 as SARS-CoV, and an additional stem loop. Bat SARS-related CoV ZC45 did not have the SARS-COV SL6-like stem loop. Instead, it possessed two other stem loops in this region. All three strains had similar SL7 and SL8. The bat SARS-like CoV ZC45 also had an additional stem loop between SL7 and SL8. Overall, the 5 ′ -UTR of 2019-nCoV was more similar to that of SARS-CoV than the bat SARS-related CoV ZC 45. The biological relevance and effects of virulence of the 5 ′ -UTR structures should be investigated further. The 2019-nCoV had various 3 ′ -UTR structures, including BSL, S1, S2, S3, S4, L1, L2, L3, and HVR (Figure 7(D-F) ). The 3 ′ -UTR was conserved among 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs [27] .Question: What does the orf8 derived from 2019-nCOV belong to?","answer":"the group that includes the closest genome sequences of bat SARS-related-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Performing a root cause analysis (RCA) of serious AEs is one systematic way of determining the causes of these events. Multidisciplinary teams were formed at Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative (MAQI(2)) sites with organized anticoagulation management services (AMS). Medical records from patients who suffered serious AEs (major bleed, embolic stroke, venous thromboembolism) were reviewed, and AMS staff were interviewed to determine the root cause using the \\"5 Whys\\" technique. More than 600 patients had an AE and underwent screening by trained RNs. Of these, 79 required full review by a multidisciplinary panel. All potential contributing factors (comorbidities, concurrent medications, current protocols) were assessed to determine the main factor that caused the AE. Full RCA was completed in 79 cases. The main contributing factor was identified in 69/79 (87%) cases. Most identified AEs, 55/69 (80%), were due to patient - specific factors such as comorbidities. Patient -to- provider and provider -to- provider communication accounted for 16/69 (23%) of events and was the second most common cause. Other causes included protocol non-adherence and technology / equipment issues. After each detailed review, the multidisciplinary panel recommended system changes that addressed the primary cause. The majority of severe AEs for patients taking warfarin were related to nonmodifiable patient -related issues.

Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin 's disease (HIV-HD) displays several peculiarities when compared with HD of the general population. These include overrepresentation of clinically aggressive histologic types and frequent infection of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Recently, we have reported that the histogenesis of HD of the general population may be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of BCL-6, a transcription factor expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells, and of CD138 / syndecan-1 (syn-1), a proteoglycan associated with post-GC, terminal B-cell differentiation. In this study, we have applied these two markers to the study of HIV-HD histogenesis and correlated their expression status to the virologic features of this disease. We have found that RS cells of all histologic categories of HIV-HD consistently display the BCL-6 (-) / syn-1 (+) phenotype and thus reflect post-GC B cells. Although BCL-6 (-) / syn-1 (+) RS cells of HIV-HD express CD40, they are not surrounded by CD40 ligand-positive (CD40L +) reactive T lymphocytes, which, in HD of the general population, are thought to regulate the disease phenotype through CD40 / CD40L interactions. Conversely, RS cells of virtually all HIV-HD express the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which, being functionally homologous to CD40, may contribute, at least in part, to the modulation of the HIV-HD phenotype.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"germinal center (GC) B cells\\", \\"Reed - Sternberg (RS) cells\\", \\"post - GC B cells\\", \\"RS cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"post - germinal center B cells\\", \\"CD40 ligand - positive (CD40L +) reactive T lymphocytes\\", \\"B - cell\\", \\"post - GC B cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"LMP1\\", \\"BCL - 6\\", \\"EBV - encoded latent membrane protein 1\\", \\"CD40 ligand\\", \\"/ CD40L\\", \\"CD138 / syndecan - 1\\", \\"CD40L\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"syn - 1\\", \\"CD40\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

NF of activated T cells (NF-AT) denotes a family of transcription factors that regulate the activation-dependent expression of many immunologically important proteins. At least four distinct genes encode the various family members, and several isoforms of these have been identified as well. The overlapping expression patterns and similar in vitro binding and trans-activation activities on various promoter elements of NF-AT-regulated genes suggest some redundancy in the function of these proteins. However, the phenotypic analysis of NF-AT-deficient mice supports the idea that there are tissue-and gene-specific functions as well. In this study we have characterized the expression of NF-AT cDNAs in murine mast cells. The majority of clones identified correspond to two NF-ATc isoforms that differ only in their amino-terminal sequence. Despite minimal discrepancies in the coding region, there are striking tissue-and cell type-specific differences in isoform expression patterns. Detection of NF-ATc. alpha mRNA is strictly dependent on cell activation signals in both T and mast cell lines. In contrast, the beta isoform is expressed at very low constitutive levels in both cell types but is only up-regulated in response to mast cell activation signals delivered through the FcepsilonRI or via calcium ionophores. These results demonstrate another level of regulation within the NF-AT family that can contribute to cell type-specific gene expression.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"T and mast cell lines\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"mast cells\\", \\"murine T and mast cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"promoter elements\\", \\"coding region\\", \\"NF - AT - regulated genes\\", \\"NF - AT cDNAs\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"NF - AT family\\", \\"NF - ATc isoforms\\", \\"beta isoform\\", \\"immunologically important proteins\\", \\"transcription factors\\", \\"FcepsilonRI\\", \\"NF of activated T cells\\", \\"amino - terminal sequence\\", \\"NF - AT\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"NF - ATc . alpha mRNA\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with a predominant loss of the Purkinje cell. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from mouse Purkinje cells revealed a predominant expression of the alpha1A channel lacking an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in the domain IV (alpha1A(-NP)). Human alpha1A channels carrying various polyglutamine length with or without NP were expressed in HEK293 cells, and channel properties were compared using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique. alpha1A(-NP), corresponding to P-type channel, with 24 and 28 polyglutamines found in patients showed the voltage dependence of inactivation shifting negatively by 6 and 11 mV, respectively, from the 13 polyglutamine control. Contrarily, the alpha1A channel with NP (alpha1A(+NP)), corresponding to Q-type channel, with 28 polyglutamines exhibited a positive shift of 5 mV. These results suggest that altered function of alpha1A(-NP) may contribute to degeneration of Purkinje cells, which express predominantly alpha1A(-NP), due to the reduced Ca(2+) influx resulting from the negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation. On the other hand, other types of neurons, expressing both alpha1A(-NP) and alpha1A(+NP), may survive because the positive shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of alpha1A(+NP) compensates Ca(2+) influx.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel\\", \\"P-type calcium\\", \\"P-type\\", \\"CAG repeat\\", \\"alpha1A\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2010 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Diagnosis was based on routine fetometry at 32 weeks of gestation, in conjunction with general ultrasound screening. 107 patients with suspected IUGR-pregnancies were divided into two groups, 49 in a hospital bedrest group and 58 in an 'out-patient' group. Fifteen women in the bedrest group refused hospitalization, and 8 women in the out-patient group had to be hospitalized for medical reasons other than suspected growth retardation, leaving 79% of the women in their allocated group. The women in the bedrest group were hospitalized for a mean duration of 29.2 days (range 5-54). The results suggest that bedrest in hospital is not beneficial, either to fetal growth or to pregnancy outcome.","answer":"There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of a bed rest in hospital policy for women with suspected impaired fetal growth."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

structure during the stepwise commissioning , the scheme is shown in fig.[bench1 ] .non - destructive devices are used for following tasks : + the _ total current _ is measured using beam transformer @xcite made of vitrovac 6065 core having a @xmath2 differential secondary winding .the resolution is 100 na at a bandwidth of 100 khz . due to a feedback circuitthe droop is less than 1 % for 5 ms macro - pulses .+ the _ beam energy _ is determined by a time - of - flight technique using two 50 @xmath3 matched capacitive pick - ups @xcite with 1 ghz bandwidth , separated by 2 m. a precision of @xmath4 % is achieved .+ the _ beam position _ is monitored by digitizing the power of the @xmath5 harmonics of the rf frequency ( 216 mhz ) of the 4 segments of these pick - ups .+ the _ beam profile _ is determined by a residual gas monitor @xcite , where residual gas ions are detected on a 23 strip printed board . for typical beam parameters no significant broadening of the profiles due to space charge influence is expected . for lower current or shorter macro pulsesconventional profile grids are used .the instruments are now installed behind the last ih2 cavity as well as behind the gas stripper . in the followingwe discuss the measurement in the longitudinal plane using particle detectors and of the transverse emittance using the pepper - pot system .for the comparison to calculations , as well as for matching of different linac structures the knowledge of the bunch shape is important , but measurements are not as common as for the transverse case . at velocities much below the speed of lightthe signal on a transverse pick - up does not represent the details of the bunch shape due to the large longitudinal electric field component .a comparison of the pick - up signal to the bunch shape measured with the method described below is shown in fig.[pick - compare ] for a velocity of @xmath6 % ( 1.4 mev / u ) to visualize the broadening of the pick - up signal detecting bunches with less than 1 ns width .we developed a device where the arrival of the ion in a particle detector is measured with respect to the accelerating rf , see fig.[diamant - phasespace ] .the method demands for less than one ion hit per rf period .this reduction is done by rutherford scattering in a 210 @xmath7g/@xmath8 tantalum foil ( @xmath9 nm thickness ) at a scattering angle of @xmath10 defined by a collimator with 16 cm distance and 0.5 mm apertures to give a solid angle of @xmath11 .the parameters are chosen to get an attenuation of @xmath12 of the beam current .a high target mass is preferred , so the energy spread for a finite solid angle is lower than the required resolution . for our parametersthe largest contribution to the energy spread arises from the electronic stopping in the foil , which amounts e.g. for ar projectiles to @xmath13 % and for u to @xmath14 % ( fwhm ) at 1.4 mev / u .more details can be found in @xcite .beam 3 m behind the ih2 output .( the 50 @xmath3 termination of the pick - up leads to a differentiation),width=207 ]    ) and phase space distribution ( sec.[section - phase - space ] ) measurement with particle detectors.,width=302 ]    a drawback of this method is the high sensitivity of the tantalum foil due to the heating by the ions energy loss .therefore , the beam has to be attenuated , which can be done by defocusing .the device is now installed behind the gas stripper and the first charge separating magnet so that another type of attenuation can be applied by changing the gas pressure or by selecting a different charge state . by this meansalso space charge effects can be studied .another approach would be the use of a supersonic high density xenon gas target instead of the tantalum foil ; estimations of the effect of the larger elongation have to be done .after a drift of @xmath15 m the scattered ions are detected by a cvd diamond detector @xcite . besides the very low radiation damage , we gain mainly from the very fast signals , having a rise time below 1 ns .the conversion to logical pulses is done by a double threshold discriminator @xcite .the logical pulses serve as a start of a vme time - to - digital converter ( caen v488 ) , where the stop is derived from the 36 mhz used for accelerating .the timing resolution of the system is about 25 ps corresponding to a phase width of 0.3@xmath1 .beam is shown , on top the calculated emittance is plotted .on the right the measurement and simulation are shown for a high current of 5 ma ar@xmath16.,width=321 ]    as an example , the bunch structure of a 120 kev / u ar@xmath16 beam at the output of the super lens ( and an additional drift of 2.4 m ) is shown in fig.[sl - variation ] .the two measurements for low ( left ) and high ( right ) current show a quite different bunch shape having a larger , filamented emittance for the low current case .the particle tracking calculation @xcite shows a strong ion current dependence for the longitudinal emittance .the applied rf power in the cavity counteracts the space charge force for a high current beam . for a low current filamentationoccurs due to the missing damping by the space charge .other experimental results can be found in @xcite .the main advantage of using particle detectors is the possibility to measure the longitudinal emittance using a coincidence technique . as shown in fig.[diamant - phasespace ] , a second detector can be moved in the path of the scattered ions .it consists of a 15 @xmath7g/@xmath8 aluminum foil ( @xmath17 nm ) where several secondary electrons per ion passage are generated .these electrons are accelerated by an electric field of 1 kv / cm towards a micro channel plate equipped with a 50 @xmath3 anode ( hamamatsu f4655 - 10 ) .the time relative to the accelerating rf is measured as well as the arrival time of the same particle at the diamond detector located 80 cm behind the mcp . from the difference in time of the _ individual _ particles one can generate a phase space plot .an example of such a measurement is given in fig.[coincidence ] ( left ) for a low current ar beam 2.5 m downstream of the gas stripper .the arrival times at the diamond detector are used as the phase ( or time ) axis having a width of 1.4 ns equals 18@xmath1 phase width . the time difference between diamond and mcpis plotted at the y - axis , the width is about 0.4 ns ( fwhm ) corresponding to an energy spread of @xmath18 % . for a high current beam ( 5 ma before stripping )a double structure is visible in the bunch profile and an energy broadening to @xmath19 % with a clear correlation in the phase space . herethe attenuation is done by selecting a high charge state ( ar@xmath20 ) far from the maximum of the stripping efficiency curve ( ar@xmath21 ) .the measured values are larger by a factor of 2 as expected by tracking calculation .therefore it is believed that some errors contribute to the measurement : having a drift length of only 80 cm between the two detectors and an ion velocity of 5.5 % of the ions ( corresponding to 48 ns time of flight ) the accuracy in time has to be 25 ps to have a precision of @xmath22 of 0.1 % .the imperfections of the device , in particular the lack of homogeneity of the accelerating field for the electrons towards the mcp effect the resolution in time .an optimization has to be done . a large distance ( e.g. 3 m ) between the two detectors would lower the requirement for the time resolution of the detectors .recently it was discovered that there might be some problems inside the stripper @xcite due to inhomogeneity of the gas jet resulting in a wider energy spread as the design value .it is shown , that this type of setup can be used for the determination of the longitudinal emittance at low ion velocities , but a careful design of the components is necessary .for the measurement of the transverse emittance two devices were installed at the diagnostic bench . a conventional slit - grid system @xcite having a coordinate resolution of 0.05 mm and an angular resolution of 0.3 mrad . due to the high beam power, this device can only be used for the lower energy part of the linac . for high current operationwe developed a pepper - pot system capable to measure the emittance within one macro - pulse , see @xcite for more details . herethe coordinates are fixed by a @xmath23 mm@xmath24 copper plate equipped with @xmath25 holes with 0.1 mm . after a drift of 25 cmthe beam - lets are stopped on a al@xmath26o@xmath27 screen .the divergence of the beam is calculated with respect to the image of the pepper - pot pattern .this image is created on the screen with a hene laser , which illuminate the pepper - pot via a pneumatic driven mirror .this calibration eliminate systematic errors due to mechanical uncertainties .a high resolution 12 bit ccd camera ( pco sensicam ) transmits the digital data via fiber optics .a typical image of such a measurement is shown in fig.[trans - emi ] , together with the projection onto the horizontal or vertical axis .this projection is used for the emittance calculation with an algorithm like for the slit - grid device .    for a precise measurementthe beam width should be large enough to illuminate several holes in the pepper - pot plate ( spacing 3 mm ) .this also avoids overheating of the pepper - pot , as well as saturation of the light intensity emitted from the screen .in addition , a background level ( about 5 % ) has to be subtracted from the data , probably caused by scattered light in the screen. therefore the beam optics have to be changed in some cases to use this modern and reliable system for a fast measurement in a high current operation .h. reich , p. sptke and l. dahl , p .sptke , this proceedings w. barth and w. barth , p. forck this proceedings n. scheider , aip proceedings 451 , p. 502p. forck , a. peters , p. strehl , aip proceedings of the beam instrumentation workshop , boston ( 2000 ) .p. forck et al . , proceedings of the @xmath28 dipac , chester , p. 176e. berdermann et al . , _ proc .xxxvi int .winter meeting of nucl ., bormio _ ( 1998 ) . c. neyer , @xmath29 workshop on electronics for lhc experiments , london , cern / lhcc/97 -

Crystallographic and spectroscopic experiments showed that both enantiomers of HPP (2 and 3) act as bidentate ligands to the mononuclear iron, such that only a single hydrogen atom (1-HR for 2 and 2-H for 3) is poised for abstraction by a reactive iron-oxygen species (likely FeIII-OO•).11, 12 These results led to the current working hypothesis for the mechanisms of the HppE-catalyzed reactions shown in Scheme 1.</p><p>Although non-heme iron enzymes are thought to initiate substrate oxidation via hydrogen atom abstraction, leading to the formation of substrate-derived radical intermediates,13 experimental evidence for the involvement of discrete radical intermediates in these enzymatic systems is often lacking.14 Specifically for the HppE-catalyzed reactions, the intermediacy of the proposed substrate radical species (5 and 6) has never been verified experimentally. To address this issue and gain support for the proposed reaction mechanisms, substrate analogues bearing strategically incorporated cyclopropyl or methylenecyclopropyl moieties were prepared and analyzed as mechanistic probes of HppE catalysis. The radical-induced ring opening of cyclopropylcarbinyl or methylenecyclopropylcarbinyl radicals are well known.15, 16 Thus, the detection of ring-opened turnover products or radical induced enzyme inactivation would provide evidence for the occurrence of radical intermediates during catalysis and their lifetimes. In this paper, we report the syntheses of a set of cyclopropyl- and methylenecyclopropyl-containing substrate analogues ((S)-7, (R)-7 and 16), the evaluation of these compounds as radical clock probes for the HppE reaction, and the mechanistic implications of the incubation results.</p><p>The syntheses of (S)-7 and (R)-7 are depicted in Scheme 2. Treatment of the bromo compound 817 with P(OEt)3 under Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction conditions followed by reduction of the resulting phosphonate 9 with NaBH4 gave a racemic mixture of alcohol 10. Resolution of this pair of alcohols was attempted using various lipases. This method attempts to utilize the asymmetric environment in the lipase active site to stereoselectively acetylate one of the enantiomers, rendering the resulting acetate separable from the unreacted alcohol. Unfortunately, all lipase systems tested showed poor stereoselectivity towards 10.18 However, it was later found that efficient resolution of the racemic acetate 11 could be achieved through asymmetric hydrolysis with pig liver esterase. Indeed, after three rounds of acetylation and esterasecatalyzed hydrolysis, both (R)- and (S)-10 were obtained in >94% enantiomeric excess (ee) as determined by 31P NMR analysis using quinine as a chiral shifting reagent (Figure S2.1-1).18c Subsequent deprotection of the phosphonate ethyl ester by TMSBr gave the desired substrate analogues (S)-7 and (R)-7.</p><p>The purified (S)-7 and (R)-7 were each incubated with HppE and the reactions were monitored by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1). Both compounds were found to be substrates of HppE and each was converted to a single product (Scheme 3). A 1,2-epoxide (13) was produced when (S)-7 was employed as the substrate, whereas a keto-product (15) was obtained from the incubation with (R)-7. The chemical nature of these products was further verified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (Figure S5-1), and the structure of 15 was also confirmed by comparison with a synthetic standard. The regio- and stereoselectivity of the turnover of (S)-7 and (R)-7 are consistent with those established for 2 and 3. Notably, the cyclopropyl group is retained in both products (13 and 15).</p><p>The conversion of (S)-7 to 13 is not surprising, since the putative C1 radical intermediate (12) is not expected to affect the cyclopropyl group at the C3 position. However, the conversion of (R)-7 to 15 as the sole product is in contrast to the anticipation that the C2-centered carbinyl radical (i.e. 14), once formed, would trigger ring opening of the adjacent cyclopropyl group. At first glance, this observation appears to contradict the proposed radical-mediated oxidation mechanism. However, the retention of the cyclopropyl group in the product may be ascribed to the subsequent one-electron oxidation step (14→15) being more facile than the competing ring opening reaction.</p><p>Considering that the ring opening rate constant of (methylenecyclopropyl)carbinyl radical (k = 6 × 109 s−1 at 298K)19 is nearly two-order of magnitude greater than that of the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (k = 8.6 × 107 s−1 at 298 K),20 a substrate analogue carrying a methylenecyclopropyl group (16) was designed and synthesized as a more sensitive probe to detect the transient formation of radical intermediate by HppE. The synthetic route to 16 started with nucleophilic addition of methyldiethylphosphonate to ester 17,21 followed by Luche reduction of the resulting ketone (18) to give 19 (Scheme 4). Since attempts to resolve this racemic alcohol using various lipases and esterases failed, 19 was converted to 16 as a racemic mixture. While enantiomerically pure substrates are preferred, experiments performed with the racemic sample can still provide evidence to discern the possible formation of radical intermediates in the HppE-catalyzed reactions.</p><p>When compound 16 was incubated with HppE, formation of a new product was detected by NMR spectroscopy. However, the conversion was incomplete with no further consumption of 16 observed after ~10 min. No fosfomycin formation could be detected when the natural substrate, (S)-HPP (2), was incubated with HppE that had been pretreated with 16, suggesting that this compound (16) also inactivates the enzyme. The fact that 16 can act as both a substrate and an inactivator for HppE may simply be a consequence of the racemic nature of 16 used for these assays. Namely, the outcome of the incubation is governed by the C2 stereochemistry of 16, with one epimer serves as the substrate and the other acts as an inactivator.</p><p>The structure of the turnover product of 16 is a molecule featuring both an epoxide ring and an intact methylenecyclopropyl group. This is supported by the appearance of new peaks at 2.7–2.9 and 5.3 ppm, which are characteristic resonances for the oxiranyl protons and the olefinic protons of a terminal alkene, respectively. By analogy to the reaction with (S)-7, this product may be assigned to the corresponding 1,2-epoxyl compound 20 derived from the (2S)-epimer of 16 (Scheme 5). The presence of 20 in the reaction system was also confirmed using high resolution mass spectrometry ([M-H]− calcd for C6H8O4P−: m/z 175.0166, found: m/z 175.0160) (Figure S5-2).</p><p>As (2S)-16 is likely to be a substrate of HppE, the inactivation of HppE may thus be attributed to the action of (2R)-16. Two mechanistic scenarios can be envisioned for the inactivation of HppE by the 2R-epimer of 16 (Scheme 6). In route a, 16 is first converted to the corresponding 2-oxo phosphonate 24 in a manner analogous to the oxidation of (R)-3 and (R)-7 by HppE. Since the cyclopropyl group of 24 is primed by the newly formed electron-withdrawing 2-keto functionality, it may be susceptible to the attack by an active site nucleophile in a Michael-addition reaction.22 An alternative explanation for the observed inactivation (route b) lies in the ultrafast radical-triggered ring opening of the methylenecyclopropyl group, whereby the C2 radical intermediate (25) rearranges to an allylic radical that inactivates the enzyme.</p><p>In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, the 2-keto product (24) was chemically synthesized and tested as an inhibitor of HppE activity. (S)-HPP (2) was added to the HppE reaction system that had been preincubated with an excess amount of 24 (20-fold excess than enzyme), and the enzyme activity was determined following fosfomycin formation by 1H-NMR (Figure S4-3). No difference in the rate or extent of fosfomycin formation was detected in the presence or absence of 24, clearly indicating that this putative turnover product is not an inactivator of HppE. Therefore, a mechanism initiated by a radical-triggered ring opening is a more likely mode of inactivation of HppE by (R)-17. Consistent with a radical-induced enzyme modification, HppE activity could not be restored after extensive dialysis of the inactivated enzyme. Moreover, given the differences in ring opening rates of the cyclopropylcarbinyl and methylenecyclopropylcarbinyl radicals and the fact inactivation was not observed with (R)-7, the lifetime of radical 22 can be estimated to be on the order of nanoseconds, placing it within range of a true intermediate.</p><p>In this work, cyclopropyl- and methylenecyclopropyl-based radical probes were employed to study the mechanism of HppE-catalysis. Specifically, the cyclopropyl-containing analogues (S)-7 and (R)-7 were found to be processed by HppE to epoxide 13 and ketone 15 products, respectively. Despite the presence of a cyclopropyl radical reporting group in these structures, the reactions of (S)-7 and (R)-7 are free from apparent radical-triggered ring opening events. In contrast, incubation with the ultrafast radical probe 16 led to the formation of 24 and irreversible enzyme inactivation. While product 20 is thought to be generated from (2S)-16 via C1-centered radical intermediate 21, the observed inactivation is likely a result of radical induced ring opening of the C2-centered radical intermediate (22) derived from (2R)-16. These observations are significant because they provide the first experimental evidence supporting the involvement of substrate radical intermediate(s) in an HppE-catalyzed reactions, and also allow estimation of the rate of the subsequent electron transfer step to be between 8.6 × 107 and 6 × 109 s−1 based on the ring-opening rate constants of the cyclopropylcarbinyl and methylenecyclopropylcarbinyl radicals.</p>","answer":"(S)-2-Hydroxypropylphosphonic acid epoxidase (HppE) is an unusual mononuclear iron enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative epoxidation of (S)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid ((S)-HPP) in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic fosfomycin. HppE also recognizes (R)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid ((R)-HPP) as a substrate and converts it to 2-oxo-propylphosphonic acid. To probe the mechanisms of these HppE-catalyzed oxidations, cyclopropyl- and methylenecyclopropyl-containing compounds were synthesized and studied as radical clock substrate analogues. Enzymatic assays indicated that the (S)- and (R)-isomers of the cyclopropyl-containing analogues were efficiently converted to epoxide and ketone products by HppE, respectively. In contrast, the ultrafast methylenecyclopropyl-containing probe inactivated HppE, consistent with a rapid radical-triggered ring-opening process that leads to enzyme inactivation. Taken together, these findings provide, for the first time, experimental evidence for the involvement of a C2-centered radical intermediate with a lifetime on the order of nanoseconds in the HppE-catalyzed oxidation of (R)-HPP."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Exploration of the body representation system (BRS) from kinaesthetic illusions in fMRI has revealed a complex network composed of sensorimotor and frontoparietal components. Here, we evaluated the degree of maturity of this network in children aged 7-11 years, and the extent to which structural factors account for network differences with adults. Brain activation following tendon vibration at 100Hz ('illusion') and 30Hz (' no illusion ') were analysed using the two-stage random effects model, with or without white and grey matter covariates. The BRS was already well established in children as revealed by the contrast 'illusion' vs ' no illusion ', although still immature in some aspects. This included a lower level of activation in primary somatosensory and posterior parietal regions, and the exclusive activation of the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in children compared to adults. The former differences were related to structure, while the latter difference reflected a functional strategy where the FPC may serve as the 'top' in top-down modulation of the activity of the other BRS regions to facilitate the establishment of body representations. Hence, the development of the BRS not only relies on structural maturation, but also involves the disengagement of an executive region not classically involved in body processing.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"Brain\\", \\"frontoparietal\\", \\"grey matter\\", \\"tendon\\", \\"white\\", \\"primary somatosensory\\", \\"components\\", \\"brain\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"kinaesthetic illusions\\", \\"develop\\", \\"u0027illusionu0027\\", \\"network\\", \\"illusion\\", \\"structural maturation\\", \\"development\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"body\\", \\"human\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"no\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"vibration\\", \\"fMRI\\", \\"top-down modulation\\", \\"evaluated\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"analysed\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"FPC\\", \\"frontopolar cortex\\", \\"regions\\", \\"structure\\", \\"(FPC)\\", \\"structural\\", \\"executive region\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

The Pin1 protein plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the hyperphosphorylated neuronal Tau protein in Alzheimer's disease and is by itself regulated by phosphorylation. We have used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to both identify the PKA phosphorylation site in the Pin1 WW domain and investigate the functional consequences of this phosphorylation. Detection and identification of phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues in a globular protein, while mostly occurring in solvent-exposed flexible loops, does not lead to chemical shift changes as obvious as in disordered proteins and hence does not necessarily shift the resonances outside the spectrum of the folded protein. Other complications were encountered to characterize the extent of the phosphorylation, as part of the (1)H,(15)N amide resonances around the phosphorylation site are specifically broadened in the unphosphorylated state. Despite these obstacles, NMR spectroscopy was an efficient tool to confirm phosphorylation on S16 of the WW domain and to quantify the level of phosphorylation. Based on this analytical characterization, we show that WW phosphorylation on S16 abolishes its binding capacity to a phosphorylated Tau peptide. A reduced conformational heterogeneity and flexibility of the phospho-binding loop upon S16 phosphorylation could account for part of the decreased affinity for its phosphorylated partner. Additionally, a structural model of the phospho-WW obtained by molecular dynamics simulation and energy minimization suggests that the phosphate moiety of phospho-S16 could compete with the phospho-substrate.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"threonine\\", \\"amide\\", \\"serine\\", \\"(15)N\\", \\"(1)H\\", \\"phosphate\\", \\"phospho\\"]}"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

BACKGROUND: Delta (6) -Desaturase (FADS2) is the rate-limiting step in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthetic pathway. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test whether the common deletion [ T/- ] in the promoter of FADS2 affects the PUFA biosynthetic pathway and consequently modifies the effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) on myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: Case subjects (n = 1694) with a first nonfatal acute MI were matched by age, sex, and area of residence to 1694 population-based control subjects in Costa Rica. PUFAs were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography from plasma and adipose tissue samples. Least-squares means from generalized linear models and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs from multiple conditional logistic regression models were estimated. RESULTS: The prevalence of the variant T/- allele was 48%. Eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid decreased in adipose tissue and plasma with increasing number of copies of the variant allele with a monotonic trend (P < 0.05 for all). Fasting plasma triacylglycerols by genotype were 2.08 mmol/L for TT, 2.16 mmol/L for T-, and 2.26 mmol/L for-- [ ie, homozygous for the variant (deletion) allele ] (P = 0.03). The FADS2 deletion was not associated with MI and did not significantly modify the association between adipose tissue ALA and the risk of MI. CONCLUSIONS: The FADS2 deletion may prevent the conversion of ALA into very-long-chain PUFAs. However, this metabolic effect is not translated into an attenuated risk between ALA and MI among carriers of the variant. It is possible that, at current intakes of ALA, any potential defect in the transcription of the gene is masked by the availability of substrate. Further research in populations deficient in ALA intake is warranted.","answer":"[[\\"alpha-linolenic acid\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"FADS2\\"], [\\"PUFA\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"FADS2\\"], [\\"ALA\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"FADS2\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Orlistat, a weight-loss agent with a novel mechanism of action, recently was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obesity. It inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to decrease systemic absorption of dietary fat. In several trials lasting up to 2 years, orlistat was more effective than diet alone for weight reduction and maintenance of lost weight. Orlistat treatment also results in modest improvements in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, and fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. The major adverse effects are gastrointestinal, usually occur early in therapy, and tend to decrease with continued treatment. Because orlistat may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, a standard multiple-vitamin supplement is recommended daily during therapy to prevent abnormalities in vitamin serum concentrations. The potential for severe gastrointestinal discomfort and the modest degree of weight loss may limit the agent 's clinical utility. Its long-term safety and effectiveness for weight maintenance, cost-effectiveness of treatment, and overall reduction in obesity-related morbidity and mortality remain to be determined.","answer":"[[\\"Orlistat\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"low-density lipoprotein\\"], [\\"Orlistat\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"lipase\\"], [\\"Orlistat\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"insulin\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Turtles are useful for studying bioaccumulative pollutants such as mercury (Hg) because they have long life spans and feed at trophic levels that result in high exposure to anthropogenic chemicals. We compared total Hg concentrations in blood and toenails of three species of turtles (Chelydra serpentina, Sternotherus odoratus, and Graptemys geographica) with different feeding ecologies from locations up- and downstream of a superfund site in Virginia, USA. Mercury concentrations in turtle tissues were low at the reference site (average ± 1SE: blood = 48 ± 6 ng g(-1); nail = 2,464 ± 339 ng g(-1) FW) but rose near the contamination source to concentrations among the highest ever reported in turtles [up to 1,800 ng g(-1) (blood) and 42,250 ng g(-1) (nail) FW]. Tissue concentrations remained elevated ~130 km downstream from the source compared to reference concentrations. Tissue Hg concentrations were higher for C. serpentina and S. odoratus than G. geographica, consistent with the feeding ecology and our stable isotope (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) analyses of these species. In addition, we suggest that toenails were a better indication of Hg exposure than blood, probably because this keratinized tissue represents integrated exposure over time. Our results demonstrate that downstream transport of Hg from point sources can persist over vast expanses of river thereby posing potential exposure risks to turtles, but relative exposure varies with trophic level. In addition, our study identifies turtle toenails as a simple, cost-efficient, and minimally invasive tissue for conservation-minded sampling of these long-lived vertebrates.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"(13)C\\", \\"(15)N\\", \\"Hg\\", \\"Mercury\\", \\"mercury\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

old with women mostly affected . as its name implies ,about two - third arise within the parotid gland , and one - third arise within the minor salivary glands .when mec arises in minor salivary glands , it can be located on the palate , retromolar area , floor of the mouth , buccal mucosa , lips , and tongue . rarely , it can arise as primary jaw tumor or as laryngeal , lacrimal , nasal , paranasal , tracheal , or pulmonary tumor .it occurs most frequently in adults during the fifth and sixth decades of life . although uncommon , it is the main malignant salivary gland tumor in children , particularly adolescents and affects women more often than men ( 3:2 ) .mec was first reported by massao and berger in 1942 and by stewart et al . in 1945 as a distinct pathologic entity .low grade tumors commonly develop a nesting pattern with multiple well - circumscribed squamous nests containing numerous clear cells .intermediate - grade tumors are less cystic and show a greater tendency to form large sheets of squamous cells and often have a more prominent intermediate cell population .a 16-year - old male subject visited the department of periodontics , the oxford dental college and hospital , bangalore complaining of bleeding gums following brushing and painless swelling in the left posterior area of the hard palate since 6 months .intraoral examination showed the presence of swelling in the left posterior area of the hard palate of approximately 2 cm  1 cm in size and color similar to that of palatal mucosa with slight bluish hue in the center of the lesion with a presence of sinus opening [ figure 1 ] .on palpation , the lesion was nontender and firm in consistency around the borders and soft at the center of the lesion .swelling in the left posterior area of the hard palate electrical pulp vitality test results were positive . to track the sinus tract ,intraoral periapical radiograph was taken with gutta - percha point placed through the sinus opening . the gutta - percha point extended till the apex of mesial root of a maxillary first molar .there were no signs of alveolar bone resorption in the panoramic , periapical , and occlusal radiographs .computed tomography peripheral nerve sheath reported soft tissue density on the left side of palate causing smooth bony indentation [ figure 2 ] . computed tomography peripheral nerve sheath initially ,the differential diagnosis of the swelling was made as periodontal abscess , palatal region vascular malformations such as hemangioma , mucocele , sialometaplasia , pleomorphic adenoma , adenoid cystic carcinoma , mec , and adenosquamous carcinoma .incisional biopsy was done to establish a definitive diagnosis , to assign a histological grade and prescribe adequate therapy .on histopathological examination , h and e staining showed three groups of cells , namely large mucous cells with an empty cytoplasm and peripherally placed nucleus , intermediate cells with basaloid nucleus , and epidermoid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm suggestive of intermediate - grade mec [ figure 3 ] .mucicarmine stain , a specific stain for the diagnosis of mec , highlights cytoplasmic mucin in the tumor cells .this staining showed large mucous cells with magenta pink colored cytoplasm indicating the presence of mucous , intermediate cells with basaloid nucleus , and lastly epidermoid cells with abundant cytoplasm . in areas , cystic areas filled with magenta pink colored materialcould be appreciated indicative of mucous , suggestive of intermediate - grade mec [ figure 4 ] .the treatment consisted of wide surgical excision of the lesion with free surgical margins which was carried out under local anesthesia with an electrocautery .boundaries of excision extended anteriorly until canine , medially up to midline , posteriorly until junction between hard and soft palate , and laterally until marginal gingiva .h and e staining : magnification at 400 mucicarmine staining : magnification at 100 one - day postoperative view the patient was recalled at 1 , 3 , 6 months and 1-year postoperatively to check for any recurrence . at 1-year healingit has been estimated that about 15% of all salivary gland tumors develops in children and adolescents .the percentage of benign tumors occurring in the palate is higher than that of malignant tumors .most of the malignant neoplasms of the salivary gland in children and adolescents are in the parotid gland . only a few have been well - documented in minor salivary glands .epithelial neoplasms originating in the minor salivary glands account for approximately 15% of all salivary gland neoplasm .mec is believed to arise from pluripotent reserve cells of excretory ducts that are capable of differentiating into squamous , columnar , and mucous cells .it occurs commonly in parotid glands with minor glands being the second most common site .it accounts for < 3% of all head to neck tumors with a female predilection .clinically , the majority of palatal mec appears as firm , painless swellings , and may mimic mucoceles or vascular lesions .blue to red color of the lesion may suggest it to be either of vascular or of salivary gland origin . as in this case , mucus was discharged from the tumor through a small sinus tract . when a compressible palatal mass is observed in adolescent , reactive and neoplastic lesions should be included in the differential diagnosis .the other minor salivary gland neoplasms , mainly pleomorphic adenoma , as well as benign and malignant mesenchymal tumor , should also be considered. a fluctuant light blue mass in an intraoral salivary gland bearing area , mec and mucocele should be at the top of the list .although mecs are considered rare in the children adolescent age group , they must be considered when a lesion appears to be similar to a mucocele but mucocele is frequently seen fluctuant reactive lesion of salivary glands most common in the lower lip and rarely in the palate .the present case was not similar to a mucocele because of the mucous discharge from a sinus opening .since the mec tends to have a blue or red surface hue , this salivary gland tumor may resemble a hemangioma which can be differentiated by clinical examination and imaging .the other most common entity is the palatal space abscess , which is characterized by a tender , diffuse , and erythematous swelling of sudden onset .nontender lesion with no clinical and radiographic evidence of inflammatory pulpal disease excludes the palatal space abscess from consideration .histologically , mecs are divided into low- , intermediate- , and high grade types , which correlate with clinical behavior . in the present case ,low - grade mec macroscopically is small and partially encapsulated and microscopically characterized by the presence of more mucous - producing cells .the intermediate - grade mec comprises solid rather than cystic architecture with more intermediate cells .the high - grade tumor demonstrates solid islands of squamous and intermediate cells which demonstrate considerable pleomorphism and mitotic activity .suggested that low to intermediate - grade mecs originating from intraoral minor salivary glands in children and adolescents can be effectively managed by wide local surgical excision that ensures tumor - free surgical margins . in this case , wide surgical excision of the lesion with free surgical margins was done .if there is no evidence of bony involvement , as in the present case , the tumor is dissected down to the periosteum . however, if there is any evidence of gross periosteal involvement or bone erosion , removal of a portion of the involving bone is necessary .high - grade tumors require more aggressive surgical approach with or without postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy .furthermore , it should be considered that micro - marsupialization , cryosurgery , and laser therapy are contraindicated in the management of an intraoral submucosal mass / nodules in children particularly if the palate is involved .these kinds of treatments may result in local spread of the tumor , and more aggressive surgery may be needed .low- to intermediate - grade mecs originating from intraoral minor salivary glands has a very low recurrence rate ( < 10% ) and a high survival rate ( 95100% ) .this is keeping with the general consensus that low and intermediate grade mecs have an indolent clinical course and a minimal chance for metastasis .nevertheless , close clinical follow - up should be for lifetime because low and intermediate - grade mec in this age group can recur many years after initial removal and also at risk of developing a secondary malignancy following the treatment .","answer":"mucoepidermoid carcinomas ( mecs ) of minor salivary gland origin are rare in children and adolescents and have been reported rarely .  literature regarding their clinical features and biologic behavior is scanty .  the purpose of this case report is to discuss the clinical manifestation , diagnosis , and treatment plan of mec of the palate .  a 16-year -

Understanding how this occurs is highly relevant to cardiac regenerative therapy. Yet, how cardiomyocytes achieve and maintain a post-mitotic state is unknown. Here, we show that cardiomyocyte centrosome integrity is lost shortly after birth. This is coupled with relocalization of various centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope. Consequently, postnatal cardiomyocytes are unable to undergo ciliogenesis and the nuclear envelope adopts the function as cellular microtubule organizing center. Loss of centrosome integrity is associated with, and can promote, cardiomyocyte G0/G1 cell cycle arrest suggesting that centrosome disassembly is developmentally utilized to achieve the post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes. Adult cardiomyocytes of zebrafish and newt, which are able to proliferate, maintain centrosome integrity. Collectively, our data provide a novel mechanism underlying the post-mitotic state of mammalian cardiomyocytes as well as a potential explanation for why zebrafish and newts, but not mammals, can regenerate their heart.Introduction:The adult mammalian heart is considered to be a post-mitotic organ, as mammalian cardiomyocytes lose their ability to proliferate shortly after birth( Li et al., 1996; Soonpaa et al., 1996; Zebrowski and Engel, 2013). This is supported by the limited regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian heart( Senyo et al., 2014) and the fact that primary adult cardiomyocyte-born tumors are extremely rare, if they exist at all( Dell'Amore et al., 2011). Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the post-mitotic state of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes may clarify whether it is possible to induce cardiac regeneration based on cardiomyocyte proliferation as seen in zebrafish and newts( Poss et al., 2002; Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2003; Gamba et al., 2014). Tremendous efforts have been invested to induce postnatal mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, besides the fact that cell cycle promoting factors( e. g., Cyclins) are downregulated around birth, while cell cycle inhibitors( e. g., Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors) are induced( Ikenishi et al., 2012), little is known about the mechanisms that induce cell cycle exit or establish the post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes( van Amerongen and Engel, 2008). The centrosome is a solitary, juxtanuclear organelle in metazoan cell-types. It consists of a pair of tubulin-based structures, called centrioles, encased in a dense, non-membranous, multi-protein cloud called the pericentriolar matrix( PCM), which is further surrounded by a dispersed array of proteins termed centriolar satellites( Bettencourt-Dias, 2013). Traditionally, the centrosome is known as the microtubule organizing center( MTOC) of the cell, and is required for primary cilium formation( Kim and Dynlacht, 2013). Recently, the centrosome has emerged as a critical signaling hub for the cell cycle regulatory machinery( Doxsey et al., 2005). For instance, centrosome localization of Cyclin E and Cyclin A is required for G1/S cell cycle progression( Pascreau et al., 2011). Consistent with this role, increasing evidence supports the requirement of a functional centrosome for proliferative potential in mammalian cell-types( Doxsey et al., 2005). For instance, cells undergo G0/G1 arrest when( i) centrosomes are removed via laser ablation,( ii) centrosome integrity is disrupted via knockdown of centrosome proteins, or( iii) centriole biogenesis is blocked via a chemical inhibitor( Hinchcliffe et al., 2001; Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001; Srsen et al., 2006; Mikule et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2015). To date, the role of centrosome integrity in cell proliferation has always been studied in the context of centrosome component mutants. Here, we show that centrosome integrity is developmentally regulated in mammalian cardiomyocytes, revealing a novel mechanism that renders cells post-mitotic. Our findings might have important implications for efforts to induce therapeutic cardiomyocyte proliferation in adult mammalian hearts.Discussion:Increasing evidence supports the requirement of a functional centrosome for cellular proliferative potential( Doxsey et al., 2005). For instance, somatic cell-types arrest in G0/G1 when centrosomes are removed or disrupted( Hinchcliffe et al., 2001; Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001; Srsen et al., 2006; Mikule et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2015). Further, centrosome degradation occurs during female meiosis—a process believed to inhibit parthenogenesis—with mitotic cycles restored upon fertilization when the sperm donates a centrosome during zygote formation( Klotz et al., 1990; Clift and Schuh, 2013). Moreover, relocalization of the MTOC to non-centrosomal loci has been described for several post-mitotic, highly differentiated, cell-types( Bartolini and Gundersen, 2006). This body of literature coupled with our results suggests that centrosome integrity can be developmentally regulated to achieve a post-mitotic state. Centrosome disassembly appears to be a very effective way to achieve a post-mitotic state. But why do cardiomyocytes disassemble their centrosomes? Upon birth, the neonatal heart, and the cardiomyocytes therein, undergo increased hemodynamic stress. Effective cardiomyocyte function in response to increased hemodynamic stress may require a cytoskeletal architecture more conducive to handling postnatal physical stresses( e. g., a nuclear envelope-based MTOC). Thus, centrosome disassembly may be a result of cytoskeletal reorganization. In this scenario, proliferative potential might be sacrificed for postnatal function. It has long been considered that skeletal myoblasts and cardiomyocytes have distinct molecular mechanisms to control their proliferative growth. This theory has been primarily based on the observation that proliferation and differentiation( contraction) are mutually exclusive in skeletal muscle but occur in parallel in cardiomyocytes( Ueno et al., 1988). However, our results together with others( Tassin et al., 1985; Bugnard et al., 2005; Srsen et al., 2006; Fant et al., 2009; Zaal et al., 2011) challenges this dogma, as establishment of a post-mitotic state in both muscle cell-types coincides with MTOC relocalization to the nuclear envelope and centrosome disassembly. The observation that p38i promotes cardiomyocyte proliferative potential in the absence of a functional centrosome provides some optimism for heart regeneration via proliferation of endogenous cardiomyocytes. However, we observe that an absence of centrosome integrity correlates with multiple spindle poles. Although multiple spindle poles are generally resolved into a semi-clustered/pseudo-bipolar conformation, this process is nevertheless highly prone to the formation of merotelic spindle-kinetochore attachments, which can promote chromosome missegregation( Ganem et al., 2009). Indeed, postnatal cardiomyocytes induced to proliferate exhibit chromosome segregation abnormalities( Engel et al., 2006). While cell viability can exist when aneuploidy is limited( e. g., as seen in Down Syndrome), aneuploidy is generally not well tolerated( Torres et al., 2008). Therefore, proliferation of adult cardiomyocytes may not necessarily result in viable daughter cells. Thus, in the absence of a functional centrosome, whether a particular manipulation induces aneuploidy, and to what degree, may be a critical factor in determining its regenerative therapeutic potential. The origin of multiple spindle poles( i. e., multiple γ-tubulin foci) during cardiomyocyte mitosis is not entirely clear. Interestingly, in addition to centriole-cohesion, Pericentrin and Cdk5Rap2 are also required for centriole-engagement( Barrera et al., 2010; Lee and Rhee, 2012). During S-phase, centrioles are duplicated, with each mother centriole forming a daughter centriole, which remains closely attached( i. e., engaged) until mid-anaphase( Kuriyama and Borisy, 1981; Sluder, 2013). When mother-daughter centrioles are engaged, only the mother centriole exhibits a strong γ-tubulin signal( Wang et al., 2011). Thus, one speculation is that when cells that lack centriole-cohesion enter mitosis, they have an increased likelihood of premature loss of centriole-engagement, thus accounting for the four γ-tubulin signals observed at metaphase. However, it has to be considered that induction of mitosis in bi-nucleated cardiomyocytes, which increasingly appear after birth, results in four γ-tubulin signals in metaphase corresponding to four duplicated centrioles. The ability of zebrafish and newts to regenerate their heart has gained extensive interest in recent years. One major question is what distinguishes mammalian cardiomyocytes from those of zebrafish and newts with regards to their proliferative potential. Our data demonstrate that the state of cellular differentiation of cardiomyocytes from various species is not evolutionary conserved. The fact that adult zebrafish and newt cardiomyocytes maintain their centrosome integrity indicates that factors promoting adult zebrafish cardiomyocyte proliferation might not necessarily induce adult mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation. Recently, it has been shown that planarians can develop and regenerate in the absence of centrosomes( Azimzadeh et al., 2012). This has questioned the requirement of a centrosome for cell proliferation during development and regeneration. However, there are significant differences between planarians and vertebrates in cell cycle control. For example, planarians express only one single repressive E2F, whereas mammals and zebrafish express several repressive and activating E2Fs. In addition, planarians do not have Cyclin E or Cyclin A homologs. Further, cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2( to which Cyclin E/A usually binds) is expressed at such low levels in planarians that it is considered functionally dead( Zhu and Pearson, 2013). This is important as in mammals centrosome localization of Cyclin E and Cyclin A is required for G1/S cell cycle progression( Pascreau et al., 2011). Thus, at least in the case of Cyclin E and Cyclin A, planarians lack centrosome-regulated cell cycle factors. In addition, our data indicate that centrosome integrity is required for proliferation during zebrafish development. This is in agreement with the recent observation that plk4 depletion in zebrafish impairs centriolar biogenesis during development and increases premature cell cycle exit( independent of ciliogenesis defects) resulting in reduced zebrafish size( Martin et al., 2014). Other examples of centriole-associated genes whose depletion causes cell cycle defects resulting in impaired development are stil( Pfaff et al., 2007; Vulprecht et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014) and cetn2( Delaval et al., 2011). While there is no evidence for the requirement of functional centrosomes in cardiac regeneration in zebrafish, there are data that indirectly suggest that centrosome function might be required for cardiac regeneration. For example it has been shown that inhibition of mps1 and plk1, factors implicated in centrosome assembly and maturation( Pike and Fisk, 2011; Joukov et al., 2014; Kong et al., 2014), impairs cardiac regeneration in zebrafish after apex resection( Poss et al., 2002; Jopling et al., 2010). Thus, it will be interesting in the future to test if destruction of centrosome integrity will indeed abolish the ability of zebrafish to regenerate their heart. Taken together, this study suggests that relocalization of the MTOC disrupts centrosome integrity which, in turn, promotes a post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes. Given the increasing role of the centrosome in cell cycle control, understanding how centrosome integrity is regulated during development may reveal new mechanisms to regulate cell proliferation with implications for regeneration and cancer.","answer":"Muscle cells in the heart contract in regular rhythms to pump blood around the body . In humans , rats and other mammals , the vast majority of heart muscle cells lose the ability to divide shortly after birth . Therefore , the heart is unable to replace cells that are lost over the life of the individual , for example , during a heart attack . If too many of these cells are lost , the heart will be unable to pump effectively , which can lead to heart failure . Currently , the only treatment option in humans with heart failure is to perform a heart transplant . Some animals , such as newts and zebrafish , are able to replace lost heart muscle cells throughout their lifetimes . Thus , these species are able to fully regenerate their hearts even after 20% has been removed . This suggests that it might be possible to manipulate human heart muscle cells to make them divide and regenerate the heart . Recent research has suggested that structures called centrosomes , known to be required to separate copies of the DNA during cell division , are used as a hub to integrate the initial signals that determine whether a cell should divide or not . Here , Zebrowski et al . studied the centrosomes of heart muscle cells in rats , newts and zebrafish . The experiments show that the centrosomes in rat heart muscle cells are dissembled shortly after birth . Centrosomes are made of several proteins and , in the rat cells , these proteins moved to the membrane that surrounded the nucleus . On the other hand , the centrosomes in the heart muscle cells of the adult newts and zebrafish remained intact . Further experiments found that that breaking apart the centrosomes of heart muscle cells taken from newborn rats stops these cells from dividing . Zebrowski et al . 's findings suggest that the loss of centrosomes after birth is a possible reason why the hearts of adult humans and other mammals are unable to regenerate after injury . In the future , these findings may aid the development of methods to regenerate human heart muscle and new treatments that may limit division of cancer cells ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

An intensive short-term chemotherapy regimen has substantially prolonged the overall survival of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) patients, which has been further improved by addition of rituximab. However, the inevitable development of resistance to rituximab and the toxicity of chemotherapy remain obstacles. We first prepared two BL cell lines resistant to rituximab-mediated CDC. Using a phosphorylation antibody microarray, we revealed that PI3K/AKT pathway contained the most phosphorylated proteins/hits, while apoptosis pathway that may be regulated by PKC displayed the greatest fold enrichment in the resistant cells. The PI3K/AKT inhibitor IPI-145 failed to reverse the resistance. In contrast, the pan-PKC inhibitor midostaurin exhibited potent antitumor activity in both original and resistant cells, alone or in combination with rituximab. Notably, midostaurin promoted apoptosis by reducing the phosphorylation of PKC and consequently of downstream Bad, Bcl-2 and NF-κB. Therefore, midostaurin improved rituximab activity by supplementing pro-apoptotic effects. In vivo , midostaurin alone powerfully prolonged the survival of mice bearing the resistant BL cells compared to rituximab alone treatments . Addition of midostaurin to rituximab led to dramatically improved survival compared to rituximab but not midostaurin monotherapy. Our findings call for further evaluation of midostaurin alone or in combination with rituximab in treating resistant BL in particular.sentence: In vivo , midostaurin alone powerfully prolonged the survival of mice bearing the resistant BL cells compared to rituximab alone treatments .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Whether alternative splicing contributes to metabolic regulation is largely unknown. Here we investigated the contribution of alternative splicing to the development of diet-induced obesity. We found that obesity-induced changes in adipocyte gene expression include alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Bioinformatics analysis associated part of this alternative splicing program with sequence specific NOVA splicing factors. This conclusion was confirmed by studies of mice with NOVA deficiency in adipocytes. Phenotypic analysis of the NOVA-deficient mice demonstrated increased adipose tissue thermogenesis and improved glycemia. We show that NOVA proteins mediate a splicing program that suppresses adipose tissue thermogenesis. Together, these data provide quantitative analysis of gene expression at exon-level resolution in obesity and identify a novel mechanism that contributes to the regulation of adipose tissue function and the maintenance of normal glycemia.Introduction:Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important mechanism that increases the complexity of the transcriptome( Pan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008) and expands the diversity and function of the proteome( Nilsen and Graveley, 2010; Yang et al., 2016). Indeed, differences in pre-mRNA splicing can contribute to the specialization of different cell types within the body( Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016). The regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing is therefore an important aspect of cellular differentiation. Indeed, processes that regulate pre-mRNA splicing represent potential mechanisms that can control cell function. Recent studies have identified changes in pre-mRNA splicing associated with autism( Irimia et al., 2014; Weyn-Vanhentenryck et al., 2014), cardiac hypertrophy( Mirtschink et al., 2015), embryonic stem cell re-programming( Han et al., 2013a), tumorigenesis( Oltean and Bates, 2014; Hsu et al., 2015; Koh et al., 2015), and the regulation of signal transduction pathways( Gupta et al., 1996; Tournier et al., 1999; Maimon et al., 2014; Martinez et al., 2015). Moreover, alternative pre-mRNA splicing associated with pathogenesis represents a tractable target for the development of new therapies( Daguenet et al., 2015). The role of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in metabolism is unclear. We studied pre-mRNA splicing in adipocytes to investigate whether adipocyte function may be regulated by changes in pre-mRNA splicing. Adipose tissue is critically important for whole body metabolic regulation because it acts as both an endocrine organ and as a storage depot for triglyceride( Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014). Interestingly, both adipose tissue deficiency( lipodystrophy) and adipose tissue accumulation( obesity) are associated with the development of metabolic syndrome and pre-diabetes( Grundy, 2015). Moreover, the widespread incidence of human obesity represents a major risk factor for the development of diabetes and mortality( Flegal et al., 2013). It is therefore important that we obtain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control adipocyte function. The purpose of this study was to examine alternative pre-mRNA splicing in adipocytes. We report that the consumption of a high fat diet causes differential exon inclusion/exclusion in the transcriptome. Bioinformatics analysis implicated a role for NOVA pre-mRNA splicing factors and this was confirmed by studies of mice with adipocyte-specific NOVA deficiency. Functional studies demonstrated that NOVA acts to suppress adipose tissue thermogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that alternative pre-mRNA splicing contributes to the regulation of adipocyte biology.Discussion:The browning of white adipose tissue is associated with the appearance of beige/brite adipocytes, increased energy expenditure, and improved obesity-induced metabolic syndrome( Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014). An understanding of molecular mechanisms that account for browning is therefore important for the development of potential therapies for the treatment of metabolic syndrome based on increasing adipose tissue energy expenditure. It is established that beige/brite adipocytes in white adipose tissue depots can arise from specialized progenitor cells( Wang et al., 2013b). Beige/brite adipocytes may also arise from inactive cells present within white adipose tissue( Rosenwald et al., 2013). These two mechanisms may contribute to functional beige/brite cell development( Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014). The increased adipose tissue browning detected in mice with adipocyte-specific NOVA deficiency was observed using floxed Nova alleles and a Cre driver( Adipoq-Cre) that is expressed in mature adipocytes. It is therefore likely that the increased white adipose tissue browning caused by NOVA deficiency does not reflect a change in adipocyte differentiation from specialized progenitor cells, but rather a change in mature adipocyte function. Whether these mature adipocytes represent white adipocytes or inactive beige/brite adipocytes is unclear. However, the observation that housing mice at thermoneutrality prevents the effect of NOVA deficiency to cause 'browning' suggests that NOVA deficiency may act by promoting the activation of inactive beige/brite adipocytes. Our analysis demonstrates that NOVA expression in white adipocytes is reduced in obese humans and mice( Figure 1). These changes in NOVA expression may cause changes in adipose tissue physiology. Gene knockout studies demonstrate that compound NOVA-deficiency in adipocytes caused increased adipose tissue thermogenesis and improved whole body glycemia in HFD-fed mice( Figure 4). However, partial NOVA-deficiency in adipocytes( potentially modeling the changes in NOVA expression caused by feeding a HFD) caused modest changes in adipocyte physiology( Figure 4—figure supplement 3). The significance of the decrease in adipocyte NOVA expression in HFD-fed mice is therefore unclear. Nevertheless, our data establish that NOVA proteins in adipocytes function to suppress adipose tissue thermogenesis. The mechanism appears to be mediated by NOVA-regulated changes in pre-mRNA splicing that promote adipocyte thermogenic gene expression( Figure 5), but we cannot exclude additional contributions caused by other biochemical actions of NOVA proteins, including alternative mRNA polyadenylation( Licatalosi et al., 2008) and functional regulation of Argonaute/microRNA complexes( Storchel et al., 2015). Further studies will be required to examine the relative contributions of NOVA-regulated pre-mRNA splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and microRNA function. However, our analysis demonstrates that NOVA proteins do function as alternative pre-mRNA splicing factors in adipocytes( Figure 2). The changes in pre-mRNA splicing caused by NOVA proteins include both increased and decreased exon inclusion, consistent with the known context-dependent role of NOVA proteins to promote both exon inclusion and exclusion( Ule et al., 2006). Importantly, there are significant gaps in our knowledge concerning mechanisms of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in adipocytes. First, NOVA proteins may act in a combinatorial manner with other splicing factors( Zhang et al., 2010), but roles for such factors in adipocytes have not been established. Second, our analysis of mice with NOVA-deficiency in adipocytes implicates a role for NOVA proteins in the alternative splicing of 26% of the genes that are regulated by HFD consumption( Figure 2B). Consequently, NOVA proteins do not contribute to 74% of the genes that exhibit HFD-regulated pre-mRNA splicing and mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of these genes have not been established. Further studies will be required to achieve an understanding of these processes. The regulation of adipose tissue thermogenesis by NOVA proteins may not be entirely dependent upon the classical UCP1 pathway( Kozak, 2010) because of the existence of alternative thermogenic mechanisms( Kazak et al., 2015). Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that NOVA proteins can suppress adipocyte thermogenesis. Reduced NOVA expression in adipocytes causes thermogenesis( Figure 5) and may potentially be achieved by drugs targeting NOVA-mediated pre-mRNA splicing. This role of NOVA proteins is most likely mediated by a network response to a pre-mRNA splicing program that collectively regulates adipocyte thermogenesis. In conclusion, we describe a NOVA-dependent alternative pre-mRNA splicing program in white adipocytes that regulates browning of white adipose tissue. These data identify alternative pre-mRNA splicing as a biological process that may be targeted by drugs designed to increase adipocyte thermogenesis and improve metabolic syndrome caused by obesity.","answer":"The process of building a protein from the information encoded in a gene begins when the gene is copied to form a pre-messenger RNA molecule . This molecule is then edited to produce a final messenger RNA that is “translated” to form the protein . Different segments of the pre-messenger RNA molecule can be removed to create different messenger RNAs . This “alternative splicing” enables a single gene to produce multiple protein variants , allowing a diverse range of processes to be performed by cells . Fat cells store energy in the form of fats and can release this energy as heat in a process called thermogenesis . This helps to regulate the body’s metabolism and prevent obesity . Vernia et al . now find that that feeding mice a high-fat diet causes widespread changes in alternative splicing in fat cells . Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that the NOVA family of splicing factors – proteins that bind to the pre-messenger RNAs to control alternative splicing – contribute to the alternative splicing of around a quarter of the genes whose splicing changes in response to a fatty diet . Mice whose fat cells were deficient in the NOVA splicing factors displayed increased thermogenesis . As a consequence , when these animals were fed a high-fat diet , they gained less weight than animals in which NOVA proteins were present . Their metabolic activity was also better , meaning they were less likely to show the symptoms of pre-diabetes . Moreover , the activity of certain genes that are known to promote thermogenesis was greater in the fat cells that were deficient in NOVA proteins . Overall , the results presented by Vernia et al . suggest that the normal role of NOVA proteins is to carry out an alternative splicing program that suppresses thermogenesis , which in turn may promote obesity . Drugs that are designed to target NOVA proteins and increase thermogenesis may therefore help to treat metabolic diseases and obesity . The next step is to identify the protein variants that are generated by NOVA proteins and work out how they contribute to thermogenesis ."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Traffic prediction is of significant importance for telecommunication network planning and network optimization. Since modeling and forecasting using traditional Box-Jenkins' ARIMA is rather a complex process and time consuming, a novel approach called APM is studied and applied in this paper. APM is especially appropriate for time series exhibiting stable seasonal pattern and can be employed much simpler than ARIMA. Traffic series from a certain mobile network of Heilongjiang province in China is studied. Average daily traffic per month for the province as well as its every sub-region from July to December in 2009 is forecasted by using APM. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for one-step ahead prediction is 2.11%, and MAPE for the 6 steps is smaller than 7%. The prediction result is of high precision and can be comparable with ARIMA.Literature Review:","answer":"The ARMA model is combined from both AR and MA to obtain an accurate model. Autoregressive Moving Average is statistical model use with time series model for prediction. The ARMA model applied to well-behaved time series data. ARMA model are considered in adequate for predicting data that integrate random. The ARMA linear time series model is very significant to predict network traffic. We discuss ARMA algorithms that are employed by researchers for network traffic predictions as follows. N. K. Hong, et al. BIB001 introduced ARMA time series model for predicting large file transfer of network traffic. Authors experimented with file transfer protocol (FTP) data set. The network protocol analyzer (wireshark) is applied to capture and collect packets at different time intervals. They applied necessary transformation (log return) for computing the number of packet while capturing data. They transferred 1GB file and 10 MB file through network. Then applied ARMA approach for forecasting different files at different time interval. They concluded that transfer of small file is better than large file. And also, they recommended breaking a large file into several small size files. Transmitting smaller files lead to use of little bandwidth. They suggested that the most appropriate model to be used is the ARMA different size of file transfer. Poo kuanHo et al.  proposed a time series model with ARMA approach to predict network traffic pattern of bit torrent application. They evaluated ARMA technique, collected 6 sets of real data at a period of six days from bit Torrent P2PN (point to point network) by using wireshark software. They developed a new simulation tool called as simple network prediction studio (SNPS). This simulation used ARMA model to predict cyclical and seasonal bit torrent network traffic patterns. The mean square errors (MSE) metric applied to measure and evaluate performance of ARMA model on cyclical and seasonal patterns. A comparative prediction result of ARMA model at cyclical and seasonal patterns of bit torrent is presented. They shared that the ARMA approach achieved better prediction in cyclical pattern. Nayera Sadek et al.  proposed time series model with K-factor ARMA model for predicting multi scale high speed network traffic. They collected dataset from different network applications such as MPEG, VIDEO, JPEG, INTERNT, and ETHERNT. They used mean absolute error (MAE) and error ratio(ER) functions to measure prediction performance of K-factor ARMA. The K-Factor ARMA model predicted different types of network traffic in time domain and frequency domain. They compared performance between K-factor ARMA model and traditional autoregressive (AR). They concluded that their model achieved better performance for prediction of network traffic. Yanhua Yu et al. BIB002 proposed accumulative predicting model (APM) method with time series model to predict mobile network traffic. They collected dataset from certain mobile network of Heilongjian province in china. They applied means absolute percentage error (MAPE) to measure and evaluate prediction of APM technique. The autocorrelation function is used to represent time series of traffic data. A comparative prediction result between APM approach and ARIMA approach is proposed. They concluded that the APM is more efficient and effective for network traffic prediction."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

of - mass ( cm ) energy of 8 tev the most remarkable deviation from the sm prediction was a @xmath19 excess found by the atlas collaboration  @xcite in the search for heavy resonances decaying into two sm gauge bosons @xmath20  also known as diboson resonances  with the bosons decaying hadronically , giving rise to two fat jets @xmath21 .the excess was compatible with a new heavy resonance with a mass around 2 tev , and it was largest in the @xmath1 channel where the two bosons were respectively tagged as a @xmath22 and a @xmath23 boson .an analogous search performed by the cms collaboration  @xcite also found an excess at the @xmath24 level around this mass . but searches performed in the semileptonic decay modes of the @xmath1 diboson pair@xcite , some of them more sensitive than the hadronic mode , showed no hint of an excess at this mass .the absence of any other signals motivated the proposal  @xcite that the anomaly might be due to a triboson resonance , namely , a heavy resonance @xmath0 with a mass around 2 tev decaying into one gauge boson plus an intermediate neutral or charged particle , @xmath5 or @xmath7 , or perhaps both , where the masses of the intermediate particles @xmath3 , @xmath4 could in principle lie in a wide range @xmath25 gev .the subsequent decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 into a gauge boson plus some extra particle @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 , would produce a @xmath26 triboson signal . and , for this signal , the presence of the extra particle @xmath2 , which could be the sm higgs boson @xmath27 , a @xmath28 boson or a new particle with a mass @xmath29 gev , would make the searches in the semileptonic channels much less sensitive than for a diboson resonance @xmath30 .such a @xmath26 signal can be realised , for example , in left - right ( lr ) models when the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two scalars @xmath31 , @xmath32 in the bidoublet , @xmath33 , is either very small or very large  @xcite , that is , one of the vevs is much larger than the other . in that case, the @xmath34 boson plays the role of the heavy resonance @xmath0 and the decays @xmath35 , with a rate proportional to @xmath36 , are absent .but the decays into heavy scalars , e.g. @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with a rate proportional to @xmath39 , are allowed .the subsequent cascade decay of the heavy scalars @xmath40 , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 a lighter pseudo - scalar , or @xmath43 , @xmath44 , yield triboson signals .    at the lhc run 2 , with a cm energy of 13 tev , searches for diboson resonances have been performed using data taken in 2015 .searches in the semileptonic channels  @xcite have not shown any deviation from the sm prediction at this mass and searches in the hadronic channel  @xcite have not confirmed the previously seen excess .still , the data are not conclusive enough , and the examination of experimental results in the context of triboson signals is worthwhile .this is the main purpose of this paper . in section  [ sec:2 ]we discuss in detail the measurements performed by the atlas collaboration in their searches for diboson resonances decaying hadronically , with their similarities and differences . in section  [ sec:3 ]we present our detailed monte carlo calculations of the qcd dijet background , which do not show any trace of a bump caused by the jet tagging criteria .section  [ sec:4 ] is devoted to presenting predictions for several selected benchmark scenarios of triboson resonances in a variety of diboson searches . in this respect, the appearance of a @xmath9 excess in a cms search for low - mass diboson resonances  @xcite decaying into two opposite - sign leptons and a boson - tagged jet ( @xmath45 ) , at a mass of 650 gev , suggests that the cascade decays of the heavy resonance can be mediated by a neutral particle @xmath3 with this mass . in section  [ sec:5 ] we propose discovery strategies for triboson resonances in the fully hadronic atlas search , with minimal changes with respect to the analysis currently carried out . in section  [ sec:6 ]we discuss our results and their implications for the heavy neutral gauge boson that should accompany the charged resonance presumably responsible for a @xmath26 signal .the details of our simulations are given in appendix  [ sec : recast ] , and a study of the impact on triboson signals of an upper cut on the number of jet tracks is presented in appendix  [ sec : a ] . an addendum is included in appendix  [ sec : add ] with the predictions of our triboson scenarios for the @xmath46 hadronic search , whose experimental results were released by the atlas collaboration after the submission of this paper .as aforementioned , the atlas collaboration found a @xmath19 excess in run 1 data at 8 tev with a luminosity of 20.3 fb@xmath47 . for the reader s convenience , we reproduce in figure  [ fig : atlasfs ] ( left ) the number of events with the nominal @xmath1 atlas selection , with the background - only best fit . with run 2 data at 13 tev ,the atlas collaboration performed a search using 3.2 fb@xmath47 .given the similar efficiencies of both searches and the @xmath48 times larger @xmath49 partonic luminosity at 13 tev , which compensates the smaller luminosity , a similar excess of around 8 events at 2 tev was expected in run 2 , but the data , reproduced in figure  [ fig : atlasfs ] ( right ) , show no significant deviation and are compatible with the background - only hypothesis at the @xmath50 level .we restrict our analysis to final states with two @xmath51 tags , which have the highest sensitivity , and present our results in figure  [ fig : vhhad ] , with the same signal normalisation used throughout the paper but for a luminosity of 13.3 fb@xmath47 . for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in either @xmath34 decay channel , the signals have about the right size and shape to explain the excesses found by the atlas collaboration below 2 tev , which reach @xmath54 in the @xmath55 channel at @xmath56 tev . in this regard , we point out that there is an apparent underfluctuation in the signal regions , compared to the data - driven prediction , for invariant masses around 1.8 tev , especially in the two - tag @xmath55 sample . bearing in mind this effect , the predictions of the triboson scenarios with @xmath52 and @xmath53 seem compatible with the measurements of the atlas collaboration .      g.  aad _ et al . _[ atlas collaboration ] , jhep * 1512 * ( 2015 ) 055 [ arxiv:1506.00962 [ hep -

CTLA-4 engagement by mAbs inhibits, while CD28 enhances, IL-2 production and proliferation upon T cell activation. Here, we have analyzed the mechanisms involved in CTLA-4-mediated inhibition of T cell activation of naive CD4 + T cells using Ab cross-linking. CTLA-4 ligation inhibited CD3 / CD28-induced IL-2 mRNA accumulation by inhibiting IL-2 transcription, which appears to be mediated in part through decreasing NF-AT accumulation in the nuclei. However, CTLA-4 ligation did not appear to affect the CD28-mediated stabilization of IL-2 mRNA. Further, CTLA-4 engagement inhibited progression through the cell cycle by inhibiting the production of cyclin D3, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4, and cdk6 when the T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 / CD28 and with anti-CD3 alone. These results indicate that CTLA-4 signaling inhibits events early in T cell activation both at IL-2 transcription and at the level of IL-2-independent events of the cell cycle, and does not simply oppose CD28-mediated costimulation.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"CD4 + T cells\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"cdk6\\", \\"CD28\\", \\"anti - CD3 / CD28\\", \\"cyclin - dependent kinase\\", \\"(cdk) 4\\", \\"cyclin D3\\", \\"anti - CD3\\", \\"mAbs\\", \\"CTLA - 4\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"NF - AT\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"IL - 2 mRNA\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The monoclonal antibody (mAb) J393 induces apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis identified the 140-kDa surface antigen for mAb J393 as CD43 / leukosialin, the major sialoglycoprotein of leukocytes. While Jurkat cells co-expressed two discrete cell-surface isoforms of CD43, recognized by mAb J393 and mAb G10-2, respectively, only J393 / CD43 signaled apoptosis. J393 / CD43 was found to be hyposialylated, bearing predominantly O-linked monosaccharide glycans, whereas G10-2 / CD43 bore complex sialylated tetra-and hexasaccharide chains. Treatment with soluble, bivalent mAb J393 killed 25-50% of the cell population, while concomitant engagement of either the CD3. TcR complex or the integrins CD18 and CD29 significantly potentiated this effect. Treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates that underwent hyperphosphorylation upon antigen receptor costimulation. Tyrosine kinase inhibition by herbimycin A diminished J393 / CD43-mediated apoptosis, whereas inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity by bis (maltolato) oxovanadium-IV enhanced cell death. Signal transduction through tyrosine kinase activation may lead to altered gene expression, as J393 / CD43 ligation prompted decreases in the nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulatory protein NF-kappaB and proteins binding the interferon-inducible regulatory element. Since peripheral blood T-lymphocytes express cryptic epitopes for mAb J393, these findings demonstrate the existence of a tightly regulated CD43-mediated pathway for inducing apoptosis in human T-cell lineages.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"Jurkat T - cells\\", \\"cell population\\", \\"Jurkat cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human T - lymphoblastoid cells\\", \\"leukocytes\\", \\"human T - cell lineages\\", \\"peripheral blood T - lymphocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"interferon - inducible regulatory element\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"transcriptional regulatory protein\\", \\"J393\\", \\"amino acid sequence\\", \\"sialoglycoprotein\\", \\"phosphotyrosine phosphatase\\", \\"protein substrates\\", \\"140 - kDa surface antigen\\", \\"J393 / CD43\\", \\"Tyrosine kinase\\", \\"mAb G10 - 2\\", \\"antigen receptor\\", \\"J393 / CD43 -\\", \\"NH2\\", \\"monoclonal antibody\\", \\"CD18\\", \\"mAb\\", \\"CD43 -\\", \\"integrins\\", \\"CD3 .

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence.

Canonicalexamples of the former are importance sampling (IS) or noise contrastive estimation (NCE; BID8 ). Instead ofcomputing probabilities over the whole output space, these methods compute the softmax over a smaller, sampled vocabulary and re-weight the probabilities, providing an unbiased estimator. An illustrationof the latter is Hierarchical Softmax BID24 , where the output classes are first clustered such that you only need to compute the softmax over a smaller output space. While the formeris an unbiased estimate, it comes with no concentration guarantees, and it is often more art than science to craft proposal distributions which will provide low-variance estimators. The latter, whileefficient, requires carefully hand-crafted clustering of the output space, at the risk of making mistakes from which there is no recovery.More recently, estimators based on nearest neighbor search have been proposed for inference and learning in log-linear models BID25 BID26 . These estimatorshinge on Maximum Inner Product Search using Locality-Sensitive to retrieve the largest logits of the distribution and account for the tail with uniformly sampled classes. They boast strongtheoretical guarantees and well-established concentration bounds. However, they wereconstrained to toy settings and not directly applicable to real-world, large-scale, machine learning. In this work, we buildupon these estimators to make them amenable to deep learning practitioners, without losing any theoretical guarantees. We first show how theycan be extended to be usable within training of deep learning models, then present our efficient implementation, adapted to deep learning hardware and frameworks. Finally, we show the applicabilityand efficiency of our method by evaluating on a real-world task: language modeling. We show significant perplexity gainsagainst competing methods with significant speed-ups.Our contributions are as follows:• We present a new deep learning layer, LSH Softmax, an efficient replacement for the softmax layer based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing and the Gumbel distribution, for any deep learning architecture, with strong theoretical guarantees for sub-linear learning and inference.• We provide details for efficient implementationon deep learning hardware (GPUs) and modern deep learning frameworks BID0 BID19 ).• Empirically, we show, on several datasets, thattraining and sampling from LSH Softmax performs similarly to an exact softmax while requiring significantly less FLOPS.In this work, we presented LSH Softmax, a softmax approximation layer for large output spaces with sub-linear learning and inference cost (in the number of states) and strong theoretical guarantees.We showcased both its applicability and efficiency by evaluating LSH on a common NLP task, language modeling.On several datasets for this task, we report perplexity closest to exact training among all baselines, as well as significant speed-ups.Our hope is that, for any architecture, this layer could be chosen in lieu of softmax, when the output space is sufficiently large to warrant the approximation.To that end, we plan to release source-code with the camera-ready version.","answer":"we present LSH Softmax, a softmax approximation layer for sub-linear learning and inference with strong theoretical guarantees; we showcase both its applicability and efficiency by evaluating on a real-world task: language modeling."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are devastating sarcomas for which no effective medical therapies are available. Over 50% of MPSNTs are associated with mutations in NF1 tumor suppressor gene, resulting in activation of Ras and its effectors, including the Raf/Mek/Erk and PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling cascades, and also the WNT/β-catenin pathway. As Group I p21-activated kinases (Group I Paks, PAK1/2/3) have been shown to modulate Ras-driven oncogenesis, we asked if these enzymes might regulate signaling in MPNSTs. In this study we found a strong positive correlation between the activity of PAK1/2/3 and the stage of human MPNSTs. We determined that reducing Group I Pak activity diminished MPNST cell proliferation and motility, and that these effects were not accompanied by significant blockade of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, but rather by reductions in Akt and β-catenin activity. Using the small molecule PAK1/2/3 inhibitor Frax1036 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, we showed that the combination of these two agents synergistically inhibited MPNST cell growth in vitro and dramatically decreased local and metastatic MPNST growth in animal models. Taken together, these data provide new insights into MPNST signaling deregulation and suggest that co-targeting of PAK1/2/3 and MEK1/2 may be effective in the treatment of patients with MPNSTs.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"group I p21-activated kinases\\", \\"Erk\\", \\"NF1\\", \\"mTORC1\\", \\"MEK1/2\\", \\"Mek\\", \\"Akt\\", \\"Group I p21-activated kinases\\", \\"Ras\\", \\"WNT\\", \\"Group I Paks\\", \\"PAK1/2/3\\", \\"tumor suppressor gene\\", \\"Group I Pak\\", \\"PI3K\\", \\"Raf\\", \\"u03b2-catenin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

4 ] .the effectiveness of holep has already been declared , which enables its substitution for open prostatectomy . since the first description of holep in 1995 by gilling , the technique of laser prostatectomy has been evolving .years later , the concept of morcellation was adopted and the technique applied to patients with boo .although the technique has been refined and its popularity has increased , holep has major impediments to widespread application .there is some literature about the learning curve of holep , but this is the first learning curve analysis in korea . in this study , we examined the learning curve of experienced surgeons as well as the efficiency of holep in a 1-year experience .two experienced urological surgeons ( sjo , jsp ) who were familiar with transurethral resection of the prostate ( turp ) performed the holep procedure for symptomatic bph patients over 1 year .there was no mentor with whom to discuss the procedure at the beginning , and video clips of operations by foreign experts were observed . from july 2008 to september 2009 , 161 patients underwent holep operation by 2 surgeons independently .all patients were evaluated preoperatively with serum prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) , transrectal ultrasound ( trus ) , digital rectal examination ( dre ) , urinalysis , and international prostate symptom score ( ipss ) .uroflowmetry ( ufm ) and postvoid residual urine ( pvr ) measurement by ultrasound were performed .perioperatively , enucleation time and morcellation time were recorded and the weight of retrieved tissue was measured .ipss , ufm , and pvr were checked during follow - up at 1 , 3 , and 6 months postoperatively , and serum psa and postoperative trus measurements were done at 3 months .the energy source was an 80 w holmium : yag laser with a 550 m laser fiber ( lumenis ) ., the energy power was set at 2 j and 50 hz , and was sometimes changed to 2 j 40 hz for hemostasis .enucleated tissue was morcellated with a versacut morcellator ( lumenis ) introduced through a 0'degree nephroscope .lubricants were applied on the scope intermittently throughout the procedure . at the end of surgery ,a 22 fr 3-way urethral foley catheter was placed in situ for postoperative continuous irrigation . in general , the flow of irrigation fluid was reduced gradually and then cut off the next morning and the urethral catheter was removed after confirming the cessation of hematuria .patient demographics and perioperative and follow -

square test , with significance considered at p<0.05 .the effect of the learning curve on enucleation and morcellation efficiency was analyzed with one - way analysis of variance .all patients were evaluated preoperatively with serum prostate -

square test , with significance considered at p<0.05 .the effect of the learning curve on enucleation and morcellation efficiency was analyzed with one - way analysis of variance .the mean patient age was 67.7 years ( range , 51 - 86 years ) old , and mean prostate volume and transitional volume were 51.6 g ( range , 29 - 162 g ) and 26.3 g ( range , 4 - 107 g ) , respectively .mean enucleation time was 61.3 min ( range , 10 - 180 min ) , and mean morcellation time was 12.3 min ( range , 2 - 60 min ) .considering operative efficacy , the enucleation volume compared to prostate transitional volume ( enucleation ratio=% of retrieved tissue = enucleation weight / transitional zone volume ) was 0.66 ( range , 0.07 - 2.51 ) .the mean enucleation efficiency ( retrieved tissue weight / enucleation time , g / min ) was 0.32 g / min ( range , 0.02 - 1.25 g / min ) , and mean morcellation efficiency ( retrieved tissue weight / morcellation time ) was 1.73 g / min ( range , 0.1 - 7.7 g / min ) ( table 1 ) .the comparison of enucleation efficiency among chronologically divided groups showed there was a certain cutoff point at which operators could perform enucleation securely .after 30 cases , we reached a stable enucleation state ( p<0.001 ) . in terms of morcellation efficiency, 20 cases were required for reaching a learning curve ( p=0.032 ) ( table 2 , fig .3 ) . occasionally , intra - operative complications occurred . with a cutoff of the initial 30 cases ,turp conversion rates were 30% vs. 12% ( p=0.015 , odds ratio [ or ] : 0.33 ) , respectively ; mucosal injury rates were 20 vs. 12 ( p=0.263 , or : 0.56 ) ; capsular perforation rates were 0 vs. 8.4 ( p=0.1 ) ; and transfusion rates were 0 vs. 1.5 ( p=0.494 ) ( table 3 ) .despite outstanding hemostatic properties , lower morbidity , and greater efficacy compared with turp , holep has a major drawback , which is that this promising technique is difficult to learn . a significantly longer adaptation time is required compared with turp , especially for novices .identification of the surgical plane between prostate adenoma and prostate capsule requires certain experiences , as other surgeries do .it is known that ktp has no distinct learning curve . however , some surgeons employing surgical techniques like enucleation insist that it needs a learning curve .robot - assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy ( ralp ) for prostate cancer needs a learning curve , and it depends on technical skills and a self - perceived state of being expertise .this may be similar to the relationship between the transurethral resection ( tur ) procedure and holep . as a general rule ,the learning curve is regarded as the period required for the surgeon to be comfortable with the surgery and is usually represented by the number of cases ., some groups mentioned that 20 cases could be sufficient , whereas others demonstrated that at least 50 cases were necessary to achieve basic competence .other groups have inquired into the primary factor that made the procedure easier , such as its intrinsic properties or circumstances of the novice surgeon .objective parameters of the learning curve that should be considered are operation time , efficiency , reduced complications , and postoperative outcome of the surgery .the present study focused on operative efficiency , which primarily makes the surgeon confident of adaptation to the procedure .we calculated enucleation efficiency , morcellation efficiency , holep efficacy ( enucleation ratio ) , and perioperative complication rates . during the holep procedure, a subjectively perceived comfortable state can be estimated by the velocity of the operation .for enucleation efficiency , subgroups consisted of the initial 30 cases , the next 30 cases , and the others , whereas for morcellation efficiency , the initial 20 cases made up a subgroup .in these groups , we determined the minimum number of cases that could indicate a statistically significant cutoff point .enucleation efficiency was achieved after 30 cases , and morcellation efficiency after 20 cases . with these results, we assumed the cutoff point concerning operation speed to be about 20 to 30 cases , which corresponded with a previous study .previous study groups mentioned that morcellation efficiency improvement was too slow to perceive . in our study , we could find a cutoff point for morcellation efficiency with statistical significance .indeed , adaptation to morcellation requires time because it is a somewhat new modality to a tur - experienced surgeon . in this study ,, surgeons start an operation with an easy case , which is followed by difficult ones .learning curve migration from small prostate cases to large prostate cases is another one . in our data ,prostate volume was larger during the latter period than in the early ones , but this difference was not statistically significant . in our experience , there was a trend for the enucleation ratio to be improved .the rates of conversion to turp ( tur conversion ) , mucosal injury , transfusion , and urethral catheter reinsertion improved as cases accumulated . this observation could be assumed to represent maturation of the surgeon 's skill .therefore , we analyzed the rate of complications in each group divided by the initial 30 cases , which was assumed to be the self - confidence point for enucleation .in particular , tur conversion , which includes tur set substitution for surface coagulation , was significantly reduced ( p=0.039 ) .this means that the operator had attained confidence with high efficiency and low complications during enucleation with the holmium laserthis may also be attributed to the operator 's confidence , which resulted in enucleation being performed more rapidly .some investigators conceived that holep learning curve contains self - consciousness such as less bleeding and rapid operation , which make the surgeon improved .others emphasized the responsibility of a mentor who can teach basic technique , lead to a true plane , discuss difficult cases , confirm an alternative choice , and fundamentally encourage the trainee . before the initiation of holep , review of expertise video recording can give the surgeon a quick understanding of the prostate and holep procedure .furthermore , as endoscopic surgeons do , review of recordings of the surgeon 's own surgical procedures provides a good opportunity to correct flaws .if support is available , a training center that has facilities such as a dry laboratory or animal laboratory in a laparoscopic or robotic surgery environment can provide desirable results .the learning curve for holep can be not only a subjectively perceived time period but also an objectively measured value .furthermore , other parameters such as the complication rate and postoperative voiding improvement should ultimately be considered . however , in this study , we did not analyze overall clinical characteristics and postoperative results , which we hope to report in further studies .although the learning curve is steep and the true plateau of expertise can never be reached , gradual improvement can be achieved as surgical volume accumulates .","answer":"purposeholmium laser enucleation of the prostate ( holep ) is known to have a steep learning curve and , as a result , its clinical usage has limitations .  the purpose of this study was to analyze the learning curve and early complications following the holep procedure.materials and methodsa retrospective analysis was performed on 161 patients who had undergone the holep procedure for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) from july 2008 to september 2009 .  the procedure was done by two surgeons .  perioperatively , enucleated tissue weight , enucleation time , morcellation time , enucleation ratio ( enucleation weight / transitional zone volume ) , and enucleation efficiency ( enucleated weight / enucleation time ) were analyzed , and early complications were assessed.resultsmean enucleation time , morcellation time , and enucleation ratio were 61.3 min ( range , 10 -

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Modeling and analyzing security of networked systems is an important problem in the emerging Science of Security and has been under active investigation. In this paper, we propose a new approach towards tackling the problem. Our approach is inspired by the shock model and random environment techniques in the Theory of Reliability, while accommodating security ingredients. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first that can accommodate a certain degree of adaptiveness of attacks, which substantially weakens the often-made independence and exponential attack inter-arrival time assumptions. The approach leads to a stochastic process model with two security metrics, and we attain some analytic results in terms of the security metrics. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Studying models of cyber epidemics over arbitrary complex networks can deepen our understanding of cyber security from a whole-system perspective. In this work, we initiate the investigation of cyber epidemic models that accommodate the dependences between the cyber attack events. Due to the notorious difficulty in dealing with such dependences, essentially all existing cyber epidemic models have disregarded them. Specifically, we introduce the idea of copulas into cyber epidemic models for accommodating the dependences between the cyber attack events. We investigate the epidemic equilibrium thresholds as well as the bounds for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium infection probabilities. We further characterize the side effects of disregarding the due dependences between the cyber attack events by showing that the results thereof are unnecessarily restrictive or even incorrect.Literature Review:","answer":"An example scenario is illustrated in Figure 2 as follows. An attacker can perform a vector of 11 attacks, A i for i = 1, . . . , 11, some of which may successfully penetrate through the defense of c i (t). For instance, A 1 successfully compromises c i (t) because the user is lured into clicking a malicious URL; A 4 successfully compromises c i (t) because the user's password is correctly guessed; A 6 and A 7 successfully compromise c i (t) by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, even under proactive defense mechanisms placed on c i (t); and A 9 successfully compromises c i (t) because the vulnerability is unpatched and the attack is neither filtered nor detected. Some defense mechanisms along with patches of potential vulnerabilities can block all of the other attacks. 3.4.3. Situation Understanding. The attack-defense interaction perspective leads to an intuitive formulation of security modeling. In principle, the outcome of attack-defense interaction is the evolution of the situation or situation(t), which is described by three classes of metrics including the aforementioned dynamic security state S(t). That is, situation(t) can be represented as a mathematical function f (·): where V (t) is a function of vulnerabilities at time t, D(t) is a function of defenses at time t, and A(t) is a function of attacks at time t. Note that S(t) is a function of security at time t that can be captured as one of the factors captured in situation(t) as discussed in Section 7. S(t) is naturally affected by V (t), D(t), and A(t) as well. While still preliminary, initial progress has been made towards explicit representation of the various kinds of f (·)'s corresponding to different kinds of attack-defense interactions  ]: preventive and reactive defense dynamics with or without accommodating the dependence between the relevant random variables  BIB001 BIB001 BIB003 BIB002 ; proactive defense dynamics [Han et al. 2014]. The basic idea is to use some model parameters to represent the V (t), D(t), and A(t) and then use some advanced models to describe the attack-defense interactions while accommodating these parameters. This allows one to characterize and predict what phenomena can happen under certain f (·)'s and in certain parameter regimes. Moreover, Equation (1) offers a solution to compare the global effect of deploying two different sets of defenses, say, D(t) and D (t), by comparing the corresponding outcome situation(t) and situation (t). The attack-defense interaction accommodated in Equation (1) leads to natural taxonomies of systems security metrics that measure and represent vulnerabilities, defenses, attacks, and situations. Table I provides a summary of the four types of metrics for measuring the security state of a given system as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. 3.4.4. Security Metric Ontology. A security metric ontology is illustrated based on the four sub-metrics in Figure 3 . In this ontology, a system \\"has\\" vulnerabilities, can be \\"defended by\\" defense mechanisms, can be \\"attacked by\\" attacks (e.g., attack vectors), and is \\"described by\\" situations including its security state. Accordingly, vulnerabilities, defenses, attacks, and situations are respectively \\"described by\\" vulnerability metrics, defense metrics, attack metrics, and situations metrics. Each category of metrics are \\"measured by\\" a type of scales (e.g., nominal, ordinal, interval, etc.) , which are omitted for simplicity in Figure 3 . The relationship between the aspects are described as follows: Attacks \\"exploit\\" vulnerabilities; attacks and defense \\"interact with\\" each other; vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses all \\"affect\\" the situation. Corresponding to Equation (1), situation metrics are formulated by the contributions of vulnerability, attack, and defense metrics. Each sub-metric will have a corresponding sub-ontology that respectively corresponds to one of the following four sections."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

METHODS: Hospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two assays: a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity) and the S-Flow assay (~99% specificity). The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay. FINDINGS: Of 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21-28, range 13-39). The rapid immunodiagnostic test detected antibodies in 153 (95.6%) of the samples and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (the rapid test did not detect antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13-20, 21-27 and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P = 0.02). INTERPRETATION: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff sampled from 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This finding supports the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime. Future studies will help assess the persistence of the humoral response and its associated neutralization capacity in recovered patients.

Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or affects a broad array of virus-interacting proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9900 proteins conserved in all sequenced mammalian genomes. We show that viruses( i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins within the cellular functions they interact with and that( ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. We conservatively estimate that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Our results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.Introduction:A number of proteins with a specialized role in antiviral defense have been shown to have exceptionally high rates of adaptation( Cagliani et al., 2011; Cagliani et al., 2012; Elde et al., 2009; Fumagalli et al., 2010; Kerns et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2005; Sawyer et al., 2004; Sawyer et al., 2005; Sawyer et al., 2007; Sironi et al., 2012; Vasseur et al., 2011). One example is protein kinase R( PKR), which recognizes viral double-stranded RNA upon infection, halts translation, and as a result blocks viral replication( Elde et al., 2009). PKR is one of the fastest adaptively evolving proteins in mammals. Specific amino acid changes in PKR have been shown to be associated with an arms race against viral decoys for the control of translation( Elde et al., 2009). However, PKR and other fast-evolving antiviral defense proteins may not be representative of the hundreds or even thousands of other proteins that interact physically with viruses( virus-interacting proteins or VIPs in the rest of this manuscript). Most VIPs are not specialized in antiviral defense and do not have known roles in immunity. Many of these VIPs play instead key functions in basic cellular processes, some of which might be essential for viral replication. In principle some VIPs without specific antiretroviral functions might nonetheless evolve to limit viral replication or alleviate deleterious effects of viruses despite the need to balance this evolutionary response with the maintenance of the key cellular functions they play. There are reasons to believe that such an evolutionary response to viruses might be limited, however. First, most VIPs evolve unusually slowly rather than unusually fast both in animals( Davis et al., 2015; Jäger et al., 2011) and in plants( Mukhtar et al., 2011; Weßling et al., 2014). Second, VIPs tend to interact with proteins that are functionally important hubs in the protein-protein interaction network of the host possibly limiting their ability to adapt( Dyer et al., 2008; Halehalli and Nagarajaram, 2015). Finally, very few cases of adaptation to viruses are known outside of fast evolving, specialized antiviral proteins( Demogines et al., 2012; Meyerson et al., 2014; Meyerson and Sawyer, 2011; Meyerson et al., 2015; Ng et al., 2015; Ortiz et al., 2009; Schaller et al., 2011). Transferrin receptor or TFRC is the most notable exception, and serves as a striking example of a non-immune, housekeeping protein used by viruses( Demogines et al., 2013; Kaelber et al., 2012). TFRC is responsible for iron uptake in many different cell types and is used as a cell surface receptor by diverse viruses in rodents and carnivores. TFRC has repeatedly evaded binding by viruses through recurrent adaptive amino acid changes. As such, TFRC is the only clear-cut example of a host protein not involved in antiviral response that is known to adapt in response to viruses. Here we analyze patterns of evolutionary constraint and adaptation in a high quality set of ~1300 VIPs that we manually curated from virology literature. These 1300 VIPs come from a set of ~10000 proteins conserved across 24 well-sequenced mammalian genomes( Materials and methods). As expected, the vast majority of these VIPs( ~80%) have no known antiviral or any other more broadly defined immune activity. We confirm that VIPs do tend to evolve slowly and demonstrate that this is because VIPs experience much stronger evolutionary constraint than other proteins within the same functional categories. However, despite this greater evolutionary constraint, VIPs display higher rates of adaptation compared to other proteins. This excess of adaptation is visible in VIPs across biological functions, on multiple time scales, in multiple taxa, and across multiple studied viruses. Finally, we showcase the power of our global scan for adaptation in VIPs by studying the case of aminopeptidase N, a well-known multifunctional enzyme( Mina-Osorio, 2008) used by coronaviruses as a receptor( Delmas et al., 1992; Yeager et al., 1992). Using our approach we reach an amino-acid level understanding of parallel adaptive evolution in aminopeptidase N in response to coronaviruses in a wide range of mammals.Discussion:Here, we have shown that viruses have been a major selective pressure in the evolution of the mammalian proteome. Indeed viruses appear to drive ~30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in the conserved part of the human proteome, as evidenced by the MK test. Furthermore, the footprints of the arms race with viruses are visible in a large number of VIPs, and in a broad range of mammals. Importantly, we find a substantial enrichment in strong signals of adaptation in VIPs with no known antiviral or other immune functions( Figures 4B and 5A). Instead adaptation to viruses is visible in VIPs with a very diverse range of functions including such core functions as transcription or signal transduction( Figures 4B, 5C and Supplementary file 1C). This very diverse range of functions strongly argues in favor of a pervasive, external selective pressure –in our case viruses– as the cause for the observed signals. Our results thus draw a broader picture where adaptation against viruses involves not only the specialized antiviral response, but also the entire population of host proteins that come into contact with viruses. The best-known case of a housekeeping protein having adapted in response to viruses, the transferrin receptor, may thus represent the rule more than an exception( Demogines et al., 2013). In line with this, a new non-antiviral protein, NPC1, has very recently been shown to adapt against its use as a receptor by filoviruses in bats( Ng et al., 2015). Although we find a strong signal of increased adaptation, the amount of adaptive evolution that can be attributed to viruses is probably underestimated by our analysis. First, there likely to be many undiscovered VIPs. There is no sign that the pace of discovery of new VIPs is slowing down( Figure 2). This means that a substantial number of proteins classified as non-VIPs in this analysis are in fact VIPs, making non-VIPs a conservative control. Second, adaptation in response to viruses is most likely not restricted to proteins that physically interact with viruses. For example, adaptation to viruses might happen in proteins that act downstream of VIPs in signaling cascades, or in non-coding sequences that regulate the expression of VIPs. Third, not all of the 1256 VIPs we use here have been consistently interacting with viruses during evolution. Most VIPs in the dataset( 95%) were discovered in humans, and how frequently these VIPs have also been interacting with viruses in other mammals is currently unknown. Some VIPs like PKR have probably been in very frequent contact with diverse viruses. Conversely, other VIPs may have been in contact with viruses for a very limited evolutionary time in mammals, and only in a limited range of lineages. This would apply to VIPs that interact with viruses with a limited host range and few other phylogenetically closely related viruses, as is the case with HCV( Figure 5B). In addition, we could only work with VIPs active in current human populations reflecting the set of viruses infecting humans at present. This means that a potentially large number of proteins classified as non-VIPs in our study were actually VIPs during past human evolution or during the evolution of other mammalian lineages. Altogether, the bias of our sample towards present human VIPs thus makes our results conservative. We speculate that our results might explain a puzzling observation that rates of protein adaptation appear relatively invariant across different biological functions assessed using GO analysis( Bierne and Eyre-Walker, 2004). Because viruses( and likely other pathogens) interact with diverse proteins across most GO functions, they elevate the rate of adaptation across the whole proteome in a way that appears independent of specific functions in the GO analysis. We argue that grouping genes together based on the way they interact with diverse pathogens or other environmental stimuli might be a profitable way for discerning the nature of selective pressures that have molded animal genomes. In conclusion, our analysis suggests that viruses have exerted a very powerful selective pressure across the breadth of the mammalian proteome, and suggests the possibility that pathogens in general are the key driver of protein adaptation in mammals and likely other lineages and might have driven many pleiotropic effects on diverse biological functions.","answer":"When an environmental change occurs , species are able to adapt in response due to mutations in their DNA .

However, recent studies in non-human primates have shown that neural activity does not simply represent muscle or movement parameters; instead, its temporal structure is well-described by a dynamical system where activity during movement evolves lawfully from an initial pre-movement state. In this study, we analyze neuronal ensemble activity in motor cortex in two clinical trial participants diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis( ALS). We find that activity in human motor cortex has similar dynamical structure to that of non-human primates, indicating that human motor cortex contains a similar underlying dynamical system for movement generation. Clinical trial registration: NCT00912041.Introduction:Neurons in motor cortex exhibit complex firing patterns during movement( Fetz, 1992; Churchland and Shenoy, 2007; Churchland et al., 2010). Though motor cortex has been extensively studied over the past century( Lemon, 2008), the complexity of these patterns remains poorly understood. Early work demonstrated that neural firing correlates with external variables such as movement direction( Georgopoulos et al., 1982), and an ongoing debate centers on whether the firing patterns represent muscle or movement parameters( e. g., joint position, intended velocity, reach endpoint, muscle forces, and so on; reviewed in Kalaska, 2009). A recent approach has been to ask, instead, whether these patterns of activity reflect an internal dynamical system across the population( Fetz, 1992; Todorov and Jordan, 2002; Churchland and Shenoy, 2007; Scott, 2008; Churchland et al., 2010, 2012; Graziano, 2011; Shenoy et al., 2013; Kaufman et al., 2014). In this view, the system's initial state is set by preparatory activity, and consistent rules govern how firing rates evolve over time across movement conditions, regardless of movement direction or other externally changing variables. This dynamical view is supported by recent studies in rhesus macaques( Churchland et al., 2010, 2012; Shenoy et al., 2013; Kaufman et al., 2014). At the level of single neurons, responses during movement show brief but strong oscillatory components, even for straight point-to-point reaches( Churchland and Shenoy, 2007; Churchland et al., 2010). Furthermore, at the population level, the responses are well-described by a simple dynamical model in which the population response( the neural state) rotates with time( Figure 1A)( Churchland et al., 2012). Importantly, the presence of a strong rotational component in these dynamics is not predicted by the prevailing view of motor cortical activity( i. e., cosine direction tuning, linear speed scaling) that, instead, predicts solely expansive and contractive dynamics( detailed in Churchland et al., 2012, Figure 4 and associated text). 10. 7554/eLife. 07436. 003Figure 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 07436. 003 In humans, studies in research participants with tetraplegia have demonstrated that motor cortical action potential( AP) responses contain information about intended movement kinematics( Truccolo et al., 2008). Here, we investigated whether these AP responses also contain rotational dynamical structure at the ensemble level.Discussion:These results demonstrate prominent rotations of the neural population state in human motor cortex during movements. As with macaques, rotations were consistent across conditions and followed naturally from an initial pre-movement state. As mentioned above, and in contrast to the macaque study, both participants in this study had a diagnosis of ALS with resultant motor impairment. Participant T7's movements in particular were very limited and occurred with a long latency following target onset( detailed in ‘Materials and methods’). Both participants likely had substantial changes in motor cortex due to their disease progression; therefore, these results do not conclusively show that dynamical activity is present in healthy human motor cortex. However, given the finding that dynamical activity is prominent in motor cortex in people with abnormal motor function, and given the similarity of this activity to that of healthy non-human primates, the results strongly suggest the presence of dynamical activity in human motor cortex in general and may also hint at which aspects of motor cortical function are preserved despite the progression of a severe motor neuron disease. Given the findings of dynamical activity during overt movements, a potentially exciting open question is whether motor cortex exhibits dynamical activity during purely imagined movements. Recent studies( Feldman et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2011, 2012; Pandarinath et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2013) have demonstrated that motor cortex is active during both overt and imagined movements. If the functional role of rotational dynamics is to serve as an oscillatory basis set for generating muscle activation patterns( e. g. electromyogram activity)( Churchland et al., 2012; Sussillo et al., 2015), then one might expect these dynamics to be absent during imagined movements, when the subject is specifically trying to avoid generating motor output. However, if activity during imagined movements serves as a mechanism for the ‘covert rehearsal’ of activity during overt movements, then dynamics might still be present( but might be, for example, orthogonal to patterns of activity that drive motor output). Future studies will attempt to directly address this question. The current study’s findings also suggest a promising avenue to improve the performance of Brain–Machine Interfaces( BMIs) for persons with tetraplegia, as previous work with macaques( Kao et al., 2015) demonstrated that incorporating neural population dynamics into BMI control algorithms may lead to performance improvements. Finally, as with macaques, the presence of these rotations calls into question the prevailing model of motor cortical activity( i. e., that motor cortical firing patterns represent muscle or movement parameters) in favor of a dynamical systems perspective in humans as well.","answer":"Every conscious movement a person makes , whether lifting a pencil or playing a violin , begins in the brain . To be more specific , neurons in a part of the brain called the motor cortex send signals to muscles to cause them to move . But many of the details about how messages from the motor cortex produce movements remain unclear . Some scientists believe that individual neurons in motor cortex send direct messages that tell the muscles which direction to move in , how fast , and how forcefully . But other scientists suggest that this is not the case . Instead , they propose that neurons in motor cortex work together as part of a dynamic system to create rhythmic patterns of activity for movement . These rhythmic patterns then sum together to create the signals that muscles need to carry out the movements . Studies in monkeys have supported the idea that the neurons in the motor cortex are not just direct messengers . These studies showed what appears to be a rotating set of patterns in neuronal activity in the motor cortex during movement . Now , Pandarinath et al . have shown that a similar rotation of neuronal activity patterns occurs during movement in two human volunteers . The participants both had a disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( or ALS for short ) . This disease had nearly paralyzed their arms and legs because it causes a progressive loss of muscle control . In the experiments , the volunteers used their index fingers to try to move a computer cursor to a target using a touch pad . Pandarinath et al . recorded activity in the volunteers' motor cortices while they completed the tasks . The experiments uncovered a predictable series of patterns that started when the individual first thought about moving . These patterns progressed in a rotation as the movement was carried out . The rotation was not tied to the direction of the movements and would be completely unexpected if the individual neurons were simply acting as direct messengers . It is hoped that these findings will help efforts to create prosthetic devices ( such as robotic arms ) that can better respond to an individual's thoughts . But further experiments are also needed in people without ALS to verify that the patterns observed weren't specifically related to this disease ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of corticosteroids and may require increases in corticosteroid dose to achieve the desired response. Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids and thus decrease their clearance. Therefore, the dose of corticosteroid should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Corticosteroids may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with cortico-steroids in patients suffering from hypopro-thrombinemia. The effect of corticosteroids on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulants when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [\\"aspirin\\", \\"Aspirin\\"], \\"Drug\\": [\\"rifampin\\", \\"phenobarbital\\", \\"troleandomycin\\", \\"corticosteroid\\", \\"ketoconazole\\", \\"phenytoin\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"cortico-steroids\\", \\"corticosteroids\\", \\"Corticosteroids\\", \\"corticosteroid\\", \\"anticoagulants\\", \\"salicylate\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Previous studies have shown that allowing the parser to resolve pos tag ambiguity does not improve performance. However, for grammar formalisms which use more fine-grained grammatical categories, for example tag and ccg, tagging accuracy is much lower. In fact, for these formalisms, premature ambiguity resolution makes parsing infeasible. We describe a multi-tagging approach which maintains a suitable level of lexical category ambiguity for accurate and efficient ccg parsing. We extend this multi-tagging approach to the pos level to overcome errors introduced by automatically assigned pos tags. Although pos tagging accuracy seems high, maintaining some pos tag ambiguity in the language processing pipeline results in more accurate ccg supertagging.","answer":"[[\\"multi-tagging approach\\", \\"pos level\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"ccg\\", \\"fine-grained grammatical categories\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"lexical category ambiguity\\", \\"multi-tagging approach\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"pos tag ambiguity\\", \\"ccg supertagging\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"tagging accuracy\\", \\"grammar formalisms\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"pos tag ambiguity\\", \\"language processing pipeline\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"multi-tagging approach\\", \\"ccg parsing\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"newspaper text\\", \\"part of speech (pos) tagging\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"fine-grained grammatical categories\\", \\"grammar formalisms\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"parsing\\", \\"grammar formalisms\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"tag\\", \\"fine-grained grammatical categories\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"accuracy\\", \\"part of speech (pos) tagging\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"parser\\", \\"pos tag ambiguity\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Context: Maturity models offer organizations a simple but effective possibility to measure the quality of their processes. Emerged out of software engineering, the application fields have widened and maturity model research is becoming more important. During the last two decades the publication amount steadily rose as well. Until today, no studies have been available summarizing the activities and results of the field of maturity model research. Objective: The objective of this paper is to structure and analyze the available literature of the field of maturity model research to identify the state-of-the-art research as well as research gaps. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted. It included relevant publications of journals and IS conferences. Mapping studies are a suitable method for structuring a broad research field concerning research questions about contents, methods, and trends in the available publications. Results: The mapping of 237 articles showed that current maturity model research is applicable to more than 20 domains, heavily dominated by software development and software engineering. The study revealed that most publications deal with the development of maturity models and empirical studies. Theoretical reflective publications are scarce. Furthermore, the relation between conceptual and design-oriented maturity model development was analyzed, indicating that there is still a gap in evaluating and validating developed maturity models. Finally, a comprehensive research framework was derived from the study results and implications for further research are given. Conclusion: The mapping study delivers the first systematic summary of maturity model research. The categorization of available publications helps researchers gain an overview of the state-of-the-art research and current research gaps. The proposed research framework supports researchers categorizing their own projects. In addition, practitioners planning to use a maturity model may use the study as starting point to identify which maturity models are suitable for their domain and where limitations exist.Literature Review:","answer":"By following a concept-centric approach, we analyzed the identified articles and iteratively developed a categorization scheme for structuring them. We developed a concept matrix BIB001 , in which each article is grouped into one or more concepts. We took the work in BIB002 as our basis for the initial version of the scheme, which was then gradually refined with the new or modified concepts during the categorization process. With each modification of the scheme, the articles that had been categorized with the outdated version of the scheme were rescanned and categorized according to the new version. Four iterations were performed before all the articles were classified accordingly. Ultimately, the resulting scheme has 3 main categories, two of which have sub-elements as presented in Figure 2 ."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Results show that boys who participated in MTFC had significantly fewer criminal referrals and returned to live with relatives more often . Multiple regression analyses showed that assignment to a treatment condition ( i.e. , GC or MTFC ) predicted official and self-reported criminality in follow-up beyond other well-known predictors of chronic juvenile offending ( i.e. , age at 1st offense , number of previous offenses , age at referral )Title 2:A comparative evaluation of parent-training interventions for families of chronic delinquentsAbstract 2:Fifty-five families of chronically offending delinquents were r and omly assigned to parent-training treatment or to service traditionally provided by the juvenile court and community . The families in the  parent-training group  received an average of 44.8 hours of professional contact ( 23.3 hours of which were phone contacts ) , and each control group  family received treatment estimated at more than 50 hours on the average . Comparisons of police contact data at baseline and subsequent years for the two groups showed that subjects in both groups demonstrated reduced rates of offending during the followup years . The finding most relevant was significant treatment-by-time effect for offense rates , with most of this effect accounted for by a greater reduction in serious crimes for the experimental group during the treatment year , and a similar reduction of the community control group occurring in the first of three followup years . These early decrements in offense rates persisted during followup for both groups . Throughout the study , boys in the experimental group spent significantly less time in institutional setting s than did boys in the control group . Parent training had a significant impact , but the reduction in offending was produced at very high emotional cost to staff . Although it is clear that this population requires substantial treatment re sources , this study underscores the need for more work on preventionTitle 3:Multisystemic treatment of serious juvenile offenders: long-term prevention of criminality and violence.Abstract 3:This article examined the long-term effects of multisystemic therapy ( MST ) vs. individual therapy ( IT ) on the prevention of criminal behavior  and violent offending among 176 juvenile offenders at high risk for committing additional serious crimes . Results from multiagent , multi method assessment batteries conducted before and after treatment showed that MST was more effective than IT in improving key family correlates of antisocial behavior and in ameliorating adjustment problems in individual family members . Moreover , results from a 4-year follow-up of rearrest data showed that MST was more effective than IT in preventing future criminal behavior , including violent offending . The implication s of such findings for the design of violence prevention programs are discussedTitle 4:Preventing escalation in problem behaviors with high-risk young adolescents: immediate and 1-year outcomes.Abstract 4:The study tested alternative intervention strategies to reduce escalation in problem behaviors among high-risk young adolescents ( 11 to 14 years old ) . A total of 158 families with young adolescents ( male and female ) participated in this study . Of these , 119 families were r and omly assigned to 1 of the following intervention conditions : ( a ) parent focus , ( b ) teen focus , ( c ) parent and teen focus , ( d ) self-directed change ( material s only ) . In addition , 39 families of young adolescents were recruited as a quasi-experimental control . Parent focus and teen focus interventions result ed in immediate beneficial effects in observed and reported family conflict . The parent intervention conditions showed immediate beneficial effects on behavior problems at school . Longitudinal trends suggest that the parent focus condition may reduce subsequent tobacco use , compared with all other approaches . Interventions that aggregated high-risk youths into groups , however , showed the highest escalations in tobacco use and problem behavior at school , beginning at termination and persisting to follow-up . These findings are discussed with respect to the need to re-evaluate strategies that aggregate high-risk youths into intervention programs and focus more on strategies to engage parents in preventionTitle 5:Multisystemic therapy with violent and chronic juvenile offenders and their families: the role of treatment fidelity in successful dissemination.Abstract 5:The effects of multisystemic therapy ( MST ) in treating violent and chronic juvenile offenders and their families in the absence of ongoing treatment fidelity checks were examined . Across 2 public sector mental health sites , 155 youths and their families were r and omly assigned to MST versus usual juvenile justice services . Although MST improved adolescent symptomology at posttreatment and decreased incarceration by 47 % at a 1.7-year follow-up , findings for decreased criminal activity were not as favorable as observed on other recent trials of MST . Analyses of parent , adolescent , and therapist reports of MST treatment adherence , however , indicated that outcomes were substantially better in cases where treatment adherence ratings were high . These results highlight the importance of maintaining treatment fidelity when disseminating complex family-based services to community settingTitle 6:Family preservation using multisystemic therapy: an effective alternative to incarcerating serious juvenile offenders.Abstract 6:Multisystemic therapy ( MST ) delivered through a community mental health center was compared with usual services delivered by a Department of Youth Services in the treatment of 84 serious juvenile offenders and their multiproblem families . Offenders were assigned r and omly to treatment conditions . Pretreatment and posttreatment assessment batteries evaluating family relations , peer relations , symptomatology , social competence , and self-reported delinquency were completed by the youth and a parent , and archival records were search ed at 59 weeks postreferral to obtain data on rearrest and incarceration . In comparison with youths who received usual services , youths who received MST had fewer arrests and self-reported offenses and spent an average of 10 fewer weeks incarcerated . In addition , families in the MST condition reported increased family cohesion and decreased youth aggression in peer relations . The relative effectiveness of MST was neither moderated by demographic characteristics nor mediated by psychosocial variablesTitle 7:Group versus individual applications of reciprocity training for parent-youth conflict.Abstract 7:Abstract Thirty families in which parent-child conflict was identified as a problem were r and omly assigned to an individual-family-based reciprocity training condition , a group-family-based reciprocity training condition and a waiting-list control ( WLC ) group . The results provided some support for the effectiveness of reciprocity training as measured by the Achenbach Aggressiveness factor and decreases in parent-recorded child problem behaviour . Both group and individual methods of presentation were superior to the WLC group on these measures from pre- to post-training . Benefits produced by training were maintained at the 2-month follow-up . Improvements were evident for all conditions on the Parent Attitude Survey . Family Relationship Index and Child Perception of Parent Behaviour Question naire , with no superiority of treatment conditions over the WLC group . Minimal difference in outcome was found between individual and group methods of family reciprocity trainingTitle 8:Counseling juvenile offenders: An experimental evaluation of project crestAbstract 8:Thirty r and omly selected juvenile delinquents receiving a dual treatment approach of community outreach counseling services ( Project CREST ) and probationary supervision  were compared over a 6-month period with a  control group of 34 delinquents receiving only probationary supervision .  The CREST group demonstrated significant improvements over the control group on total acts of misconduct ( p<.05 ) and monthly misconduct rates ( p<.025 ) . These findings are discussed in light of previous evaluations of the CREST model","answer":"This model takes into account within- study sampling error and between- studies variation in the assessment of uncertainty and will give wider confidence intervals to the effect size and hence a more conservative result .No significant difference was found for psychosocial outcomes such as family functioning , and child/adolescent behaviour .REVIEW ER 'S CONCLUSIONS The evidence suggests that family and parenting interventions for juvenile delinquents and their families have beneficial effects on reducing time spent in institutions .This has an obvious benefit to the participant and their family and may result in a cost saving for society ."},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

The challenge is particularly exacerbated by the continuously secreted layer of mucus, a highly viscoelastic and adhesive gel that traps drug carriers and quickly eliminates them via natural clearance mechanisms.[1] A breakthrough for increasing particle delivery through mucus came over a decade ago with the discovery that a dense coating of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on particles can effectively minimize particle adhesion to mucins.[2] This led to the development of \\"mucus-penetrating\\" particles (MPP) that could quickly traverse mucus, which in turn achieved more uniform distribution at mucosal surfaces and prolonged retention compared to conventional mucoadhesive particles, and consequently superior drug delivery performance.[3]</p><p>For targeted delivery to the underlying epithelium, ideal drug carriers should not only quickly traverse the viscoelastic gel layer, but also bind to cells in the underlying epithelium. Unfortunately, the PEG coating on MPP reduces their interactions with target cells,[4] leading to limited binding and uptake by the underlying epithelium. Although conjugating ligands, such as lectins or cell-penetrating peptides, can facilitate particle association to cells, their incorporation on the surface of particles can result in non-specific adhesive interactions between the particles and mucins, leading to reduced permeation through mucus.[5]</p><p>To enable both rapid mucus penetration and efficient association to the epithelium simultaneously, we decided to explore a two-step, \\"pretargeting\\" approach that decouples the cell targeting from particle design and formulation. This approach is enabled by \\"bispecific\\" pretargeting molecules that can bind both specific epitopes on target cells and the drug-carrier particles. When delivered first, the pretargeting molecule will rapidly diffuse through mucus and accumulate on the cell surface, and capture subsequently dosed particles that permeate through the mucus layer. Conceptually, the pretargeting approach satisfies both requirements of rapid mucus penetration and cell-binding. In practice, pretargeting involves careful engineering of the pretargeting molecule.</p><p>Here, as a proof-of-concept that we can facilitate targeted delivery of MPP to epithelial cells, we generated a bispecific antibody against two epitopes, ICAM-1 that is constitutively expressed on the luminal surface of gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium,[6] and PEG on the surface of MPP. By binding directly to PEG, the design and formulation of our nanoparticles is substantially simplified, and we avoid potentially compromising the ability of densely PEGylated nanoparticles to rapidly penetrate mucus. To overcome the traditional shortcomings of bispecific antibody production, including low yields and purity due to misassembly of heavy and light chains during co-expression,[7] we engineered a \\"Fab-IgG\\" bispecific antibody comprising distinct Fab domains separated by a flexible peptide linker with each Fab possessing site-specific amino acid mutations in the heavy–light chain interface to impart orthogonal heavy and light chain pairings (Figure 1 a & b).[8] This approach ensures proper assembly of heavy and light chain pairs, and consequently high yields and purity (Figure 1 c) from simple co-expression of a single heavy and two light chain plasmids, while largely retaining native antigen binding affinities. Indeed, our engineered α-ICAM1 x α-PEG Fab-IgG binds to ICAM-1 and PEG with comparable affinities as native α-ICAM1 and α-PEG IgG, respectively (Figure 2 a & b). We further verified the ability of Fab-IgG to bind PEG on the surface of 100 nm fluorescent MPP (>2 PEG/nm2; Table S1) via an immunoblot assay (Figure 2 b inset).</p><p>We next verified the ability for our Fab-IgG pretargeting molecule to facilitate cellular uptake of MPP using monolayers of non-polarized Caco-2 cells (Figure 2 c & d). Pretargeting with Fab-IgG increased the amount of particles associated with Caco-2 cells by more than 15-fold (p < 0.0001) compared to non-targeted PS-PEG (Figure 2 c), with nearly 100% of the cell population internalizing particles (Figure 2 d). The extent of pretargeted particle uptake is comparable to \\"active-targeted\\" particles prepared by pre-mixing the Fab-IgG with PEGylated MPP prior to addition to cells.</p><p>We next sought to validate our assumption that the presence of targeting ligands on actively targeted particles would impede particle diffusion through mucus, whereas pretargeted MPP, due to absence of cell-binding ligands on the particle surface, would quickly permeate mucus. We collected fresh, undiluted GI mucus secretions from mice, and performed high resolution multiple particle tracking microscopy to quantify the mobility of different particle formulations in mucus gel.[2a, 9] Unmodified PS-PEG readily penetrate mouse GI mucus, as evident by their diffusive, Brownian trajectories that spanned many microns over the course of 20 s movies (Figure 3 a). In contrast, actively targeted particles exhibited highly constrained, non-Brownian time-lapse traces in the same mouse GI mucus secretions. The time-scale-dependent ensemble mean-squared displacement (<MSD>) of actively targeted PS-PEG was ~65-fold lower than that for unmodified PS-PEG at a time scale of 1 s (Figure 3 b), with most of the actively targeted PS-PEG (~ 85%) effectively trapped in mucus (exhibiting traces less than their own diameters; Figure 3 c & d).</p><p>Finally, we sought to confirm whether pretargeting enhances nanoparticle targeting to cells with an overlaying mucus layer. Unfortunately, there are currently no in vitro cell culture models that can mimic continuous mucus clearance – a hallmark of physiological mucosal epithelium.[1a, 1b] To partially recapitulate mucus clearance, we developed an in vitro culture model, whereby a uniform mucus layer is applied on transwell inserts, and placed on top of a monolayer of non-polarized Caco-2 cells (Figure 4 a). In this setup, mucus drainage is readily achieved by simply interchanging the transwell inserts. Using this model, we found the uptake for non-targeted and actively targeted nanoparticles were significantly reduced by nearly 2-fold or more (p < 0.0001) compared to pretargeted nanoparticles (Figure 4 b), a reflection of the mutually exclusive tradeoffs typically encountered in nanoparticle design and formulation when trying to incorporate the features of either rapid mucus penetration or efficient association to the underlying epithelium. We further compared the distribution and retention of non-targeted versus bispecific pretargeted nanoparticles in an ex vivo mouse intestinal perfusion model and found our pretargeted strategy to retain significantly more MPP while still preserving broad distribution of particles throughout mucosal tissues (Figure S1). These results underscore the potential promise of pretargeting to enhance particle delivery to mucosal surfaces.</p><p>The concept of pretargeting was first introduced in the field of radioimmunotherapy, where pretargeting with bispecific fusion proteins has shown considerable promise in the preclinical and early phase clinical studies for treatment of blood cancers.[10] Pretargeting has since been used for targeting a variety of solid tumors.[11] Nevertheless, pretargeting has remained restricted to systemic application to date, and has never been explored for mucosal delivery. Here, by pretargeting with a carefully engineered, polymer-binding bispecific antibody, we demonstrate that MPP can bind specifically to the epithelium while retaining their ability to rapidly penetrate mucus. This dual functionality of our pretargeted approach holds promise over both muco-inert, non-targeted formulations as well as actively targeted formulations for prolonging retention and sustaining drug delivery from nanocarriers at mucosal tissues. A particular novelty of our system is the incorporation of antigen-binding fragment (Fab) that specifically recognizes and binds PEG, which allows us to utilize otherwise unmodified PEGylated MPP and ensure maximum flux of particles penetrating across the mucus layer. Our Fab-IgG bispecific pretargeting molecule design is compatible with various Fabs while maintaining individual Fab affinity, allowing us to swap in any cell- and polymer-specific Fabs of interest. This facilitates the development and screening of diverse libraries of pretargeting molecules spanning a range of antigens and bispecific formats to further optimize pretargeting of different MPP to specific mucosal surfaces. We believe pretargeting will likely further enhance the efficacy of a variety of therapeutics delivered to treat localized mucosal diseases, including inflammation, infections, and cancer.</p>Experimental Section<p>The general experimental methods were as follows; details are available in the Supporting Information. Bispecific and native wildtype monoclonal antibodies were cloned and expressed transiently in Expi293F mammalian cells followed by affinity chromatography purification, and characterized for molecular size, purity, and relative binding affinities. PEG-coated MPP were prepared by covalent conjugation of 3 kDa MW methoxy-PEG-amine to 100 nm fluorescent carboxylated PS particles,[12] and characterized for size, surface charge, concentration, and PEG surface coverage. The transport kinetics of particles were assessed in fresh, undiluted mouse GI mucus using multiple-particle tracking.[2a, 9] Cellular uptake of nanoparticles, in the presence and absence of a reconstituted mucin layer, was quantified by flow cytometry using confluent monolayers of non-polarized Caco-2 cells as model epithelium. Pretargeting antibody and fluorescent nanoparticles were dosed directly to the lumen of freshly excised healthy mouse small intestinal segments for ex vivo particle distribution and retention studies. These intestinal segments were then frozen, sectioned transversely onto glass slides, counterstained for cell nuclei with DAPI, and fluorescently imaged.</p>","answer":"Mucus represents a major barrier precluding sustained and targeted drug delivery to mucosal epithelium. Ideal drug carriers should not only rapidly diffuse across mucus, but also bind the epithelium. Unfortunately, ligand-conjugated particles often exhibit poor penetration across mucus. Here, we explored a two-step xe2x80x9cpretargetingxe2x80x9d approach through engineering a bispecific antibody that binds both cell-surface ICAM-1 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the surface of nanoparticles, effectively decoupling cell targeting from particle design and formulation. When tested in a mucus-coated Caco-2 culture model that mimics the physiological process of mucus clearance, pretargeting increased the amount of PEG-particles binding to cells by ~2-fold or more compared to either non-targeted or actively targeted PEG-particles. Pretargeting also markedly enhanced particle retention in mouse intestinal tissues. Our work underscores pretargeting as a promising strategy to improve the delivery of therapeutics to mucosal surfaces."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

The energy consumption of DCs becomes a critical issue. Powering DCs with renewable energy can effectively reduce the brown energy consumption and thus alleviates the energy consumption problem. Owing to geographical deployments of DCs, the renewable energy generation and the data processing demands usually vary in different DCs. Migrating virtual machines (VMs) among DCs according to the availability of renewable energy helps match the energy demands and the renewable energy generation in DCs, and thus maximizes the utilization of renewable energy. Since migrating VMs incurs additional traffic in the network, the VM migration is constrained by the network capacity. The inter-datacenter (inter-DC) VM migration with network capacity constraints is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose two heuristic algorithms that approximate the optimal VM migration solution. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithms, by migrating VM among DCs, can reduce up to 31 of brown energy consumption.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The growing economical and environmental cost of data centers due to the high energy consumption is becoming a major issue. “Green Data Centers” refers to, energy aware, energy efficient and CO2 emission minimizing designs, protocols, devices, infrastructures and algorithms for data centers. Today's data centers are provisioned for peak load. However, it is shown that servers are idle most of the time. Idle servers and the connected network elements are consuming considerable amount of energy. In this survey, we identify the key enablers of green data center research. Firstly we overview the green metrics that are applicable to data centers. Then we describe the most recent stage of research and give a taxonomy of the related work. We focus on computing and networking proposals for green data centers, even though we briefly describe some other green research related to data centers such as cloud computing, cooling.[2]: Data center consumes increasing amount of power nowadays, together with expanding number of data centers and upgrading data center scale, its power consumption becomes a knotty issue. While main efforts of this research focus on server and storage power reduction, network devices as part of the key components of data centers, also contribute to the overall power consumption as data centers expand. In this paper, we address this problem with two perspectives. First, in a macro level, we attempt to reduce redundant energy usage incurred by network redundancies for load balancing. Second, in the micro level, we design algorithm to limit port rate in order to reduce unnecessary power consumption. Given the guidelines we obtained from problem formulation, we propose a solution based on greedy approach with integration of network traffic and minimization of switch link rate. We also present results from a simulation-based performance evaluation which shows that expected power saving is achieved with tolerable delay.","answer":"Fang ph et al [2] presented a novel power management strategy for the DCs, and their target was to minimize the energy consumption of switches in a DC.

The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor for interleukin 10 (IL-10R) contains two box 3 sequence motifs that have been identified in the signal-transducing receptor subunits for IL-6-type cytokines and noted to be required for activating STAT3 and inducing transcription through IL-6-responsive elements. To determine whether the IL-10R has signaling functions similar to IL-6R in cells normally expressing these receptors, leukocytes of the B -, T -, and NK-cell lineages were treated with either cytokine. Both cytokines activated factors that bound to the sis-inducible element and included STAT1 and STAT3. The cell response to IL-10 characteristically differed from that to IL-2 / IL-15, IL-4, and interferon gamma. The signaling capabilities of the IL-10R for activating specific STAT proteins and inducing gene transcription were defined by reconstitution of receptor functions in transfected tissue culture cells. COS-1 cells, co-expressing the human IL-10R and individual STAT proteins, confirmed a preference of the IL-10R for STAT3 and STAT1. Unlike many hematopoietin receptors, the IL-10R did not detectably activate STAT5. The IL-10R, together with reporter gene constructs containing different IL-6-responsive gene elements, reconstituted in hepatoma cells an induction of transcription by IL-10 that was comparable to that by IL-6. This regulation could not be appreciably modified by enhanced expression of STAT proteins. The similar actions of IL-10R and IL-6R on the induction of endogenous IL-6-responsive genes were demonstrated in hepatoma cells stably expressing the IL-10R. These receptor functions required the presence of the box 3 motifs, as shown by the analysis of the mouse IL-10R constructs containing progressively truncated cytoplasmic domains. The data demonstrate that the IL-10R, unlike other members of the interferon receptor family, is highly effective in recruiting the signaling pathways of IL-6-type cytokine receptors.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"transfected tissue culture cells\\", \\"COS - 1 cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"leukocytes\\", \\"B - , T - , and NK - cell lineages\\", \\"hepatoma cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"IL - 6 response elements\\", \\"IL - 6 - responsive elements\\", \\"IL - 6 - responsive gene elements\\", \\"IL - 6 - responsive genes\\", \\"IL - 6 -\\", \\"sis - inducible element\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"progressively truncated cytoplasmic domains\\", \\"IL - 6 - type cytokines\\", \\"cytokines\\", \\"signal - transducing receptor subunits\\", \\"IL - 10R\\", \\"STAT proteins\\", \\"box 3 motifs\\", \\"IL - 2 / IL - 15\\", \\"box 3 sequence motifs\\", \\"STAT5\\", \\"IL - 6\\", \\"STAT3\\", \\"STAT1\\", \\"IL - 6 - type cytokine receptors\\", \\"Both cytokines\\", \\"interleukin 10\\", \\"IL - 4\\", \\"cytoplasmic domain\\", \\"IL - 10\\", \\"hematopoietin receptors\\", \\"interferon gamma\\", \\"interleukin (IL) - 10 and IL - 6 - type cytokines\\", \\"IL - 6R\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

This data set provides insights into fundamental weak forces that mediate protein complex formation. In our earlier work, we found that alanine mutagenesis scanning estimates agreed with observations that the aromatic residues and arginine are most likely to be hot spot residues.14,16 Surprisingly, these secondary structure-specific data sets reveal that hot spot residue frequencies are independent of the backbone environment (Figure 1). Thus, β-branched residues are no more enriched as hot spots on β-strands than they are on α-helices, and residues with high helical propensity are not overrepresented as hot spots on interfacial helices.</p><p>The lack of correlation between hotspot residue propensity and backbone conformation prompted a question: How do secondary structures featuring largely similar hot spot residues dictate specific interactions in proteins? The three-dimensional epitope that interacts with the binding partner is likely influenced by various factors, including the identity and the positioning of key residues. Side chain dihedral angles govern atomic positions and thus contribute directly to the binding epitope.17 We hypothesized that the backbone-dependent side-chain conformational preferences of hot spot residues in particular may provide an additional factor that governs the binding energetics of protein interfaces.18–21 We sought to examine if a particular secondary structure displaying similar side-chain functionality might be able to specifically target different receptors by adopting distinct side-chain conformations (Figure 1c).</p><p>We performed a residue level analysis of protein–protein interfaces with the goal of defining the contribution of side-chain conformation to molecular recognition. Specifically, we asked if hot spot residues favor particular side-chain conformations in a secondary structure specific manner. We began by assessing the frequency of side-chain rotamers on hot spot residues and the differences between these frequencies and non-hot spot residues, with the hypothesis that rotamers that are enriched in hot spot residues may be critical for binding affinity or specificity.20 The distribution of rotamer states for different residue types is well established and known to be backbone dependent, providing an important foundation for our analysis.18,22–27 Since we are examining native structures, we used the Dunbrack backbone-dependent rotamer libraries as our standard for comparison.25 Without subgrouping by secondary structure, we typically saw moderate enrichments to common rotameric states (Figure S1). When we subdivided the results based on secondary structure, however, we found stronger enrichments that included uncommon rotamers. For example, the anti (a) χ1 bin is enriched for Phe hot spot residues on loops, the gauche− (g−) χ1 bin is enriched only for strand Phe, and the gauche+ (g+) χ1 bin dominates for helical Phe (Figure S2). The results suggest that the preferred side-chain conformation for hot spot residues is backbone dependent. A summary of these data for χ1 is provided in Table S1. A detailed description of data analysis for all figures is available in the supplement.</p><p>We examined the average ΔΔG for residues with each of these secondary structure and χ1 combinations. We adjusted the ΔΔG to account for scoring terms that would penalize rotamers with poor intraresidue interactions, since we are interested in the strength of interchain interactions given that a particular rotamer has been adopted. Helical Phe residues had an average adjusted ΔΔG of 3.7 ± 0.06 for g+, 1.9 ± 0.03 for g−, and 1.3 ± 0.01 for a (Figure 2). Strand and loop Phe possessed entirely different signatures from helical Phe, favoring g− and equally g+ and a conformations, respectively. Isoleucine's loop preferences resemble phenylalanine's helix preferences, but its helix and strand profiles are unique.</p><p>Further rotamers of particular interest include helical g+ leucine and g+ conformations of residues with two or more χ angles on helices in general (Figure S3). These are very difficult to obtain on a helical backbone due to clashes with adjacent helical turns but form remarkably strong interactions when they do appear. In contrast, the single-χ residues have diverse conformations of interest, such as helical valine in any conformation but a and g− strand serine. Any of these rotamers may be attractive targets for inhibition by \\"topographical\\" mimetics, which possess compatible residue positioning but a distinct backbone that may stabilize such rotamers.</p><p>Surprisingly many hot spot residues adopt off-rotamer side-chain conformations, which are quite uncommon otherwise.28 The absolute value of the angular deviation in off-rotamer conformations is often moderate (10–15°), but the energetic difference can be substantial. Rosetta models rotamer energy distributions surrounding ideal conformations as Gaussians with mean and standard deviation fit to PDB statistics; for example, the energy wells for common helical rotamers have standard deviations of 8°. The Dunbrack rotamer energy term (fa_dun) therefore penalizes each χ deviation of 10–15° by 1–2 R.E.U.29 To reach the 1.0 R.E.U. hot spot threshold, an off-rotamer residue must exhibit significant favorable interchain interactions in order to account for that penalty. Nonetheless, we find that leucine and isoleucine appear as hot spot residues at comparable rates whether on or off rotamer (Figure 3; full data in Figure S4). The percentage of off-rotamer states that are hot spot residues remains relatively constant and roughly independent of backbone conformation. Such a result is contrary to expectations, as a penalty of even 0.5 R.E.U. would reduce a given leucine's overall likelihood of being a hot spot residue from 28.8% to 15.6%.</p><p>This similarity between hot spot residue occurrences for on-and off-rotamer states holds for rotameric χ angles, which govern the rotation about an sp3–sp3 σ bond. In contrast, the conformational distribution for an sp2–sp3 σ bond, e.g., χ2 of Phe, is better modeled by a continuous distribution than by a set of rotamer wells (Figure S5). For such \\"non-rotameric\\" χ angles, hot spot amino acids tend to enrich already well populated states. These particular side-chain conformational preferences may make significant contributions to a peptide binding epitope. To analyze this possibility, we examined the LxxLL binding motif, which is commonly observed in interactions between nuclear receptors and coactivators. LxxLL helices contain three leucines at positions i, i + 3, and i + 4, with varying residues at the × positions. While the N- and C-terminal flanking residues and the residues at the × position can provide selectivity in the interactions of these motifs,30 the three leucines typically make the highest affinity interactions with the partner protein. We were drawn to LxxLL motifs because the relative leucine sequence and the helical backbone conformation are conserved over a range of protein complexes, allowing an opportunity to isolate the role of side-chain conformations on recognition.</p><p>We analyzed and categorized the leucine rotamers in the high-resolution structures of protein interfaces containing the LxxLL helix (Table 1) and found that the side-chain dihedral patterns for the three leucines vary for different complexes (Figure 4). Conformational plasticity is known to be essential for promiscuity in protein and ligand recognition.19,31 We reasoned that the LxxLL motif demonstrates conformational plasticity at the side-chain rotamer level that enables the motif to recognize this wide array of target proteins: the LxxLL motif is able to bind to different receptors largely because the leucine residues can access different rotamer geometry.21,32</p><p>Of the above complexes, the majority are formed by nuclear hormone receptors and coactivator peptides. The crystal structures demonstrate the side-chain conformational diversity inherent in the complexes: the off-rotamer conformations are exclusively the purview of these complexes, and of the 27 observed conformational states, 21 are only observed in receptor/coactivator complexes. These observations support the hypothesis that nuclear receptor specificity is mediated largely by the recognition of specific rotameric states (Figure S6). Structures of the same receptor/peptide complex consistently exhibited the same rotamers, even if they are uncommon conformations (e.g., the 10 complexes of DRIP/vitamin D3 receptor, and the 10 of NRC2/glucocorticoid receptor, feature consistent leucine rotamers). This consistency also suggests that these subtle geometrical distinctions are not due to crystal structure artifacts; the observed side-chain conformations are indeed preferred. Furthermore, the same peptide employs different rotamers when forming complexes with distinct receptors. Figure 5 illustrates the distinct rotameric states that nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NRC2) assumes in its complexes with six protein targets. At least one of the three leucine residues differs in rotamer geometry in each complex.</p><p>To obtain a quantitative description of the strength of these rotameric preferences, we calculated energetics of three LxxLL motifs in their complexes with three different proteins (2prg, 4giz, 4j24). We applied flexible backbone docking and refinement algorithms using RosettaScripts33 to optimize the bound conformations (details in SI). For each sequence, we conducted simulations in which we constrained just the leucine side chains of these peptide complexes to their own native values or to the native values of the other LxxLL motifs in question (Figure 6). Each sequence demonstrated a strong preference in binding energy (2–4 R.E.U.) for its own native rotamers, despite conformational similarities: 2prg and 4j24 both have three (g−, a) leucines, while the N-terminal leucine of 4giz is (a, g+). These protein interfaces therefore recognize preferred rotamers with extremely fine detail. In no case were the energies the result of explicit clashes; residues around the constrained side chains were able to repack to accommodate the constraints, but the resulting complexes were energetically inferior.</p><p>Beyond biophysical insight, these results suggest concrete technological applications. The fact that LxxLL motifs populate distinct rotamer states to bind to different receptors suggests that amino acids with constrained side chains may deliver highly specific binders. Despite the key biological role of LxxLL motifs in transcription, it has been difficult to produce inhibitors that specifically target the chosen hormone receptor.34,35 A preorganized side chain might have a lower entropic penalty and therefore better binding affinity. Off-rotamer states, for example, evoke the internal dihedral angles preferred by small alkane rings; residues such as Ile for which off-rotamer states are particularly common may benefit from cyclobutyl or cyclopentyl mimicry. Uncommon rotamers may be obtained by other means. Cyclopropane amino acids developed by Martin,36 previously applied to Phe, can offer either g− or g+ constraints, as can the β-substituted Phe, Trp, and Tyr derivatives developed by Hruby.37 Amino acid variants with unsaturated side chains have also been described.38 Further development of such noncanonical amino acids offers a potentially fruitful route for the design of specific PPI inhibitors.</p><p>Our investigation into the role of side-chain rotamers on protein–protein complex formation was originally motivated by the finding that the identity of hot spot residues does not directly correlate with backbone ϕ and ψ dihedrals: interfacial α-helices, β-strands and loops all similarly favor aromatic residues as hot spots. We find persuasive support for the hypothesis that side-chain rotamers contribute significantly to the desired level of specificity in protein complex formation. We find that some rotamers contribute appreciably more to binding than others in a residue and secondary structure specific manner. This result suggests that noncanonical amino acid residues with constrained side chains may offer an exciting avenue for new classes of secondary structure mimics as PPI inhibitors. We obtained further support for this hypothesis by analyzing the well-studied LxxLL motif in coactivators of nuclear receptors, demonstrating that the receptors dictate particular sets of rotamers in the peptides that bind them.</p><p>ASSOCIATED CONTENTSupporting Information</p><p>Methods and supplementary figures, including a detailed account of all data analysis (PDF)</p><p>The authors declare no competing financial interest.</p>","answer":"Protein secondary structures serve as geometrically constrained scaffolds for the display of key interacting residues at protein interfaces. Given the critical role of secondary structures in protein folding and the dependence of folding propensities on backbone dihedrals, secondary structure is expected to influence the identity of residues that are important for complex formation. Counter to this expectation, we find that a narrow set of residues dominates the binding energy in proteinxe2x80x93protein complexes independent of backbone conformation. This finding suggests that the binding epitope may instead be substantially influenced by the side-chain conformations adopted. We analyzed side-chain conformational preferences in residues that contribute significantly to binding. This analysis suggests that preferred rotamers contribute directly to specificity in protein complex formation and provides guidelines for peptidomimetic inhibitor design."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

METHODS One hundred and sixty-six wounds of 98 burn patients were enrolled and divided into Acticoat group and silver sulfadiazine group in the multi-center r and omized clinical trial . Acticoat was used as the treated group for those who have redness , swelling , and excessive secretion ( \\" heavy \\" exu date s ) in the wound , Acticoat was changed once a day . When there is not much secretion in the wound , or redness and swelling were not obvious , the dressings were changed once every 3 days . Silver sulfadiazine ( SD-Ag ) was used as control group , which was treated under the usual clinical routine . Healing time was observed up to 20 days . Healing percentage on the 15th day after treatment was determined . RESULTS Healing time was 12.42+/-5.40 days after the application of Acticoat . This was significantly shorter than that of control wounds . The wounds of the trial group healed nearly 3.35 days earlier than the control ones . Healing percentage at 15 days in the trial wounds was 97.37 % , which was higher than the control , but there was no significant difference between them . The bacterial clearance rate of the Acticoat group on the 6th and 12th day post-treatment was 16.67 and 26.67 % , respectively , which was significantly higher than the control . CONCLUSIONS Acticoat with nanocrystalline silver promotes the healing process of residual wounds post-burn effectively . No adverse reaction of Acticoat was found during the studyTitle 2:An open study comparing topical silver sulfadiazine and topical silver sulfadiazine-cerium nitrate in the treatment of moderate and severe burns.Abstract 2:Sixty patients with moderate and severe burns were r and omly assigned to receive topical silver sulfadiazine ( SSD ) alone ( n=30 ) or SSD combined with cerium nitrate ( SSD-CN ) ( n=30 ) . There were four deaths in the SSD group and one in the SSD-CN group ; more patients with higher risk severity survived in the SSD-CN group . Wound infection did not differ significantly between the groups . The rate of re-epithelialization of partial thickness burns was faster by 8 days in the SSD-CN group . The relatively dry shell-like eschar of the SSD-CN-treated burn allowed planned excisions with immediate autologous grafting and the tissue beneath was ready to accept grafting 11 days earlier than in the SSD group ( p=0.03 ) . This result ed in a significantly shorter hospital stay for those in the SSD-CN group than in the SSD group ( 23.3 vs. 30.7 days ; p=0.03 ) with consequent cost savings . A higher incidence of transient stinging pain was reported with application of SSD-CN , but this was effectively managed with analgesics where necessary . The results of this study confirm the greater efficacy of SSD-CN in the treatment of burns patientsTitle 3:The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trialsAbstract 3:Flaws in the design , conduct , analysis , and reporting of r and omised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated . The Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and moreTitle 4:A matched-pair, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Acticoat silver-coated dressing for the treatment of burn wounds.Abstract 4:A new silver-coating technology was developed to prevent wound adhesion , limit nosocomial infection , control bacterial growth , and facilitate burn wound care through a silver-coated dressing material . For the purpose s of this article , Acticoat ( West aim Biomedical Inc , Fort Saskatchawan , Alberta , Canada ) silver-coated dressing was used . After in vitro and in vivo studies , a r and omized , prospect i ve clinical study was performed to assess the efficacy and ease of use of Acticoat dressing as compared with the efficacy and ease of our institution 's st and ard burn wound care . Thirty burn patients with symmetric wounds were r and omized to be treated with either 0.5 % silver nitrate solution or Acticoat silver-coated dressing . The dressing was evaluated on the basis of overall patient comfort , ease of use for the wound care provider , and level of antimicrobial effectiveness . Wound pain was rated by the patient using a visual analog scale during dressing removal , application , and 2 hours after application . Ease of use was rated by the nurse providing wound care . Antimicrobial effectiveness was evaluated by quantitative burn wound biopsies performed before and at the end of treatment . Patients found dressing removal less painful with Acticoat than with silver nitrate , but they found the pain to be comparable during application and 2 hours after application . According to the nurses , there was no statistically significant difference in the ease of use . The frequency of burn wound sepsis ( > 10(5 ) organisms per gram of tissue ) was less in Acticoat-treated wounds than in those treated with silver nitrate ( 5 vs 16 ) . Secondary bacteremias arising from infected burn wounds were also less frequent with Acticoat than with silver nitrate-treated wounds ( 1 vs 5 ) . Acticoat dressing offers a new form of dressing for the burn wound , but it requires further investigation with greater numbers of patients in a larger number of centers and in different phases of burn wound careTitle 5:Randomized, controlled trials, observational studies, and the hierarchy of research designs.Abstract 5:BACKGROUND In the hierarchy of research design s , the results of r and omized , controlled trials are considered to be evidence of the highest grade , whereas observational studies are viewed as having less validity because they reportedly overestimate treatment effects . We used published meta-analyses to identify  r and omized clinical trials and observational studies that examined the same clinical topics . We then compared the results of the original reports according to the type of research design . METHODS A search of the Medline data base for articles published in five major medical journals from 1991 to 1995 identified meta-analyses of r and omized , controlled trials and meta-analyses  of either cohort or case-control studies that assessed the same intervention . For each of five topics , summary estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of data from the individual r and omized , controlled trials and the individual observational studies . RESULTS For the five clinical topics and 99 reports evaluated , the average results of the observational studies were remarkably similar to those of the r and omized , controlled trials . For example , analysis of 13 r and omized , controlled trials of the effectiveness of bacille  Calmette-Guérin vaccine in preventing active tuberculosis yielded a relative risk of 0.49 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.34 to 0.70 ) among vaccinated patients , as compared with an odds ratio of 0.50 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.39 to 0.65 ) from 10 case-control studies . In addition , the range of the point estimates for the effect of vaccination was wider for the r and omized , controlled trials ( 0.20 to 1.56 ) than for the observational studies ( 0.17 to 0.84 ) . CONCLUSIONS The results of well- design ed observational studies ( with either a cohort or a case-control design ) do not systematic ally overestimate the magnitude of the effects of treatment as compared with those in r and omized , controlled trials on the same topicTitle 6:A prospective, randomized trial of Acticoat versus silver sulfadiazine in the treatment of partial-thickness burns: which method is less painful?Abstract 6:Despite recent improvements in analgesia , pain control during dressing changes continues to be a major challenge in patients with burns . We investigated two different dressing modalities to compare how much pain the patient experienced during and after the dressing change . Patients with partial-thickness burns that required only topical wound care were assigned r and omly to treatment with Acticoat ( Smith and Nephew USA , Largo , FL ) or silver sulfadiazine ( AgSD ) . The outcome variable was pain during wound care , which was measured using visual analog pain scores . The mean visual analog pain scores for the wounds treated with Acticoat or AgSD wounds were 3.2 and 7.9 , respectively ( P < .0001 ; paired Student 's t-test ) . In 41 of the 47 paired pain score observations , the pain in the wound treated with AgSD was perceived as greater than in the wound treated with Acticoat . Burn wound care with Acticoat is less painful than burn wound care with AgSD in patients with selected partial-thickness burnsTitle 7:Efficacy of topical silver against fungal burn wound pathogens.Abstract 7:BACKGROUND Fungal infections of burn wounds have become an important cause of burn-associated morbidity and mortality . The nature of fungal infections dictates aggressive treatment to minimize the morbidity associated with these infections . Persons with large total body surface area burns are particularly susceptible to fungal infections and are treated in such a manner as to minimize their risk of infection . METHODS This study examined the in vitro fungicidal efficacy of a variety of different topical agents . By placing fungal inocula in contact with mafenide acetate , silver nitrate , silver sulfadiazine , and a nanocrystalline silver-coated dressing , we determined the kill kinetics of these topical agents against a spectrum of common burn wound fungal pathogens . RESULTS The topical antimicrobials that were tested demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy against these pathogens . CONCLUSION The nanocrystalline silver-based dressing provided the fastest and broadest-spectrum fungicidal activity and may make it a good c and i date for use to minimize the potential of fungal infection , thereby reducing complications that delay wound healingTitle 8:A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Silver Sulfadiazine Cream With a Water-Soluble Polyantimicrobial Gel in Partial-Thickness Burn WoundsAbstract 8:The lipid base of silver sulfadiazine ( SSD ) makes removal of the product painful for the patient and difficult for the physician to accurately assess particularly in partial-thickness burn injuries . As an alternative , a water-soluble antimicrobial gel is used at the University of Virginia . We present a prospect i ve , r and omized comparison of these two therapies using pain with dressing changes and time to perform dressing changes as our primary endpoints . Adult in patients with partial-thickness burn wounds were r and omized to begin therapy with either SSD cream or the water-soluble burn wound gel ( BWG ) , and then therapies were alternated daily .  Pain assessment s , time to complete dressing care , total narcotic medication administered , and the number of personnel required for dressing changes were recorded . Eight patients were enrolled result ing in 13 pairs ( 26 points ) of data comparison between the two therapies . Four of the eight enrolled patients ( 50 % ) refused to continue receiving SSD because of pain associated with dressing changes and voluntarily withdrew from the study . The amount of time to perform dressing changes was an average of 79 nurse-minutes longer for SSD . A 6.08 greater morphine equivalent was delivered to those having BWG removed . A water-soluble polyantimicrobial gel was superior to SSD in the parameters measured as exhibited by our patient dropout rate and differential time to perform dressing care . Limiting the time to perform dressing care will reduce the cumulative pain experience , improve patient satisfaction , and reduce the re sources to deliver care","answer":"This comprehensive systematic review and meta- analysis of the available evidence suggest that the use of nanocrystalline silver dressings results in shorter length of stay in hospital , less pain , fewer surgical procedures and reduced infection rates compared to silver sulphadiazine/silver nitrate"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We describe seven Dutch patients from six families with a slowly progressive, mainly spinal cord syndrome that remained for many years the sole expression of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). MRI demonstrated white matter abnormalities in the lateral and dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Post-mortem examination of one of the patients showed extensive myelin loss in these columns. An array of genotypes was found in these patients.

With the possible expansion of 2019-nCoV globally [8] and the declaration of the 2019-nCoV outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics to detect, prevent and contain 2019-nCoV promptly. There is however currently a lack of understanding of what is available in the early phase of 2019-nCoV outbreak. The systematic review describes and assesses the potential rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for 2019-nCoV, based in part on the developments for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, therapeutic drugs and vaccines for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There were two independent reviewers each focusing on SARS, MERS, and 2019-nCoV, respectively. A third independent reviewer was engaged to resolve any conflicting article of interest. We used the key words \\"SARS\\", \\"coronavirus\\", \\"MERS\\", \\"2019 Novel coronavirus\\", \\"Wuhan virus\\" to identify the diseases in the search strategy. The systematic searches for diagnosis, therapeutic drugs and vaccines were carried out independently and the key words \\"drug\\", \\"therapy\\", \\"vaccine\\", \\"diagnosis\\", \\"point of care testing\\" and \\"rapid diagnostic test\\" were used in conjunction with the disease key words for the respective searches. Examples of search strings can be found in Table S1 . We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and validation trials (for diagnostics test) published in English, that measured (a) the sensitivity and/or specificity of a rapid diagnostic test or a point-of-care testing kit, (b) the impact of drug therapy or (c) vaccine efficacy against either of these diseases with no date restriction applied. For the 2019-nCoV, we searched for all in vitro, animal, or human studies published in English between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020, on the same outcomes of interest. In addition, we reviewed the references of retrieved articles in order to identify additional studies or reports not retrieved by the initial searches. Studies that examined the mechanisms of diagnostic tests, drug therapy or vaccine efficacy against SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV were excluded. A Google search for 2019-nCoV diagnostics (as of 6 February 2020; Table S2 ) yielded five webpage links from government and international bodies with official information and guidelines (WHO, Europe CDC, US CDC, US FDA), three webpage links on diagnostic protocols and scientific commentaries, and five webpage links on market news and press releases. Six protocols for diagnostics using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from six countries were published on WHO's website [9] . Google search for 2019-nCoV vaccines yielded 19 relevant articles. With the emergence of 2019-nCoV, real time RT-PCR remains the primary means for diagnosing the new virus strain among the many diagnostic platforms available ( [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] ; Table S3 ). Among the 16 diagnostics studies selected, one study discussed the use of RT-PCR in diagnosing patients with 2019-nCoV [11] ( Table 1 ). The period and type of specimen collected for RT-PCR play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. It was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period. It has also suggested that in the early days of illness, patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptoms. Apart from the commonly used RT-PCR in diagnosing MERS-CoV, four studies identified various diagnostic methods such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), RT-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) and a one-step rRT-PCR assay based on specific TaqMan probes. RT-LAMP has similar sensitivity as real time RT-PCR. It is also highly specific and is used to detect MERS-CoV. It is comparable to the usual diagnostic tests and is rapid, simple and convenient. Likewise, RT-iiPCR and a one-step rRT-PCR assay have also shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for MER-CoV. Lastly, one study focused on the validation of the six commercial real RT-PCR kits, with high accuracy. Although real time RT-PCR is a primary method for diagnosing MERS-CoV, high levels of PCR inhibition may hinder PCR sensitivity (Table 1) . There are eleven studies that focus on SARS-CoV diagnostic testing (Table 1) . These papers described diagnostic methods to detect the virus with the majority of them using molecular testing for diagnosis. Comparison between the molecular test (i.e RT-PCR) and serological test (i.e., ELISA) showed that the molecular test has better sensitivity and specificity. Hence, enhancements to the current molecular test were conducted to improve the diagnosis. Studies looked at using nested PCR to include a pre-amplification step or incorporating N gene as an additional sensitive molecular marker to improve on the sensitivity (Table 1 ). In addition, there are seven potential rapid diagnostic kits (as of 24 January 2020; Table 2 ) available on the market for 2019-nCoV. Six of these are only for research purposes. Only one kit from Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) is approved for use in the clinical setting for rapid diagnosis. Most of the kits are for RT-PCR. There were two kits (BGI, China and Veredus, Singapore) with the capability to detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies, respectively. The limit of detection of the enhanced realtime PCR method was 10 2 -fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 10 7fold higher than conventional PCR methods In the clinical aspect, the enhanced realtime PCR method was able to detect 6 cases of SARS-CoV positive samples that were not confirmed by any other assay [25] • The real time PCR has a threshold sensitivity of 10 genome equivalents per reaction and it has a good reproducibility with the inter-assay coefficients of variation of 1.73 to 2.72%. • 13 specimens from 6 patients were positive with viral load range from 362 to 36,240,000 genome equivalents/mL. The real-time RT-PCR reaction was more sensitive than the nested PCR reaction, as the detection limit for the nested PCR reaction was about 10 3 genome equivalents in the standard cDNA control. [34] Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR); RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); open reading frame 1a (ORF1a); Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); immunofluorescent assay (IFA); immunochromatographic test (ICT); nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA). With the emergence of 2019-nCoV, there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally (Table 3 ), in which a wide range of technology (such as messenger RNA, DNA-based, nanoparticle, synthetic and modified virus-like particle) was applied. It will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). However, the kit developed by the BGI have passed emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of China [40] . Of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-nCoV, SARS CoV or MERS-CoV vaccines screened, only four were eventually included in the review. Most studies on SARS and MERS vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models ( Figure 1 ). The four studies included in this review were Phase I clinical trials on SARS or MERS vaccines (Table 4 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] . There were no studies of any population type (cell, animal, human) on the 2019-nCoV at the point of screening. The published clinical trials were mostly done in United States except for one on the SARS vaccine done in China [44] . All vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS were reported to be safe, well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants. In addition, we highlight six ongoing Phase I clinical trials identified in the ClinicalTrials.gov register ( [48, 49] ); Table  S4 ) [50] [51] [52] . These trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective MERS-CoV vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet. The trials are projected to complete in December 2020 (two studies in Russia [50, 51] ) and December 2021 (in Germany [52] ). Existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-nCoV trials at the time of writing. Among 23 trials found from the systematic review (Table 5) , there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) for 2019-nCoV therapeutics [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . Of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol, mesenchymal stem cells, traditional Chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment. The remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals, interferon atomization, darunavir and cobicistat, arbidol, and remdesivir usage for 2019-nCoV patients (Table 5) . Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 86% and 94% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively, and was maintained in 79% participants up to study end at week 60. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 50% participants at one or more time points during the study, but only 3% maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. T-cell responses were detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60. [47] Molecules developed by the university scientists inhibit two coronavirus enzymes and prevent its replication. The discovered drug targets are said to be more than 95% similar to enzyme targets found on the SARS virus. Researchers note that identified drugs may not be available to address the ongoing outbreak but they hope to make it accessible for future outbreaks. [85] Besides the six completed randomized controlled trials (RCT) selected from the systematic review (Table 6) , there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at SARS therapeutics [92] . The studies found from ClinicalTrials.gov have not been updated since 2013. While many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin only, there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage. Three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the SARS epidemic-3 in China, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Hong Kong [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . The studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants, combination of western and Chinese treatment vs. Chinese treatment in 123 participants, integrative Chinese and Western treatment in 49 patients, usage of a specific Chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants. Another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir usage in 152 participants [98] . One randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and Chinese treatment during the SARS epidemic was excluded as it was a Chinese article [94] . There is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at MERS therapeutics [99] . It investigates the usage of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon Beta 1B. Likewise, many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir/ribavirin, interferon, and convalescent plasma usage. To date, only one trial has been completed. One phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin (SAB-301) was found in available literature [46] . The trial conducted in the United States in 2017 demonstrated SAB-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses. Another trial on MERS therapeutics was found on ClinicalTrials.gov-a phase 2/3 trial in the United States evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity on coadministered MERS-CoV antibodies REGN3048 & REGN3051 [100]. Rapid diagnostics plays an important role in disease and outbreak management. The fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures. Local transmission and clusters can be prevented or delayed by isolation of laboratory-confirmed cases and their close contacts quarantined and monitored at home . Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] . Laboratory diagnosis can be performed by: (a) detecting the genetic material of the virus, (b) detecting the antibodies that neutralize the viral particles of interest, (c) detecting the viral epitopes of interest with antibodies (serological testing), or (d) culture and isolation of viable virus particles.Question: What role rapid diagnostics plays?","answer":"enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures.

Here, we demonstrate that ARC POMC neurons express capsaicin-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor( TRPV1)-like receptors. To show expression of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons, we use single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction( RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, TRPV1 knock-out( KO), and TRPV1-Cre knock-in mice. A small elevation of temperature in the physiological range is enough to depolarize ARC POMC neurons. This depolarization is blocked by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist and by Trpv1 gene knockdown. Capsaicin-induced activation reduces food intake that is abolished by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. To selectively stimulate TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons in the ARC, we generate an adeno-associated virus serotype 5( AAV5) carrying a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2( ChR2) –enhanced yellow fluorescent protein( eYFP) expression cassette under the control of the two neuronal POMC enhancers( nPEs). Optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons decreases food intake. Hypothalamic temperature is rapidly elevated and reaches to approximately 39 °C during treadmill running. This elevation is associated with a reduction in food intake. Knockdown of the Trpv1 gene exclusively in ARC POMC neurons blocks the feeding inhibition produced by increased hypothalamic temperature. Taken together, our findings identify a melanocortinergic circuit that links acute elevations in hypothalamic temperature with acute reductions in food intake.Introduction:Body temperature changes according to the circadian rhythm, physical activities, and external factors such as food intake[1–3]. Although it is expected that a rise in body temperature is rapidly conveyed to the hypothalamus via the blood stream, the physiological consequences of such an increase in hypothalamic temperature have not been studied. The transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily members 1–4( TRPV1, 2, 3, and 4) in peripheral sensory neurons play a role in accurately sensing ambient temperature and in adapting to environmental temperature changes through behavioral and physiological responses[4–9]. In the early 1960s, Nakayama and colleagues showed that local hypothalamic heating from 36. 7 °C to 38. 7 °C increases hypothalamic neuronal activity[10], suggesting that, like peripheral sensory neurons, hypothalamic neurons are able to respond to changes in temperature, possibly via activation of temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid( TRPV) channels. Indeed, neurophysiological, genetic, and in situ hybridization studies have described expression of TRPV receptors, in particular TRPV1 channels, specifically in hypothalamic neurons[11–14]. However, the presence of functional TRPV1 in the hypothalamus is still controversial. In fact, TRPV1 reporter mouse studies have shown very limited expression of TRPV1 receptors in the hypothalamus[12]. Second, TRPV1-expressing vasopressin neurons show temperature-sensitive inward currents at temperatures above 35 °C[13, 15, 16], which is in contrast to the prior findings that recombinant TRPV1 receptors are activated only by noxious temperatures( >42 °C)[4]. Third, transcriptome analysis of agouti-related peptide( AgRP) and proopiomelanocortin( POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus( ARC) shows no expression of Trpv1 transcripts[17]. Interestingly, some ARC POMC neurons are situated outside the blood–brain barrier[18, 19], which permits them to detect acute changes in temperature. Therefore, we sought to determine whether ARC POMC neurons express temperature-sensitive TRPV1 receptors. Using multiple independent techniques, we found that ARC POMC neurons expressed capsaicin- and temperature-sensitive TRPV1 subunit-containing receptors( TRPV1-like). Pharmacologic and optogenetic activation of ARC POMC neurons that express TRPV1-like channels reduced food intake. Increased body temperature during exercise was transmitted to the ARC. This elevation was associated with a reduction in food intake that was blocked by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. These results support the interpretation that activation of capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons contributes to the regulation of acute food intake.Discussion:All the results from neurophysiologic, molecular, genetic, and immunohistochemical studies provided evidence that ARC POMC neurons expressed functional TRPV1 channels. ARC POMC neurons were sensitive to capsaicin but activated by physiological warm temperature around 37 °C, suggesting that ARC POMC neurons may express heteromeric rather than homomeric TRPV1 receptors. In fact, a subset of ARC POMC neurons had Trpv3 and Trpv4 transcripts. Pharmacological and optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons reduced food intake. This anorexigenic effect was blocked by an MC3/4R antagonist. Importantly, a transient increase in body temperature was rapidly transmitted to the ARC. This elevation of hypothalamic temperature was enough to reduce food intake, although temperature-independent effects might explain these anorexigenic effects. Mice silencing the Trpv1 gene exclusively in ARC POMC neurons showed no effect of increased hypothalamic temperature on food intake. Therefore, our results support the interpretation that ARC POMC neurons have the ability to respond not only to hormones and nutrients but also to changes in body temperature. At first glance, our present TRPV1 receptor expression results may appear to be inconsistent with those from a prior study describing the lack of Trpv1 mRNA expression in ARC POMC neurons[17]. We think this is likely due to methodological differences in the temperatures applied during transcriptome assessments. In the study of cell type–specific transcriptomics, POMC-GFP cells were sorted at room temperature[17]. Importantly, such subphysiological temperatures reducedTrpv1 mRNA expression[41]. Thus, transcriptomic expression of TRPV1 receptors would be expected to be greatly down-regulated under such low temperature conditions; indeed, in our hands we found that low temperature treatment( i. e., 24 °C) strongly decreased Trpv1 mRNA expression in ARC POMC neurons. We did find robust Trpv1 mRNA in ARC POMC neurons, but only when we incubated at a temperature in the physiological range. The use of multiple independent techniques, including patch-clamp recording, single-cell RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, gene knockdown with shRNA, CRISPR/Cas-9-mediated gene knockdown, TRPV1 KOs, and TRPV1-Cre mice, provided converging lines of evidence for the expression of TRPV1 receptor subunits in ARC POMC neurons. However, it appears that there was a discrepancy between our results and the prior findings described in the literature[24, 25]. In particular, ARC POMC neurons were depolarized by warm temperature( >37 °C). It is unlikely that this depolarization was mediated via activation of homomeric TRPV1 receptors. In fact, recombinant TRPV1 receptors were activated at much higher temperatures( >42 °C)[4, 23]. These findings suggest that warm temperature-elicited depolarization may be due to the activation of other than TRPV1 channels, such as TRPV3 and TRPV4 subunits, with a low threshold temperature[5, 6, 25, 42, 43]. Although we cannot rule out this possibility, the sensitivity to capsaicin suggests that ARC POMC neurons contained TRPV1 subunits that have a specific binding site for capsaicin[20–22]. It has been documented that TRPV channels can assemble into heteromeric complexes[23, 29, 44]. Heteromeric TRPV channels containing TRPV1 subunits are always sensitive to capsaicin, but have altered threshold temperature[23, 44]. For instance, heteromeric TRPV1/TRPV3 channels are activated at lower temperatures compared to homomeric TRPV1 channels in human embryonic kidney 293 cells( HEK293) cells( >34 °C versus >38 °C)[23], suggesting that ARC POMC neurons may express heteromeric TRPV channels. In our preparations, Trpv3 and Trpv4 mRNA were also detected along with Trpv1 transcripts in ARC POMC neurons. Interestingly, the neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus expressing TRPV1 and TRPV4 receptor subunits were excited by warm temperature[13, 16, 45]. The neurons in these areas in TRPV1 KO mice still responded to elevated temperature, although the amplitude of temperature-elicited currents was greatly reduced[13, 16]. In line with these findings, we found that knockdown of the Trpv3 and Trpv4 genes in the ARC altered the thermal sensitivity. Hence, it seems likely that TRPV receptors in the hypothalamus generally form heteromeric rather than homomeric complexes that have capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 subunits( TRPV1-like). Despite the well-known anorexigenic effects of α-MSH[46], stimulation of the entire ARC POMC population did not produce the canonical reduction in food intake[35, 36, 38]. The lack of effects of selective stimulation of ARC POMC neurons would be due in part to POMC neuron heterogeneity. A large and growing body of literature supports the idea that ARC POMC neurons are neurochemically, anatomically, and functionally heterogeneous[19, 31, 47–51]. For example, activation of ARC POMC neurons by the cannabinoid receptor type 1 agonist has been shown to promote food intake through the release of opioids[31]. In our preparations, optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-expressing POMC neurons clearly reduced food intake. These findings suggest that neurochemically and/or neuroanatomically distinct subpopulations of ARC POMC neurons play distinct roles in feeding behavior. In fact, while both TRPV1 and cannabinoid type 1 receptor( CB1) agonists depolarize POMC neurons[31], the physiological consequences of ARC POMC neuron activation by TRPV1 versus CB1 agonists diverged in opposite directions. Hence, it is plausible that the net balance between anorexigenic melanocortin POMC and orexigenic opioid POMC neurons would be finely tuned by differential responses to nutrient-related molecules and signaling, as described in our prior study[19]. Interestingly, long- but not short-term stimulation of ARC POMC neurons effectively decreased food intake and this anorexigenic effect was completely absent in Ay mice[36], suggesting that long-term stimulation of the entire population of ARC POMC neurons could indeed shift the net balance toward the anorexigenic melanocortin outflow. Administration of capsaicin reduced food intake and prevented body weight gain in rodents and humans[52, 53]. TRPV1 KO mice gained more body weight than did control animals in adulthood and when fed a high-fat diet[54]. Our present findings provided possible explanations as to how vanilloids contribute to the regulation of feeding behavior. In other words, capsaicin and its analog excite TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons, resulting in lowered food intake. Importantly, TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons were activated not only by vanilloids but also by small, physiological elevations in temperature that can also easily be induced by a brief bout of treadmill exercise. Hence, TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons could function as a transducer of thermal stimuli. Like hormones and nutrients, temperature-induced depolarization of ARC POMC neurons drove anorexigenic, melanocortinergic neuronal outflow in our preparations. In the early 1960s, feeding-related activity has been shown to result in an “immediate” increase in brain temperature( within less than 1 min)[55], suggesting that diet, like physical exercise, is able to increase hypothalamic temperature. As capsaicin increases satiety and fullness in humans as well[56], it is plausible that elevated hypothalamic temperature could promote satiety and thereby reduce food intake through activation of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons. In summary, we identify a melanocortinergic circuit beginning in ARC POMC neurons that links acute elevations in peripheral and brain temperature with acute reductions in food intake via activation of TRPV1-like receptors. Such temperature-sensing mechanisms are ideally situated to mediate the regulation of energy intake and expenditure.","answer":"Intense exercise acutely decreases appetite and subsequent food intake .

NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to be associated with various kinds of immunological diseases including colitis. However, there are few drug candidates targeting inflammasomes for the treatment of colitis. In the present study, we aimed at examining the effect of 1-ethyl-5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole, a synthetic small molecular compound also named Fc11a-2, for the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome. Treatment with Fc11a-2 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of body weight and shortening of colon length induced by DSS. In addition, the disease activity index, histopathologic scores and myeloperoxidase activity were also significantly reduced by Fc11a-2 treatment. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of DSS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in colon, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-17A and IFN-γ, were markedly suppressed by Fc11a-2. Furthermore, a decreased CD11c(+) macrophage infiltration in colons and inactivation of caspase-1 in peritoneal macrophages were detected in Fc11a-2-treated mice. The mechanism of action of Fc11a-2 was related to the inhibition of the cleavage of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 which in turn suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of Fc11a-2 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its potential use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"1-ethyl-5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole\\", \\"Fc11a-2\\", \\"sodium\\", \\"benzo[d]imidazole\\", \\"Fc11a\\", \\"sulfate\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Recently, the relationship between CCSP and COPD has been reported. Since COPD results from an abnormal inflammatory response, we hypothesized that CCSP could have a protective role against chronic inflammation - induced lung damage. To address this issue, the pathophysiology of chronic lung inflammation induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CCSP - deficient mice was determined. A tube of 5 mm in length was soaked in a fluid containing P. aeruginosa (PAO01 strain) for 1 week and inserted into the trachea of CCSP - deficient mice. One week later, P. aeruginosa was administered into the trachea. Five weeks after insertion of tube, the mice were sacrificed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were collected to determine the bacterial growth, and the lung histology and physiology were also examined. P. aeruginosa was continuously detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids during the study. Neutrophils were increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from the CCSP - deficient mice in comparison to wild-type mice. A histological study demonstrated chronic inflammation around bronchus, serious bronchial stenosis, and alveolar enlargement in the CCSP - deficient mice. The lung physiology study demonstrated an increase in the lung compliance of the CCSP - deficient mice. Chronic P. aeruginosa inflammation resulted in chronic bronchitis and emphysematous changes in the CCSP - deficient mice. CCSP could play an important role in protecting the host from the chronic inflammation - induced lung damage.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"Neutrophils\\", \\"lung\\", \\"bronchus\\", \\"serious bronchial stenosis\\", \\"trachea\\", \\"abnormal inflammatory response\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\\", \\"bacterial\\", \\"P. aeruginosa\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"lung compliance\\", \\"alveolar enlargement\\", \\"acute respiratory infection\\", \\"chronic lung inflammation\\", \\"inflammation\\", \\"chronic inflammation\\", \\"physiology\\", \\"Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection\\", \\"chronic bronchitis\\", \\"COPD\\", \\"lung inflammation\\", \\"growth\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"histological study\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"bronchoalveolar lavage fluids\\", \\"Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"CCSP\\", \\"club cell secretory protein\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"mice\\"], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"reported\\", \\"soaked\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"lung injury\\", \\"lung damage\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

It contains the celebrated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a special case that only equivary to the translations. In contrast, we seek to train TERs for a generic class of transformations and train them in an unsupervised fashion. To this end, we present a novel principled method by Autoencoding Variational Transformations (AVT), compared with the conventional approach to autoencoding data. Formally, given transformed images, the AVT seeks to train the networks by maximizing the mutual information between the transformations and representations. This ensures the resultant TERs of individual images contain the intrinsic information about their visual structures that would equivary extricably under various transformations. Technically, we show that the resultant optimization problem can be efficiently solved by maximizing a variational lower-bound of the mutual information. This variational approach introduces a transformation decoder to approximate the intractable posterior of transformations, resulting in an autoencoding architecture with a pair of the representation encoder and the transformation decoder. Experiments demonstrate the proposed AVT model sets a new record for the performances on unsupervised tasks, greatly closing the performance gap to the supervised models.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: A common misperception within the neural network community is that even with nonlinearities in their hidden layer, autoassociators trained with backpropagation are equivalent to linear methods such as principal component analysis (PCA). Our purpose is to demonstrate that nonlinear autoassociators actually behave differently from linear methods and that they can outperform these methods when used for latent extraction, projection, and classification. While linear autoassociators emulate PCA, and thus exhibit a flat or unimodal reconstruction error surface, autoassociators with nonlinearities in their hidden layer learn domains by building error reconstruction surfaces that, depending on the task, contain multiple local valleys. This interpolation bias allows nonlinear autoassociators to represent appropriate classifications of nonlinear multimodal domains, in contrast to linear autoassociators, which are inappropriate for such tasks. In fact, autoassociators with hidden unit nonlinearities can be shown to perform nonlinear classification and nonlinear recognition.[3]: [4]: An autoencoder network uses a set of recognition weights to convert an input vector into a code vector. It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn factorial codes.[5]: Previous work has shown that the difficulties in learning deep generative or discriminative models can be overcome by an initial unsupervised learning step that maps inputs to useful intermediate representations. We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.[6]: Learning an interpretable factorised representation of the independent data generative factors of the world without supervision is an important precursor for the development of artificial intelligence that is able to learn and reason in the same way that humans do. We introduce beta-VAE, a new state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our approach is a modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned beta > 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised (DC-IGN) approaches to disentangled factor learning on a variety of datasets (celebA, faces and chairs). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, beta-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter, which can be directly optimised through a hyper parameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data.[7]: We present in this paper a novel approach for training deterministic auto-encoders. We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pretraining.","answer":"Auto-Encoders and GANs. Training auto-encoders in an unsupervised fashion has been studied in literature [4] [2] [2]0 . Most auto-encoders are trained by minimizing the reconstruction errors on input data from the encoded representations. A large category of auto-encoder variants have been proposed. Among them is the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) [1] that maximizes the lower-bound of the data likelihood to train a pair of probabilistic encoder and decoder, while beta-VAE seeks to disentangle representations by introducing an adjustable hyperparameter on the capacity of latent channel to balance between the independence constraint and the reconstruction accuracy [4]5 . Denoising auto-encoder [2]0 seeks to reconstruct noise-corrupted data to learn robust representation, while contrastive Auto-Encoder [2]1 encourages to learn representations invariant to small perturbations on data. Along this line, [3] propose capsule nets by minimizing the discrepancy between the reconstructed and target data."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In this study, HmTx was purified from venom by separation chromatography, and the PLA(2) activity of the fractions was determined by lecithin agar assay. The enzyme is an acidic protein with a pI of 5.6 and an apparent molecular weight of 14018.4 Da. The nucleotide sequence of HmTx contains 649 bp, and the mature protein is predicted to have 131 amino acid residues-104 of which make up the large subunit, and 27 of which make up the small subunit. The subunit structure of HmTx is highly similar to that of the other toxin, Pandinus imperator imperatoxin I (IpTx(i)) and to Mesobuthus tamulus phospholipase A(2) (MtPLA(2)). The 3D-structure of HmTx consists of three conserved alpha-helices: h1 (Lys24-His34), h2 (Cys59-Asp71), and h3 (Ala80-Phe89). The beta-sheet consisted of a single stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet (b1.1 at Glu43-Lys45 and b1.2 at Lys48-Asn50) that was highly similar to the conserved sequences (-CGXG-, -CCXXHDXC- and CXCEXXXXXC-) of Apis mellifera (bee) phospholipases.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Asn\\", \\"His\\", \\"amino acid\\", \\"Lys\\", \\"Asp\\", \\"Phe\\", \\"Ala\\", \\"nucleotide\\", \\"Glu\\", \\"Cys\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"MtPLA(2)\\", \\"PLA(2)\\", \\"HmTx\\", \\"phospholipase A(2)\\", \\"phospholipases\\", \\"group III phospholipase A(2)\\", \\"Heteromtoxin\\", \\"Mesobuthus tamulus phospholipase A(2)\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Previous work has shown that modeling soft constraints, where the model is encouraged, but not require to obey the constraints, can substantially improve segmentation performance. On the other hand, for imposing hard constraints, dual decomposition is a popular technique for efficient prediction given existing algorithms for unconstrained inference. We extend the technique to perform prediction subject to soft constraints. Moreover, with a technique for performing inference given soft constraints, it is easy to automatically generate large families of constraints and learn their costs with a simple convex optimization problem during training. This allows us to obtain substantial gains in accuracy on a new, challenging citation extraction dataset.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of segmenting and classifying occurrences of names in text. In NER, local contextual cues provide important evidence, but non-local information from the whole document could also prove useful: for example, it is useful to know that “Mary Kay Inc.” has been mentioned in a document to classify subsequent mentions of “Mary Kay” as an organization and not as a person. Previous works for NER typically model the problem as a sequence labeling problem, coupling the predictions of neighboring words with a Markov model such as conditional random fields. We propose applying the dual decomposition approach to combine a local sentential model and a non-local label consistency model for NER. The dual decomposition approach is a fusion approach which combines two models by constraining them to agree on their predictions on the test data. Empirically, we show that this approach outperforms the local sentential models on four out of five data sets.[2]: Dual decomposition, and more generally Lagrangian relaxation, is a classical method for combinatorial optimization; it has recently been applied to several inference problems in natural language processing (NLP). This tutorial gives an overview of the technique. We describe example algorithms, describe formal guarantees for the method, and describe practical issues in implementing the algorithms. While our examples are predominantly drawn from the NLP literature, the material should be of general relevance to inference problems in machine learning. A central theme of this tutorial is that Lagrangian relaxation is naturally applied in conjunction with a broad class of combinatorial algorithms, allowing inference in models that go significantly beyond previous work on Lagrangian relaxation for inference in graphical models.[3]: We propose an algorithm to find the best path through an intersection of arbitrarily many weighted automata, without actually performing the intersection. The algorithm is based on dual decomposition: the automata attempt to agree on a string by communicating about features of the string. We demonstrate the algorithm on the Steiner consensus string problem, both on synthetic data and on consensus decoding for speech recognition. This involves implicitly intersecting up to 100 automata.[4]: This paper introduces algorithms for non-projective parsing based on dual decomposition. We focus on parsing algorithms for non-projective head automata, a generalization of head-automata models to non-projective structures. The dual decomposition algorithms are simple and efficient, relying on standard dynamic programming and minimum spanning tree algorithms. They provably solve an LP relaxation of the non-projective parsing problem. Empirically the LP relaxation is very often tight: for many languages, exact solutions are achieved on over 98 of test sentences. The accuracy of our models is higher than previous work on a broad range of datasets.[5]: This paper introduces dual decomposition as a framework for deriving inference algorithms for NLP problems. The approach relies on standard dynamic-programming algorithms as oracle solvers for sub-problems, together with a simple method for forcing agreement between the different oracles. The approach provably solves a linear programming (LP) relaxation of the global inference problem. It leads to algorithms that are simple, in that they use existing decoding algorithms; efficient, that they avoid exact algorithms for the full model; and often exact, in that empirically they often recover the correct solution in spite of using an LP relaxation. We give experimental results on two problems: 1) the combination of two lexicalized parsing models; and 2) the combination of a lexicalized parsing model and a trigram part-of-speech tagger.","answer":"Recently, dual decomposition has become a popular method for solving complex structured prediction problems in NLP [4] [5] [2] [3] [1] . Soft constraints can be implemented inefficiently using hard constraints and dual decomposition--- by introducing copies of output variables and an auxiliary graphical model, as in . However, at every iteration of dual decomposition, MAP must be run in this auxiliary model. Furthermore the copying of variables doubles the number of iterations needed for information to flow between output variables, and thus slows convergence. On the other hand, our approach to soft constraints has identical per-iteration complexity as for hard constraints, and is a very easy modification to existing hard constraint code."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are uncommon malignancies, highly resistant to chemotherapy, that have emerged as attractive platforms for evaluating novel targeted regimens. everolimus is an oral rapamycin derivative within the mammalian target of rapamycin class of agents. Preclinical series have shown that everolimus exhibits anticancer effects in RCC and NET cell lines. A phase 3 placebo-controlled study in advanced clear-cell RCC, known as RECORD-1 (for \\"REnal Cell cancer treatment with Oral RAD001 given Daily\\"), documented that everolimus stabilizes tumor progression, prolongs progression-free survival and has acceptable tolerability in patients previously treated with the multikinase inhibitors sunitinib and/or sorafenib. everolimus has been granted regulatory approval for use in sunitinib-pretreated and/or sorafenib-pretreated advanced RCC and incorporated into clinical practice guidelines, and the RECORD-1 safety data are being used to develop recommendations for managing clinically important adverse events in everolimus-treated patients. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating everolimus as earlier RCC therapy (first-line for advanced disease and as neoadjuvant therapy), in non-clear-cell tumors, and in combination with various other approved or investigational targeted therapies for RCC. Regarding advanced NET, recently published phase 2 data support the ability of everolimus to improve disease control in patients with advanced NET as monotherapy or in combination with somatostatin analogue therapy, octreotide long-acting release (LAR).

Solid lipid formulation systems are used to overcome oral bioavailability problems of poorly water-soluble drugs. One promising process is the conversion of a liquid lipid system in a free flowing powder by use of adsorbing excipients. The aim of this study was the detailed characterization of solid-liquid interactions in oil adsorbed to Fujicalin® and Neusilin® which were manufactured by means of dual asymmetric centrifugation or conventional mortar/pestle blending. The adsorption strength of the excipients was investigated by Benchtop-NMR and ESR spectroscopy revealing the highest adsorption power for the Neusilin® products. The adsorbate production methods as well as the storage of the excipients impact their adsorption properties. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) show that dual asymmetric centrifugation leads to a smoothing of the particle surface, whereas the mortar/pestle blending results in an uneven surface and particle destruction. The oil distribution at the particles is inhomogeneous for both production methods. The micropolarity of the adsorbed oil was investigated by ESR spectroscopy and multispectral fluorescence imaging. The adsorbing process on Neusilin® leads to an increased micropolarity of the oil component. The release of the oil component in aqueous media could be verified by Benchtop-NMR and multispectral fluorescence imaging.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Fujicalin\\", \\"Neusilin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

The Dataset for Emotions of Narrative Sequences (DENS) was collected from both classic literature available on Project Gutenberg and modern online narratives available on Wattpad, annotated using Amazon Mechanical Turk. A number of statistics and baseline benchmarks are provided for the dataset. Of the tested techniques, we find that the fine-tuning of a pre-trained BERT model achieves the best results, with an average micro-F1 score of 60.4%. Our results show that the dataset provides a novel opportunity in emotion analysis that requires moving beyond existing sentence-level techniques.IntroductionHumans experience a variety of complex emotions in daily life. These emotions are heavily reflected in our language, in both spoken and written forms.Many recent advances in natural language processing on emotions have focused on product reviews BIBREF0 and tweets BIBREF1, BIBREF2. These datasets are often limited in length (e.g. by the number of words in tweets), purpose (e.g. product reviews), or emotional spectrum (e.g. binary classification).Character dialogues and narratives in storytelling usually carry strong emotions. A memorable story is often one in which the emotional journey of the characters resonates with the reader. Indeed, emotion is one of the most important aspects of narratives. In order to characterize narrative emotions properly, we must move beyond binary constraints (e.g. good or bad, happy or sad).In this paper, we introduce the Dataset for Emotions of Narrative Sequences (DENS) for emotion analysis, consisting of passages from long-form fictional narratives from both classic literature and modern stories in English. The data samples consist of self-contained passages that span several sentences and a variety of subjects. Each sample is annotated by using one of 9 classes and an indicator for annotator agreement.BackgroundUsing the categorical basic emotion model BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5 studied creating lexicons from tweets for use in emotion analysis. Recently, BIBREF1, BIBREF6 and BIBREF2 proposed shared-tasks for multi-class emotion analysis based on tweets.Fewer works have been reported on understanding emotions in narratives. Emotional Arc BIBREF7 is one recent advance in this direction. The work used lexicons and unsupervised learning methods based on unlabelled passages from titles in Project Gutenberg.For labelled datasets on narratives, BIBREF8 provided a sentence-level annotated corpus of childrens' stories and BIBREF9 provided phrase-level annotations on selected Project Gutenberg titles.To the best of our knowledge, the dataset in this work is the first to provide multi-class emotion labels on passages, selected from both Project Gutenberg and modern narratives. The dataset is available upon request for non-commercial, research only purposes.DatasetIn this section, we describe the process used to collect and annotate the dataset.Dataset ::: Plutchik’s Wheel of EmotionsThe dataset is annotated based on a modified Plutchik’s wheel of emotions.The original Plutchik’s wheel consists of 8 primary emotions: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Anticipation, Surprise, Trust, Disgust. In addition, more complex emotions can be formed by combing two basic emotions. For example, Love is defined as a combination of Joy and Trust (Fig. 1).The intensity of an emotion is also captured in Plutchik's wheel. For example, the primary emotion of Anger can vary between Annoyance (mild) and Rage (intense).We conducted an initial survey based on 100 stories with a significant fraction sampled from the romance genre. We asked readers to identify the major emotion exhibited in each story from a choice of the original 8 primary emotions.We found that readers have significant difficulty in identifying Trust as an emotion associated with romantic stories. Hence, we modified our annotation scheme by removing Trust and adding Love. We also added the Neutral category to denote passages that do not exhibit any emotional content.The final annotation categories for the dataset are: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Anticipation, Surprise, Love, Disgust, Neutral.Dataset ::: Passage SelectionWe selected both classic and modern narratives in English for this dataset. The modern narratives were sampled based on popularity from Wattpad. We parsed selected narratives into passages, where a passage is considered to be eligible for annotation if it contained between 40 and 200 tokens.In long-form narratives, many non-conversational passages are intended for transition or scene introduction, and may not carry any emotion. We divided the eligible passages into two parts, and one part was pruned using selected emotion-rich but ambiguous lexicons such as cry, punch, kiss, etc.. Then we mixed this pruned part with the unpruned part for annotation in order to reduce the number of neutral passages. See Appendix SECREF25 for the lexicons used.Dataset ::: Mechanical Turk (MTurk)MTurk was set up using the standard sentiment template and instructed the crowd annotators to \`pick the best/major emotion embodied in the passage'.We further provided instructions to clarify the intensity of an emotion, such as: “Rage/Annoyance is a form of Anger”, “Serenity/Ecstasy is a form of Joy”, and “Love includes Romantic/Family/Friendship”, along with sample passages.We required all annotators have a \`master' MTurk qualification. Each passage was labelled by 3 unique annotators. Only passages with a majority agreement between annotators were accepted as valid. This is equivalent to a Fleiss's kappa  score of greater than 0.4.For passages without majority agreement between annotators, we consolidated their labels using in-house data annotators who are experts in narrative content. A passage is accepted as valid if the in-house annotator's label matched any one of the MTurk annotators' labels. The remaining passages are discarded. We provide the fraction of annotator agreement for each label in the dataset.Though passages may lose some emotional context when read independently of the complete narrative, we believe annotator agreement on our dataset supports the assertion that small excerpts can still convey coherent emotions.During the annotation process, several annotators had suggested for us to include additional emotions such as confused, pain, and jealousy, which are common to narratives. As they were not part of the original Plutchik’s wheel, we decided to not include them. An interesting future direction is to study the relationship between emotions such as ‘pain versus sadness’ or ‘confused versus surprise’ and improve the emotion model for narratives.Dataset ::: Dataset StatisticsThe dataset contains a total of 9710 passages, with an average of 6.24 sentences per passage, 16.16 words per sentence, and an average length of 86 words.The vocabulary size is 28K (when lowercased). It contains over 1600 unique titles across multiple categories, including 88 titles (1520 passages) from Project Gutenberg. All of the modern narratives were written after the year 2000, with notable amount of themes in coming-of-age, strong-female-lead, and LGBTQ+. The genre distribution is listed in Table TABREF8.In the final dataset, 21.0% of the data has consensus between all annotators, 73.5% has majority agreement, and 5.48% has labels assigned after consultation with in-house annotators.The distribution of data points over labels with top lexicons (lower-cased, normalized) is shown in Table TABREF9. Note that the Disgust category is very small and should be discarded. Furthermore, we suspect that the data labelled as Surprise may be noisier than other categories and should be discarded as well.Table TABREF10 shows a few examples labelled data from classic titles. More examples can be found in Table TABREF26 in the Appendix SECREF27.BenchmarksWe performed benchmark experiments on the dataset using several different algorithms. In all experiments, we have discarded the data labelled with Surprise and Disgust.We pre-processed the data by using the SpaCy pipeline. We masked out named entities with entity-type specific placeholders to reduce the chance of benchmark models utilizing named entities as a basis for classification.Benchmark results are shown in Table TABREF17. The dataset is approximately balanced after discarding the Surprise and Disgust classes. We report the average micro-F1 scores, with 5-fold cross validation for each technique.We provide a brief overview of each benchmark experiment below. Among all of the benchmarks, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) BIBREF11 achieved the best performance with a 0.604 micro-F1 score.Overall, we observed that deep-learning based techniques performed better than lexical based methods. This suggests that a method which attends to context and themes could do well on the dataset.Benchmarks ::: Bag-of-Words-based BenchmarksWe computed bag-of-words-based benchmarks using the following methods:Classification with TF-IDF + Linear SVM (TF-IDF + SVM)Classification with Depeche++ Emotion lexicons BIBREF12 + Linear SVM (Depeche + SVM)Classification with NRC Emotion lexicons BIBREF13, BIBREF14 + Linear SVM (NRC + SVM)Combination of TF-IDF and NRC Emotion lexicons (TF-NRC + SVM)Benchmarks ::: Doc2Vec + SVMWe also used simple classification models with learned embeddings. We trained a Doc2Vec model BIBREF15 using the dataset and used the embedding document vectors as features for a linear SVM classifier.Benchmarks ::: Hierarchical RNNFor this benchmark, we considered a Hierarchical RNN, following BIBREF16. We used two BiLSTMs BIBREF17 with 256 units each to model sentences and documents. The tokens of a sentence were processed independently of other sentence tokens. For each direction in the token-level BiLSTM, the last outputs were concatenated and fed into the sentence-level BiLSTM as inputs.The outputs of the BiLSTM were connected to 2 dense layers with 256 ReLU units and a Softmax layer. We initialized tokens with publicly available embeddings trained with GloVe BIBREF18. Sentence boundaries were provided by SpaCy. Dropout was applied to the dense hidden layers during training.Benchmarks ::: Bi-directional RNN and Self-Attention (BiRNN + Self-Attention)One challenge with RNN-based solutions for text classification is finding the best way to combine word-level representations into higher-level representations.Self-attention BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21 has been adapted to text classification, providing improved interpretability and performance. We used BIBREF20 as the basis of this benchmark.The benchmark used a layered Bi-directional RNN (60 units) with GRU cells and a dense layer. Both self-attention layers were 60 units in size and cross-entropy was used as the cost function.Note that we have omitted the orthogonal regularizer term, since this dataset is relatively small compared to the traditional datasets used for training such a model. We did not observe any significant performance gain while using the regularizer term in our experiments.Benchmarks ::: ELMo embedding and Bi-directional RNN (ELMo + BiRNN)Deep Contextualized Word Representations (ELMo) BIBREF22 have shown recent success in a number of NLP tasks. The unsupervised nature of the language model allows it to utilize a large amount of available unlabelled data in order to learn better representations of words.We used the pre-trained ELMo model (v2) available on Tensorhub for this benchmark. We fed the word embeddings of ELMo as input into a one layer Bi-directional RNN (16 units) with GRU cells (with dropout) and a dense layer. Cross-entropy was used as the cost function.Benchmarks ::: Fine-tuned BERTBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) BIBREF11 has achieved state-of-the-art results on several NLP tasks, including sentence classification.We used the fine-tuning procedure outlined in the original work to adapt the pre-trained uncased BERT_textrm {{scriptsize LARGE}} to a multi-class passage classification task. This technique achieved the best result among our benchmarks, with an average micro-F1 score of 60.4%.ConclusionWe introduce DENS, a dataset for multi-class emotion analysis from long-form narratives in English. We provide a number of benchmark results based on models ranging from bag-of-word models to methods based on pre-trained language models (ELMo and BERT).Our benchmark results demonstrate that this dataset provides a novel challenge in emotion analysis. The results also demonstrate that attention-based models could significantly improve performance on classification tasks such as emotion analysis.Interesting future directions for this work include: 1. incorporating common-sense knowledge into emotion analysis to capture semantic context and 2. using few-shot learning to bootstrap and improve performance of underrepresented emotions.Finally, as narrative passages often involve interactions between multiple emotions, one avenue for future datasets could be to focus on the multi-emotion complexities of human language and their contextual interactions.Appendices ::: Sample DataTable TABREF26 shows sample passages from classic titles with corresponding labels.Figure 1: Plutchik’s wheel of emotions (Wikimedia, 2011)Table 1: Genre distribution of the modern narrativesTable 4: Benchmark results (averaged 5-fold cross validation)Table 2: Dataset label distributionQuestion: How many annotators were there?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"3 \\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"We required all annotators have a \`masteru0027 MTurk qualification.

The current U.S. military and civilian oxime countermeasure, 2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]-1-methylpyridin-1-ium chloride (2-PAM), is under consideration for replacement with a more effective acetylcholinesterase reactivator, 1,1'-methylenebis{4-hydroxyiminomethyl}pyridinium dimethanesulfonate (MMB-4). Kinetic data in the scientific literature for MMB-4 are limited; therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for a structurally related oxime, 1,1'-trimethylenebis{4-hydroximinomethyl}pyridinium dibromide. Based on a previous model structure for the organophosphate diisopropylfluorophosphate, the model includes key sites of acetylcholinesterase inhibition (brain and diaphragm), as well as fat, kidney, liver, rapidly perfused tissues and slowly perfused tissues. All tissue compartments are diffusion limited. Model parameters were collected from the literature, predicted using quantitative structure-property relationships or, when necessary, fit to available pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The model was parameterized using rat plasma, tissue and urine time course data from intramuscular administration, as well as human blood and urine data from intravenous and intramuscular administration; sensitivity analyses were performed. The PBPK model successfully simulates rat and human data sets and has been evaluated by predicting intravenous mouse and intramuscular human data not used in the development of the model. Monte Carlo analyses were performed to quantify human population kinetic variability in the human evaluation data set. The model identifies potential pharmacokinetic differences between rodents and humans, indicated by differences in model parameters between species. The PBPK model can be used to optimize the dosing regimen to improve oxime therapeutic efficacy in a human population.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"2-PAM\\", \\"organophosphate\\", \\"oxime\\", \\"2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]-1-methylpyridin-1-ium chloride\\", \\"1,1u0027-trimethylenebis{4-hydroximinomethyl}pyridinium dibromide\\", \\"diisopropylfluorophosphate\\", \\"oximes\\", \\"1,1u0027-methylenebis{4-hydroxyiminomethyl}pyridinium dimethanesulfonate\\", \\"MMB-4\\", \\"TMB-4\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"acetylcholinesterase\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Interferons (IFNs) inhibit induction by IL-4 of multiple genes in human monocytes. However, the mechanism by which IFNs mediate this inhibition has not been defined. IL-4 activates gene expression by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation, homodimerization, and nuclear translocation of the latent transcription factor, STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-6). STAT6-responsive elements are characteristically present in the promoters of IL-4-inducible genes. Because STAT6 activation is essential for IL-4-induced gene expression, we examined the ability of type I and type II IFNs to regulate activation of STAT6 by IL-4 in primary human monocytes. Pretreatment of monocytes with IFN-beta or IFN-gamma, but not IL-1, IL-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte / macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, or transforming growth factor beta suppressed activation of STAT6 by IL-4. This inhibition was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 and was not evident unless the cells were preincubated with IFN for at least 1 hr before IL-4 stimulation. Furthermore, inhibition by IFN could be blocked by cotreatment with actinomycin D and correlated temporally with induction of the JAK / STAT inhibitory gene, SOCS-1. Forced expression of SOCS-1 in a macrophage cell line, RAW264, markedly suppressed trans-activation of an IL-4-inducible reporter as well as IL-6-and IFN-gamma-induced reporter gene activity. These findings demonstrate that IFNs inhibit IL-4-induced activation of STAT6 and STAT6-dependent gene expression, at least in part, by inducing expression of SOCS-1.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"macrophage cell line\\", \\"RAW264\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"primary human monocytes\\", \\"monocytes\\", \\"human monocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"JAK / STAT inhibitory gene\\", \\"IL - 4 - inducible reporter\\", \\"IL - 4 - inducible genes\\", \\"promoters\\", \\"SOCS - 1 gene\\", \\"SOCS - 1\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Interferons\\", \\"IL - 4\\", \\"STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription - 6)\\", \\"interleukin 4\\", \\"IFN\\", \\"Interferons (IFNs)\\", \\"latent transcription factor\\", \\"granulocyte / macrophage colony - stimulating factor\\", \\"IL - 6\\", \\"IFN - beta\\", \\"IFN - gamma\\", \\"STAT6\\", \\"IFNs\\", \\"macrophage colony - stimulating factor\\", \\"IL - 1\\", \\"IL - 6 -\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"signal transducer and activator of transcription - 6\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The effect of guar ( 15.6 g/day ) , a dietary fibre , and simultaneous administration of bezafibrate ( 600 mg/day ) during dietetic treatment on the plasma lipoproteins and apolipoproteins was investigated in 12 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia ( corresponding to the HLP type IIa pattern ) . Either bezafibrate alone or bezafibrate in combination with guar was administered in a cross-over study for 3 months . Guar led to an additional lowering of the total cholesterol in the plasma by 7 % ( P less than or equal to 0.05 ) associated with a fall of the low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-cholesterol ) by 13 % ( P less than or equal to 0.01 ) without any changes in the very low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) and high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterols . In parallel with the decrease in LDL-cholesterol , the apoprotein B also was diminished by 20 % ( P less than or equal to 0.05 ) . The plasma triglyceride level and the triglyceride distribution within the individual lipoprotein fractions were not altered in any consistent manner by the addition of guar . Neither the fasting plasma glucose level nor the body weight were affected . The side-effects due to guar treatment consisted of slight nausea , meteorism and constipation , but this did not in any of the cases lead to early termination of the study .

Adaptivemethods often display faster progress in the initial portion of the training, but their performance quickly plateaus on the unseen data (development/test set) BID17 . Indeed,the optimizer is chosen as SGD (or with momentum) in several recent state-of-the-art works in natural language processing and computer vision BID11 BID18 , wherein these instances SGD does perform better than adaptive methods. BID14 haverecently proposed a variant of ADAM called AMSGRAD, hoping to solve this problem. The authorsprovide a theoretical guarantee of convergence but only illustrate its better performance on training data. However, thegeneralization ability of AMSGRAD on unseen data is found to be similar to that of ADAM while a considerable performance gap still exists between AMSGRAD and SGD BID6 BID1 .In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study on ADAM and illustrate that both extremely large and small learning rates exist by the end of training. The resultscorrespond with the perspective pointed out by BID17 that the lack of generalization performance of adaptive methods may stem from unstable and extreme learning rates. In fact, introducingnon-increasing learning rates, the key point in AMSGRAD, may help abate the impact of huge learning rates, while it neglects possible effects of small ones. We further provide anexample of a simple convex optimization problem to elucidate how tiny learning rates of adaptive methods can lead to undesirable non-convergence. In such settings, RMSPROPand ADAM provably do not converge to an optimal solution, and furthermore, however large the initial step size α is, it is impossible for ADAM to fight against the scale-down term.Based on the above analysis, we propose new variants of ADAM and AMSGRAD, named AD-ABOUND and AMSBOUND, which do not suffer from the negative impact of extreme learning rates. We employ dynamic boundson learning rates in these adaptive methods, where the lower and upper bound are initialized as zero and infinity respectively, and they both smoothly converge to a constant final step size. The new variants can beregarded as adaptive methods at the beginning of training, and they gradually and smoothly transform to SGD (or with momentum) as time step increases. In this framework, we canenjoy a rapid initial training process as well as good final generalization ability. We provide a convergenceanalysis for the new variants in the convex setting.We finally turn to an empirical study of the proposed methods on various popular tasks and models in computer vision and natural language processing. Experimental results demonstratethat our methods have higher learning speed early in training and in the meantime guarantee strong generalization performance compared to several adaptive and non-adaptive methods. Moreover, they can bring considerableimprovement over their prototypes especially on complex deep networks.We investigate existing adaptive algorithms and find that extremely large or small learning rates can result in the poor convergence behavior.A rigorous proof of non-convergence for ADAM is provided to demonstrate the above problem.Motivated by the strong generalization ability of SGD, we design a strategy to constrain the learning rates of ADAM and AMSGRAD to avoid a violent oscillation.Our proposed algorithms, AD-ABOUND and AMSBOUND, which employ dynamic bounds on their learning rates, achieve a smooth transition to SGD.They show the great efficacy on several standard benchmarks while maintaining advantageous properties of adaptive methods such as rapid initial progress and hyperparameter insensitivity.","answer":"Novel variants of optimization methods that combine the benefits of both adaptive and non-adaptive methods."},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

The results were consistent when evaluating the association based on the left hand. The difference between right and left-hand 2D:4D was also not associated with TGCT risk [OR for a one-SD increase in ΔR-L: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.87-1.23].Digit ratio (2D:4D) is associated with gastric cancer.RESULTS: GCA group presented significantly higher left 2D:4D, but significantly lower R-L in comparison to healthy controls, particularly so for males. Digit ratio did not correlate to clinical staging or TNM staging.The 2D:4D pattern found for gastric cancer parallels that earlier described for breast cancer.Higher second fourth digit ratio predicts higher incidence of prostate cancer in prostate biopsy.2D/4D ratio >0,95 (OR (CI 95%) 4,4 (1,491-13,107) was related to neoplasia.CONCLUSION: High digit ratio predicts PCa in men undergoing prostate biopsy. Digit ratio >0,95 has 4-fold risk of PCa compared to men with digit ratio ≤0.95.RESULTS: African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95% confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio. CONCLUSION: 2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer.RESULTS: We found a direct association between left 2D:4D and breast cancer risk, an inverse association between Δ(r-l) and risk of breast cancer, but no association between right 2D:4D and breast cancer risk. Among breast cancer cases, both right 2D:4D and Δ(r-l) were inversely associated with age at diagnosis.CONCLUSION: Digit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer.Recent studies have reported a strong association between 2D:4D and risk of prostate cancer.RESULTS: No association was observed between 2D:4D and prostate cancer risk overall (HRs 1.00; 95% CIs, 0.92-1.08 for right, 0.93-1.08 for left).CONCLUSION: Our results are not consistent with an association between 2D:4D and overall prostate cancer risk, but we cannot exclude a weak inverse association between 2D:4D and early onset prostate cancer risk.Males in the OSCC group presented significantly higher digit ratio (P = 0.03) in comparison with males with OPLs and individuals without oral lesions. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, males with the higher digit ratio seem to be more prone to undergo malignization of lesions in the oral cavity.Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D : 4D), men with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D : 4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21). CONCLUSION: Pattern of finger lengths may be a simple marker of prostate cancer risk, with length of 2D greater than 4D suggestive of lower risk.In the case-control analysis (n = 263), after controlling for ethnicity, women who developed CIN were significantly more likely to have a higher 2D:4D compared with HPV-negative women. A similar, nonsignificant trend was observed among women with a persistent HPV infection. CONCLUSION: Lower fetal androgen exposure may predispose to persistent HPV and increased risk of CIN.Low numbers of CAG repeats and low 2D:4D are both associated with high sperm numbers and protection against breast cancer.Digit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer.A lower digit ratio is related to an increased detection rate of prostate cancer, a high percentage of core cancer volume and a high Gleason score.Digit ratio could act as a possible marker for cancer predisposition.Right hand digit ratio (2D:4D) is associated with oral cancer.CONCLUSION: Digit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer.Second to fourth digit ratio: a predictor of prostate-specific antigen level and the presence of prostate cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a lower digit ratio have higher risks of prostate biopsy and prostate cancer.Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as breast cancer and myocardial infarction.Low numbers of CAG repeats and low 2D:4D are both associated with high sperm numbers and protection against breast cancer.Findings from AR studies predict that low 2D:4D will be associated with prostate and hepatocellular cancer, urolithiasis, ADHD, ankylosing spondylitis, spontaneous abortion, and polycystic ovaries, while high 2D:4D will be associated with motor neuron diseases and endometrial cancer.We found a direct association between left 2D:4D and breast cancer risk, an inverse association between Δ(r-l) and risk of breast cancer, but no association between right 2D:4D and breast cancer riskDigit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancerThe 2D:4D pattern found for gastric cancer parallels that earlier described for breast cancer","answer":"Digit ratio (2D:4D) is associated with gastric cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma. 2D:4D was found to be higher in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and prostate cancer  patients relative to controls.

The AML1 gene on chromosome 21 is disrupted in the (8;21) (q22;q22) and (3;21) (q26;q22) translocations associated with myelogenous leukemias and encodes a DNA-binding protein. From AML1 gene, two representative forms of proteins, AML1a and AML1b, are produced by an alternative splicing. Both forms have DNA-binding domain, but AML1a lacks a putative transcriptional activation domain which AML1b has. Here we demonstrate that AML1a, which solely has no effects as a transcriptional regulator, dominantly suppresses transcriptional activation by AML1b, and that AML1a exhibits the higher affinity for DNA-binding than AML1b. Furthermore a dominant negative form of AML1, AML1a, totally suppressed granulocytic differentiation otherwise induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor when AML1a was overexpressed in 32Dc13 murine myeloid cells. Such differentiation block by AML1a was canceled by the concomitant overexpression of AML1b. These data strongly suggest that a transcriptionally active form of AML1 is essential for the myeloid cell differentiation. In addition, we observed an altered expression level of AML1 along with the myeloid differentiation in several hemopoietic cell lines. In these cases, at least, the AML1 expression level is a potential regulator for myeloid cell differentiation.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"hemopoietic cell lines\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"32Dc13 murine myeloid cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"AML1\\", \\"AML1 gene\\", \\"chromosome 21\\", \\"acute myeloid leukemia gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"AML1\\", \\"DNA - binding protein\\", \\"AML1a\\", \\"AML1b\\", \\"dominant negative form\\", \\"DNA - binding domain\\", \\"granulocyte colony - stimulating factor\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Pink] in high-fructose diet-induced diabetic rats. Vescalagin, an active component from Pink wax apple [Syzygium samarangense (Blume) Merrill and Perry cv. Pink] fruit, with glucose uptake enhancing ability in insulin-resistant FL83B mouse hepatocytes, as shown in our previous study, was further evaluated for its hypotriglyceridemic and hypoglycemic effects in high-fructose diet (HFD)-induced diabetic rats. Wistar rats were fed HFD for 16 weeks and orally administered with vescalagin from Pink wax apple daily during the last 4 weeks. The results of biochemical parameters showed that fasting blood glucose, C-peptide, fructosamine, triglyceride and free fatty acid contents decreased by 44.7%, 46.2%, 4.0%, 42.5%, and 10.8%, respectively, in the HFD-induced diabetic rats administered with vescalagin at 30 mg/kg body weight in comparison with those of control HFD-induced diabetic rats. However, high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol content increased by 14.4% in the HFD rats treated with vescalagin. The present study reveals that vescalagin could have therapeutic value against diabetic progression via its anti-hypertriglyceridemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"fructosamine\\", \\"glucose\\", \\"fructose\\", \\"Vescalagin\\", \\"vescalagin\\", \\"triglyceride\\", \\"cholesterol\\", \\"fatty acid\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

This is partly remedied by prioritization of disease-associated variants that overlap GWAS-enriched epigenomic annotations. Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations. In simulation, RiVIERA promising power in detecting causal variants and causal annotations, the multi-trait joint inference further improved the detection power. We applied RiVIERA to model the existing GWAS summary statistics of 9 autoimmune diseases and Schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue-specific epigenomics annotations from ENCODE/Roadmap consortium covering 127 cell/tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks. RiVIERA identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood T-Cell specifically in the nine autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNA-hypersensitive-sites.Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations.Joint Bayesian inference of risk variants and tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments across multiple complex human diseases.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

however, these successful approaches often rely on frequent feedback indicating whether the learning agent is performing well, otherwise known as dense rewards.In many tasks, dense rewards can be difficult to specify without inducing locally optimal but globally sub-optimal behavior.As such, it is frequently desirable to specify only a sparse reward that simply signals whether an agent has attained success or failure on a given task.Despite their desirability, sparse rewards introduce their own set of challenges.When rewards are sparse, determining which of an agent's actions led to a reward becomes more difficult, a phenomenon known in reinforcement learning as the credit-assignment problem.Furthermore, if rewards cannot be obtained by random actions, an agent will never receive a signal through which it can begin learning.As such, researchers have devised methods which attempt to provide agents with additional reward signals, known as intrinsic rewards, through which they can learn meaningful behavior (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2009) .A large subset of these works focus on learning intrinsic rewards that encourage exploration of the state space (Pathak et al., 2017; Houthooft et al., 2016; Burda et al., 2019; Ostrovski et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2017) .Exploring the state space provides a useful inductive bias for many sparse reward problems where the challenge lies in \\"finding\\" rewards that may only be obtained in parts of the state space that are hard to reach by random exploration.These exploration-focused approaches frequently formulate their intrinsic rewards to measure the \\"novelty\\" of a state, such that agents are rewarded for taking actions that lead to novel states.Our work approaches the question of how to apply novelty-based intrinsic motivation in the cooperative multi-agent setting.Directly applying novelty-based intrinsic motivation to the multi-agent setting results in agents each exploring their shared state space independently from one another.In many cases, independent exploration may not be the most efficient method.For example, consider a task where multiple agents are placed in a maze and their goal is to collectively reach all of the landmarks that are spread out through the maze.It would be inefficient for the agents to explore the same areas redundantly.Instead, it would be much more sensible for agents to \\"divide-and-conquer,\\" or avoid redundant exploration.Thus, an ideal intrinsic reward for this task would encourage such behavior; however, the same behavior would not be ideal for other tasks.For example, take the same maze but change the task such that all agents need to reach the same landmark.Divide-and-conquer would no longer be an optimal exploration strategy since agents only need to find one landmark and they all need to reach the same one.Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning can benefit from sharing information about exploration across agents; however, the question of what to do with that shared information depends on the task at hand.In order to improve exploration in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, we must first identify what kinds inductive biases can potentially be useful for multi-agent tasks and then devise intrinsic reward functions that incorporate those biases.Then, we must find a way to allow our agents to adapt their exploration to the given task, rather than committing to one type of intrinsic reward function.In this work, we first introduce a candidate set of intrinsic rewards for multiagent exploration which hold differing properties with regards to how they explore the state space.Subsequently, we present a hierarchical method for simultaneously learning policies trained on different intrinsic rewards and selecting the policies which maximize extrinsic returns.Importantly, all policies are trained using a shared replay buffer, drastically improving the sample efficiency and effectiveness of learning in cooperative multi-agent tasks with sparse rewards.We propose a set of multi-agent intrinsic reward functions with differing properties, and compare them both qualitatively (through videos) and quantitatively on several multi-agent exploration tasks in both a gridworld domain as well as in VizDoom.Overall, we can see that cooperative multi-agent tasks can, in many cases, benefit from intrinsic rewards that take into account what other agents have explored, but there are various ways to incorporate that information, each with differing properties.As such, we propose a method for learning policies for all intrinsic reward types simultaneously while dynamically selecting the most effective ones.We show that our method is capable of matching or surpassing the performance of the best performing intrinsic reward type on various tasks while using the same number of samples collected from the environment.In future work we hope to introduce methods for directly learning the multi-agent intrinsic reward functions, rather than selecting from a set.The black holes which send agents back to their starting positions if they are stepped into are an important aspect of the environment, as they add difficulty to exploration.The probability, ρ, of a black hole opening at each step, t, evolves as such: ρ t+1 = ρ t + N (µ, σ), where µ = σ = 0.05 for TASK 1 and µ = σ = 0.005 for 2 and 3.Agents observe their global position in (x, y) coordinates (scalars), as well as local information regarding walls in adjacent spaces, the probability of their adjacent spaces opening into a black hole, the relative position of other agents (if they are within 3 spaces), as well as information about which treasures the agent has already collected in the given episode.The global state is represented by the (x, y) coordinates of all agents, as one-hot encoded vectors for x and y separately, as well as the local information of all agents regarding black holes, walls, and treasures collected.Each agent's action space consists of the 4 cardinal directions as well as an option to not move, which is helpful in cases where an agent is waiting for a black hole to be safe to cross.","answer":"We propose several intrinsic reward functions for encouraging coordinated exploration in multi-agent problems, and introduce an approach to dynamically selecting the best exploration method for a given task, online."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

As secreted ligands, the extracellular traffic of BMP has been extensively studied. However, it remains poorly understood that how BMP ligands are secreted from BMP-producing cells. In this work, we show the dominant role of Marcksb controlling the secretory process of Bmp2b via interaction with Hsp70 in vivo. We firstly carefully characterized the role of Marcksb in promoting BMP signaling during dorsoventral axis formation through knockdown approach. We then showed that Marcksb cell autonomously regulates the trafficking of Bmp2b from producing cell to the extracellular space and both the total and the extracellular Bmp2b was decreased in Marcksb-deficient embryos. However, neither the zygotic mutant of marcksb( Zmarcksb) nor the maternal zygotic mutant of marcksb( MZmarcksb) showed any defects of dorsalization. In contrast, the MZmarcksb embryos even showed increased BMP signaling activity as measured by expression of BMP targets, phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 levels and imaging of Bmp2b, suggesting that a phenomenon of “genetic over-compensation” arose. Finally, we revealed that the over-compensation effects of BMP signaling in MZmarcksb was achieved through a sequential up-regulation of MARCKS-family members Marcksa, Marcksl1a and Marcksl1b, and MARCKS-interacting protein Hsp70. 3. We concluded that the Marcksb modulates BMP signaling through regulating the secretory pathway of Bmp2b.Introduction:Early vertebrate development involves the formation and patterning of body plan, such as dorsoventral axis formation and anteroposterior axis formation. Bone morphogenetic protein( BMP) signaling gradient is critical for the specification of ventral and posterior cell fate[1]. Like other morphogens, the formation of BMP signaling gradient depends on several factors, including the graded transcription and secretion of BMP ligands, the extracellular transport of BMP ligands and the interaction between BMP ligands and their antagonists[2]. In zebrafish, the secreted ligands Bmp2b and Bmp7a act as heterodimers and bind to their receptors type I and type II to transduce signal and to phosphorylate the regulatory Smads( Smads 1, 5, and 9), which in turn regulate BMP target genes with Smad4 in the nuclei[3, 4]. As secreted ligands, the extracellular traffic of BMP homolog Dpp has been extensively studied in Drosophila. The long-range distribution of Dpp is mainly dependent on restricted extracellular diffusion[5], which process is regulated by glypican members of heparin sulfate proteoglycans[6]. In zebrafish, it was reported that BMP gradient is mainly determined by the graded expression of BMP ligands[7]. The secretion of several morphogens, such as WNTs, FGF-2 and Hedgehog has been studied in different animal models[8–11]. Recent study implies that the release of Dpp is regulated by inwardly rectifying potassium channel and calcium transients[12]. However, it remains poorly understood how the secretory pathway, including the intracellular trafficking and the secretion to extracellular space, of BMP ligands is regulated. The myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate( MARCKS) is a ubiquitous substrate for protein kinase C( PKC). Two conserved domains within the MARCKS proteins are known to be critical for their functions: the N-terminal myristoylated domain helps anchoring MARCKS to the plasma membrane; and the phosphorylation site domain( PSD) domain serves as the site for MARCKS binding to actin filaments and calcium/calmodulin[13–17]. A notable function of MARCKS is to regulate the secretion of different substances including airway mucin[18, 19]. The well-studied regulated mucin secretion process via MARCKS involves its PKC and calcium/calmodulin dependent phosphorylation, high binding affinity with F-actin and membrane phosphoinositides, and interaction with intracellular molecular chaperons[20–23]. The MARCKS family proteins have also been reported to play various roles in gastrulation movements in Xenopus[24] and zebrafish[25], and the morphogenesis of neural tube in mouse[26] and chick[27]. However, the potential roles of MARCKS in morphogen secretion and embryonic patterning has never been studied and reported. In this study, we unveiled a role of a MARCKS family member–Marcksb in dorsoventral patterning by regulating the BMP signaling activity through interacting with Heat-shock protein 70( Hsp70) to control the secretion of BMP ligands. Interestingly, unlike the marcksb knockdown embryos showing dorsalization, the maternal-zygotic mutants of marcksb( MZmarcksb) showed mild ventralization, suggesting that genetic over-compensation arises in the MZmarcksb embryos. We further proved that the transcription of other MARCKS family members were strongly activated during oogenesis of MZmarcksb females, and Hsp70. 3 –the MARCKS interaction protein was up-regulated at shield stage in MZmarcksb embryos, suggesting a sequential compensation of different genetic factors.Discussion:MARCKS is known to be involved in regulating secretion of many proteins in various cell types. The role of MARCKS in mucin secretion in the airway has been intensively studied[19, 22, 37, 41–46]. The translocation of MARCKS from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm upon phosphorylation by PKCδ is the initial step allowing MARCKS binding to the mucin granules[44], and this binding requires the interaction among translocated MARCKS, Hsp70 and Cysteine string protein( CSP)[22, 37]. After dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase I and 2A, MARCKS mediates the mucin granules binding to the myosin V and move along the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane[20]. In our study, the interaction between MARCKS and Hsp70 and the Phosphorylation of Marcksb both affect the extracellular level of Bmp2b, which indicates that MARCKS acts similarly to its role in mucin secretion in the intracellular trafficking and the secretion of Bmp2b. The maturation of TGF-β superfamily ligands, such as BMPs, requires endoproteolytic cleavage of the prodomain from BMPs precursors( ProBMPs) which coincides with the intracellular trafficking process[47, 48]. Our data show that Bmp2b is properly cleaved before it being secreted to the extracellular space, as only properly cleaved Bmp2b is detected in the extracellular medium. The extracellular level of Bmp2b is much lower in marcksb-deficient embryo, indicating that marcksb is required for the secretory pathway of BMP ligands. Besides, we also noticed that the proBmp2b level was slightly increased and the cleaved Bmp2b level was slightly decreased in the embryonic lysis of marcksb-deficient embryo when compared with wildtype embryo. In consideration of the key role of MARCKS in intracellular trafficking system, we propose that proBmp2b would not traffic properly to the place where it is cleaved without the help of MARCKS. Moreover, the defective cleavage of proBMPs may further interfere dimerization, folding, and secretion of the active ligands[49, 50]. Therefore, it is possible that marcksb and hsp70 are required for one or several steps in the whole secretory pathway of BMPs, which mainly includes the intracellular trafficking along with endoproteolytic cleavage and the secretion to extracellular space. Embryonic gastrulation includes dynamic events of cell migration and cell fate determination, both of which some molecules are involved in. One example is that the ventral to dorsal BMP signaling gradient transducing through Alk8 and Smad5 can create loose cell-cell adhesiveness at ventral region and allow ventral cells migrating dorsally[51]. This effect of BMP signal is different from its classical role in ventral cell fate determination and possibly is achieved by transcriptional activation of gene regulating cadherin function[51]. Our study provides another example on how one molecule could act on both morphogenesis and cell fate determination. It is widely accepted that MARCKS is required for gastrulation movements, which might be related to its binding with phosphoinositides[52] and F-actin[24]. Although the previous MARCKS knockdown studies in Xenopus and zebrafish mainly focused on its function on gastrulation movements[24, 25], they could not exclude the possibility that MARCKS family members also participate in embryonic patterning before or during gastrulation. In the present study, we also observed epiboly defects in both marcksb morphants and marcksb mutants, which is consistent to its classical role in regulation of cell migration. For the first time, however, we revealed that zebrafish marcksb is also required for dorsoventral patterning, and the function is achieved by interacting with Hsp70. 3 to regulate the secretory process of BMPs, a type of morphogen crucial for ventral cell fate specification. Therefore, our study provides new insights into how a classical factor involved in cell migration also acts on cell fate determination. In this study, we faced the genetic compensation responding to gene knockout which was reported recently[33]. Interestingly, the transcription of other MARCKS family members were activated during oogenesis in MZmarcksb females, probably driven by non-sense mRNA decay mechanism[53, 54], and Hsp70. 3 –the MARCKS interaction protein was up-regulated at shield stage which was presumably driven by zygotic activation in MZmarcksb embryos, suggesting a sequential compensation of different genetic factors via different mechanisms. Knockdown of either hsp70. 3 or a combination of marcksa, marcksl1a and marcksl1b can efficiently block the activity of BMP signaling and reduce the extracellular level of Bmp proteins in the MZmarcksb embryos, which indicates that both Hsp70 and other MARCKS proteins collaborate closely to respond to the genetic loss of marcksb. In our case, the genetic compensation raised both from genes with sequence homology, and from genes within the same functional network, which support the recently proposed working model[33]. Interestingly, MZmarcksb showed a higher level of secreted Bmp2b( Fig 6E and 6F) and was sensitive to the knockdown of Bmp2b antagonist Chordin( Fig 6G–6I), suggesting that the genetic compensation could even lead to elevated output of the overall products and mild enhancement of certain biological process. This phenomenon has never been demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, the detection of maternal expression of other MARCKS family members in MZmarcksb suggests that they may have switched from zygotic genes to maternal genes in the genetic adaption process during oogenesis.","answer":"Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) are extracellular proteins which belong to the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) superfamily .

We investigated the roles of the prostaglandin synthases cyclooxygenase (COX) I and COX-II in angiogenesis and progesterone production in the newly formed CL, using inhibitors of the COX enzymes and the gonadotropin-induced pseudopregnant rat as a model. Injection of indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, on the day of ovulation and the following day decreased serum levels of progesterone, as did injection of the selective COX-II inhibitor NS-398. In contrast, a selective COX-I inhibitor, SC-560, had no effect on serum progesterone concentrations. None of the inhibitors had any effect on the weight of the superovulated ovaries or on the synthesis of progesterone by cultured luteal cells. To determine whether changes in angiogenesis are responsible for the decrease in progesterone synthesis, we measured hemoglobin and CD34 levels in luteinized ovaries following injection of COX inhibitors and measured the relative frequency of cells positive for platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule as a specific marker for endothelial cells. All of these parameters were reduced by the COX-II inhibitors, suggesting that changes in the vasculature are responsible for the decrease in serum progesterone. Histological examination of ovarian corrosion casts indicated that NS-398 inhibited the establishment of luteal capillary vessels following the injection of hCG. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the activity of COX-II is associated with the formation of functional CL via its stimulation of angiogenesis.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"ovarian\\", \\"superovulated ovaries\\", \\"endothelial cells\\", \\"serum\\", \\"CL\\", \\"cells\\", \\"ovarian luteal\\", \\"cultured luteal cells\\", \\"vasculature\\", \\"corpus luteum\\", \\"luteal capillary vessels\\", \\"ovaries\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

To further reveal the functional significance of RBPs during neural development, we carried out an in vivo RNAi screen in the dorsal spinal cord interneurons, including the commissural neurons. We found that the NOVA family of RBPs play a key role in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and axon guidance. Interestingly, Nova mutants display similar defects as the knockout of the Dcc transmembrane receptor. We show here that Nova deficiency disrupts the alternative splicing of Dcc, and that restoring Dcc splicing in Nova knockouts is able to rescue the defects. Together, our results demonstrate that the production of DCC splice variants controlled by NOVA has a crucial function during many stages of commissural neuron development.Introduction:Alternative splicing generates gene function complexity in many neural developmental processes, including neuronal differentiation, neuronal migration, axon growth and guidance, and synapse formation and function( Grabowski and Black, 2001; Lee and Irizarry, 2003; Li et al., 2007). A large number of axon guidance molecules undergo alternative splicing, including Dscam( Schmucker et al., 2000), Netrin ligands and their Dcc and Neogenin receptors( Keeling et al., 1997; Reale et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2004), Slit ligands and Robo receptors( Camurri et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008; Clark et al., 2002; Dalkic et al., 2006; Little et al., 2002; Tanno et al., 2004), Semaphorin ligands and Neuropilin and Plexin receptors( Cackowski et al., 2004; Correa et al., 2001; Qu et al., 2002; Takahashi et al., 2009; Tamagnone et al., 1999), and Ephrins and Ephs( Holmberg et al., 2000; Lai et al., 1999; Sajjadi et al., 1991). However, the functional significance of these alternative splicing events and the splicing factors responsible for generating protein variants for these molecules remain largely uncharacterized. Netrin and Dcc( deleted in colorectal carcinoma) function during cell migration, neurite specification and growth, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and tumorigenesis( Cooper et al., 1999; Killeen, 2009; Mehlen and Tauszig-Delamasure, 2014; Moore et al., 2007). Within the spinal cord commissural neurons, DCC is required for Netrin-stimulated axon outgrowth and for attracting the axons to the Netrin-secreting midline( Dickson, 2002; Dickson and Zou, 2010; Evans and Bashaw, 2010). Mammalian Dcc undergoes alternative splicing to generate two isoforms that differ in the extracellular domain, in the linker sequence between the fourth and fifth fibronectin repeats( FN4 and FN5)( Reale et al., 1994). This alternative splicing was first reported in neuroblastoma cells and was found to be disrupted in these tumor cells( Reale et al., 1994), but its physiological significance was completely unknown. We refer to the splice variants hereafter as DCClong and DCCshort, with DCClong containing extra 20 amino acids in the FN4-FN5 linker. Interestingly, a recent structure study shows that the two isoforms bind Netrin-1 with comparable affinities, but are likely to adopt distinct conformations upon ligand binding( Xu et al., 2014). To reveal the factors that control the alternative splicing of axon guidance genes including Dcc, we carried out an in vivo RNAi screen against candidate RNA-binding proteins( RBPs) in cultured mouse embryos, and found that Nova1 and Nova2 knockdown leads to severe defects in the dorsal spinal cord interneurons, including the commissural interneurons. The NOVA( neuro-oncological ventral antigen) proteins were first identified as the autoimmune antigens in the neurodegenerative disease POMA( paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia; Darnell, 1996). NOVA1/2 are neural-specific KH( hnRNP K homology)-type of RBPs that can directly regulate alternative splicing( Buckanovich et al., 1996; Lewis et al., 1999; Ule et al., 2006). Genome-wide studies have identified many potential NOVA targets that are involved in various neural developmental processes( Licatalosi et al., 2008; Ule et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2010). In vivo studies using Nova knockout mice have demonstrated defects in synapse formation and function, and in neuronal migration( Huang et al., 2005; Jensen et al., 2000; Ruggiu et al., 2009; Yano et al., 2010). We show here that Nova1/2 loss of function reduces the migration of the spinal cord interneurons and their progenitors, and disturbs the axon outgrowth and guidance of the commissural interneurons. Interestingly, these defects resemble those seen in Dcc knockouts. Consistently, Dcc alternative splicing is perturbed by Nova deficiency in vivo. Through rescue experiments, we show that restoring Dcclong, the diminished isoform in Nova knockouts, is able to reverse the defects. Furthermore, NOVA1/2 regulate Dcc pre-mRNA splicing in in vitro assays. Together, our results demonstrate that Dcc alternative splicing is important for the gene function and is controlled by the NOVA splicing factors.Discussion:Neuronal and axonal migration requires dynamic regulation of cell signaling, particularly evident as cells/axons encounter an intermediate target such as the midline of the central nervous system( Dickson and Zou, 2010; Evans and Bashaw, 2010; Kaprielian et al., 2001). Alternative splicing has been increasingly implicated as an important means to generate temporal and spatial specific functions for guidance molecules( Chen et al., 2008; Park and Graveley, 2007). To further understand the functional significance of alternative splicing, it is important to identify the relevant splicing factors and their targets. Through an in vivo RNAi screen against RBPs, we discovered that Nova1/2 are key regulators of both neuronal and axonal migration in the spinal cord interneurons. We found that Nova deficiency reduces the migration of mitotic progenitors and differentiated interneurons in the spinal cord( Figure 3, 4). We observed similar defects in Dcc KOs, which were mostly uncharacterized before. Within the commissural interneurons, Nova dKO disrupts Netrin-induced axon outgrowth and ventral projection to the midline, also resembling the Dcc mutant( Figure 5, 6). The phenotypic similarity between Nova and Dcc KOs strongly suggests that Dcc activity is affected by Nova dKO. Indeed, this is confirmed by the observations that Dcc alternative splicing is disrupted by Nova dKO( Figure 7), that Nova dKO defects can be largely rescued in vitro and in vivo by restoring Dcclong( Figure 8, Figure 8—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—source data 1), and that NOVA controls Dcc alternative splicing in vitro( Figure 9). Also importantly, our results show that disrupting Dcc alternative splicing without affecting the total Dcc level leads to as severe defects as Dcc KO, underscoring the importance of alternative splicing for the gene function. The defects in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and axon guidance in Nova and Dcc KOs appear to share a common feature, which is a temporal delay. The migration is slowed but not completely blocked( Figure 4). The axon outgrowth is initially defective but becomes normal after an extended culture period( Figure 5). The axon guidance defect also appears to be somewhat alleviated at E12. 5 compared to earlier stages( Figure 6). This delay could be due to an incomplete loss of the gene function in the KOs. Alternatively, NOVA proteins have been shown to regulate many target genes including Dcc in a temporal specific manner, generating different ratios of splice variants at different developmental stages( Yano et al., 2010; also see accompanying paper by Saito et al.) As Nova deficiency changes the ratio between DCC variants, it may alter the developmental state of the neurons. Consequently, this leads to abnormal responsiveness of the neurons to the extracelluar environment and thus defects in neuronal and axonal migration. The fact that the loss of Dcclong in Nova dKOs cannot be compensated by the increase in Dccshort demonstrates that the two isoforms are functionally distinct. The two DCC isoforms differ in the FN4-FN5 linker, with both FN4 and FN5 domains interacting with Netrin( Xu et al., 2014). A structure study of Netrin in complex with the DCC or NEO1 receptor found that DCC variants can bind to Netrin-1 with comparable affinities, but are likely to adopt distinct conformations in the ligand-receptor complex( Xu et al., 2014). Netrin and DCCshort form a continuous liand:receptor complex, whereas DCClong is likely to form a 2:2 ligand:receptor complex with Netrin( Xu et al., 2014). Whether the presence of both isoforms and at different ratios can produce additional conformations of the ligand-receptor complex is completely unknown. How the architecturally distinct complexes can lead to different intracellular signaling also remains an intriguing question. The defects seen in Nova dKOs could result from the loss in Dcclong, the increase in Dccshort, or the combination of both. We cannot yet distinguish between these possibilities. The rescue of Nova dKOs by DCClong, but not by DCCshort, can also be interpreted in different ways. One possibility is that DCClong is fully responsible for the gene function, whereas DCCshort has no activity. Another is that both isoforms are required and each has its specific activity. Only DCClong can rescue Nova KOs because it is reduced in the mutants, while DCCshort is still present. Since the two Dcc isoforms are normally expressed at comparable levels in commissural axons at E11. 5( Figure 7C), it is likely that each isoform has its unique activity during neuronal migration and axon guidance. Dcc alternative splicing was first identified using human neuroblastoma cells IMR32( Reale et al., 1994). Compared with normal mouse brain tissues, IMR32 expresses a decreased level of Dcclong and an elevated level of Dccshort( Reale et al., 1994). These changes are in the same pattern as those in Nova dKOs. Thus, altered Dcc alternative splicing may also contribute to tumor development. Allelic loss of the 18q21 region encompassing Dcc is identified in about 70% of primary colorectal cancers and is also found in other types of cancers( Mehlen and Fearon, 2004). It remains to be seen if altered Dcc alternative splicing accounts for additional cases of colorectal cancers and other cancers. Furthermore, Dcc plays additional roles in the nervous system, such as in dendritic growth and guidance( Furrer et al., 2003; Nagel et al., 2015; Suli et al., 2006; Teichmann and Shen, 2011), and in synapse formation and function( Colon-Ramos et al., 2007; Goldman et al., 2013; Horn et al., 2013). Therefore, it is important to determine if Dcc alternative splicing is also important for other biological processes.","answer":"The first step of producing a protein involves the DNA of a gene being copied to form a molecule of RNA .

Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of childhood pneumonia and pneumonia-associated mortality. New conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae have contributed to decreases in radiologic, clinical and complicated pneumonia cases and have reduced hospitalization and mortality. The importance of co-infections with multiple pathogens and the predominance of viral-associated disease are emerging. Better access to effective preventative and management strategies is needed in low- and middle-income countries, while new strategies are needed to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented. Text: Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades. Although there have been substantial decreases in overall child mortality and in pneumonia-specific mortality, pneumonia remains the major single cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, causing approximately 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths in 2013 [1] . Substantial advances have occurred in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia, in development of standardized case definitions, and in prevention with the production of improved vaccines and in treatment. Such advances have led to changes in the epidemiology, etiology and mortality from childhood pneumonia. However in many areas access to these interventions remains sub-optimal, with large inequities between and within countries and regions. In this paper we review the impact of recent preventative and management advances in pneumonia epidemiology, etiology, radiologic presentation and outcome in children. The overall burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population from 605 million in 2000 to 664 million in 2015 [2] . Recent data suggest that there has been a 25% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia, from 0.29 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries in 2000, to 0.22 episodes per child year in 2010 [3] . This is substantiated by a 58% decrease in pneumonia-associated disability-adjusted life years between 1990 and 2013, from 186 million to 78 million as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease study [1] . Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 [1] . These data do not reflect the full impact of increasingly widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in low-and middle-income countries because the incidence of pneumonia and number of deaths are likely to decrease still further as a result of this widespread intervention [4] . Notwithstanding this progress, there remains a disproportionate burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, where more than 90% of pneumonia cases and deaths occur. The incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year, compared to 0.22 episodes per child year in low-and middle-income countries [3] . On average, 1 in 66 children in high-income countries is affected by pneumonia per year, compared to 1 in 5 children in low-and middle-income countries. Even within low-and middleincome countries there are regional inequities and challenges with access to health care services: up to 81% of severe pneumonia deaths occur outside a hospital [5] . In addition to a higher incidence of pneumonia, the case fatality rate is estimated to be almost 10-fold higher in low-and middle-income countries as compared to high-income countries [3, 5] . Childhood pneumonia can also lead to significant morbidity and chronic disease. Early life pneumonia can impair longterm lung health by decreasing lung function [6] . Severe or recurrent pneumonia can have a worse effect on lung function; increasing evidence suggests that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might be related to early childhood pneumonia [7, 8] . A meta-analysis of the risk of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major (restrictive lung disease, obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis) and minor (chronic bronchitis, asthma, abnormal pulmonary function) groups [9] . The risk of developing at least one of the major sequelae was estimated as 6% after an ambulatory pneumonia event and 14% after an episode of hospitalized pneumonia. Because respiratory diseases affect almost 1 billion people globally and are a major cause of mortality and morbidity [10] , childhood pneumonia might contribute to substantial morbidity across the life course. Chest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event [11] because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific. In 2005, to aid in defining outcomes of pneumococcal vaccine studies, the World Health Organization's (WHO) standardized chest radiograph description defined a group of children who were considered most likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia [12] . The term \\"end-point consolidation\\" was described as a dense or fluffy opacity that occupies a portion or whole of a lobe, or the entire lung. \\"Other infiltrate\\" included linear and patchy densities, peribronchial thickening, minor patchy infiltrates that are not of sufficient magnitude to constitute primary end-point consolidation, and small areas of atelectasis that in children can be difficult to distinguish from consolidation. \\"Primary end-point pneumonia\\" included either end-point consolidation or a pleural effusion associated with a pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate (including \\"other\\" infiltrate). Widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia. In a review of four randomized controlled trials and two case-control studies of Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination in high-burden communities, the vaccination was associated with an 18% decrease in radiologic pneumonia [13] . Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998 [14] . In vaccine efficacy trials in low-and middle-income countries, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced radiologic pneumonia by 37% in the Gambia [15] , 25% in South Africa [16] and 26% in the Philippines [17] . The WHO radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely and to provide a set of standardized definitions through which researchers could achieve broad agreement in reporting chest radiographs. However, despite widespread field utilization, there are concerns regarding inter-observer repeatability. There has been good consensus for the description of lobar consolidation but significant disagreement on the description of patchy and perihilar infiltrates [18, 19] . In addition, many children with clinically severe lung disease do not have primary end-point pneumonia: in one pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination study, only 34% of children hospitalized with pneumonia had primary end-point pneumonia [20] . A revised case definition of \\"presumed bacterial pneumonia\\" has been introduced, and this definition includes pneumonia cases with WHO-defined alveolar consolidation, as well as those with other abnormal chest radiograph infiltrates and a serum C-reactive protein of at least 40 mg/L [21, 22] . This definition has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination [23] . Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10), had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America [22] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa [21] . Thus there is convincing evidence that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia; however there is no evidence to suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccination modifies the radiologic appearance of pneumococcal pneumonia. Empyema is a rare complication of pneumonia. An increased incidence of empyema in children was noted in some high-income countries following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 introduction, and this was attributed to pneumococcal serotypes not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, especially 3 and 19A [24] . In the United States, evidence from a national hospital database suggests that the incidence of empyema increased 1.9-fold between 1996 and 2008 [25] . In Australia, the incidence rate ratio increased by 1.4 times when comparing the pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (1998 to 2004) to the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 period (2005 to 2010) [26] . In Scotland, incidence of empyema in children rose from 6.5 per million between 1981 and 1998, to 66 per million in 2005 [27] . These trends have been reversed since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13. Data from the United States suggest that empyema decreased by 50% in children younger than 5 years [28] ; similarly, data from the United Kingdom and Scotland showed substantial reduction in pediatric empyema following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 introduction [29, 30] . Several national guidelines from high-income countries, as well as the WHO recommendations for low-and middleincome countries, recommend that chest radiography should not be routinely performed in children with ambulatory pneumonia [31] [32] [33] . Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) or complications. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia [34] . In addition to the effect on radiologic pneumonia, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from viral-associated pneumonia, probably by reducing bacterial-viral co-infections resulting in severe disease and hospitalization [35] . An analysis of ecological and observational studies of pneumonia incidence in different age groups soon after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7 in Canada, Italy, Australia, Poland and the United States showed decreases in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations ranging from 15% to 65% [36] . In the United States after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 replaced pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-7, there was a further 17% decrease in hospitalizations for pneumonia among children eligible for the vaccination, and a further 12% decrease among unvaccinated adults [28] . A systematic review of etiology studies prior to availability of new conjugate vaccines confirmed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B as the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia, with Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with some severe cases. Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause, identified in 15-40% of pneumonia cases, followed by influenza A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [37] . More recent meta-analyses of etiology data suggest a changing pathogen profile, with increasing recognition that clinical pneumonia is caused by the sequential or concurrent interaction of more than one organism. Severe disease in particular is often caused by multiple pathogens. With high coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccination, viral pathogens increasingly predominate [38] . In recent case-control studies, at least one virus was detected in 87% of clinical pneumonia cases in South Africa [39] , while viruses were detected in 81% of radiologic pneumonia cases in Sweden [40] . In a large multi-center study in the United States, viral pathogens were detected in 73% of children hospitalized with radiologic pneumonia, while bacteria were detected in only 15% of cases [41] . A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies of viral etiology in radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, completed up to 2014, reported good evidence of causal attribution for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [42] . However there was no consistent evidence that many other commonly described viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus, were more commonly isolated from cases than from controls. Further attribution of bacterial etiology is difficult because it is often not possible to distinguish colonizing from pathogenic bacteria when they are isolated from nasal specimens [43] . Another etiology is pertussis. In the last decade there has also been a resurgence in pertussis cases, especially in highincome countries [44] . Because pertussis immunity after acellular pertussis vaccination is less long-lasting than immunity after wild-type infection or whole-cell vaccination, many women of child-bearing age have waning pertussis antibody levels. Their infants might therefore be born with low transplacental anti-pertussis immunoglobulin G levels, making them susceptible to pertussis infection before completion of the primary vaccination series [45] . In 2014, more than 40,000 pertussis cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States; in some states, population-based incidence rates are higher than at any time in the last 70 years [44] . In contrast, most low-and middleincome countries use whole-cell pertussis vaccines and the numbers of pertussis cases in those countries were stable or decreasing until 2015 [46] .Question: What is the leading cause of death among children after the age of 1 month?","answer":"Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death in children outside the neonatal period,"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

We expressed yellow fluorescent protein( YFP) from a yeast promoter and selected for a regular alternation between low and high fluorescence over a 24-hr period. This selection produced changes in cell adhesion rather than YFP expression: clonal populations oscillated between single cells and multicellular clumps. The oscillations are not a response to environmental cues and continue for at least three cycles in a constant environment. We identified eight putative causative mutations in one clone and recreated the evolved phenotype in the ancestral strain. The mutated genes lack obvious relationships to each other, but multiple lineages change from the haploid to the diploid pattern of gene expression. We show that a novel, complex phenotype can evolve by small sets of mutations in genes whose molecular functions appear to be unrelated to each other.Introduction:Biological oscillators demand dynamical interactions between multiple components and have evolved many times to drive various behaviors, from heartbeats, on the timescale of seconds, to circadian clocks and seasonal clocks, on the time scale of days and years. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lacks homologs to genes that make up the core oscillator or light-sensing pathways of fungal circadian rhythms( Brunner and Kaldi, 2008; Idnurm and Heitman, 2010; Salichos and Rokas, 2010) and does not display any 24-hr behavior capable of sustained autonomous oscillations in a constant environment( Eelderink-Chen et al., 2010; Robertson et al., 2013). As an example of a novel trait, we evolved a 24-hr oscillator in the budding yeast to determine how biologically complex machinery could evolve from proteins and signaling networks that lack any known connection to oscillatory behavior. Because circadian clocks can be entrained by environmental signals and have a temperature-independent period, whereas the behavior we have evolved represents an autonomous oscillator with a period of roughly 24 hr that controls a biological output, we refer to the circuit we have evolved as a diurnal oscillator, referring to its period, rather than the distinction between day and night.Discussion:Do the oscillations that we detect have any relationship to other oscillations that have been detected in budding yeast? Fluctuations in metabolic activity can be driven by temperature oscillations with a 24-hr period but rapidly die out at constant temperature( Eelderink-Chen et al., 2010), and a particular regime of growth to high density can induce prolonged metabolic oscillations whose period is 4–5 hr( Tu et al., 2005). We think it is unlikely that either of these cycles are connected to the behavior we observe: the 24-hr cycles do not free-run and the shorter cycles have the wrong period and can only be seen at cell densities higher than those that we used. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the behavior we see is the result of coupling changes in cell–cell adhesion to a previously unknown circadian clock in budding yeast. How similar is the diurnal oscillator we evolved to naturally occurring circadian clocks? All circadian clocks share four features:( 1) a limit-cycle, cell autonomous cellular oscillator that continues to oscillate in the absence of environmental cues( free run);( 2) the oscillator maintains a roughly 24-hr period over a range of temperatures( temperature compensation);( 3) the period of the internal oscillator can be synchronized, or entrained, to the phase of a daily environmental cue( e. g., light, temperature); and( 4) the ability to control cellular and organismal behavior( Young and Kay, 2001; Tauber et al., 2004; Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005; Rosbash, 2009). Our results show the yeast oscillator we evolved has two of these four behaviors: its roughly 24-hr period is maintained in the absence of environmental cues or selection on the output of the oscillator( Figures 2B, 3A, 3C, 4C, and 4D), and it regulates a cellular behavior, the ability of cells to form clumps. Further investigations are required to determine if the yeast oscillator uses the combination of positive and negative feedback loops that form the core of circadian clocks and could be evolved to be temperature-compensated and entrained by environmental signals. Our experiment shows that mutating genes in multiple, unrelated biochemical networks can produce evolutionary novelty and reveals that identifying adaptive mutations is often insufficient to explain the mechanism of these new phenotypes. The ability of multiple combinations of mutations to produce the same complex phenotype leads to two inferences. First, we know relatively little about the circuitry of many existing molecular pathways and evolving novel traits may help illuminate previously unknown connections between pathways. Second, that multiple mutations are capable of producing unexpected changes in cellular physiology by connecting previously unrelated pathways to produce new circuits. The few mutations that are shared between different oscillating lineages suggest that there are multiple, functionally different ways that such rearrangements can lead to the same phenotype. The common loss of silencing despite little commonality in other mutated genes between evolved clones has two implications. First, it suggests that wild yeast may regulate their clumpiness during the diploid phase, which accounts for most of their life cycle, and that our evolved populations have exploited this regulation to respond to our selection for oscillatory behavior. Second, the independent evolution of the same trait appears to have a mixture of common and diverse features. All nine of the populations we examined have switched from the haploid- to the diploid-specific pattern of gene expression and all four lineages analyzed in detail have mutated WHI2. The repeated occurrence of these genetic changes suggests that they greatly increase the number of subsequent mutations that could lead to the appearance of an oscillator. Whether the later mutations act on a single pathway or multiple, different pathways will require the detailed dissection of the oscillator's mechanism. It would be interesting to determine whether a selection for oscillation in diploids, where the inactivation of genes requires two independent genetic changes, would take a similar trajectory and produce the same mechanism that we have uncovered in haploids. The inconsistency among bulk segregant analysis, gene deletions and wild type reversions illustrates the difficulty in identifying the contribution of different mutations to a complex, evolved phenotype. We can nevertheless make inferences about the molecular underpinnings of evolutionary novelties. Four of the six mutations that are strongly identified as causal mutations are loss of function mutations. The mutations in SCW11 and WHI2 are nonsense mutations, whereas those in SIR4 and YJL070C can be replaced by gene deletions, but not by restoration of the wild-type gene. The preponderance of loss of function mutants suggests that sophisticated functions can be produced primarily by inactivating genes, rather than modifying or increasing their activities. Whether similar paths are followed in nature is likely to depend on the strength and unidirectionality of selection and the extent of antagonistic pleiotropy: the contrast between the benefits of a mutation in one environment and its costs in others. We speculate that short bursts of intense selection, such as those that occur when a species occupies a new and unoccupied niche, could lead to adaptation that is primarily driven by gene inactivation, whose short-term benefits exceeds its costs. These costs could later be reduced either by suppressor mutations that would minimize the harmful effects of loss of function mutations, while maintaining the evolved phenotype, or even by reversion of the original mutation, once the evolved phenotype had been stabilized by further mutations. Further investigation will be required to determine how often loss of function mutations participate in a variety of evolutionary processes, ranging from cancer to the formation of new species and forms of biological organization.","answer":"In living things , many important behaviors—including animal heartbeats and sleep patterns—happen in cycles .

We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI. Text: Influenza like-illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infections can be caused by several types of respiratory viruses or bacteria in humans [1] . Influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial viruses (RSV) and Parainfluenza viruses are identified as major viruses mostly responsible for ILI and pneumonia in several studies [2] . However practitioners cannot diagnose the infection without a biological test confirmation. Unfortunately, these infections causes are identified in less than 50% [3] . Réunion Island, a French overseas territory with 850,000 inhabitants, is located in the southern hemisphere between Madagascar and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean (Latitude: 21°05.2920 S Longitude: 55°36.4380 E.). The island benefits from a healthcare system similar to mainland France and epidemiological surveillance has been developed by the regional office of the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Cire OI), based on the surveillance system of mainland France [4] . Influenza activity generally increases during austral winter, corresponding to summer in Europe [5] . Since 2011, influenza vaccination campaign in Reunion Island starts in April and the vaccine used corresponds to World Health Organization recommendations for the southern hemisphere. Since 1996, clinical and biological influenza surveillance has been based on a sentinel practitioner's network [6] . In 2014, this network was composed of 58 general practitioners (GPs) spread over the island and represented around 7% of all Réunion Island GPs. Nasal swabs are randomly collected all along the year and are tested by RT-PCR for influenza viruses. Among these surveillance samples, 40 to 50% are tested positive for influenza A virus, A(H1N1)pdm09 or B virus by the virological laboratory of the University Hospital Center of Réunion. Thus ILI samples tested negative for influenza are of unknown etiology. Several biological tools allow identifying respiratory pathogens from nasal swab. In recent years, multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been developed to identify several viruses simultaneously [7] [8] [9] [10] . We therefore used this new method to set up a retrospective study using swabs collected by sentinel GPs from 2011 to 2012. The main objective of our study was to characterize respiratory pathogens responsible for ILI consultations in sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. Secondary objectives were to highlight seasonal trends on respiratory pathogens circulation and to describe occurrence of co-infections, especially during the flu season. ILI was defined as a sudden onset of fever more than 38 degrees Celsius and cough, associated or not with other symptoms such as breathing difficulty, headache, etc. Every week, all GPs of the sentinel network were encouraged to collect a nasal swab from the first two patients who presented ILI since less than three days. After being tested for influenza viruses, the 994 swabs collected in 2011 and 2012 are frozen at -80°C at the university hospital center (CHU) laboratory. Based on the budget, a season-stratified sample of 250 swabs was randomly selected in order to describe circulating viruses including outside flu season. Random sampling was performed with Excel 1 using the anonymized surveillance database of the Cire OI. The sampling frame contained identification number of swab assigned by Cire OI, laboratory identification number, sex, age, date of onset of symptoms, date of swab collection and result of influenza RT-PCR. We used Respifinder 1 Smart 22 kits a multiplex RT-PCR (PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands) which can detect 22 respiratory pathogens. This assay is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology. The reverse transcription and preamplification steps were performed on the epgradient Mastercycler 1 (Eppendorf) and the hybridization, ligation and detection steps on the LightCycler 1 480 system (Roche Applied Science). This method was chosen because of its high specificity, compared to other same methods (78% versus 33%) [3, 11] . Multiplex analysis allows for rapid production of diagnostic results. It thus allows highlighted the possible presence of eighteen respiratory viruses and four bacteria in one reaction by melt curve analysis: Influenza A not (H1N1 Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 1 and Excel 1 . Two seasons were defined to identify possible seasonal trends in circulation of the viruses: winter season during weeks 23 to 39 between June and September and summer season during the rest of the year. Data and swabs result from a surveillance system that received regulatory approvals, including the CNIL (National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties Number 1592205) approval in July 2012. All the patients have received oral information and gave their consent for swab and data collection. Data were collected for surveillance purpose and are totally anonymous. Among the 250 randomly-selected swabs, 26 were not available anymore as they were sent to Influenza Reference Center for confirmation and characterization of the pathogenic agent. According to the sensitivity of the assay two samples could be discordant results between Influenza PCR initially realized and Multiplex PCR. Thus they were deleted from the analysis: one is positive for Influenza in singleplex and negative for all tested pathogens in multiplex and one is positive for Influenza in singleplex and positive for PIV2 in multiplex. In total, 222 analyses were considered. Moreover, 53 samples were negative for all analyzed respiratory pathogens (23.9%) and 169 samples had at least one detected pathogen (76.1%), finally a total of 178 pathogens was identified. During the study period, a minority of the weeks (21 i.e. 20%) did not include any sampled swab, mainly outside flu season. Patients' sex-ratio was 0.63 (86 men and 136 women) and mean age was 28.4 years [min 0; max 81]. Ten percent had less than 5 years, 24% 5-15 years, 63% 15-65 years and only 3% were 65 and older. The respiratory pathogens most frequently identified in ILI swabs were rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A not H1N1 (21.2%) and influenza B (12.6%) ( Table 1) . Among the 22 respiratory pathogens tested by the multiplex, only three were not found in any analyzed sample: Parainfluenza3, Legionella pneumophila and Bordetella pertussis. Regarding co-infections, nine swabs revealed the presence of two viruses, among which6 involved influenza viruses (Table 2) . Analyses showed that some viruses are possibly seasonal and were circulating during a specific period of the year. They are detected only in summer for Human Metapneumovirus, RSV A and B, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. For the latter, it is specific to the studied period since the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus reappeared in Réunion Island in October 2012 and was no longer circulating since late 2010. On the opposite, Parainfluenza 1,2 and 4 viruses were identified only in winter. For other pathogens, no specific period of detection was observed. A weekly description of samples was realized to study the distribution of respiratory pathogens in 2011 and 2012 (Fig 1) . Results of biological analyses were compared with data of ILI consultations declared by sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. We observed in 2011, after a first wave in June mainly due to influenza A not H1N1 virus, a second wave of ILI consultations with mainly identification of Parainfluenza viruses and not influenza viruses. In 2012, the second epidemic wave at the end of austral winter coincided with Influenza viruses and Rhinovirus circulation. Regarding negative swabs (Fig 2) , we observed no seasonality during the study period with a similar proportion whatever the season. This retrospective study based on a sentinel GPs network showed that not only influenza viruses are responsible for ILI consultations. Indeed, an important circulation of multiple pathogens was observed throughout the year, with 12 different types of pathogens identified in 2011 and 2012. Respiratory viral pathogens were present in 76.1% of samples, which is largely above results from annual influenza surveillance [12] . After influenza viruses, Rhinovirus and Coronavirus were the most common respiratory viruses in Réunion Island. Although samples were not taken every week, sample was representative of ILI activity and consistent with flu season. Nevertheless, according to the low number of samples, it is difficult to conclude about seasonality. However in our study, RSV was circulating in summer season which is hot and rainy, which is confirmed by other studies in tropical region [13] . This study also highlighted several co-infections, showing that concomitant the multiple etiology of ILI. Co-circulation was already observed in Réunion Island during the A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic in addition to influenza virus, with identification of other respiratory viruses such as Rhinovirus or Coronavirus [14] . In mainland France, during this pandemic, circulation of major respiratory viruses was found, such as Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, Coronavirus, Human Metapneumovirus, like in our publication [15] [16] . In our study, only 5.3% of positive swabs were co-infections whereas in two studies in Madagascar co-infections represented 27.3% and 29.4% [17] [18] . Despite the distance of 9,300 km between Réunion and France, the island is directly connected to Europe with four daily flights to France. These exchanges can impact respiratory pathogens circulation in southern and northern hemisphere. Results of this study can therefore be of interest to both Indian Ocean and Europe countries. Among the 148 swabs initially negative for influenza because not previously tested for any other viruses, the study found an etiology for 95 swabs. In total, only 53 swabs, representing 24% of the sample, remained without etiology with negative multiplex PCR results all along the year. Multiple hypotheses can explain this result: a poor quality of swabs, preventing from identifying a pathogen, noninfectious causes or other pathogens not included in the multiplex PCR.  However, we couldn't test the negative swabs for RNAse P, a marker of human cells, which could provide a modicum of assurance that the swab contained human cells. Concerning the two samples divergent for influenza identification between the multiplex and singleplex PCR, we discarded them for the analysis; one was positive in Influenza with singleplex and positive in PIV with multiplex. It could be a false positive result from singleplex. Indeed, as the multiplex PCR assay has a good sensitivity and is considered as a gold-standard, we decided to keep seven negative results for Influenza in singleplex and positive in Influenza in multiplex [7] [8] [9] [10] . No case of Bordetella pertussis which causes whooping cough and Legionella pneumophila which causes Legionnaires' disease was identified in this study. However, these diseases are rare in Réunion Island, around three cases of Legionnaires' disease are declared each year. A limit of the study is that no clinical data were available in the virological surveillance system of influenza in Réunion Island. It was impossible to compare clinical symptoms according to each pathogen and to know if there are different pathogens which cause for instance rhinitis, laryngitis or bronchitis (diseases included in ILI). A specific prospective study including clinical data might provide useful elements in the semiotics of diseases. In conclusion, this study highlighted an important circulation of multiple pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI is not specific to influenza and so it is essential to have biological results in order to establish the differential diagnosis and thus explain the etiology of symptoms. For a better understanding of respiratory pathogens circulating in Réunion Island, information from this study may also be useful to practitioners who see many patients in consultation with ILI. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy in the ILI surveillance and allowed to highlight the circulation of other viruses and bacterial causes of respiratory infections, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI. Moreover, it would be interesting to repeat this study every 3 or 5 years adding clinical data to monitor the evolution of respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island over time.Question: What hypotheses can explain this result?","answer":"a poor quality of swabs, preventing from identifying a pathogen, noninfectious causes or other pathogens not included in the multiplex PCR."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

However, still the actual C2-unsubstituted spiroindolenines remain inaccessible, at least with classical electron-withdrawing protecting groups on the nitrogen.</p><p>The development of catalytic reactions in aqueous media is a rapidly growing field, not only because of environmental concerns but also of the unique selectivities that water properties may bring to a given reaction. 13 Considering the robustness of gold catalysts when exposed to moisture and oxygen, water has been used successfully as a (co)solvent in gold catalysis. 14 We hypothesized that operating in a polar, protic media would fasten the protodeauration step and potentially allow the isolation of the spiroindolenines, even with unsubstituted compounds. In this paper, we report the gold-catalyzed spirocyclizations of tryptamine and tryptophan derivatives 1 in aqueous media, delivering a range of spiroindolenines 2 (Scheme 1, eq.</p><p>3). In particular, we show that the use of water media allows the selective formation and the isolation of the C2-unsubstituted spiroindolenines.</p>Scheme 1. Selectivities in Gold-Catalyzed Cyclizations of Alkyne-Tethered Indole Derivatives<p>We first sought suitable conditions to promote the spirocyclization of a model 2-methyl-N-nosyl-N-propargyl tryptamine 1a in an aqueous environment to ensure the possibility to make this chemistry under aqueous conditions (Table 1, entry 1-2). Screening of micellar conditions using TPGS-750M (DL-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycol succinate) as the surfactant 15 and the Echavarren catalyst 3a resulted in moderate conversions (entry 1). We then identified that mixtures of MeCN and water yields high conversions of spiroindolenine 2a (entry 2; higher amount of water lead to reduced conversions, see SI for the full optimization table).  6) a The NMR yield was determined using 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard; b Yields in parentheses are isolated yields; c Yield given for the reaction performed in MeCN; d Reaction time 4 h.</p><p>Next, we turned our attention to the more challenging cyclization of C2-unsubstituted tryptamine 1b upon gold-catalyzed conditions in aqueous phase and analyzed the crude mixtures by 1 H NMR. This reaction can deliver three distinct products, namely the desired spiroindolenine 2b, the hexahydroazepino[4,5-b]indole 4b and the tetrahydro-1H-azocino [5,4-b]indole 5b (potentially resulting from the direct 8-endo addition of the indole), that are easily separable on silica gel. We first verified that the reaction performed in organic solvent leads in all cases to the exclusive high yielding formation of the formal 7-exo addition product 4b, as reported by Echavarren (entry 3). 7a When the reaction was performed in micellar conditions at 60 °C, despite partial conversion, the main product appeared to be the spiroindolenine 2b (entry 4). 16 We next attempted catalyst 3a in a 4:1 mixture of H2O/MeCN, leading to 4b equimolar to 2b (entry 5). With the idea that the addition of an acid would even better facilitate the protodeauration, 17 we introduced a small proportion of acetic acid to the solvent system that led as expected to a higher amount of desired spirocycle 2b (entry 6). We then found that catalyst 3b delivered the same 49% yield of 2b, but resulted in the increase of 8-membered ring product 5b at the expense of 4b (entry 7). This is remarkable since product 5b was known so far to result from cyclizations using only AuCl3 or AuCl catalysts, but not from catalysts bearing a phosphine ligand. 7a The proportion of 2b increased with higher amount of acetic acid (entry 8) and the switch of the organic co-solvent to DMSO, led to 61% of desired spiroindolenine 2b (entry 9). A decrease of the reaction time to 4 hours and the catalyst loading to 7 mol% allowed to isolate the spiroindolenine 2b in average 50% yields and high selectivities, using either catalyst 3a or 3b (entries 10-11).</p><p>Scheme 2. Scope of the Gold-Catalyzed Spirocyclizations of Tryptamine and Tryptophan Derivatives It is clear from these results that water offers interesting opportunities in this complex mechanistic scenario and that concomitant efforts directed at the identification of the gold complex and the solvent system can reverse selectivities obtained toward one or the other compounds of the series. 18 Interestingly also, we never observed any product resulting from the potential gold-catalyzed hydration of the triple bond under those conditions. 19 A series of C2-substituted tryptamines 1a-g were then engaged in gold-catalyzed cyclizations, using 7 mol% of 3a to ensure full conversions within a few hours. (Scheme 2). The reference spiroindolenine 2a was obtained in 91% yield on a 1.0 mmol scale. The introduction of chlorine and methoxy substituents at position 5 of the indole had no impact on the reaction, delivering 2c and 2d in excellent yields. With a phenyl group at C2, the reaction proceeded well. When 2-bromotryptamine 1f was used, the spirooxindole 2f was obtained in 61% yield, resulting from the in situ hydrolysis of the intermediate 2-bromospiroindolenine. 7c,20 Finally, a thiophenyl moiety was introduced at C2 and led to the product 2g in 64% yield. We next switched to tryptophan-derivatives as starting materials 21 and could isolate spirooxindole 2h and spiroindolenines 2i and 2j in excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. 22 We next exposed racemic 2-Me tryptophan derivatives 1k-1m to cyclization conditions and obtained the corresponding spiroindolenines rac-2k, rac-2l and rac-2m in excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. Notably, the reaction worked well with unprotected amine 1l. We next engaged a series of challenging C2-unsubstituted tryptamines/tryptophans 1b, 1n-t in the established conditions. Product 2b was obtained in 51% isolated yield (that decreased to 45% on a 1.0 mmol scale). Gratifyingly, the compound 2b crystallized and led to the corresponding X-ray structure. Remarkably, one of our crystallization attempts led to the formation of the crystalline trimer 6 (Figure 1). Despite the fact that this equilibrated trimerization has been known from the 1930's, 23 crystal structures of spiroindolenines in a trimeric form have not been reported so far. From our experimental observations, we eventually concluded that compound 2b undergoes partial trimerization when it goes from solution to solid state, which is why the NMR spectrum of the purified compound does not show absolute purity and isolated yields are typically lower than NMR yields. We could show that the pure compound is easily obtained from purification on silica gel by concentration of the organic phase in the presence of a nonvolatile deuterated solvent (i.e. d6-DMSO) to prevent solidification. We next engaged 5-methoxy, 5-chloro and 5-methyltryptamines 1n-p in the cyclizations and obtained the spiroindolenines in similar average of 53% yields. The replacement of the nosyl group by a tosyl dropped the yield of 2q to 43%. The use of a tryptophan-derived starting material led to the spiro compound 2r in 47% yield. We next used N-propargyl tryptamines 1s and 1t to obtain the two spiroindolenines 2s-t in excellent yields and chemoselectivities. Those tryptamines with their electron-donating groups show a similar level of regioselectivity when operating in an organic solvent. 11b Some of the tryptophan spirocyclic compounds (2k-2m) were racemic because of synthetic reasons. We sought an alternative allowing access enantiopure products. We turned to biocatalysis since it is a powerful and unique approach in the toolbox of organic chemists. 24 Tryptophan synthase 25 allows, in theory, simple access to a variety of enantiopure tryptophan derivatives from inexpensive serine and indole derivatives. 26 After the expression and purification of the required enzyme, we applied this strategy to a series of 2-methylindole derivatives 8 (R= H, OMe, F) and easily obtained the corresponding tryptophan analogs 9 (Scheme 3). The enzymatic crude mixtures were submitted to protein precipitation, filtered and lyophilized. Propargylation was then performed directly on the crude products, leading to fully propargylated intermediates. The gold-catalyzed cyclization in aqueous conditions then afforded the spiro derivatives 2u-w in excellent global yields and diastereoselectivities over 3 steps. This strategy, implying just a final purification, proved to be very efficient to access densely functionalized enantiopure spiroindolenines. The enantiomeric excess measured on 2u by chiral HPLC (>99.5%) showed that the whole sequence is totally stereoretentive. Scheme 3. Biocatalyzed Access to Enantioenriched Tryptophane Derivatives 9 and their in Situ Functionalizations/Spirocyclizations Finally, we studied the deprotection of the nosyl group of spiroindolenines to afford secondary amines that would be ready for further functionalization. Standard conditions using thiophenol and potassium carbonate on spiroindolenine 2a led to the isolation of the spiroamine 10 in 89% yield (Scheme 4). We wanted these conditions to be applicable in aqueous phase and for this purpose we developed a one-pot procedure combining the gold-catalyzed cyclization followed by the deprotection of the nosyl group via the addition of thiophenol and potassium carbonate. With this approach we obtained the amine 10 in 75% yield starting from the tryptamine 1a. Scheme 4. Deprotection of the Nosyl Group: a Tandem Cyclization/Deprotection Strategy to Access Unprotected Spiroindolenine</p><p>In summary, we have developed an efficient strategy to access spiroindolenines using gold-catalysis in aqueous conditions with high yields starting from tryptamine and tryptophan derivatives. Beyond the fact that operating with water as the main solvent answers partially to the general transitioning that organic synthesis has to do towards greener approaches, we showed here that water also has much to offer in terms of chemo-and regioselectivity. We were able, in particular, with these conditions access hitherto unattainable electron-poor spiroindolenines with high regioselectivities. The combination of biocatalysis and synthetic methods leading to enantiopure compounds in high efficiency also demonstrates that the introduction of biocatalysis to synthetic schemes is more relevant than ever.</p>","answer":"N-Propargyl tryptamine and tryptophan derivatives that are readily available from both synthetic and biocatalytic approaches, undergo gold-catalyzed dearomative cyclizations in aqueous media to the corresponding spirocyclic derivatives. In addition to the efficiency of the method, operating in aqueous media affords a selective entry to C2-unsubstituted spiroindolenines that have long remained unattainable by Au(I)-catalysis. Moderate to excellent yields of the desired spirocyclic products bearing various substituents were obtained.The Au(I)-catalyzed 1 spirocyclization of indoles 2, 3 tethered to alkynes is an important reaction since it leads to high-value spiroindole alkaloids. 4,5,6 The mechanisms associated with this reactivity are, however, somewhat labyrinthic. Activation of the triple bond by the cationic Au(I) complex initiates the kinetically favored formation of spirocyclic vinylgold intermediate ii. However, this key intermediate then evolves differently depending on the C2-substitution of the indole ring (Scheme 1, eq. 1). (1) C2 substituted compounds undergo protodeauration to the chiral spiroindoles iii (Path A). 7 (2) Unsubstituted compounds (Path B), lead to the annulated product iv, supposedly as the result of a C3-to-C2 migration from ii. 7a, 8, 9 (3) A nucleophile can trap the spirocyclic vinylgold intermediate and lead to the reduced spirocyclic compounds v (Path C). 10 (4) If the protodeauration of the spiro intermediate ii is slow, owing to the potential reversibility of spirocyclization step, then a direct C2 addition (Path D) leading to the thermodynamic product iv is not to be precluded. 11 In the tryptamine series, Echavarren showed for instance that N-propargyl tryptamines A bearing electron-withdrawing groups (R=EWG) lead exclusively to the hexahydroazepino [4,5-b]indole B (Scheme 1, eq. 2), 7a while we reported that spiroindolenines C can be selectively obtained only if R= EDG (Scheme 1, eq. 2). 11b,12"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Outcomes of ICU and non-ICU patients were compared, and a simple nomogram for predicting the probability of ICU transfer after hospital admission was developed based on initial laboratory data using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Differences in laboratory indices were observed between patients admitted to the ICU and those who were not admitted. Several independent predictors of ICU transfer in COVID-19 patients were identified including older age (>/=65 years) (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.02), hypertension (HR = 2.65), neutrophil count (HR = 1.11), procalcitonin level (HR = 3.67), prothrombin time (HR = 1.28), and D-dimer level (HR = 1.25). The lymphocyte count and albumin level were negatively associated with mortality (HR = 0.08 and 0.86, respectively). The developed model provides a means for identifying, at hospital admission, the subset of patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression and would require transfer to the ICU within 3 and 7 days after hospitalization.

This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task.RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F1 (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years. We also need to expand MTI through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text. The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.CONCLUSIONS Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded.12 years on - Is the NLM medical text indexer still useful and relevant?Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded.The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.<br><b>METHODS</b>: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used.The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded.The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.<br>After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  In order to persuade users of widely using cloud storage, one critical challenge that should be solved is finding way to determine whether data has been illegally modified on the cloud server or not. The topic has although been addressed in several works, there is lack of scheme to meet all the demand of supporting dynamic operations, public verification, less computation etc. This paper surveys the related results that has been done and proposes two alternative schemes, called DIV-I and DIV-II. Compared to S-PDP introduced by Ateniese et al., both DIV-I and DIV-II use less time to generate tags and verify. In addition, the proposed schemes fully support dynamic operations as well as public verification.Literature Review:","answer":"The popularity and adoption of cloud storage is rising that produce many security challenges for the cloud providers as well as for the customers.

We report here the 30-day mortality and 6- and 12-month functional outcomes from the DESTINY trial.                DESTINY (ISRCTN01258591) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial based on a sequential design that used mortality after 30 days as the first end point. When this end point was reached, patient enrollment was interrupted as per protocol until recalculation of the projected sample size was performed on the basis of the 6-month outcome (primary end point=modified Rankin Scale score, dichotomized to 0 to 3 versus 4 to 6). All analyses were based on intention to treat.                A statistically significant reduction in mortality was reached after 32 patients had been included: 15 of 17 (88%) patients randomized to hemicraniectomy versus 7 of 15 (47%) patients randomized to conservative therapy survived after 30 days (P=0.02). After 6 and 12 months, 47% of patients in the surgical arm versus 27% of patients in the conservative treatment arm had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 (P=0.23).                DESTINY showed that hemicraniectomy reduces mortality in large hemispheric stroke. With 32 patients included, the primary end point failed to demonstrate statistical superiority of hemicraniectomy, and the projected sample size was calculated to 188 patients. Despite this failure to meet the primary end point, the steering committee decided to terminate the trial in light of the results of the joint analysis of the 3 European hemicraniectomy trials.Title 2:Surgical decompression for space-occupying cerebral infarction (the Hemicraniectomy After Middle Cerebral Artery infarction with Life-threatening Edema Trial [HAMLET]): a multicentre, open, randomised trial.Abstract 2:Patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarctions have a poor prognosis, with case fatality rates of up to 80%. In a pooled analysis of randomised trials, surgical decompression within 48 h of stroke onset reduced case fatality and improved functional outcome; however, the effect of surgery after longer intervals is unknown. The aim of HAMLET was to assess the effect of decompressive surgery within 4 days of the onset of symptoms in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction.                Patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction were randomly assigned within 4 days of stroke onset to surgical decompression or best medical treatment. The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 1 year, which was dichotomised between good (0-3) and poor (4-6) outcome. Other outcome measures were the dichotomy of mRS score between 4 and 5, case fatality, quality of life, and symptoms of depression. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN94237756.                Between November, 2002, and October, 2007, 64 patients were included; 32 were randomly assigned to surgical decompression and 32 to best medical treatment. Surgical decompression had no effect on the primary outcome measure (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 0%, 95% CI -21 to 21) but did reduce case fatality (ARR 38%, 15 to 60). In a meta-analysis of patients in DECIMAL (DEcompressive Craniectomy In MALignant middle cerebral artery infarction), DESTINY (DEcompressive Surgery for the Treatment of malignant INfarction of the middle cerebral arterY), and HAMLET who were randomised within 48 h of stroke onset, surgical decompression reduced poor outcome (ARR 16%, -0.1 to 33) and case fatality (ARR 50%, 34 to 66).                Surgical decompression reduces case fatality and poor outcome in patients with space-occupying infarctions who are treated within 48 h of stroke onset. There is no evidence that this operation improves functional outcome when it is delayed for up to 96 h after stroke onset. The decision to perform the operation should depend on the emphasis patients and relatives attribute to survival and dependency.Title 3:Sequential-design, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of early decompressive craniectomy in malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (DECIMAL Trial).Abstract 3:There is no effective medical treatment of malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. The purpose of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of early decompressive craniectomy in patients with malignant MCA infarction.                We conducted in France a multicenter, randomized trial involving patients between 18 and 55 years of age with malignant MCA infarction to compare functional outcomes with or without decompressive craniectomy. A sequential, single-blind, triangular design was used to compare the rate of development of moderate disability (modified Rankin scale score < or =3) at 6 months' follow-up (primary outcome) between the 2 treatment groups.                After randomization of 38 patients, the data safety monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial because of slow recruitment and organizing a pooled analysis of individual data from this trial and the 2 other ongoing European trials of decompressive craniectomy in malignant MCA infarction. Among the 38 patients randomized, the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin scale score < or =3 at the 6-month and 1-year follow-up was 25% and 50%, respectively, in the surgery group compared with 5.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in the no-surgery group (P=0.18 and P=0.10, respectively). There was a 52.8% absolute reduction of death after craniectomy compared with medical therapy only (P<0.0001).                In this trial, early decompressive craniectomy increased by more than half the number of patients with moderate disability and very significantly reduced (by more than half) the mortality rate compared with that after medical therapy.","answer":"Surgical decompression lowers the risk of death and death or severe disability defined as mRS > 4 in selected patients 60 years of age or younger with a massive hemispheric infarction and oedema. Optimum criteria for patient selection and for timing of decompressive surgery are yet to be defined. Since survival may be at the expense of substantial disability, surgery should be the treatment of choice only when it can be assumed, based on their preferences, that it is in the best interest of patients. Since all the trials were stopped early, an overestimation of the effect size cannot be excluded."},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

In the context of feature-based matching, SIFT and its variants have long excelled in a wide array of applications. However, for ultra-wide baselines, as in the case of aerial images captured under large camera rotations, the appearance variation goes beyond the reach of SIFT and RANSAC. In this paper we propose a data-driven, deep learning-based approach that sidesteps local correspondence by framing the problem as a classification task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that local correspondences can still be useful. To do so we incorporate an attention mechanism to produce a set of probable matches, which allows us to further increase performance. We train our models on a dataset of urban aerial imagery consisting of \` same 'and \` different' pairs, collected for this purpose, and characterize the problem via a human study with annotations from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We demonstrate that our models outperform the state-of-the-art on ultra-wide baseline matching and approach human accuracy.","answer":"[[\\"models\\", \\"human accuracy\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"SIFT\\", \\"feature-based matching\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"ultra-wide baseline matching\\", \\"models\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"large camera rotations\\", \\"aerial images\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"SIFT\\", \\"RANSAC\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"dataset of urban aerial imagery\\", \\"models\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"models\\", \\"state-of-the-art\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"annotations from Amazon Mechanical Turk\\", \\"human study\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"Image matching\\", \\"Computer Vision\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"classification task\\", \\"problem\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"human study\\", \\"problem\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"ultra-wide baseline matching\\", \\"state-of-the-art\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Nearly one-half received biologic DMARD, and their use was strongly associated with RF-positive polyarthritis, PsA, uveitis, and systemic arthritis.pediatric JIA patients who were being treated with MTX for active uveitisEighteen patients (18/22; 82%) showed improvement of their uveitis with a significant decrease in activity of AC inflammation after a minimal period of 3 months of MTX treatment. A topical steroid-sparing effect was observed when MTX was administered for a period of 3 to 9 monthsMost experience among DMARD's/ immunosuppressive drugs has been obtained with methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, controlled studies in uveitis are still missing, so that treatment with MTX and all other immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporine A, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) only reaches an evidence level III (expert opinion, clinical experience or descriptive study)The data suggest that MTX is very effective in controlling inflammation of uveitis in patients with JIA. However, additional topical steroids or systemic immunosuppressive drugs are often required.The risk factor for development of early cataract requiring surgery in children with JIA-associated uveitis is the presence of posterior synechia at the time of diagnosis of uveitis. However, early treatment with MTX is associated with a mean delay in the development of cataract requiring surgery of 3.5 years.MTX seems to be an effective therapy for JIA associated uveitis.","answer":"The first-line standard therapy for uveitis is topical and systemic corticosteroids, often reinforced by methotrexate as a second-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).  MTX has a topical steroid sparing effect as well. Early treatment with MTX is advocated to prevent complications such as cataract. There are no trial data on the effect of MTX. Most experience among DMARD's/ immunosuppressive drugs has been obtained with methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, controlled studies in uveitis are still missing, so that treatment with MTX and all other immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporine A, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) only reaches an evidence level III (expert opinion, clinical experience or descriptive study).

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  This paper is concerned with state space problem solvers that achieve generality by learning strong heuristics through experience in a particular domain. We specifically consider two ways of learning by analysing past solutions that can improve future problem solving: creating macros and the chunks. A method of learning search heuristics is specified which is related to 'chunking' but which complements the use of macros within a goal directed system. An example of the creation and combined use of macros and chunks, taken from an implemented system, is described. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Research on macro-operators has a long history in planning and other search applications. There has been a revival of interest in this topic, leading to systems that successfully combine macrooperators with current state-of-the-art planning approaches based on heuristic search. However, research is still necessary to make macros become a standard, widely-used enhancement of search algorithms. This article introduces sequences of macro-actions, called iterative macros. Iterative macros exhibit both the potential advantages (e.g., travel fast towards goal) and the potential limitations (e.g., utility problem) of classical macros, only on a much larger scale. A family of techniques are introduced to balance this trade-off in favor of faster planning. Experiments on a collection of planning benchmarks show that, when compared to low-level search and even to search with classical macro-operators, iterative macros can achieve an impressive speed-up in search. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Many complex domains and even larger problems in simple domains remain challenging in spite of the recent progress in planning. Besides developing and improving planning technologies, re-engineering a domain by utilising acquired knowledge opens up a potential avenue for further research. Moreover, macro-actions, when added to the domain as additional actions, provide a promising means by which to convey such knowledge. A macro-action, or macro in short, is a group of actions selected for application as a single choice. Most existing work on macros exploits properties explicitly specific to the planners or the domains. However, such properties are not likely to be common with arbitrary planners or domains. Therefore, a macro learning method that does not exploit any structural knowledge about planners or domains explicitly is of immense interest. This paper presents an offline macro learning method that works with arbitrarily chosen planners and domains. Given a planner, a domain, and a number of example problems, the learning method generates macros from plans of some of the given problems under the guidance of a genetic algorithm. It represents macros like regular actions, evaluates them individually by solving the remaining given problems, and suggests individual macros that are to be added to the domain permanently. Genetic algorithms are automatic learning methods that can capture inherent features of a system using no explicit knowledge about it. Our method thus does not strive to discover or utilise any structural properties specific to a planner or a domain. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  N-gram analysis provides a means of probabilistically predicting the next item in a sequence. Due originally to Shannon, it has proven an effective technique for word prediction in natural language processing and for gene sequence analysis. In this paper, we investigate the utility of n-gram analysis in predicting operator sequences in plans. Given a set of sample plans, we perform n-gram analysis to predict the likelihood of subsequent operators, relative to a partial plan. We identify several ways in which this information might be integrated into a planner. In this paper, we investigate one of these directions in further detail. Preliminary results demonstrate the promise of n-gram analysis as a tool for improving planning performance. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  Despite recent progress in AI planning, many benchmarks remain challenging for current planners. In many domains, the performance of a planner can greatly be improved by discovering and exploiting information about the domain structure that is not explicitly encoded in the initial PDDL formulation. In this paper we present and compare two automated methods that learn relevant information from previous experience in a domain and use it to solve new problem instances. Our methods share a common four-step strategy. First, a domain is analyzed and structural information is extracted, then macro-operators are generated based on the previously discovered structure. A filtering and ranking procedure selects the most useful macro-operators. Finally, the selected macros are used to speed up future searches. ::: ::: We have successfully used such an approach in the fourth international planning competition IPC-4. Our system, Macro-FF, extends Hoffmann's state-of-the-art planner FF 2.3 with support for two kinds of macro-operators, and with engineering enhancements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our ideas on benchmarks from international planning competitions. Our results indicate a large reduction in search effort in those complex domains where structural information can be inferred. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  This paper describes Marvin, a planner that competed in the Fourth International Planning Competition (IPC 4). Marvin uses action-sequence-memoisation techniques to generate macro-actions, which are then used during search for a solution plan. We provide an overview of its architecture and search behaviour, detailing the algorithms used. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of its features in various planning domains; in particular, the effects on performance due to the use of macro-actions, the novel features of its search behaviour, and the native support of ADL and Derived Predicates.Literature Review:","answer":"Since the beginning of AP the use of macro-actions has been widely explored. The first macro-action learning system was STRIPS  . It used previous solution plans as macro-actions to solve subsequent problems as well as to monitor the execution of plans in the real world. Later, MORRIS BIB001 extended this approach by adding filtering heuristics to prune the generated set of macro-actions. This approach distinguished two types of macro-actions: S-macros that occur frequently during search and T-macros, that occur less often, but model some weakness in the heuristic. The REFLECT system  took the alternative approach of generating macroactions based on domain pre-processing. All sound combinations of actions were considered to be macroactions and filtered through basic pruning rules. Due to the small size of the domains with which the planner was reasoning, the remaining number of macro-actions was small enough to use in planning. Macro-actions systems traditionally use an off-line approach to generate and filter macro-actions before using them but a few systems have tried ML to filter macro actions during the search. In BIB002 ) the author used chunks and in (García-Durán et al., 2006) they used control rules to decide when to apply the macro-actions. Recent works successfully integrate macros with state-of-the-art heuristic search planners. These works include the IPC-2004 competitor MACROFF BIB006 BIB003 . Here partially ordered macroactions are extracted by identifying statically connected abstract components and then, an off-line filtering technique is used to prune the list of macro-actions. Marvin BIB007 , also a participant at IPC-2004, used action-sequence memorization techniques to generate macro-actions on-line that allow the planner to escape from plateaus without any exploration. Wizard BIB004 used a genetic algorithm to generate and filter a collection of macro-actions independent from the baseline planner. Algorithms for n-grams analysis have also been recently applied to learning macro-actions for the heuristic planner FF BIB005 )."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A number of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) deletion mutants have been identified in gliomas, in which the EGFR gene is frequently amplified and rearranged. We have previously characterized the structure of a gene in A-172 human glioma cells that encodes a 190-kDa EGFR mutant with tandem duplication of the tyrosine kinase (TK) and calcium-mediated internalization (CAIN) domains. Here we describe a 185-kDa tandem duplication mutant (TDM) that is expressed in KE and A-1235 glioma cells, along with certain functional characteristics of the mutants. The corresponding transcripts in KE and A-1235 cells contain 1053 additional nucleotides representing an in-frame duplication of exons 18 through 25 which encode the entire TK region and a portion of the CAIN domain. As with duplication of the entire TK/CAIN region (exons 18-26) in A-172 cells, duplication of exons 18-25 is associated with a specific genomic rearrangement between flanking introns. Involved introns contain homology to recombination signal sequence (RSS) heptamers present in the V(D)J region of the T lymphocyte receptor gene. In defined medium, both oncogenic TDM are constitutively autophosphorylated and inefficiently downregulated. High-affinity binding is reduced in EGFR.TDM/18-26, although the t1/2 of receptor internalization is not prolonged.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"A-1235 cells\\", \\"gliomas\\", \\"A-172 human glioma cells\\", \\"KE\\", \\"A-1235 glioma cells\\", \\"T lymphocyte\\", \\"A-172 cells\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

An ammonia-redistribution strategy for synthesizing metal borohydride ammoniates with controllable coordination number of NH(3) was proposed, and a series of magnesium borohydride ammoniates were easily synthesized by a mechanochemical reaction between Mg(BH(4))(2) and its hexaammoniate. A strong dependence of the dehydrogenation temperature and purity of the released hydrogen upon heating on the coordination number of NH(3) was elaborated for Mg(BH(4))(2)·xNH(3) owing to the change in the molar ratio of H(δ+) and H(δ-), the charge distribution on H(δ+) and H(δ-), and the strength of the coordinate bond N:→Mg(2+). The monoammoniate of magnesium borohydride (Mg(BH(4))(2)·NH(3)) was obtained for the first time.

The purpose of this double-blind, randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of treatment with only educational or education associated with self-care therapies on the pattern of mandibular movements of women with chronic painful TMDs. Forty-two women were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups, control group (CG, n=13), education group (EG, n=16), and education and self-care group (ESG, n=13), according to the sequence of treatment they received. A kinesiograph device recorded mandibular movements during maximum mouth opening and mastication at baseline (T0) and at 30-day (T1) and 60-day (T2) follow-up. Kinesiographic data were statistically analyzed using 1-way ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons of means (α=.05). The ESG group demonstrated an improvement in the maximum vertical opening (MVO = 5.1 ±3.4 mm; P=.012) and anteroposterior mandibular movement (MAM) during maximum opening (7.4 ±9.5; P=.019), significantly higher than that of the EG (MVO =1.8 ±3.5 mm; MAM =0.8 ±5.0 mm) and the CG (MVO =0.9 ±3.8 mm; MAM =0.8 ±4.4 mm) after 30 days of follow-up. Moreover, at T1, vertical mandibular movement during mastication was significantly higher in the ESG group (17.4 ±1.7 mm) than in the EG group (15.0 ±2.8, P=.027). No significant differences were found between the women who received treatment with educational and self-care therapies for 60 days and the women who received this treatment for 30 days. In the short-term, education and self-care treatment positively influenced the mandibular movement pattern of women with chronic painful TMDs.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"Mandibular\\", \\"mandibular\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"temporomandibular disorders\\", \\"mastication\\", \\"TMD\\", \\"maximum vertical opening\\", \\"MVO\\", \\"opening\\", \\"movement\\", \\"anteroposterior mandibular movement\\", \\"MAM\\", \\"movements\\", \\"TMDs\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"positively\\", \\"chronic painful\\", \\"No significant\\", \\"signs\\", \\"found\\", \\"Limited mandibular movements\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"self-care treatment\\", \\"self-care therapies\\", \\"management\\", \\"follow-up\\", \\"treatment\\", \\"evaluate\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"kinesiographic pattern\\", \\"educational\\", \\"education\\", \\"pattern\\", \\"Kinesiographic data\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [\\"kinesiograph device\\"], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"women\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"randomized clinical trial\\", \\"double-blind\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"vertical\\", \\"mouth\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Fast motions that are important for protein interactions1 can also be linked to slower motions involved in enzyme catalysis.2 The measurement of backbone 15N relaxation rates in NMR has become a routine procedure3,4 to characterize fast local motions.5,6 These measurements can be complemented by other relaxation data to obtain a more refined view of backbone dynamics.7 Usually, the 15N relaxation rates employed to characterize fast protein dynamics are the longitudinal relaxation rate R1, the transverse relaxation rate R2 and the dipolar cross-relaxation rate between the 15N and 1H nuclei.8 The last of these rates is essential for the accurate estimation of the spectral density function at high frequency5,9 and crucial for the identification of fast backbone motions.10,11 This rate is derived from what is commonly called the 'NOE experiment' where the ratio between the steady-state longitudinal 15N polarization under 1H irradiation or at equilibrium without any perturbation, is measured.8,12 The saturation of 1H's is more difficult to achieve than previously assumed, and cross-correlated relaxation13 affects the steady-state 15N polarization during 1H irradiation. We quantify these errors for the 1H irradiation scheme12 commonly used in the 'NOE experiment' and show that they can be suppressed in a straightforward manner, leading to more accurate measurements of spectra density at high frequency.</p><p>Several schemes have been proposed for 1H irradiation in steady-state NOE experiments. Although composite pulse decoupling15 can be used, the most common procedure applies a series of pulses and delays.12,14 Pulses with a variety of flip angles have been advocated,14 and schemes with 120° pulses are the most popular, based on empirical observations.16 Surprisingly, theoretical and experimental studies of irradiation schemes are sparse.14,17 We have recently shown that the symmetry of the saturation scheme is important.11 Here, we reexamine the accuracy of the experiment as a function of the 1H saturation scheme utilizing the Homogeneous Liouville Equation formalism. 17,18</p><p>All experiments were performed on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a room-temperature probe, using a sample of perdeuterated and 15N-labelled human ubiquitin (0.5 mM, in 50 mM ammonium acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.8). We measured 15N{1H} Overhauser effects using a symmetric proton irradiation scheme composed of repeated elements [delay τ/2 – β pulse – delay τ/2]n. Experiments were performed with flip angles β = 90°, 120° and 180°. In Figure 1a, we show differences, Δ(β1,β2), in the NOE ratio (of intensities with and without 1H irradiation) obtained with different flip angles β. Deviations are significant with β = 120° and maximal for β = 90°. As highlighted by color in Figure 1a (e.g. blue points appear on a blue background), the deviations are a periodic function of the 1H carrier frequency, with a period of 200 Hz, which corresponds to the inverse of the interval between two pulses τ. A 100 Hz shift of the 1H carrier leads to an inversion of all deviations, i.e., to a phase shift π of the periodic function. This observation is rationalized by numerical simulations (Fig. 1b).</p><p>Figure 1b shows that the calculated steady state 15N polarization depends on the 1H carrier frequency, with a period equal to the inverse of the interpulse delay: 1/(τ) = 200 Hz for τ = 5 ms. The oscillations can only be reproduced when the cross-correlation of the 15N chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and the 15N1H dipolar coupling is included in simulations.</p><p>The oscillations seen in Figure 1 stem from a superposition of two separate effects. The dominant one is largest when the evolution under the offset from the 1H carrier and the heteronuclear scalar coupling leads to the conversion Hy → 2HyNz during the interpulse delay τ. If β = 90°, the sequence β – τ – β leads to the conversion Hz → −2HzNz. Subsequent cross-correlated cross-relaxation between 2HzNz and Nz, results in an effective cross-relaxation pathway between the longitudinal polarization operators Hz and Nz, that perturbs the steady state. The second effect is most observable when the dominant effect vanishes, i.e. when the delay τ is a multiple of 1/|1JNH|. The average component Hzav vanishes if the 1H polarization precesses an integer number of full rotations during the delay τ, i.e. at the DANTE condition.19 Otherwise, the polarization Hz is not effectively saturated (Hzav ≠ 0) so that the 15N polarization does not evolve towards the desired steady state.</p><p>To illustrate the validity of this analysis, consider the experiment described in Figure 2, a \\"spin-temperature jump\\", demonstrating that a scheme like (A) creates a steady state different from the steady state obtained with 180° pulses. Intuitively, one might suppose that proton irradiation with any scheme would lead to proper saturation if applied long enough with sufficient power, so that both irradiation schemes would lead to the same steady state. However, as shown in Figure 2, under a sequence of 120° pulses, the polarization Nz evolves from the 'ideal' 15N steady state (achieved after a 4s irradiation with 180° pulses) towards the same state as the one obtained with scheme A. Deviations measured under scheme A correspond to a different steady state and not to a transient effect.</p><p>Figure 3 shows how systematic errors due to imperfect saturation propagate to the derived spectral density function at high frequency.12 This value is essential to the quantitative analysis of relaxation data.3,20 Deviations in the NOE ratios are amplified, so that large deviations are observed (with a maximum of 47% for Gln49, see SI). When an improper irradiation scheme is used, qualitative interpretations may be biased; for example, high-frequency motions seem to vary significantly in the β-hairpin comprising residues 9–11, while they appear to be uniform with the correct saturation scheme.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the steady state 15N polarization in NOE experiments depends on the flip angle β employed in the saturation sequence. Widely used trains of 120° pulses do not lead to the ideal steady state because of CSA/DD cross-correlated relaxation. Flip angles β should be set to 180° and delays τ to integer multiples of the inverse of the scalar coupling 1JNH. Improper irradiation leads to significant errors in the estimate of the spectral density functions at high frequency. This effect may be comparable to experimental errors in many studies with low-precision NOE ratios and it occurs whether a protein is deuterated or not (SI).</p>","answer":"The steady-state {1H}-15N NOE experiment is used in most common NMR analyses of backbone dynamics to accurately ascertain the effects of the fast dynamic modes. We demonstrate here that, in its most common implementation, this experiment generates an incorrect steady state in the presence of CSA/dipole cross-correlated relaxation leading to large errors in the characterization of these high-frequency modes. This affects both the quantitative and qualitative interpretation of 15N backbone relaxation in dynamic terms. We demonstrate further that minor changes in the experimental implementation effectively remove these errors and allow a more accurate interpretation of protein backbone dynamics."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Little is known about the biological pathways associated in FIP pathogenesis. This is the first study aiming to determine the phenotypic characteristics on the cellular level in relation to specific metabolic pathways of importance to FIP pathogenesis. METHODS: The internalization of type II FIPV WSU 79-1146 in Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CrFK) cells was visualized using a fluorescence microscope, and optimization prior to phenotype microarray (PM) study was performed. Then, four types of Biolog Phenotype MicroArray plates (PM-M1 to PM-M4) precoated with different carbon and nitrogen sources were used to determine the metabolic profiles in FIPV-infected cells. RESULTS: The utilization of palatinose was significantly low in FIPV-infected cells; however, there were significant increases in utilizing melibionic acid, L-glutamine, L-glutamic acid and alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln) compared to non-infected cells. CONCLUSION: This study has provided the first insights into the metabolic profiling of a feline coronavirus infection in vitro using PMs and deduced that glutamine metabolism is one of the essential metabolic pathways for FIPV infection and replication. Further studies are necessary to develop strategies to target the glutamine metabolic pathway in FIPV infection.","answer":"[\\"Mechanism\\", \\"Treatment\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Mutations in the gene ATM are responsible for the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction, radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition. Both the A-T phenotype and the similarity of the ATM protein to other DNA-damage sensors suggests a role for ATM in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition, signalling and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). There are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in A-T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The protein defective in NBS, nibrin (encoded by NBS1), forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 (refs 1, 2). This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time. The overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in A-T and NBS suggests that ATM and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway. Here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with IR. This response is abrogated in A-T cells that either do not express ATM protein or express near full-length mutant protein. We also show that ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin (S343A) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells. ATM phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association as revealed by radiation-induced foci formation. Our data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in phenotype between A-T and NBS..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"cancer\\", \\"Nijmegen breakage syndrome\\", \\"ataxia-telangiectasia\\", \\"cerebellar dysfunction\\", \\"A-T\\", \\"NBS\\", \\"genetic disorder\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

At most synapses, chemical signalling is terminated by a rapid reaccumulation of neurotransmitter into presynaptic terminals. Uptake systems for the biogenic amines are the initial site of action for therapeutic antidepressants and drugs such as cocaine and the amphetamines. We have isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a human noradrenaline transporter. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 617 amino acids, with 12-13 highly hydrophobic regions compatible with membrane-spanning domains. Expression of the cDNA clone in transfected HeLa cells indicates that noradrenaline transport activity is sodium-dependent and sensitive to selective noradrenaline transport inhibitors. Transporter RNA is localized to the brainstem and the adrenal gland. The predicted protein sequence demonstrates significant amino-acid identity with the Na+/gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter, thus identifying a new gene family for neurotransmitter transporter proteins. Analysis of its structure and function may lead to structure-based drug design for the treatment of human depression and could help determine whether transporter abnormalities underlie affective disorders.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"noradrenaline transporter\\", \\"noradrenaline transport inhibitors\\", \\"cocaine- and antidepressant-sensitive human noradrenaline transporter\\", \\"membrane-spanning domains\\", \\"neurotransmitter transporter\\", \\"Na+/gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

BACKGROUND. Increased expression of the HER-2 / neu oncogene in breast cancer correlates with decreased estrogen receptor concentration and seems to be an important prognostic factor. The authors investigated whether there is a correlation between HER-2 / neu expression and immunologic parameters representing tumor defense in patients with breast cancer. METHOD. A Western blot analysis was used to investigate HER-2 / neu expression, whereas a chromium-release assay using the K562 cell line as target was used to measure natural killer (NK) cell activity. RESULTS. In patients with breast cancer, NK cell activity was significantly higher compared with patients with benign tumors (P = 0. 006) or healthy control subjects (P = 0. 002). Moreover, 23. 3% of patients with breast cancer showed an overexpression of HER-2 / neu protein. Within this group of patients, NK cell activity was significantly lower (45. 6 + /-16. 1%) compared with the group with no HER-2 / neu overexpression (57. 3 + /-11. 0%). NK cell activity did not increase in patients with HER-2 / neu overexpression. Thus, there was a statistically significant correlation of cytolytic effector cell function with HER-2 / neu expression of the tumor (P = 0. 003), and HER-2 / neu overexpression correlated with a negative estrogen receptor status (P = 0. 005). CONCLUSION. These data add further evidence to previous observations from the authors ' laboratory that certain tumor characteristics may be associated with reactions of the host with breast cancer.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"K562 cell line\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"NK cell\\", \\"benign tumors\\", \\"natural killer (NK) cell\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"HER - 2 / neu oncogene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"HER - 2 / neu protein\\", \\"HER - 2 / neu\\", \\"estrogen receptor\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

To measure the cost and effectiveness of 3 established antimicrobial regimens for the prevention of infective complications after abdominal surgery.  design A prospective randomized trial was performed involving a total of 1070 patients undergoing abdominal surgery.  Setting And Patients All patients having upper gastrointestinal tract, colorectal, appendiceal, or biliary surgery at a major teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia, were considered for entry into the study.  interventions Patients were randomized prior to surgery to receive a single dose of cefotaxime sodium (1 g), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid (3.1 g), or ceftriaxone sodium, (1 g). All drugs were given intravenously at the start of anesthesia.  Main Outcome Measures Rates of major wound infections, minor wound infections, other wound problems, and other infective complications. The acquisition and administrative costs of the drugs used and the costs of the infective complications were measured.  results A Total of 1070 patients were entered into the study. Major wound infections occurred in 21 patients (2.0%). Twenty-five patients (2.3%) developed a minor wound infection. Other infective complications developed in 107 patients. There were significantly fewer minor wound infections in the ceftriaxone-treated group as compared with the other 2 groups. There was no differences in the frequency of major wound infections, other wound problems, or other infective complications. The acquisition costs of cefotaxime and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid were less than those of ceftriaxone. The estimated cost of treating the infective complications in the group of patients who received ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid (128,039) was greater than the cost associated with the groups being treated with cefotaxime (91,243) or ceftriaxone (96,095).  conclusions The study indicates that each of the 3 regimens was associated with highly satisfactory control of postoperative infective complications after abdominal surgery.

Here we show that clustering of binding sites for the transcription termination factor TTF-I downstream of the pre-rRNA coding region specifies transcription termination, increases the efficiency of transcription initiation and affects the three-dimensional structure of rRNA genes. On chromatin templates, but not on free rDNA, clustered binding sites promote cooperative binding of TTF-I, loading TTF-I to the downstream terminators before it binds to the rDNA promoter. Interaction of TTF-I with target sites upstream and downstream of the rDNA transcription unit connects these distal DNA elements by forming a chromatin loop between the rDNA promoter and the terminators. The results imply that clustered binding sites increase the binding affinity of transcription factors in chromatin, thus influencing the timing and strength of DNA-dependent processes.Introduction:An intriguing question for understanding protein-DNA recognition is how low-abundant transcription factors recognize their target sites in genomic DNA[1],[2]. Empirical studies revealed that regulatory regions, such as enhancers and promoters, comprise modular units of a few hundred base pairs that harbour multiple binding sites for the same transcription factor. Such ‘homotypic clustering sites’( HTCs) have been identified in 2% of the human genome, being enriched at promoters and enhancers[3]. HTCs have been shown to play a role in Drosophila development, regulating early patterning genes[4]–[6]. Genome-wide binding analyses in yeast have demonstrated that the occupancy of transcription factors is higher at clustered binding sites compared to single ones[7]. Studies in mammalian cells have shown that clustering of binding sites facilitate the cooperative binding of nuclear receptors to their target sites in vivo, suggesting that HCTs coordinate the recruitment of transcription initiation factors[8]–[10]. Alternatively, cooperative binding could arise through indirect effects, e. g. by changing the accessibility of neighbouring binding sites in chromatin[11]. To assess the functional relevance of homotypic clustering of transcription factor binding sites, we studied the 3′-terminal region of murine rRNA genes( rDNA), which contains ten binding sites( T1–T10) for the transcription termination factor TTF-I. Binding of TTF-I to the terminator elements is required to stop elongating RNA polymerase I( Pol I) and termination of pre-rRNA synthesis occurring predominantly at the first terminator T1[12]–[15]. In addition to the downstream terminators, there is a single TTF-I binding site, termed T0, located 170 bp upstream of the transcription start site[16]. Binding of TTF-I to this site is required for efficient transcription initiation and for the recruitment of chromatin remodelling complexes that establish distinct epigenetic states of rRNA genes. The interaction of TTF-I with CSB( Cockayne Syndrome protein B), NoRC( Nucleolar Remodeling Complex), or NuRD( Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylation complex), respectively, has been shown to recruit histone modifying enzymes which lead to the establishment of a specific epigenetic signature that characterizes active, silent or poised rRNA genes[17]–[20]. TTF-I has been shown to oligomerize in vitro and to link two DNA fragments in trans[21]. These characteristics enable TTF-I bound to the upstream binding site T0 and the downstream terminators T1–T10 to loop out of the pre-rRNA coding region[22],[23]. Formation of a chromatin loop facilitates re-initiation and increases transcription initiation rates at the rRNA gene[22],[24]. TTF-I is a multifunctional protein that is not only essential for transcription termination, but also directs efficient rDNA transcription, mediates replication fork arrest[25], establishes specific epigenetic features and determines the topology of rDNA. The conservation of multiple TTF-I binding sites downstream of the pre-rRNA coding region raises the question whether homotypic clustering of terminator elements is functionally relevant. Here we demonstrate that HTCs serve a chromatin-specific function. Packaging into chromatin increases the binding affinity of TTF-I to clustered terminator elements, augments the efficiency of transcription termination, enhances transcription initiation, and changes the higher-order structure of rRNA genes. The homotypic clusters at the rRNA gene coordinate the timing of molecular events, coordinating transcription termination and initiation and the occurrence of higher-order chromatin domains, suggesting an important chromatin-dependent role for clustered binding sites in the genome.Discussion:Clustering of transcription factor binding sites, comprising either multiple binding sites for the same factor( homotypic clustering) or different DNA binding motifs( heterotypic clustering), is an important regulatory feature of eukaryotic gene expression, about 62% of transcription factor genes and 66% of developmentally regulated genes comprising clustered binding sites in vertebrates[3]. Therefore, this feature has been widely used for computational prediction. In Drosophila, predicted HTCs are present in more than 70% of regulatory regions and have been suggested to function as developmental enhancers[6],[41]. Clustered binding sites are suggested to exert a positive effect on transcription by either of the following mechanisms. They could increase the local concentration of transcription factors or facilitate multiple interactions with components of the transcription machinery. Alternatively, they could provide functional redundancy[37],[42], allowing cooperative binding of the factors through interactions among the multiple binding sites or indirectly through multiple interactions with the transcriptional machinery[10],[43]–[46]. Here, we have uncovered a novel chromatin-based mechanism underlying HTC-directed transcriptional activation. We show that packaging into chromatin converts multiple low-affinity terminators downstream of the rDNA transcription unit into a high-affinity binding platform for TTF-I. This preferential binding of TTF-I to the downstream terminators is a prerequisite for TTF-I binding to the promoter-proximal binding site, connecting the promoter with the terminator to allow efficient recycling of Pol I. Cooperative binding of proteins has been shown to disrupt nucleosomes, thereby increasing the accessibility of transcription factors to regulatory sites[47],[48]. Our data reveal an alternative mechanism that increases the affinity of transcription factors. We show that binding of TTF-I to its target sites in chromatin is higher than to free DNA, suggesting that a specific nucleosomal arrangement or interactions with histones may trigger cooperative binding of TTF-I. Thus, HTCs attract transcription factors to functionally relevant sites, avoiding binding to single target sites in the genome. High-affinity binding of TTF-I to clustered termination sites will ensure loading of the downstream terminators( T1–T10) prior to TTF-I binding to the promoter-proximal binding site T0 in vivo. Sequential binding of TTF-I to the 3′- and 5′-end of the rDNA transcription unit will ensure that transcription initiation will take place exclusively at rRNA genes that are associated with TTF-I and will be properly terminated. In addition, a direct interaction between the promoter and the terminator is only established when the terminator comprises several TTF-I binding sites. This mode of binding and the formation of an intragenic loop may serve two functions. First, it links the terminator with the respective transcription unit to be activated. Second, it enhances transcription at genes associated with TTF-I by forming a highly active ribomotor structure[22],[49]. Thus, homotypic clustering of TTF-I binding sites coordinates transcription initiation and termination, thereby affecting both the timing and the efficiency of rDNA transcription. It is well established that gene activation by a distal regulatory element correlates with long-range interactions between enhancer( s) and gene promoters by factor-mediated formation of chromatin loops[50]. With regard to human and rat rRNA genes, previous studies suggested a role for TBP and c-Myc in loop formation at active rRNA genes[23],[33]. However, genome-wide ChIP-Seq data did not reveal significant enrichment of c-Myc- and TBP at the terminator( Fig. S7B). Moreover, murine rRNA genes lack clustered E-boxes( Fig. S7A), and therefore the participation of c-Myc in loop formation is not very likely. Similar loop mechanisms were shown for RNA polymerase II transcribed genes, suggesting a common theme involving the interaction of promoters with transcription termination regions that enhance the transcriptional activity and gene regulation[51]. Active enhancer elements are characterized by eukaryotic histone marks, e. g. H3K27ac or H3K4me1, which are involved in long-range chromatin interactions[40]. Notably, our integrative genomic analysis revealed characteristic enrichment of histone marks at the terminator, which can be observed in human as well[52]. The results support our finding that the homotypic cluster of TTF-I binding sites displays all hallmarks of a functional enhancer, such as distal location, presence of HTCs, regulatory histone marks and the potential to exert gene activation by direct, protein-mediated DNA loops. Chromatin-dependent high-affinity binding of TTF-I to the clustered binding sites adds a further regulatory level on the enhancer function, i. e., coordination of transcription termination and initiation.","answer":"The sequence-specific binding of proteins to regulatory regions controls gene expression .

Introduction<p>Anthocyanins are powerful water-soluble antioxidants of flavonoids class with health promoting effect [1, 2]. The coloured flavylium form of anthocyanins is a reason to regard them as natural food colorants [2]. The latter explains a high scientific and technological interest to the substances. Anthocyanins are synthesized in plant tissue, mainly in fruits, flowers and for some species in leaves as a rule as a complex mixture of compounds with different structures [3]. Anthocyanins are glycosides of anthocyanidins (Figure 1), with great varieties of more than 600 anthocyanin structures found in plant sources [4] though only six structures of the latter cover the majority of the structures due to glycosylation type variability [5].</p><p>Reversed-phase HPLC is a common method for analysis of complex mixtures of plant anthocyanins [6, 7]. The specificity of the method is usage of rather strong acidic mixtures of water and organic water-miscible solvent. Acidification is necessary to transfer the substances into charged and coloured flavylium form, due to the fact that anthocyanins may be easily detected at the presence of large amounts of other colourless substances.</p><p>The retention of substances in HPLC depends upon type and even trademark of stationary reversed phase, composition of mobile phase, and temperature as well as solute structure. Mobile phases of water mixtures with acetonitrile or methanol are acidified with HCOOH [8], acetic [9], phosphoric [10], and trifluoroacetic [11] acids as well as the mixtures (without any explanation) of some of them [12–14] for anthocyanins separation. However, as far as we know only \\"HCOOH–acetonitrile–water\\" mobile phases were investigated extensively to elucidate the regularities of anthocyanins retention [8, 15–17]. According to Snyder' selectivity triangular water, acetonitrile and HCOOH are solvents of different groups, VIII, VIb, and IV correspondingly [18], so the withdrawal or exchange of some solvents may lead to alteration of solutes separation selectivity.</p><p>The aim of the present paper is the investigation of regularities of anthocyanins retention in RP HPLC with mobile phases composed of water, acetonitrile and phosphoric acid and comparing that with retention in the more commonly used mobile phases being water–acetonitrile mixtures acidified with HCOOH (10 vol. %).</p>2.1. Chemicals and Reagents<p>All anthocyanins under investigation were extracted from the plant sources and isolated by means of semipreparative HPLC. 3-Glucosides of delphinidin (Dp3Glu), cyanidin (Cy3Glu), petunidin (Pt3Glu), peonidin (Pn3Glu), and malvidin (Mv3Glu) were isolated from grape fruit skin; pelargonidin-3-glucoside (Pg3Glu) was isolated from strawberry fruits; cyanidin-3-sophoroside (Cy3Sopho) and cyanidin-3-glucosylrutinoside (Cy3GRut) were isolated from sour cherry fruits; cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy3Sam) and cyanidin-3-xylosilrutinosyde (Cy3XRut) were isolated from red currant fruits; cyanidin-3-arabinosylglucoside (Cy3AGlu) was isolated from rowanberry fruits; cyanidin-3-galactoside (Cy3Gala) and cyanidin-3-arabinoside (Cy3Ara) were isolated from saskatoon fruit. The solute structures were confirmed by electronic and mass spectrum with relative retention control [16, 17].</p><p>Mobile phases for HPLC were composed of distilled water, acetonitrile (Super Gradient, LAB-SCAN), reagent grade HCOOH, and phosphoric acid (SPECTR-CHEM Ltd., RF).</p>2.2. Extraction and Partial Purification of Anthocyanins<p>Plant material was dispersed in 0.1 M solution of HCl in distilled water with blander and macerated overnight. Then supernatant was decanted and applied for solid phase extraction by DIAPAC C18 cartridges (BioChemMak ST, RF).</p>2.3. Semipreparative Isolation of Individual Anthocyanins<p>The isolation of individual anthocyanins was performed by Shimadzu equipment LC-20 with spectrophotometric detection on chromatographic column 10 × 250 mm SUPELCOSIL C18 (5 mcm) in eluents of water–acetonitrile, 10 vol. % HCOOH system.</p>2.4. Analytical HPLC<p>The fractions of semipreparative separations were controlled and chromatographic behaviour of anthocyanins was investigated with utilisation of Agilent Infinity 1200 equipment with diode array (DAD) and MS (6130 Quadrupole LC/MS) detectors. Chromatographic column: 4.6 × 250 mm Symmetry C18 in two mobile phase systems.</p><p>System  1: solutions of acetonitrile in distilled water (8–14 vol. %), acidified with phosphoric acid (0.5 vol. %). The concentration of phosphoric acid (0.5 vol. %) in System 1 was chosen to match the pH close to that for 10 vol. % of HCOOH (1.45–1.50) of System 2. It should be mentioned that the decrease of acid content leads to increase of mobile phase pH and to decrease of number theoretical plates of the chromatographic system under investigation [19].</p><p>Reference System  2: solutions of acetonitrile in distilled water (6–12 vol. %), acidified with HCOOH (10 vol. %).</p>2.5. Spectral Characteristics<p>Electronic spectra of the anthocyanin' peaks were recorded in DAD cell with a range step of 0.50 nm. Mass spectra were recorded at ESI-mode with column 2.1 × 150 mm Kromasil 100-3.5C18, mobile phase 10 vol. % of HCOOH and 8 vol. % of CH3CN in distilled water, 150 mcl/min. Fragmentor voltage of 100 V was applied to get molecular ions and 150 or 200 V to get fragmented ions of corresponding anthocyanidins.</p>3.1. Common Consideration<p>The dependence of retention of sample anthocyanin cyanidin-3-glucoside, Cy3Glu (Figure 2), upon volume fraction of CH3CN in a mobile phase is rather linear function according to Snyder equation [20] (1) for System 1 (R2 = 0.9998) as well as for System 2 (R2 = 0.998):(1)log⁡kϕi=log⁡kwi−Si·ϕ,where kϕ(i) is retention factor of Cy3Glu at a given ϕ, volume fraction of CH3CN in a mobile phase, and log⁡kw(i) and S(i) are linear approximation constants.</p><p>The replacement of 10 vol. % of HCOOH by 0.5 vol. % of phosphoric acid results in pronounced increase of Cy3Glu retention, so that ~3.5 vol. % of CH3CN must be added to compensate the increase. Moreover, this means that elution power of HCOOH is three times lower than that of CH3CN. Meanwhile for the eluent Systems 1 and 2 parameters S(i) are 0.162 and 0.150, respectively. The relatively small difference between negative slopes (S(i)) becomes valuable for the calculated values for the stoichiometric displacement model [20] (2) on the same basis:(2)log⁡kci=a−b·log⁡c(CH3CN),where kc(i) is retention factor of Cy3Glu at a given c(CH3CN), molar concentration of CH3CN in a mobile phase, and a and b are linear approximation constants; b corresponds to the number of CH3CN molecules that are released into a mobile phase during solute sorption.</p><p>For System 1 and System 2 parameter b is 4.50 and 2.60, respectively. The results indicate a valuable role of HCOOH in sorption-desorption processes and its withdrawal may influence the solute separation selectivity.</p>3.2. Solutes with Different Anthocyanidin Structures and the Same Glycosylation Type<p>The separation map in the framework of relative retention analysis [17] with pelargonidin-3-glucoside as a reference solute is presented in Figure 3. Each point on the plot has coordinates x, logarithm of capacity factor of Pg3Glu and y, that for corresponding solute in the same mobile phase. Points for the same solute and different mobile phase compositions settle down on straight lines according to equation of relative retention (3) (Table 1):(3)log⁡ki=a·log⁡kPg3Glu+b.</p><p>Pg3Glu was taken as a reference solute for the simplest ring B structure. Parameters of (3) are the valuable characteristics of corresponding solutes. For example, addition of OH-group into position 3′ of ring B (for a transfer from Pg3Glu to Cy3Glu) leads not only to decrease of retention (and parameter b) because of solute hydrophilicity increase but also to increase of parameter a as a consequence of additive van der Waals interactions of these O and H atoms with stationary phase atoms. It is easy to see that addition of OH- and CH3O-groups to positions 3′ and 5′ of ring B leads to close to additive increase of capacity factor logarithm. This property is true for the same solute retention in System 2 [15]; thus the sequence of anthocyanins' elution on the chromatograms of mixtures of 3-glucosides delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and malvidin for both systems remains unchanged (Figure 4). Meanwhile the exchange of phosphoric acid by HCOOH one results in slight selectivity alterations: some decrease of relative retention for OH-substitutions and an increase of that for OCH3-substitutions are evident (Figure 5).</p><p>Thus, points for Mv3Glu and Pn3Glu for System 2 settle down above the lines for the same anthocyanins for System 1, while the opposite case is found for relative retention of Dp3Glu and Cy3Glu. Accordingly, System 2 has somewhat higher selectivity for separation of substances with different flavylium ions hydrophilicity.</p><p>The lines of relative retention approximated to the region of zero points [21] (left down corner of the plot on Figure 3) are differentiated according to the number of OH-groups in ring B of anthocyanin structure. Moreover, according to our observation the place of OH-addition has no meaning—the particular anthocyanins of Alstroemeria flowers [22] with OH-groups at carbon atoms number 6 have retention close to that of isomers with OH-groups in ring B. This is in a full agreement with the property of reversed-phases chromatography having a low selectivity for isomers separation. Accordingly, the position of lines of relative retention (3) in the region of zero points may be utilised for tentative chromatographic estimation of the number of OH-groups in solute molecules.</p>3.3. Solutes with the Same Anthocyanidin Structure and Different Glycosylation Type<p>The separation map of relative retention of some cyanidin-3-glycosides with Cy3Glu as a reference solute in System 1 is presented in Figure 6. It becomes evident that not only the absolute retention but also relative retention of different cyanidin-3-glycosides depends not only upon solute structure, but also upon mobile phase composition; coelution of some solute pairs including the reversal of the elution order may occur after alteration of component concentrations in the mobile phase of the same eluent system and stationary phase.</p><p>By the way the drawing of the resolution map may escape mistakes connected with estimation of number of solutes and choice of appropriate mobile phase composition for complex mixtures analysis by HPLC methods.</p><p>In the case of System 1 parameter a of (3) may be utilised for preliminary estimation of complexity of glycoside structure in position 3 of anthocyanidin backbone: a has a value in the region 1.000 ± 0.020 for monoglycosides (Cy3Gala and Cy3Ara), 1.122 ± 0.011 for diglycosides (Cy3Sopho, Cy3Sam, Cy3AGlu, and Cy3Rut), and 1.300 ± 0.030 for triglycosides (Cy3GRut, Cy3XRut) (Table 2). The values are close to that reported for retention of cyanidin-3-glycosides in RP HPLC in solvent System 2 [17, 23] proving the property to be a common regularity of the solute chromatographic behaviour at least for the systems under investigation.</p><p>Finely, the exchange of HCOOH by phosphoric acid also leads to slight decrease of relative retention of di- and trisaccharides, Figure 7, but no significant alterations of solutes separation selectivity were found.</p>4. Conclusions<p>The exchange of HCOOH (System 1) for phosphoric acid (System 2) leads to substantial increase of anthocyanins retention in mobile phases, acidified mixtures of water and acetonitrile.</p><p>Selectivity of resolution of the same glycosides of six common anthocyanidins is only slightly greater in System 2, by the way, though the sequence of elution remains the same for reasonable solutes retention times.</p><p>Analysis of anthocyanins relative retentions on the separation map (in the region of zero points) may be explored for estimation of the number of OH-groups in anthocyanidin backbone.</p><p>Selectivity of resolution of the different glycosides of the same anthocyanidin (an example of the most common natural aglicone, cyanidin) is also close to that for System 1.</p><p>But the advantage of relative retention analysis is a sensitivity to structure of carbohydrate radicals; parameter b for mono-, di-, and trisaccharides is differing enough permitting determination of complexity of glycosyl radical in the 3 positions of anthocyanidin without utilization of MS detection. Moreover, parameter a is highly sensitive to sugar isomers structures.</p><p>Thus, eluent systems under investigation have close properties, though System 2 seems to be somewhat more efficient.</p>","answer":"The influence of exchange of HCOOH (System 2) by phosphoric acid (System 1) for acidification of the “acetonitrile–water” mobile phases for reversed-phase HPLC of anthocyanins was investigated in the framework of relative retention analysis.

Although these factors differ across environments, it is currently unknown whether or how accurately state and action representations are acquired by the agent because previous experiments have typically provided this information a priori through instruction or pre-training. Here we studied how state and action representations adapt to reflect the structure of the world when such a priori knowledge is not available. We used a sequential decision-making task in rats in which they were required to pass through multiple states before reaching the goal, and for which the number of states and how they map onto external cues were unknown a priori. We found that, early in training, animals selected actions as if the task was not sequential and outcomes were the immediate consequence of the most proximal action. During the course of training, however, rats recovered the true structure of the environment and made decisions based on the expanded state-space, reflecting the multiple stages of the task. Similarly, we found that the set of actions expanded with training, although the emergence of new action sequences was sensitive to the experimental parameters and specifics of the training procedure. We conclude that the profile of choices shows a gradual shift from simple representations to more complex structures compatible with the structure of the world.Introduction:In sequential decision-making tasks, an agent makes a series of choices and passes through several states before earning rewards. Making choices requires knowing the structure of the environment such as the available actions, the number of states of the environment and how they map on to external cues, i. e., the state-space of the task. Within the lab this information is typically given to subjects in advance of the task either through instructions or pre-training, however, such a priori information is not usually made available to a decision-maker in natural environments, and the decision-making process must, therefore, involve( i) learning the correct state-space of the environment and( ii) acquiring new actions that are useful for earning reward in the task. Learning the state-space of the task is crucial in allowing the agent to navigate within the environment, and provides building blocks for various forms of reinforcement-learning algorithms in the brain[1, 2]. This process involves considering different events and cues that occur after taking each action, and integrating them in order to recover how many states the task has and how they are related to external cues. Recent theoretical work provides a basis for this process in the context of classical conditioning and suggests that the underlying states used to represent the environment are dynamic; that animals are able to infer and learn new states of the environment based on their observations[3, 4]. However, at present, there is no direct evidence for such adaptive state-space representations in decision-making situations. Actions are the other building block for reinforcement-learning algorithms, and refer, for example, to different motor commands that an agent can use to influence the state of the environment. Efficient decision-making relies on using actions at the appropriate scale; engaging decision-making at too fine-grained a level of motor movement will overwhelm this process with choice points. Indeed, evidence suggests that humans and other animals can create new actions in the form of action chunks or action sequences by concatenating simple actions together[5, 6, 7, 8, 2]. Such action sequences, known as ‘temporally extended actions’, can be thought of as new skills that expand the set of available actions and that are treated as single response units. By acquiring new action sequences, the selection process needs to be implemented only once at the initiation point of an action sequence instead of before each individual action and, in this way, adaptive representations of actions contribute to the scalability of the decision-making process. In the current study, using a sequential decision-making task in rats, we sought to investigate whether state-space and action representations adapt to the structure of the world. We used a two-stage decision-making task similar to a two-stage task previously used in human subjects and rodents[e. g., 9, 10, 11, 12], and show, without any explicit instructions about the structure of the task( which obviously cannot be provided to rats), that early in training, the rats made decisions based on the assumption that the state-space is simple and the environment is composed of a single stage whereas, later in training, they learned the true state-space reflecting the multi-stage structure of the environment and made decisions accordingly. We also found that concurrently with the expansion of the state-space, the set of actions also expanded and action sequences were added to the set of actions that the rats executed. This latter effect, however, was sensitive to the choice of experimental parameters and did not emerge in all of the test conditions. We conclude that decision making is adaptive and depends on acquiring, refining and updating both state-space and action representations over time. Importantly, although this may not seem an entirely unexpected result from an associative learning perspective[e. g., 13], it required the development of an alternative hierarchical architecture to generate a description of the rats’ performance in RL terms.Discussion:Learning the value of different actions in various states of the environment is essential for decision-making in multi-stage environments. This learning process operates above the state-space and action representation and, therefore, the ability to( i) acquire the correct state-space of the task, and( ii) create new actions that are useful for solving the task, are important for efficient decision-making. Using a sequential decision-making task in rats, we provide direct evidence that, early in training, subjects make decisions based on simple state-space and action representations, but that, during the course of training, both state-space and action representations( under certain conditions) evolve and adapt to the structure of the environment. That is, we found that the rats responded initially as if the proximal response to reward was the only relevant action to earn that reward but gradually learned the interaction between the first lever press and the second lever press response within and across the states signalled by the discriminative stimuli and so acquired the multistage discrimination. Furthermore, we found evidence that the single lever press actions initially acquired by the rats later expanded to include sequences of lever presses and that, when these sequences were used, they tended to be used in a habitual manner by repeating previously rewarded sequences even when the stage 2 state was revalued. The ability to solve multi-stage decision-making tasks has been previously demonstrated in different species, however, unlike the current study, these demonstrations have either given the different stages of the task to the subjects[e. g., 9], or have explicitly signalled the actions that should be taken at each stage[e. g., 20], which remove the necessity for building multi-stage representations to solve the task. Similarly, the ability of animals to concatenate simple actions to execute action sequences has been established previously and here we extended these prior studies by showing that, during the course of learning, single actions turn into action sequences that are not only executed, but also are evaluated as a single response unit[13]. Similar findings have recently been reported demonstrating that lever press-magazine entry sequences are resistant to devaluation in rats[21]. A task similar to the two-stage task that we used here in rats has previously been employed to study different forms of decision-making processes in humans[9]. Although the experiments in those studies were composed of a single session, results indicated that the subjects were using an expanded state-space representation without needing to go through multiple training sessions. This is presumably due to the instructions and the cover story provided to the subjects, which informed them about the correct state-space representation. In terms of acquiring action sequences, using a similar task in humans we have previously shown that subjects engaged action sequences[10]. Again, however, we found they were able to do so without requiring multiple training sessions. Why such sequences should have formed so rapidly is a matter of conjecture but, as the task involved pressing keys on a keyboard, familiarity with similar response sequences could have supported sequence acquisition( especially as only two key presses were required to earn the reward). Based on these comparisons, the results of the current experiments point to the importance and complexity of learning state-space and action representations. As the profile of the rats’ choices indicates, they required a significant amount of training in order to learn the structure of the environment( 10-40 sessions). This is while, in some instrumental conditioning settings, animals are able to learn the contingency between actions and states in two and sometimes in a single training session[14]. Uncovering the processes that determine the encoding of the state-space of the task and how this process interacts with that subserving instrumental conditioning will be an important step towards better understanding the learning mechanisms that mediate decision-making processes generally. The results of the computational modelling indicated that hierarchical model-based RL provides the best explanation for the rats’ choices. This model assumes that the subjects build an internal map of the environment which encodes both the specific outcomes of single actions and of action sequences. The validity of this assumption for single actions can be confirmed based on the results of the current experiment and previous studies[22] showing that subjects encode the specific outcome of each individual action, e. g., taking ‘R’ leads to ‘S1’ and ‘L’ leads to ‘S2’. With regard to encoding the outcome of action sequences, although previous studies have indicated that the subjects specifically encode the outcome of each action sequence[13], we cannot assess whether subjects encoded outcome specific sequences in the current study because the value of the food outcome was not manipulated. As such, the results do not address the( model-based or model-free) nature of the controller mediating the evaluation of action sequences. Although the computational modelling analysis provided evidence consistent with hierarchical model-based RL, the results do not imply that all the behavioural trends in the data were captured by the model. In particular, although a wide range of models with different parameters were considered here, there were some differences between the pattern of stage 1 choices in the data shown in Fig 3( e) and the simulations of the best model shown in Fig 3( i). One way to address this issue is using recurrent neural networks( RNNs) instead of the RL family, which are more flexible and able to learn the details of the behavioural processes without relying on manually engineering the models[23]. Another limitation of the current work is that, although we provided evidence for the expansion of the state-space of the task, we did not provide any computational account for ‘how’ the states-space is acquired by the animals. This can potentially be addressed by approximating Q–values using a parametrised family of models able to adjust their predictions as the training progresses. Along the same lines, as we discussed in the previous sections, the emergence and detection of action sequences requires certain experimental conditions, such as a short ITI. Without these conditions actions at stage 1 are consistent with the operation of action sequences, but not actions at stage 2. One explanation for this effect is the possibility that action sequences were inhibited. For example, if during long ITIs the subjects go through extinction, it is unlikely that they keep performing the whole action sequence throughout the ITI and into the next trial. As such, although the first component of the action sequence at stage 1 is performed, the second component may be inhibited when it is inappropriate, making it harder to detect the performance of action sequences. Alternatively, this pattern of choices could also indicate the operation of another RL system, such as model-free RL, instead of interrupted sequences. Within this alternative framework, choices are a mixture of goal-directed actions( model-based), and model-free actions that are guided by their ‘cached’[as opposed to their current values]. Our results are equivocal with respect to this interpretation, but since, in other conditions, there is positive evidence for action sequences, it is more parsimonious to interpret this result in terms of the inhibition of action sequences rather than as the output of an additional model-free system. The current task and the parameter set that we have assessed in these experiments( see also S2 Text) constitute an addition to the developing literature on multistage discrimination learning[e. g., 17, 12, 11, 24, 25] and its relationship to action sequence learning in rats[13]. Importantly, this research demonstrates that one way in which rats, and potentially other animals including humans[10], learn complex multistage discriminations is not just by expanding the task space through shifts in attention across the perceptual feature dimensions of complex stimuli[26, 27] but also by expanding the action repertoire from single actions to action sequences. The tendency to generate such sequences may have been aided by some important features of the current task; perhaps the most important of which was our attempt to minimize the impact of predictive cues in the first stage that could significantly interfere with the action-related predictions of the second stage state. However, a recent study[28] that replicated many of the effects reported by[10] with regard to the development of action sequences in a multistage discrimination task in human subjects nevertheless confounded stimulus and action predictions at the first stage as others have done[9]. However, the Adams and Cushman’s study differed from Dezfouli and Balleine’s in also reporting some evidence for a model-free component of performance over and above the model-based selection of habitual action sequences, which raises the possibility that evidence of model-free RL in first stage choices depended on using specific first stage stimuli that could provide stimulus values for the second stage states. That feature aside, however, the current task is a close analogue for the human 2 stage task generated by Daw and colleagues and particularly that of[10] and appears to produce very similar effects in both rodent and human subjects. Given its utility in animals, this task could, therefore, provide the opportunity to not only investigate the behavioural and psychological determinants of performance across species but, by utilising more direct neural manipulations, to establish the way in which the brain supports state and action learning in multistage discrimination tasks and particularly how model-based control of simple actions and habitual actions sequences is implemented in multistage discriminations. Generally, the interaction of a model-free controller with action sequence learning has not been evaluated at the neural level, although considerable evidence suggests that premotor and presupplementary motor regions are likely to play an important role[e. g., 29]. This is particularly true given the evidence in animals that damage to the rodent homologue of premotor cortex reduces otherwise sequential action-outcome relations simple actions[13]. This account is strikingly different from other models within which goal-directed actions and habits and their computational model-based and model-free implementation have typically been seen as antagonistic processes for which some form of arbitrator is required to adjudicate competition between them. Arbitration has been investigated in a number of paradigms in humans and several investigators have found evidence of model-based model-free arbitration-related activity particularly in the inferior lateral prefrontal cortex[30, 31]. In contrast, within hierarchical models, goal-directed actions and habit sequences do not compete, being two action strategies from which the goal-directed controller selects. Which of these is the more accurate statement of the way goal-directed and habitual actions interact is an empirical issue but other potential models of performance have generally suggested that collaboration rather than competition between action controllers more accurately captures their interactions[cf. 32].","answer":"Everyday decision-making tasks typically require taking multiple actions and passing through multiple states before reaching desired goals .

Despite accumulating evidence suggesting that neuronal membrane proteins are potential targets of inhaled anesthetics, most currently favored membrane protein targets lack any direct evidence for anesthetic binding. We report herein the location of the binding site for the inhaled anesthetic halothane at the amino acid residue level of resolution in the ligand binding cavity in a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor, bovine rhodopsin. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching and direct photoaffinity labeling with [(14)C]halothane suggested an interhelical location of halothane with a stoichiometry of 1 (halothane/rhodopsin molar ratio). Radiosequence analysis of [(14)C]halothane-labeled rhodopsin revealed that halothane contacts an amino acid residue (Trp265) lining the ligand binding cavity in the transmembrane core of the receptor. The predicted functional consequence, competition between halothane and the ligand retinal, was shown here by spectroscopy and is known to exist in vivo. These data suggest that competition with endogenous ligands may be a general mechanism of the action of halothane at this large family of signaling proteins.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"amino acid\\", \\"[(14)C]halothane\\", \\"halothane\\", \\"Tryptophan\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"G protein-coupled receptors\\", \\"rhodopsin\\", \\"G protein-coupled receptor\\", \\"bovine rhodopsin\\"]}"},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

often because many of the pd markers needed to describe the system are lacking and/or the number of samples collected over time too few .statistics suggests that a model should not have more degrees of freedom than are supported by the current analysis data set .however , physiological parameters are useful for extrapolation and may be informed by prior knowledge if the current analysis data set does not support their estimation .markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) bayesian estimation approaches allow this to be done in a more statistically rigorous manner .traditional nlme estimation approaches , such as weighted least squares and maximum likelihood , have limited options for incorporation of prior information ; parameters can be fixed to a specific value , or they can be estimated based on the analysis data set .mcmc bayesian approaches allow the incorporation of a probability distribution to the prior knowledge , with means and variance for the model 's prior parameters .the variance of the prior means for the model parameters determines how much weight should be given to the prior relative to current analysis data set ( figure 1 ) .the resulting posterior model is thus based on the combination of prior knowledge and the current experimental data . with bayesian estimation approaches ,there is no need to either completely ignore prior knowledge ( an unrealistic prospect for mechanism - based models ) or assume it is correct with absolute certainty .the theory of bayesian statistics goes back to the 18th century , when thomas bayes introduced the theorem for how one may update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired .his theory provided the mathematical equation for indicating that future outcome has a probability that is based on current data and prior knowledge :   where the probability of a hypothesis h conditional on a given body of data e is the ratio of the unconditional probability of the conjunction of the hypothesis with the data to the unconditional probability of the data alone ( p(e ) ) . in bayesian model optimization ,p(e|h ) is the marginal posterior density for model , given the priors and the analysis data set .bayesian theory fits quite well with the need for mechanistic pk / pd models to incorporate prior knowledge to adequately inform the parameters of the system of ordinary differential equations .this theory has been difficult to implement for statistical modeling until the advent of more powerful computing resources and mcmc sampling approaches . for nearly all statistical models ,there is no closed form solution for the bayesian posterior density estimator needed for model optimization ; therefore , computational methods with numerical integration are a necessity .the mcmc sampling technique provides an effective approach for sampling from a distribution of parameters to solve this problem using iterative numerical integration .the mcmc approach samples a distribution of parameters at each iteration that is dependent on the conditional distribution , which is in turn dependent on the values sampled from the previous iterations .the posterior distribution is arrived at through this stochastic , iterative process that is informed by a combination of the current model , the model priors , and the analysis data set .the optimal set of fixed and random effects of the model is derived once the iterative mcmc process has reached a state of equilibrium , often called the the parameters vary stochastically about their means with a defined variance that is based on the optimal relationship between the model / priors and the analysis data . during the initial series of mcmc iterations , efficiently obtaining the stationary can be challenging .there are different approaches to arrive at the stationary distribution , but the most common is to use a  burn - in  period of mcmc iterations during which a large number of iterations are discarded . following a sufficiently long  burn - in  period , the posterior parameters will converge to the stationary distribution .this is analogous to convergence to the maximum likelihood using more traditional estimation algorithms , with the exception that there is not convergence to a single maximum likelihood , but rather a probability distribution from which various useful statistics can be derived ( e.g. , mean , median , and sd ) . determining the appropriate number of burn - in iterations to achieve convergence to the stationary distributionis the greatest challenge for model optimization using mcmc bayesian estimation algorithms , particularly with complex pk / pd models .two problems that cause difficulty for convergence to the stationary distribution are as follows : correlation of the parameters with their initial estimates and autocorrelation , which is a systematic sequential within chain correlation .diagnostic tests have been developed to determine whether convergence to the stationary distribution has occurred and include single chain vs. multiple mcmc approaches .many of these convergence diagnostics are available in the bayesian output analysis package available for r or s - plus ( table 1 ) .the geweke and gelman and rubin diagnostics can be plotted as a function of iteration to determine the progress of convergence as a function of the number of iterations . to determine whether the posterior parameters are uncorrelated with their initial estimates, it is typical to perform at least three mcmc with parameters that have different starting values .if the three chains converge to similar posterior distributions as determined by a multiple chain convergence diagnostic ( e.g. , gelman and rubin ) , then it is assumed that they are no longer correlated with their initial estimates .autocorrelation is typically a more difficult problem for bayesian nlme pk / pd modeling because it is often caused by correlation between parameters in the model ( often related to the structure of the model ) and may require tens of thousands of mcmc iterations before the autocorrelation is corrected .the degree of autocorrelation is typically assessed using a lag - autocorrelation plot , which determines the degree of autocorrelation within chains based on the distance ( i.e. , number of iterations or lag ) between the sampled parameters .nonmem and bugs ( winbugs or openbugs ) are two common platforms for implementation of mcmc bayesian estimation for pk / pd modeling . however, neither platform incorporates these convergence diagnostics ; thus , assessment of convergence must be conducted using an external tool .few published examples exist of the application of mcmc bayesian estimation to complex , mechanism - based pk / pd models .the approach has been more commonly adopted in the field of toxicology for physiologically based pk modeling of xenobiotic compounds in humans and animals .this is , in part , due to the fact that environmental toxicologists often need to estimate the risk posed by different xenobiotic agents , which fits in well with the ability of bayesian approaches to provide a posterior probability distribution for the model .in addition , there has been widespread adoption in toxicology of ordinary differential equation modeling software tools such as acslx , which have incorporated mcmc bayesian algorithms .the use of mcmc bayesian nlme approaches for application to clinical pk / pd problems is much less common . in 2007 , jonsson et al published a reanalysis  of a mechanism - based pk / pd model of neutropenia , which was the first example of the fully transparent application of mcmc bayesian methods to a complex , hierarchical mechanistic pk / pd problem .they highlighted the difficulties with determining convergence and the time - consuming model optimization process using mcmc bayesian estimation .jonsson and co - authors conclude that the mcmc bayesian approach enables efficient use of all available information from data , scientific evidence , and more reliable predictions based on that information . in the current issue of pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology ,leil et al report the application of an mcmc bayesian approach to a mechanism - based pk / pd model for prediction of cyp3a4-mediated drug interactions .these examples demonstrate that the bayesian approach to pk / pd modeling will require a shift in the approach to pk / pd modeling , with more effort being invested in identifying a biologically plausible model and in finding informative priors than in achieving parsimony .the mcmc bayesian approach currently represents the most robust and statistically rigorous manner in which to make use of prior knowledge to develop nlme pk / pd models that can be used to improve decision making in biomedical research and development .","answer":"mechanism - based pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic models have a fundamental basis in biology and pharmacology and , thus , are useful for hypothesis generation and extrapolation beyond the conditions of the original analysis data .  the complexity of these models necessitates the incorporation of prior knowledge to inform many of the model parameters .  markov chain monte carlo bayesian estimation offers a robust and statistically rigorous approach for incorporation of prior information into mechanism - based models .  this article provides a perspective on the utility of this approach ."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI. Text: Influenza like-illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infections can be caused by several types of respiratory viruses or bacteria in humans [1] . Influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial viruses (RSV) and Parainfluenza viruses are identified as major viruses mostly responsible for ILI and pneumonia in several studies [2] . However practitioners cannot diagnose the infection without a biological test confirmation. Unfortunately, these infections causes are identified in less than 50% [3] . Réunion Island, a French overseas territory with 850,000 inhabitants, is located in the southern hemisphere between Madagascar and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean (Latitude: 21°05.2920 S Longitude: 55°36.4380 E.). The island benefits from a healthcare system similar to mainland France and epidemiological surveillance has been developed by the regional office of the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Cire OI), based on the surveillance system of mainland France [4] . Influenza activity generally increases during austral winter, corresponding to summer in Europe [5] . Since 2011, influenza vaccination campaign in Reunion Island starts in April and the vaccine used corresponds to World Health Organization recommendations for the southern hemisphere. Since 1996, clinical and biological influenza surveillance has been based on a sentinel practitioner's network [6] . In 2014, this network was composed of 58 general practitioners (GPs) spread over the island and represented around 7% of all Réunion Island GPs. Nasal swabs are randomly collected all along the year and are tested by RT-PCR for influenza viruses. Among these surveillance samples, 40 to 50% are tested positive for influenza A virus, A(H1N1)pdm09 or B virus by the virological laboratory of the University Hospital Center of Réunion. Thus ILI samples tested negative for influenza are of unknown etiology. Several biological tools allow identifying respiratory pathogens from nasal swab. In recent years, multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been developed to identify several viruses simultaneously [7] [8] [9] [10] . We therefore used this new method to set up a retrospective study using swabs collected by sentinel GPs from 2011 to 2012. The main objective of our study was to characterize respiratory pathogens responsible for ILI consultations in sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. Secondary objectives were to highlight seasonal trends on respiratory pathogens circulation and to describe occurrence of co-infections, especially during the flu season. ILI was defined as a sudden onset of fever more than 38 degrees Celsius and cough, associated or not with other symptoms such as breathing difficulty, headache, etc. Every week, all GPs of the sentinel network were encouraged to collect a nasal swab from the first two patients who presented ILI since less than three days. After being tested for influenza viruses, the 994 swabs collected in 2011 and 2012 are frozen at -80°C at the university hospital center (CHU) laboratory. Based on the budget, a season-stratified sample of 250 swabs was randomly selected in order to describe circulating viruses including outside flu season. Random sampling was performed with Excel 1 using the anonymized surveillance database of the Cire OI. The sampling frame contained identification number of swab assigned by Cire OI, laboratory identification number, sex, age, date of onset of symptoms, date of swab collection and result of influenza RT-PCR. We used Respifinder 1 Smart 22 kits a multiplex RT-PCR (PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands) which can detect 22 respiratory pathogens. This assay is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology. The reverse transcription and preamplification steps were performed on the epgradient Mastercycler 1 (Eppendorf) and the hybridization, ligation and detection steps on the LightCycler 1 480 system (Roche Applied Science). This method was chosen because of its high specificity, compared to other same methods (78% versus 33%) [3, 11] . Multiplex analysis allows for rapid production of diagnostic results. It thus allows highlighted the possible presence of eighteen respiratory viruses and four bacteria in one reaction by melt curve analysis: Influenza A not (H1N1 Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 1 and Excel 1 . Two seasons were defined to identify possible seasonal trends in circulation of the viruses: winter season during weeks 23 to 39 between June and September and summer season during the rest of the year. Data and swabs result from a surveillance system that received regulatory approvals, including the CNIL (National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties Number 1592205) approval in July 2012. All the patients have received oral information and gave their consent for swab and data collection. Data were collected for surveillance purpose and are totally anonymous. Among the 250 randomly-selected swabs, 26 were not available anymore as they were sent to Influenza Reference Center for confirmation and characterization of the pathogenic agent. According to the sensitivity of the assay two samples could be discordant results between Influenza PCR initially realized and Multiplex PCR. Thus they were deleted from the analysis: one is positive for Influenza in singleplex and negative for all tested pathogens in multiplex and one is positive for Influenza in singleplex and positive for PIV2 in multiplex. In total, 222 analyses were considered. Moreover, 53 samples were negative for all analyzed respiratory pathogens (23.9%) and 169 samples had at least one detected pathogen (76.1%), finally a total of 178 pathogens was identified. During the study period, a minority of the weeks (21 i.e. 20%) did not include any sampled swab, mainly outside flu season. Patients' sex-ratio was 0.63 (86 men and 136 women) and mean age was 28.4 years [min 0; max 81]. Ten percent had less than 5 years, 24% 5-15 years, 63% 15-65 years and only 3% were 65 and older. The respiratory pathogens most frequently identified in ILI swabs were rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A not H1N1 (21.2%) and influenza B (12.6%)  ( Table 1) . Among the 22 respiratory pathogens tested by the multiplex, only three were not found in any analyzed sample: Parainfluenza3, Legionella pneumophila and Bordetella pertussis. Regarding co-infections, nine swabs revealed the presence of two viruses, among which6 involved influenza viruses (Table 2) . Analyses showed that some viruses are possibly seasonal and were circulating during a specific period of the year. They are detected only in summer for Human Metapneumovirus, RSV A and B, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. For the latter, it is specific to the studied period since the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus reappeared in Réunion Island in October 2012 and was no longer circulating since late 2010. On the opposite, Parainfluenza 1,2 and 4 viruses were identified only in winter. For other pathogens, no specific period of detection was observed. A weekly description of samples was realized to study the distribution of respiratory pathogens in 2011 and 2012 (Fig 1) . Results of biological analyses were compared with data of ILI consultations declared by sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. We observed in 2011, after a first wave in June mainly due to influenza A not H1N1 virus, a second wave of ILI consultations with mainly identification of Parainfluenza viruses and not influenza viruses. In 2012, the second epidemic wave at the end of austral winter coincided with Influenza viruses and Rhinovirus circulation. Regarding negative swabs (Fig 2) , we observed no seasonality during the study period with a similar proportion whatever the season. This retrospective study based on a sentinel GPs network showed that not only influenza viruses are responsible for ILI consultations. Indeed, an important circulation of multiple pathogens was observed throughout the year, with 12 different types of pathogens identified in 2011 and 2012. Respiratory viral pathogens were present in 76.1% of samples, which is largely above results from annual influenza surveillance [12] . After influenza viruses, Rhinovirus and Coronavirus were the most common respiratory viruses in Réunion Island. Although samples were not taken every week, sample was representative of ILI activity and consistent with flu season. Nevertheless, according to the low number of samples, it is difficult to conclude about seasonality. However in our study, RSV was circulating in summer season which is hot and rainy, which is confirmed by other studies in tropical region [13] . This study also highlighted several co-infections, showing that concomitant the multiple etiology of ILI. Co-circulation was already observed in Réunion Island during the A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic in addition to influenza virus, with identification of other respiratory viruses such as Rhinovirus or Coronavirus [14] . In mainland France, during this pandemic, circulation of major respiratory viruses was found, such as Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, Coronavirus, Human Metapneumovirus, like in our publication [15] [16] . In our study, only 5.3% of positive swabs were co-infections whereas in two studies in Madagascar co-infections represented 27.3% and 29.4% [17] [18] . Despite the distance of 9,300 km between Réunion and France, the island is directly connected to Europe with four daily flights to France. These exchanges can impact respiratory pathogens circulation in southern and northern hemisphere. Results of this study can therefore be of interest to both Indian Ocean and Europe countries. Among the 148 swabs initially negative for influenza because not previously tested for any other viruses, the study found an etiology for 95 swabs. In total, only 53 swabs, representing 24% of the sample, remained without etiology with negative multiplex PCR results all along the year. Multiple hypotheses can explain this result: a poor quality of swabs, preventing from identifying a pathogen, noninfectious causes or other pathogens not included in the multiplex PCR. However, we couldn't test the negative swabs for RNAse P, a marker of human cells, which could provide a modicum of assurance that the swab contained human cells. Concerning the two samples divergent for influenza identification between the multiplex and singleplex PCR, we discarded them for the analysis; one was positive in Influenza with singleplex and positive in PIV with multiplex. It could be a false positive result from singleplex. Indeed, as the multiplex PCR assay has a good sensitivity and is considered as a gold-standard, we decided to keep seven negative results for Influenza in singleplex and positive in Influenza in multiplex [7] [8] [9] [10] . No case of Bordetella pertussis which causes whooping cough and Legionella pneumophila which causes Legionnaires' disease was identified in this study. However, these diseases are rare in Réunion Island, around three cases of Legionnaires' disease are declared each year. A limit of the study is that no clinical data were available in the virological surveillance system of influenza in Réunion Island. It was impossible to compare clinical symptoms according to each pathogen and to know if there are different pathogens which cause for instance rhinitis, laryngitis or bronchitis (diseases included in ILI). A specific prospective study including clinical data might provide useful elements in the semiotics of diseases. In conclusion, this study highlighted an important circulation of multiple pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI is not specific to influenza and so it is essential to have biological results in order to establish the differential diagnosis and thus explain the etiology of symptoms. For a better understanding of respiratory pathogens circulating in Réunion Island, information from this study may also be useful to practitioners who see many patients in consultation with ILI. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy in the ILI surveillance and allowed to highlight the circulation of other viruses and bacterial causes of respiratory infections, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI. Moreover, it would be interesting to repeat this study every 3 or 5 years adding clinical data to monitor the evolution of respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island over time.Question: Which were the most frequently identified respiratory pathogens?","answer":"rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A not H1N1 (21.2%) and influenza B (12.6%)"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Implications for a possible role of tumor cell/host TGF-beta interactions in human breast cancer progression. TGF-beta effects on angiogenesis, stroma formation, and immune function suggest its possible involvement in tumor progression. This hypothesis was tested using the 2G7 IgG2b, which neutralizes TGF-beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3, and the MDA-231 human breast cancer cell line. Inoculation of these cells in athymic mice decreases mouse spleen natural killer (NK) cell activity. Intraperitoneal injections of 2G7 starting 1 d after intraperitoneal inoculation of tumor cells suppressed intraabdominal tumor and lung metastases, whereas the nonneutralizing anti-TGF-beta 12H5 IgG2a had no effect. 2G7 transiently inhibited growth of established MDA-231 subcutaneous tumors. Histologically, both 2G7-treated and control tumors were identical. Intraperitoneal administration of 2G7 resulted in a marked increase in mouse spleen NK cell activity. 2G7 did not inhibit MDA-231 primary tumor or metastases formation, nor did it stimulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in beige NK-deficient nude mice. Finally, serum-free conditioned medium from MDA-231 cells inhibited the NK cell activity of human blood lymphocytes. This inhibition was blocked by the neutralizing anti-TGF-beta 2G7 antibody but not by a nonspecific IgG2. These data support a possible role for tumor cell TGF-beta in the progression of mammary carcinomas by suppressing host immune surveillance.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"metastases\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"intraabdominal tumor\\", \\"Intraperitoneal\\", \\"NK cell\\", \\"intraperitoneal\\", \\"stroma\\", \\"breast cancer cell line\\", \\"tumor cell\\", \\"blood lymphocytes\\", \\"lung metastases\\", \\"breast cancer cell\\", \\"tumor cells\\", \\"MDA-231 cells\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"mammary carcinomas\\", \\"spleen NK cell\\", \\"MDA-231 subcutaneous tumors\\", \\"MDA-231 primary tumor\\", \\"spleen natural killer (NK) cell\\", \\"breast cancer\\", \\"serum\\", \\"MDA-231\\", \\"cells\\", \\"spleen natural killer cell\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Solving it requires (a) determining a location to place an object in the scene and (b) determining its appearance at the location. Such an object insertion model can potentially facilitate numerous image editing and scene parsing applications. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable neural network for the task of inserting an object instance mask of a specified class into the semantic label map of an image. Our network consists of two generative modules where one determines where the inserted object mask should be (i.e., location and scale) and the other determines what the object mask shape (and pose) should look like. The two modules are connected together via a spatial transformation network and jointly trained. We devise a learning procedure that leverage both supervised and unsupervised data and show our model can insert an object at diverse locations with various appearances. We conduct extensive experimental validations with comparisons to strong baselines to verify the effectiveness of the proposed network.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We present an unsupervised visual feature learning algorithm driven by context-based pixel prediction. By analogy with auto-encoders, we propose Context Encoders -- a convolutional neural network trained to generate the contents of an arbitrary image region conditioned on its surroundings. In order to succeed at this task, context encoders need to both understand the content of the entire image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for the missing part(s). When training context encoders, we have experimented with both a standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an adversarial loss. The latter produces much sharper results because it can better handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context encoder learns a representation that captures not just appearance but also the semantics of visual structures. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, context encoders can be used for semantic inpainting tasks, either stand-alone or as initialization for non-parametric methods.[2]: In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.[3]: Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X → Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y → X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push F(G(X)) ≈ X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.[4]: State-of-the-art pedestrian detection models have achieved great success in many benchmarks. However, these models require lots of annotation information and the labeling process usually takes much time and efforts. In this paper, we propose a method to generate labeled pedestrian data and adapt them to support the training of pedestrian detectors. The proposed framework is built on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple discriminators, trying to synthesize realistic pedestrians and learn the background context simultaneously. To handle the pedestrians of different sizes, we adopt the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer in the discriminator. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that our framework can smoothly synthesize pedestrians on background images of variations and different levels of details. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, we add the generated samples into training data of the baseline pedestrian detectors and show the synthetic images are able to improve the detectors' performance.[5]: Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims at learning a joint distribution of images in different domains by using images from the marginal distributions in individual domains. Since there exists an infinite set of joint distributions that can arrive the given marginal distributions, one could infer nothing about the joint distribution from the marginal distributions without additional assumptions. To address the problem, we make a shared-latent space assumption and propose an unsupervised image-to-image translation framework based on Coupled GANs. We compare the proposed framework with competing approaches and present high quality image translation results on various challenging unsupervised image translation tasks, including street scene image translation, animal image translation, and face image translation. We also apply the proposed framework to domain adaptation and achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Code and additional results are available in this https URL .[6]: Collecting well-annotated image datasets to train modern machine learning algorithms is prohibitively expensive for many tasks. One appealing alternative is rendering synthetic data where ground-truth annotations are generated automatically. Unfortunately, models trained purely on rendered images often fail to generalize to real images. To address this shortcoming, prior work introduced unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms that attempt to map representations between the two domains or learn to extract features that are domain-invariant. In this work, we present a new approach that learns, in an unsupervised manner, a transformation in the pixel space from one domain to the other. Our generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method adapts source-domain images to appear as if drawn from the target domain. Our approach not only produces plausible samples, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art on a number of unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate that the adaptation process generalizes to object classes unseen during training.[7]: With recent progress in graphics, it has become more tractable to train models on synthetic images, potentially avoiding the need for expensive annotations. However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulator's output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze dataset without any labeled real data.[8]: We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.[9]: In this paper, we propose an effective face completion algorithm using a deep generative model. Different from well-studied background completion, the face completion task is more challenging as it often requires to generate semantically new pixels for the missing key components (e.g., eyes and mouths) that contain large appearance variations. Unlike existing nonparametric algorithms that search for patches to synthesize, our algorithm directly generates contents for missing regions based on a neural network. The model is trained with a combination of a reconstruction loss, two adversarial losses and a semantic parsing loss, which ensures pixel faithfulness and local-global contents consistency. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that our model is able to deal with a large area of missing pixels in arbitrary shapes and generate realistic face completion results.[10]: Many image-to-image translation problems are ambiguous, as a single input image may correspond to multiple possible outputs. In this work, we aim to model a of possible outputs in a conditional generative modeling setting. The ambiguity of the mapping is distilled in a low-dimensional latent vector, which can be randomly sampled at test time. A generator learns to map the given input, combined with this latent code, to the output. We explicitly encourage the connection between output and the latent code to be invertible. This helps prevent a many-to-one mapping from the latent code to the output during training, also known as the problem of mode collapse, and produces more diverse results. We explore several variants of this approach by employing different training objectives, network architectures, and methods of injecting the latent code. Our proposed method encourages bijective consistency between the latent encoding and output modes. We present a systematic comparison of our method and other variants on both perceptual realism and diversity.[11]: Unsupervised image-to-image translation is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. Given an image in the source domain, the goal is to learn the conditional distribution of corresponding images in the target domain, without seeing any pairs of corresponding images. While this conditional distribution is inherently multimodal, existing approaches make an overly simplified assumption, modeling it as a deterministic one-to-one mapping. As a result, they fail to generate diverse outputs from a given source domain image. To address this limitation, we propose a Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-image Translation (MUNIT) framework. We assume that the image representation can be decomposed into a content code that is domain-invariant, and a style code that captures domain-specific properties. To translate an image to another domain, we recombine its content code with a random style code sampled from the style space of the target domain. We analyze the proposed framework and establish several theoretical results. Extensive experiments with comparisons to the state-of-the-art approaches further demonstrates the advantage of the proposed framework. Moreover, our framework allows users to control the style of translation outputs by providing an example style image. Code and pretrained models are available at this https URL[12]: Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing textto- image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256.256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.[13]: We study the problem of transferring a sample in one domain to an analog sample in another domain. Given two related domains, S and T, we would like to learn a generative function G that maps an input sample from S to the domain T, such that the output of a given function f, which accepts inputs in either domains, would remain unchanged. Other than the function f, the training data is unsupervised and consist of a set of samples from each domain. The Domain Transfer Network (DTN) we present employs a compound loss function that includes a multiclass GAN loss, an f-constancy component, and a regularizing component that encourages G to map samples from T to themselves. We apply our method to visual domains including digits and face images and demonstrate its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities, while preserving their identity.[14]: We present a new method for synthesizing high-resolution photo-realistic images from semantic label maps using conditional generative adversarial networks (conditional GANs). Conditional GANs have enabled a variety of applications, but the results are often limited to low-resolution and still far from realistic. In this work, we generate 2048 A— 1024 visually appealing results with a novel adversarial loss, as well as new multi-scale generator and discriminator architectures. Furthermore, we extend our framework to interactive visual manipulation with two additional features. First, we incorporate object instance segmentation information, which enables object manipulations such as removing adding objects and changing the object category. Second, we propose a method to generate diverse results given the same input, allowing users to edit the object appearance interactively. Human opinion studies demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, advancing both the quality and the resolution of deep image synthesis and editing.[15]: We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.[16]: We propose coupled generative adversarial network (CoGAN) for learning a joint distribution of multi-domain images. In contrast to the existing approaches, which require tuples of corresponding images in different domains in the training set, CoGAN can learn a joint distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. It can learn a joint distribution with just samples drawn from the marginal distributions. This is achieved by enforcing a weight-sharing constraint that limits the network capacity and favors a joint distribution solution over a product of marginal distributions one. We apply CoGAN to several joint distribution learning tasks, including learning a joint distribution of color and depth images, and learning a joint distribution of face images with different attributes. For each task it successfully learns the joint distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. We also demonstrate its applications to domain adaptation and image transformation.","answer":"Object generation based on GANs has been studied extensively [6] [11] [8] [10]5 [5] [16] [2] [7] [13] [14] [12] [3] [10] .

However, genome-wide studies reveal that steroid receptors-binding sites are mainly located at intragenic regions. To determine the role of these sites, we examined the effect of progestins on the transcription of the bcl-x gene, where only intragenic progesterone receptor-binding sites (PRbs) were identified. We found that in response to hormone treatment, the PR is recruited to these sites along with two histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and GCN5, leading to an increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation and to the binding of the SWI/SNF complex. Concomitant, a more relaxed chromatin was detected along bcl-x gene mainly in the regions surrounding the intragenic PRbs. PR also mediated the recruitment of the positive elongation factor pTEFb, favoring RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation activity. Together these events promoted the re-distribution of the active Pol II toward the 3'-end of the gene and a decrease in the ratio between proximal and distal transcription. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which PR regulates gene expression by facilitating the proper passage of the polymerase along hormone-dependent genes.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"steroid\\", \\"Progesterone\\", \\"progesterone\\", \\"Steroid\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Progesterone receptor\\", \\"SWI/SNF complex\\", \\"CBP\\", \\"histone H3\\", \\"bcl-x\\", \\"RNA polymerase II\\", \\"Steroid receptors\\", \\"intragenic binding sites\\", \\"H4\\", \\"pTEFb\\", \\"PRbs\\", \\"GCN5\\", \\"intragenic progesterone receptor-binding sites\\", \\"Pol II\\", \\"polymerase\\", \\"steroid receptors-binding sites\\", \\"PR\\", \\"positive elongation factor\\", \\"histone acetyltransferases\\", \\"CREB-binding protein\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

ALI is a recessive condition with a geographical north-south gradient characterised by decreased levels of intestinal lactase.Considerations include recognizing that a substantial proportion of the world's adult population (65%-70%) exhibits lactase nonpersistence, a reduced ability to metabolize lactose to glucose and galactose.Four clinical subtypes of lactose intolerance may be distinguished, namely lactase deficiency in premature infants, congenital lactase deficiency, adult-type hypolactasia and secondary lactase intolerance.Lactose intolerance (LI) is characterized by the presence of primarily gastrointestinal clinical signs resulting from colonic fermentation of lactose, the absorption of which is impaired due to a deficiency in the lactase enzyme. These clinical signs can be modified by several factors, including lactose dose, residual lactase expression, concurrent ingestion of other dietary components, gut-transit time, and enteric microbiome composition.","answer":"Lactase deficiency"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Heterozygous germ-line mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type-II receptor (BMPR-II) gene underlie heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH). Although inflammation promotes PAH, the mechanisms by which inflammation and BMPR-II dysfunction conspire to cause disease remain unknown. Here we identify that tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) selectively reduces BMPR-II transcription and mediates post-translational BMPR-II cleavage via the sheddases, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). TNFα-mediated suppression of BMPR-II subverts BMP signalling, leading to BMP6-mediated PASMC proliferation via preferential activation of an ALK2/ACTR-IIA signalling axis. Furthermore, TNFα, via SRC family kinases, increases pro-proliferative NOTCH2 signalling in HPAH PASMCs with reduced BMPR-II expression. We confirm this signalling switch in rodent models of PAH and demonstrate that anti-TNFα immunotherapy reverses disease progression, restoring normal BMP/NOTCH signalling. Collectively, these findings identify mechanisms by which BMP and TNFα signalling contribute to disease, and suggest a tractable approach for therapeutic intervention in PAH.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"ALK2\\", \\"bone morphogenetic protein type-II receptor\\", \\"SRC family kinases\\", \\"ADAM10\\", \\"ACTR-IIA\\", \\"tumour necrosis factor-u03b1\\", \\"NOTCH2\\", \\"ADAM17\\", \\"NOTCH\\", \\"BMP\\", \\"TNFu03b1\\", \\"BMPR-II\\", \\"BMP type-II receptor\\", \\"BMP6\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinomas is well standardized and the use of radioiodine represents an essential step; in contrast, there is no standardized therapeutic approach for anaplastic tumors and their prognosis is poor. The resistance of anaplastic thyroid cancer to radioiodine treatment is principally due to the absence of expression of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS), mainly due to epigenetic silencing. The acetylation status of histones is involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression and is usually disrupted in advanced thyroid cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibitors have been demonstrated as potent anticancer drugs with several different effects on cell viability and differentiation. Methods: Stabilized anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines (BHT-101 and CAL-62) and primary cultures from patients who underwent thyroidectomy for anaplastic thyroid cancer were treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589. After treatment, we evaluated the expression and function of NIS. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time PCR (RT-PCR); NIS promoter activity was determined with a luciferase reporter assay; and protein expression was assessed through immunofluorescence. We tested the protein function by 125I uptake and efflux experiments; finally the cytotoxic effect of 131I was determined with a clonogenic assay. Results: Our results demonstrate that treatment with LBH589 leads to NIS RNA expression as shown by RT-PCR and luciferase assay, and to protein expression as determined by immunofluorescence in vitro and by immunohistochemistry in xenograft tumors. Moreover, 125I uptake and efflux experiments show the correct protein function and iodine retention, that translate into cytotoxicity effects, as demonstrated by a clonogenic assay with 131I . Conclusions: This study supplies a new potential strategy for the treatment of ATC by modifying gene expression with the aim of inducing responsiveness towards radioiodine therapy.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"sodium iodide\\", \\"SODIUM IODIDE\\", \\"radioiodine\\", \\"iodine\\", \\"LBH589\\", \\"u00b9u00b3u00b9I\\", \\"131I\\", \\"125I\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"sodium iodide symporter\\", \\"NIS promoter\\", \\"histones\\", \\"SODIUM IODIDE SYMPORTER\\", \\"histone deacetylase\\", \\"HISTONE DEACETYLASE\\", \\"NIS\\", \\"Histone deacetylase\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

The current reference test is reverse transcriptase PCR. Many studies have reported high sensitivities of CT scans and suggested that they can be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 alongside reverse transcriptase PCR. The current data about CT scans are highly variable and incoherent. Therefore, new multicentric studies in different countries are needed to better understand the role of CT scans in COVID-19 diagnosis. In this report, we will discuss the clinical relevance of each test and the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American College of Radiology recommendations regarding the use of imaging in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","answer":"[\\"Diagnosis\\"]"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Inproposed method, original features are fed into semi-FFNN structure to map features into new feature space, and then outputs of this intelligent mapping structure are classified by minimum distance classifier via cross-validation technique. Ineach generation, weights and biases of semi-FFNN structure are updated by GA and correct recognition rate (or error recognition rate) is evaluated.In the rest of this paper, overview of minimum distance classifier, Feed-Forward Neural Network structure and Genetic Algorithm are described in sections2, 3and 4, respectively. Insection 5, proposed method and its mathematical consideration are presented. Experimentalresults, comparison between proposed method and other feature combinations and classifiers using the same database are discussed in section 6.

Additional ASO modifications with enhanced RNA affinity and a signature 2′,4′-bridged nucleic acid (BNA) sugar framework have been found to exhibit promising properties for antisense applications (Figure 1). Among them, locked nucleic acid (LNA 15,6) constitutes the basic representative and recent research has demonstrated that ASOs carrying locked nucleotides allow modulation of gene expression via a variety of mechanisms.7–9</p><p>As part of a comprehensive program aimed at elucidating the structure activity relationships (SAR) of gapmer ASOs containing high affinity modifications,10–15 we combined the LNA modification with a methyl substitution at the 5′-position of the bicyclic sugar.14 Introduction of S-5′-Me-LNA 2 residues into ASOs furnished high affinity recognition comparable to that seen with native LNA. Conversely, introduction of R-5′-Me-LNA 3 residues neutralized the gains afforded by the LNA modification and resulted in an unfavorable RNA affinity relative to native DNA. In animal experiments, gapmers with central DNA windows and S-5′-Me-LNA in their wings exhibited lower drug-induced increases in spleen weights, indicative of reduced immune stimulation, as compared to their LNA counterparts.</p><p>Recently, we also evaluated the effect of introducing a methyl group in the (R) and (S) configuration at the 5′-position of α-L-LNA 4, which also shows LNA-like high affinity recognition of complementary RNA. However, the consequences on RNA affinity were different from those observed in the β-D-LNA series with the R-5′-Me isomer 6 now displaying enhanced affinity as compared to the S-5′-Me analog 5.16</p><p>In view of the attractive antisense properties displayed by the S-5′-Me-LNA modification, and the configuration-dependent divergent effects on RNA affinity in the α-L versus the β-D series, we decided to evaluate the consequences for stability and structure of the methyl backbone modification in the context of a hexitol nucleic acid (HNA17) analog, 3′-fluoro hexitol nucleic acid (FHNA) 7. FHNA-modified ASOs (unlike those containing Ara-FHNA 8) showed comparable potency to LNA in animal trials without producing hepatotoxicity.15 Interestingly, the excellent in vivo activity observed with FHNA was achieved in the absence of elaborate fomulations to improve delivery and despite the lower RNA affinity of this modification relative to LNA.</p><p>Here we report the synthesis, biophysical evaluation and crystal structures of oligonucleotides containing S-6′-Me-FHNA 9 or R-6′-Me-FHNA 10 residues (Figure 1). The phosphoramidite T building blocks of 9 and 10 and the modified oligonucleotides were synthesized as outlined in Schemes S1 and S2 and Figure S1 (supporting information file). To establish the consequences of the two analogs for the stability of hybrids between modified DNA and RNA, we conducted UV melting experiments with duplexes containing either one or two modified nucleotides (Table 1). The S-6′-Me-FHNA-T enhances duplex thermal stability similar to FHNA-T (Figure 1). On the other hand, incorporation of R-6′-Me-FHNA-T has a destabilizing effect, amounting to ca. 4°C relative to FHNA-T.15</p><p>To understand the opposite effects on stability triggered by a methyl substituent at C6′ with R or S configuration, we studied the crystal structures of A-form decamer duplexes [d(GCGTAT*ACGC)]2 (T*=S-6′-Me-FHNA-T 13 or R-6′-Me-FHNA-T 14) with a single modified nucleotide per strand. Both crystallize in the same space group (P212121) and are isomorphous. The structure of the duplex with S-6′-Me-FHNA Ts (S-6′-Me decamer) was refined to 1.55 Å resolution and that of the duplex with R-6′-Me-FHNA Ts (R-6′-Me decamer) was refined to 1.24 Å resolution. Experimental procedures are summarized in the supporting information, selected crystal data and refinement parameters are listed in Table S1, and examples of the quality of the final electron density are depicted in Figure S2 (si file).</p><p>In both duplexes all 2′-deoxyribose sugars adopt the C3′-endo conformation, consistent with the overall RNA-like A-form conformation (Figure S3; si file). In the region of the modified residues T*6 and T*16 (nucleotides in strands 1 and 2 are numbered 1–10 and 11–20, resp.), paired strands exhibit only minimal conformational deviations (Figure S4; si file).</p><p>Inspection of the helical parameters and backbone torsion angles in the S- and R-6′-Me duplexes and comparing them to the structure of the decamer with FHNA T residues at positions 6 and 16 (Figure 2),15 reveals subtle changes in the torsion angles α (wider in S-6′-Me-FHNA and compressed in R-6′-Me-FHNA), β (expanded to pure ap in S-6′-Me-FHNA and compressed in R-6′-Me-FHNA), as well as in torsion angle ε of the preceding residues (A5 and A15; Figure 2C, arrow). However, in both 6′-Me-FHNA structures, the sugar-phosphate backbone geometries of modified residues conform to the standard sc−, ap, sc+, sc+ (60° in HNAs15,17), ap, sc− (α to ζ) genus of A-form duplexes. In both the S- and R-6′-Me decamers, residue A5 exhibits an extended backbone variant with α, β and γ in the ap conformations. In the latter duplex, this conformation is also observed for residue G13.</p><p>The most obvious difference between the methyl group in the S and R configurations at C6′ (note the different atom numberings in FHNA and LNA) in the two structures is a short 1···5 intra-nucleoside contact between C7′ (Me) and O4′ in R-6′-Me-FHNA (Figure 2B). In the S-6′-Me decamer the spacing between the methyl group and O4′ is considerably larger (Figure 2A). Apart from the aforementioned minor deviations in the torsion angles α, β and ε in the region of the modified residue (Figure 2C), there are no obvious deviations between the conformations of the R- and S-6′-Me-FHNA nucleotides and the backbone of the latter appears unable to avoid the 1···5 contact.</p><p>Because of the conformational similarities between FHNA, HNA, LNA and RNA,15 the above energetically unfavorable interaction involving O4′ (O3′ in LNA and RNA) as a result of an R-6′-Me (R-5′-Me in LNA and RNA) substituent will persist in all of these analogs as well as in A-form DNA duplexes. Even when alternative backbone conformations of DNA are considered,14 such as the above extended backbone variant with α, β and γ all in the ap range, or the tricyclo-DNA ac− (α), sc+ (β), sc+ (γ) backbone,18 an R-configured methyl group will cause energetically unfavorable interactions (Figure 3).</p><p>In addition to causing an unfavorable 1···5 backbone, contact, a 6′-methyl group (5′ in LNA and RNA) in the R configuration can also be expected to perturb the water structure around O2P phosphate oxygens (Figure 4). By comparison, the S-6′-methyl group is directed toward the minor groove (Figures 2, S3) and away from the negatively polarized environment around phosphates.</p><p>In summary, the structural data provide insight into the opposite effects on RNA affinity seen with the two 6′-Me-FHNA modifications described here and help rationalize the previous observations regarding the modulation of β-D-LNA's duplex stability as a function of the configuration of the 5′-methyl substituent.14</p><p>Supported by NIH grant R01 GM55237 (to M.E.).</p><p>          COORDINATE DEPOSITION</p><p>The PDB ID codes (http://www.rcsb.org) for the S- and R- 6′-Me decamers are 3V06 and 3V07, respectively.</p><p>          SUPPORTING INFORMATION</p><p>Materials and methods, Schemes S1 and S2, Tables S1 and S2, Figures S1–S4.

S-5xe2x80xb2-Me-LNA has high RNA affinity and modified oligonucleotides show reduced immune stimulation in vivo. Conversely, an R-5xe2x80xb2-methyl group dramatically lowers RNA affinity. To test the effects of S- and R-6xe2x80xb2-methyl groups on 3xe2x80xb2-fluoro hexitol nucleic acid (FHNA) stability, we synthesized S- and R-6xe2x80xb2-Me-FHNA thymidine and incorporated them into oligo-2xe2x80xb2-deoxynucleotides.

We take a deep convolutional neural network approach, and choose to take the angle of classification, working on a finite set of possible colors. Similarly to a recent paper, we implement a loss and a prediction function that favor realistic, colorful images rather than \\"true\\" ones. We show that a rather lightweight architecture inspired by the U-Net, and trained on a reasonable amount of pictures of landscapes, achieves satisfactory results on this specific subset of pictures. We show that data augmentation significantly improves the performance and robustness of the model, and provide visual analysis of the prediction confidence. We show an application of our model, extending the task to video colorization. We suggest a way to smooth color predictions across frames, without the need to train a recurrent network designed for sequential inputs.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We develop a fully automatic image colorization system. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep networks, exploiting both low-level and semantic representations. As many scene elements naturally appear according to multimodal color distributions, we train our model to predict per-pixel color histograms. This intermediate output can be used to automatically generate a color image, or further manipulated prior to image formation. On both fully and partially automatic colorization tasks, we outperform existing methods. We also explore colorization as a vehicle for self-supervised visual representation learning.","answer":"Actually, one promising way to perform image colorization is to be able to learn meaningful color-related representations for the images (which often involves using very deep and heavy or pretrained architecture as in [1] ) and then ensure the temporal consistency of them."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We determined whether growth state can influence the action of protein kinase C by measuring protein kinase C activity in growing and stationary cultures of normal and transformed cells. Two approaches were used to measure protein kinase C: assay of intact cells for inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding in response to phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu); and assay of detergent extracts for total calcium, phospholipid-dependent kinase activity. In extracts of growing and stationary Swiss 3T3 cells, the total amount of protein kinase C activity was similar, indicating that growth state does not alter the level of enzyme in the cell. The short-term response of Swiss 3T3 cells to an activator of protein kinase C also appeared to be independent of growth state, since the 50% effective dose for PDBu inhibition of EGF binding to its receptor was approximately 7 nM for both growth conditions. In contrast, the response of cells to long-term treatment with PDBu was significantly different depending upon the initial growth state of the cells. In both growth states, PDBu caused loss of protein kinase C activity, which reflected a loss in protein mass as determined by immunoblotting with antiserum to protein kinase C. However, the maximum decrease approached 100% in stationary cultures versus approximately 75% in growing cells. Protein kinase C levels in several transformed cell lines were subject to down modulation in a similar growth state-dependent manner. Further, the inhibition of EGF binding by tumor promoters following long-term treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with PDBu also varied with growth state. In down modulated growing cells, PDBu caused almost complete inhibition of EGF binding, whereas in down modulated stationary cells, minimal inhibition of EGF binding by PDBu was observed. These results suggest that prolonged treatment with tumor promoters alters the sensitivity of cells to activators of protein kinase C in a growth state-dependent manner.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"antiserum\\", \\"extracts\\", \\"cell\\", \\"Swiss 3T3 cells\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"cells\\", \\"cell lines\\", \\"cultures\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that combined H(1) and H(2) blockage results in improved outcomes in patients treated for acute allergic syndromes compared with treatment with H(1) blockade alone.                In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 91 adult patients with acute allergic syndromes were treated with either 50 mg of diphenhydramine and saline solution (control group) or with 50 mg of diphenhydramine and 50 mg of ranitidine (active group). These patients were treated with parenteral administration. Patients were recruited from an emergency department at an urban academic medical center. The primary endpoints were resolution of urticaria, angioedema, or erythema at 2 hours after protocol treatment. Areas of cutaneous involvement, heart rates, blood pressures, respiratory findings, and symptom scores were also assessed at baseline, 1 hour, and 2 hours.                There were significantly more patients without urticaria at 2 hours among the patients in the active group compared with those in the control group. Both groups had similar proportions of urticaria at baseline. Logistic regression models to predict resolution of urticaria, which accounted for baseline urticarial involvement, showed odds ratios in favor of the active group treatment. Similar findings were observed when the absence of both urticaria and angioedema was considered as the dependent variable. There was not a significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to the absence of erythema or angioedema (irrespective of the presence of urticaria) at 2 hours. Blood pressure and symptoms did not show differences between the 2 groups over time. Lower heart rates were observed 1 hour after treatment in the active treatment group (mean reduction 10 beats/min) compared with those found in the placebo group (mean reduction 6 beats/min).                These data show that adding H(2) blockers to H(1) antagonists results in additional improvement of certain cutaneous outcomes for patients presenting with acute allergic syndromes. These findings favor the recommendation for using combined H(1) and H(2) antihistamines in acute allergic syndromes.Title 2:Histamine antagonists in the treatment of acute allergic reactions.Abstract 2:We compared the efficacies of cimetidine (an H2-receptor antagonist) and diphenhydramine (an H1-receptor antagonist) alone and in combination for alleviation of symptoms of acute allergic reactions. STUDY DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, patients and examiners assessed the severity of symptoms and signs of acute allergic reactions using a visual-analog scale before treatment and 30 minutes after treatment with 300 mg IV cimetidine and placebo, 50 mg IV diphenhydramine and placebo, or diphenhydramine plus cimetidine.                Thirty-nine patients with acute allergic reactions presenting to two emergency departments of teaching hospitals.                Of the 35 patients with pruritus, all 12 receiving diphenhydramine placebo had clinically significant relief compared with six of ten (60%) receiving cimetidine plus placebo (P = .03). Twelve of 13 (92%) receiving diphenhydramine plus cimetidine had relief, which was not a significant difference from the single drugs. Comparison of mean differences in pretreatment and post-treatment symptom scores (relief scores) among groups of patients with pruritus detected significantly more relief in the group receiving diphenhydramine plus placebo (80.3 +/- 7.4) than in those receiving cimetidine plus placebo (48.8 +/- 13.4) (P = .022). Of the 33 patients with urticaria, five of 11 (46%) receiving diphenhydramine plus placebo had clinically significant relief compared with eight of ten (80%) receiving cimetidine plus placebo (P = .18). Eleven of 12 patients (92%) receiving diphenhydramine plus cimetidine had relief, which is a significant difference from those receiving diphenhydramine plus placebo (P = .027). Comparison of mean relief scores in patients with urticaria detected significantly more relief in the group receiving diphenhydramine plus cimetidine (55.3 +/- 6.5) than in the group receiving diphenhydramine plus placebo (30.7 +/- 6.1) (P = .006).                For treatment of pruritus from acute allergic reactions, diphenhydramine is more effective than cimetidine, and the combination offers no additional benefit. For treatment of acute urticaria, the combination of cimetidine and diphenhydramine is more effective than diphenhydramine alone.Title 3:Famotidine in the treatment of acute urticaria.Abstract 3:Recent studies suggest that histamine H2-receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of urticaria. This study was conducted to determine whether famotidine, a H2 antagonist, is effective in the treatment of acute urticaria and compare its effect with that of the H1 antagonist diphenhydramine. In this prospective, double-blind, controlled trial, 25 patients with urticaria of less than 72 h duration were randomized to receive a single dose of either famotidine 20 mg i.m. or diphenhydramine 50 mg i.m. Prior to treatment and 30 min after treatment, patients rated pruritus and sedation using visual analogue scales, while physicians evaluated intensity of urticaria and percentage of body surface area involved by urticaria. Famotidine was found to reduce pruritus associated with acute urticaria, intensity of urticaria, and body surface area affected by urticaria without causing sedation. Famotidine was comparable to diphenhydramine in efficacy; however, there was a (nonsignificant) trend for diphenhydramine to be more effective than famotidine in the treatment of pruritus, and for famotidine to be more effective in the reduction of surface area of involvement. It is concluded that famotidine merits further investigation as a potential medication for treatment of urticaria.Title 4:Oral agents in the management of urticaria: patient perception of effectiveness and level of satisfaction with treatment.Abstract 4:Orally administered diphenhydramine, famotidine, and cromolyn sodium were compared for their abilities to alleviate symptoms of acute urticaria.                This was a prospective, randomized, blind study, implemented in the emergency departments (EDs) of two teaching hospitals, each with an annual average of 40,000 ED patient visits. Patient perception of the effectiveness of treatment was assessed using a visual analog scale.                33 adult patients presenting to the EDs were entered into the study over a one-year period. Of these, 8 were lost to follow-up and 5 were noncompliant with medications and not included in data analysis. Twenty adult patients, aged 19-78 years, completed the five-day study: 7 received diphenhydramine, 6 received famotidine, and 7 received cromolyn sodium.                Patients receiving diphenhydramine reported the greatest satisfaction with treatment: 86 percent (6/7) indicated they would use the medication again. Fifty percent (3/6) in the famotidine group and 43 percent (3/7) in the cromolyn sodium group rated the treatment as worth using again.

However, cases of this hypothetical pathogenic mechanism have never been reported. We describe a lethal form of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness( KID) syndrome caused by the reversion of the GJB2 nonsense mutation p. Tyr136X that would otherwise have confined the effect of another dominant lethal mutation, p. Gly45Glu, in the same allele. The patient's mother had the identical misssense mutation which was confined by the nonsense mutation. The biological relationship between the parents and the child was confirmed by genotyping of 15 short tandem repeat loci. Haplotype analysis using 40 SNPs spanning the >39 kbp region surrounding the GJB2 gene and an extended SNP microarray analysis spanning 83, 483 SNPs throughout chromosome 13 in the family showed that an allelic recombination event involving the maternal allele carrying the mutations generated the pathogenic allele unique to the patient, although the possibility of coincidental accumulation of spontaneous point mutations cannot be completely excluded. Previous reports and our mutation screening support that p. Gly45Glu is in complete linkage disequilibrium with p. Tyr136X in the Japanese population. Estimated from statisitics in the literature, there may be approximately 11, 000 p. Gly45Glu carriers in the Japanese population who have this second-site confining mutation, which acts as natural genetic protection from the lethal disease. The reversion-triggered onset of the disesase shown in this study is a previously unreported genetic pathogenesis based on Mendelian inheritance.Introduction:A nonsense mutation may, in theory, disrupt and thus “confine” the effects of another dominant pathogenic mutation when the two mutations coexist in the same allele of a single gene. Furthermore, in such cases, reversion of the confining nonsense mutation may paradoxically elicit a congenital disease, although proven cases of this hypothetical pathogenesis have not been reported. Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness( KID) syndrome( OMIM 148210) is a rare congenital ectodermal disorder characterized by vascularizing keratitis, ichthyosiform erythroderma and sensorineural hearing loss[1]. KID syndrome is mainly caused by a heterozygous germ line missense mutation in GJB2( Entrez Gene ID: 2706) encoding connexin 26( Cx26)( RefSeq: NM_004004. 5)[2]–[4]. Here we report a case of KID syndrome where the reversion of a missense mutation induced a lethal disease. We encountered a girl with KID syndrome from obviously healthy parents, and sequence analysis of GJB2 revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, p. Gly45Glu, in the patient. Unexpectedly, her healthy mother also had the heterozygous missense mutation p. Gly45Glu, as well as another heterozygous nonsense mutation: p. Tyr136X. From these findings, we hypothesized that the p. Tyr136X mutation confines the pathogenic effect of p. Gly45Glu in the mother and that the reversion of p. Tyr136X triggered the onset of KID syndrome in the patient. In the present study, TA cloning and haplotype analysis of the family confirmed that an allelic recombination event involving the maternal allele carrying the two mutations generated the pathogenic allele unique to the patient. Furthermore, cotransfection experiments and a neurobiotin uptake assay clearly demonstrated that the p. Tyr136X mutation confines the pathogenic effects of the p. Gly45Glu mutation. Thus, to our knowledge, the present findings provide the first evidence of reversion-triggered onset of a congenital disease.Discussion:Many cases of revertant mosaicism have been reported as “natural gene therapy” where the mitotic recombination results in revertant mutations that mitigate the disease symptoms[13]–[16]. However, the present study is the first report to demonstrate a mutant reversion triggering a genetic disease. The present data of genomic DNA sequencing and haplotype analysis demonstrate that the patient and her father share an identical haplotype( Figure 1C, shown in blue). We hypothesized that the entire blue allele in the patient's genome was derived from the father, while the other allele( Figure 1C, shown in yellow) was basically derived from the mother. It seemed, however, that this allele underwent pre-zygotic reversion during meiosis of the maternal gamete. The fact that the patient's unique allele( Figure 1C, shown in yellow) differs by three non-continuous SNPs from the unique maternal allele( Figure 1C, shown in orange) while the neighboring SNPs are conserved might be explained by multiple events of gene conversion involving both of the maternal alleles( Figure 1C, shown in blue and orange) that may have occurred in this genetic region. Double cross-over also might account for the recombination, but it is less likely, considering that the non-conserved and conserved SNPs in the patient's allele reside within close proximity( Figure 1C); the average length of the gene conversion tract is estimated to be in the range of 55–290 bp, whereas the cross-over tracts are typically longer[17]. Mitotic gene conversion has been found in some cases of revertant mosaicism in cutaneous disease, including generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa[12],[13]. We are unaware of any previous report of multiple gene conversions within a relatively short genetic segment as in the present case. However, the present data compel us to consider that it occurred. Since the patient's unique allele differs by three or more base pairs from the counterparts carried by either parent, we judge the possibility of coincidental accumulation of spontaneous point mutations at these specific SNP sites to be highly unlikely. This possibility, however, cannot be completely excluded. As evidence supporting our hypothesis, consistent with a previous report[9], we clearly demonstrated that Cx26 p. Gly45Glu colocalized with the p. Val27Ile/p. Glu114Gly variant but failed to form gap junctions( Figure 3A). Previous studies have shown that Cx26 p. Gly45Glu forms hemichannels that are aberrantly activated at low extracellular Ca2+ levels[9]. The present study used a neurobiotin uptake assay[9] to show that only the p. Gly45Glu mutant and not the p. Gly45Glu/p. Tyr136X mutant induces the aberrant uptake( Figure 3B). These results taken together support the model in which the p. Tyr136X mutation confines the dominant gain-of-function effect of the p. Gly45Glu mutation to prevent the onset of the disease( Figure 4). Such secondary effects of revertants may pose a challenge in genetic analyses of extended genes or more than one gene with functional interactions. Interestingly, in the group of Japanese patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, it is not uncommon to find GJB2 p. Gly45Glu carriers, but none of them are affected by KID syndrome[5]. They uniformly have a tandem p. Tyr136X mutation, as in the mother of the present case[5]. Thus, we hypothesized that, in the Japanese population, carriers of p. Gly45Glu are protected from the lethal form of KID syndrome by the tandem, confining mutation p. Tyr136X. To clarify the frequency of the p. Gly45Glu mutation in the entire Japanese population, we performed screening analysis for the two mutations p. Gly45Glu and p. Tyr136X in a normal control group consisting of 920 overall healthy Japanese individuals( 1, 840 alleles). Neither p. Gly45Glu nor p. Tyr136X was found in any of the 1, 840 alleles( data not shown). Tsukada et al.[5] also reported that neither p. Gly45Glu nor p. Tyr136X was found in 252 Japanese healthy control individuals( 504 control Japanese alleles). These results indicate that the alleles with tandem p. Gly45Glu and p. Tyr136X mutations are infrequent in the general Japanese population. However, in the epidemiological statistics of Tsukada et al.[5], we found screening data for GJB2 mutations in Japanese patients with sensorineural hearing loss. The report revealed that, among 1, 343 Japanese patients with hearing loss, 33 patients had one or two p. Gly45Glu alleles( 34 p. Gly45Glu alleles in 2686 alleles for an allele frequency of 1. 27%; 33 carriers in 1, 343 patients for a carrier rate of 2. 46%). This means 2. 46% of Japanese patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss have one or two p. Gly45Glu alleles. As for the prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss, it was reported that 3. 5 per 1, 000 individuals in the entire population have bilateral sensorineural hearing loss[18]. Thus, calculating from these epidemiological statistics, we estimate that 8. 6 per 100, 000 individuals, or approximately 11, 000 individuals in the entire Japanese population, have one or two p. Gly45Glu alleles. However, no patient with the lethal form of KID syndrome due to p. Gly45Glu has been reported in the Japanese population as far as we know, although the mutation p. Gly45Glu has been reported as a cause of the lethal form of KID syndrome in several European patients[3],[19]–[22]. Tsukada et al.[5] reported that all 34 alleles with p. Gly45Glu found in the Japanese patients with sensorineural hearing loss also had p. Tyr136X, suggesting that p. Gly45Glu is in complete linkage disequillibrium with p. Tyr136X in the Japanese population. In our mutation screening, no allele carrying either or both mutations, p. Gly45Glu and p. Tyr136X, was found in 920 Japanese individuals( 1, 840 alleles) and these results support the idea that p. Gly45Glu is in complete LD with p. Tyr136X in the Japanese population. In light of this, we conclude that, even though individuals may have the dominant lethal mutation p. Gly45Glu, the confining mutation p. Tyr136X in cis configuration protects against the disease, KID syndrome, in the approximately 11, 000 Japanese individuals in the entire Japanese population who harbor p. Gly45Glu. The allele with the tandem mutations p. Gly45Glu and p. Tyr136X causes hearing loss in an autosomal recessive manner. Most carriers of the tandem mutations in the Japanese population are heterozygous for the allele, such as the patient's mother in the present study, and are not affected with hearling loss. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the second-site confining mutation is an imporatant genetic protection mechanism, and its loss, like the opening of Pandora's box, is a novel genetic pathogenesis that releases the hidden genetic disease.","answer":"Loss of gene functions due to nonsense mutations is a typical pathogenic mechanism of hereditary diseases .

Some architectures incorporate methods to reduce RNN state updates, therefore allowing the network to preserve memory over long temporal intervals. To address these problems of convergence, this paper proposes a timing-gated LSTM RNN model, called the Gaussian-gated LSTM (g-LSTM). The time gate controls when a neuron can be updated during training, enabling longer memory persistence and better error-gradient flow. This model captures long-temporal dependencies better than an LSTM and the time gate parameters can be learned even from non-optimal initialization values. Because the time gate limits the updates of the neuron state, the number of computes needed for the network update is also reduced. By adding a computational budget term to the training loss, we can obtain a network which further reduces the number of computes by at least 10x. Finally, by employing a temporal curriculum learning schedule for the g-LSTM, we can reduce the convergence time of the equivalent LSTM network on long sequences.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Despite recent advances in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), capturing long-term dependencies in sequences remains a fundamental challenge. Most approaches use backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is difficult to scale to very long sequences. This paper proposes a simple method that improves the ability to capture long term dependencies in RNNs by adding an unsupervised auxiliary loss to the original objective. This auxiliary loss forces RNNs to either reconstruct previous events or predict next events in a sequence, making truncated backpropagation feasible for long sequences and also improving full BPTT. We evaluate our method on a variety of settings, including pixel-by-pixel image classification with sequence lengths up to 16 ,000, and a real document classification benchmark. Our results highlight good performance and resource efficiency of this approach over competitive baselines, including other recurrent models and a comparable sized Transformer. Further analyses reveal beneficial effects of the auxiliary loss on optimization and regularization, as well as extreme cases where there is little to no backpropagation.[2]: The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is an extremely powerful sequence model that is often difficult to train. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a specific RNN architecture whose design makes it much easier to train. While wildly successful in practice, the LSTM's architecture appears to be ad-hoc so it is not clear if it is optimal, and the significance of its individual components is unclear. In this work, we aim to determine whether the LSTM architecture is optimal or whether much better architectures exist. We conducted a thorough architecture search where we evaluated over ten thousand different RNN architectures, and identified an architecture that outperforms both the LSTM and the recently-introduced Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) on some but not all tasks. We found that adding a bias of 1 to the LSTM's forget gate closes the gap between the LSTM and the GRU.","answer":"There have been a multitude of proposed methods to improve the training of RNNs, especially for long sequences. Apart from incorporating additional gating structures, for example the LSTM and the GRU , more recently various techniques were proposed to further increase the capabilities of recurrent networks to learn on sequences of length over 1000. Proposed initialization techniques such as the orthogonal initialization of kernel matrices , of the biases , and diagonal recurrent kernel matrices ( [2] ) have demonstrated success. [1] propose using truncated backpropagation with an additional auxiliary loss to reconstruct previous events."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The unambiguous identification of a crossover event within hemochromatosis families is very difficult; it is particularly hampered by the variability of the phenotypic expression as well as by the sex- and age-related penetrance of the disease. For these practical considerations, traditional linkage analysis could prove of limited value in further refining the extrapolated physical position of HFE. We therefore embarked upon a linkage-disequilibrium analysis of HFE and normal chromosomes from the Brittany population. In the present report, 66 hemochromatosis families yielding 151 hemochromatosis chromosomes and 182 normal chromosomes were RFLP-typed with a battery of probes, including two newly derived polymorphic markers from the 6. 7 and HLA-F loci located 150 and 250 kb telomeric to HLA-A, respectively. The results suggest a strong peak of existing linkage disequilibrium focused within the i82-to-6. 7 interval (approximately 250 kb). The zone of linkage disequilibrium is flanked by the i97 locus, positioned 30 kb proximal to i82, and the HLA-F gene, found 250 kb distal to HLA-A, markers of which display no significant association with HFE. These data support the possibility that HFE resides within the 400-kb expanse of DNA between i97 and HLA-F. Alternatively, the very tight association of HLA-A3 and allele 1 of the 6. 7 locus, both of which are comprised by the major ancestral or founder HFE haplotype in Brittany, supports the possibility that the disease gene may reside immediately telomeric to the 6. 7 locus within the linkage-disequilibrium zone. Additionally, hemochromatosis haplotypes possessing HLA-A11 and the low-frequency HLA-F polymorphism (allele 2) are supportive of a separate founder chromosome containing a second, independently arising mutant allele. Overall, the establishment of a likely \\" hemochromatosis critical region \\" centromeric boundary and the identification of a linkage-disequilibrium zone both significantly contribute to a reduction in the amount of DNA required to be searched for novel coding sequences constituting the HFE defect","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"HFE defect\\", \\"hemochromatosis\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

HANDLING LINGUISTIC PREFERENCES 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  A multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm incorporating preference information interactively is proposed. A new nine grade evaluation method is used to quantify the linguistic preferences expressed by the decision maker (DM) so as to reduce his/her cognitive overload. When comparing individuals, the classical Pareto dominance relation is commonly used, but it has difficulty in dealing with problems involving large numbers of objectives in which it gives an unmanageable and large set of Pareto optimal solutions. In order to overcome this limitation, a new outranking relation called \\"strength superior\\" which is based on the preference information is constructed via a fuzzy inference system to help the algorithm find a few solutions located in the preferred regions, and the graphical user interface is used to realize the interaction between the DM and the algorithm. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed theoretically, and its ability to handle preference information is validated through simulation. The influence of parameters on the performance of the algorithm is discussed and comparisons to another preference guided multi-objective evolutionary algorithm indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective in solving high dimensional optimization problems.Literature Review:","answer":"Usually, a human DM is more likely to provide qualitative preferences rather than quantitative preferences. In view of this fact, fuzzy logic is an appropriate tool to handle the linguistic preferences of humans. It can convert fuzzy preferences into quantitative information as it does in BIB002 ,  , and BIB001 . Fuzzy logic or fuzzy inference systems for the purpose of preference extraction and transformation deserve further investigation."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

These include AZD0837, betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, and LY517717.Most are small synthetic molecules that target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, YM150).They must be modified and standardized for the measurement of direct FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban and others).Betrixaban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor administered once daily, mostly excreted unchanged in the bile and with low (17%) renal excretion.These newer agents directly target specific steps in coagulation cascade and include newer low molecular weight heparins (adomiparin), ultra low molecular weight heparins (semuloparin, RO-14), inhibitors of activated factor II (dabigatran, AZD0837), X (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), IX (REG1,2), XI (antisense oligonucleotides, BMS 262084, clavatadine A), VII/tissue factor (tifacogin, PCI 274836, and BMS 593214), V (recomodulin, solulin), VIII (TB402), dual thrombin/factor X inhibitors (EP21709, tanogitran), and newer vitamin K antagonists (tecarfarin).Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa.The majority of the drugs in development belong to the class of direct factor Xa inhibitors (the -xabans). These include betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, eribaxaban, and LY517717.Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban.EXPERT OPINION: A large body of Phase II and Phase III data is now available for FXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban.Another factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is under evaluation in an ongoing phase III clinical trial and others such as AZD0837, betrixaban and darexaban are still in safety and tolerability phase II studies.Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the active site of factor Xa.Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, the direct thrombin antagonist dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban are more predictable and convenient anticoagulants in comparison with warfarin, mainly because of the non-requirement of regular laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments.Recently developed anticoagulants include direct thrombin antagonists such as dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, and edoxaban.Direct factor Xa inhibitors include rivaroxiban, which has shown promising results for VTE prophylaxis and is being studied for VTE treatment, as well as apixaban and betrixaban, which are at earlier stages of clinical validation.Two direct factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation.Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa.[Pharmacologic and clinical characteristics of direct inhibitors of factor Xa: rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban].Betrixaban is an oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa (FXa) being developed for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).A randomized evaluation of betrixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, for prevention of thromboembolic events after total knee replacement (EXPERT).Betrixaban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor administered once daily, mostly excreted unchanged in the bile and with low (17%) renal excretion.Betrixaban is a new direct factor Xa inhibitor with distinct pharmacological characteristics, including a long half-life, minimal renal clearance and minimal hepatic metabolism.Novel anticoagulants in clinical testing include orally active direct factor II inhibitors [dabigatran etexilate (BIBR 1048), AZD0837)], parenteral direct factor II inhibitors (flovagatran sodium), orally active direct factor X inhibitors [rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939), apixaban, betrixaban, YM150, DU-176b, LY-517717, GW813893, TAK-442, PD 0348292] and new parenteral FXa inhibitors [idraparinux, idrabiotaparinux (biotinilated idraparinux;

Repeat expansion has been implicated in 10 out of 17 candidate genes identified for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs)-commonly referred as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Though genetically distinct, the SCAs share a large number of features that confound their clinical classification. In addition, there is a difference in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of ataxias between different ethnic groups. We have created a new SCA-locus-specific variation database (LSVD) that aims to catalog and integrate information on SCAs associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion (SCA1, SCA 2, SCA 3, SCA 6, SCA 7, SCA 8, SCA 12, SCA 17, Friedreich's ataxia [FRDA], and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA]) from all over the world. The database has been developed using the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). The database houses detailed information on clinical features, such as age and symptom at onset, mode of inheritance, and genotype information, pertaining to the SCA patients from more than 400 families across India. All the compiled genotype data conforms to the HGVS Nomenclature guidelines. This would be a very useful starting point for understanding the molecular correlates of phenotypes in ataxia-a multilocus disease in which related molecular mechanisms converge to overlapping phenotypes.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"SCA 3\\", \\"SCA1\\", \\"SCA 12\\", \\"SCA 8\\", \\"SCA 17\\", \\"SCA 6\\", \\"SCA 7\\", \\"SCA 2\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

This paper proposes WR @math L; a robust reinforcement learning algorithm with significant robust performance on low and high-dimensional control tasks. Our method formalises robust reinforcement learning as a novel min-max game with a Wasserstein constraint for a correct and convergent solver. Apart from the formulation, we also propose an efficient and scalable solver following a novel zero-order optimisation method that we believe can be useful to numerical optimisation in general. We contribute both theoretically and empirically. On the theory side, we prove that WR @math L converges to a stationary point in the general setting of continuous state and action spaces. Empirically, we demonstrate significant gains compared to standard and robust state-of-the-art algorithms on high-dimensional MuJuCo environments.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: This work tackles the problem of robust zero-shot planning in non-stationary stochastic environments. We study Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) evolving over time and consider Model-Based Reinforcement Learning algorithms in this setting. We make two hypotheses: 1) the environment evolves continuously and its evolution rate is bounded, 2) a current model is known at each decision epoch but not its evolution. Our contribution can be presented in four points. First, we define this specific class of MDPs that we call Non-Stationary MDPs (NSMDPs). We introduce the notion of regular evolution by making an hypothesis of Lipschitz-Continuity on the transition and reward functions w.r.t. time. Secondly, we consider a planning agent using the current model of the environment, but unaware of its future evolution. This leads us to consider a worst-case method where the environment is seen as an adversarial agent. Third, following this approach, we propose the Risk-Averse Tree-Search (RATS) algorithm. This is a zero-shot Model-Based method similar to Minimax search. Finally, we illustrate the benefits brought by RATS empirically and compare its performance with reference Model-Based algorithms.","answer":"In [1] a non-stationary Markov Decision Process model is considered, where the dynamics can change from one time step to another. The constraint is based on Wasserstein distance, specifically, the Wasserstein distance between dynamics at time @math and @math is bounded by @math , i.e., is @math -Lipschitz with respect to time, for some constant @math . They approach the problem by treating nature as an adversary and implement a Minimax algorithm. The basis of their algorithm is that due to the fact that the dynamics changes slowly (due to the Lipschitz constraint), a planning algorithm can project into the future the scope of possible future dynamics and plan for the worst. The resulting algorithm, known as , is - as the name implies - a tree search algorithm. It operates on a sequence snapshots'' of the evolving MDP, which are instances of the MDP at points in time. The algorithm is tested on small grid world, and does not appear to be readily extendible to the continuous state and action scenarios our algorithm addresses."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Modeling of human PRDM12 mutations that cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) revealed remarkable conservation of the mutated residues in evolution.Transcriptional regulator PRDM12 is essential for human pain perception.New therapeutic options have recently been derived from studies of individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Here we identified 10 different homozygous mutations in PRDM12 (encoding PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing protein 12) in subjects with CIP from 11 families. Prdm proteins are a family of epigenetic regulators that control neural specification and neurogenesis.However, the study of genetic disorders rendering individuals completely unable to feel pain offers hope. All causes of congenital painlessness affect nociceptors, evolutionarily conserved specialist neurons able to sense all type of tissue damage. The discovery of new genes essential for sensing pain (SCN11A, PRDM12, and CLTCL1) has provided unexpected insights into the biological mechanisms that drive distinct stages of nociception.","answer":"congenital insensitivity to pain, or CIP"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

A rAd5-HA expressing the HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; PR8) was delivered to humans epicutaneously or intranasally  and assayed for safety and immunogenicity. The vaccine was well tolerated and induced seroconversion with the intranasal administration had a higher conversion rate and higher geometric meant HI titers [41] . While clinical trials with rAd vectors have overall been successful, demonstrating safety and some level of efficacy, rAd5 as a vector has been negatively overshadowed by two clinical trial failures. The first trial was a gene therapy examination where high-dose intravenous delivery of an Ad vector resulted in the death of an 18-year-old male [42, 43] . The second clinical failure was using an Ad5-vectored HIV vaccine being tested as a part of a Step Study, a phase 2B clinical trial. In this study, individuals were vaccinated with the Ad5 vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes. The vaccine induced HIV-specific T cell responses; however, the study was stopped after interim analysis suggested the vaccine did not achieve efficacy and individuals with high preexisting Ad5 antibody titers might have an increased risk of acquiring HIV-1 [44] [45] [46] . Subsequently, the rAd5 vaccine-associated risk was confirmed [47] . While these two instances do not suggest Ad-vector vaccines are unsafe or inefficacious, the umbra cast by the clinical trials notes has affected interest for all adenovirus vaccines, but interest still remains. Immunization with adenovirus vectors induces potent cellular and humoral immune responses that are initiated through toll-like receptor-dependent and independent pathways which induce robust pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Recombinant Ad vaccines expressing HA antigens from pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), H5 and H7 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (HPAIV), and H9 avian influenza viruses have been tested for efficacy in a number of animal models, including chickens, mice, and ferrets, and been shown to be efficacious and provide protection from challenge [48, 49] . Several rAd5 vectors have been explored for delivery of non-HA antigens, influenza nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 2 (M2) protein [29, [50] [51] [52] . The efficacy of non-HA antigens has led to their inclusion with HA-based vaccines to improve immunogenicity and broaden breadth of both humoral and cellular immunity [53, 54] . However, as both CD8 + T cell and neutralizing antibody responses are generated by the vector and vaccine antigens, immunological memory to these components can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use [48] . One drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, so alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus vectors include those from non-human primates (NHP), dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, birds and others [48, 55] . These vectors can infect a variety of cell types, but are generally attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. Swine, NHP and bovine adenoviruses expressing H5 HA antigens have been shown to induce immunity comparable to human rAd5-H5 vaccines [33, 56] . Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses from low-prevalence serotypes have also been shown to be efficacious. Low prevalence serotypes such as adenovirus types 3, 7, 11, and 35 can evade anti-Ad5 immune responses while maintaining effective antigen delivery and immunogenicity [48, 57] . Prime-boost strategies, using DNA or protein immunization in conjunction with an adenovirus vaccine booster immunization have also been explored as a means to avoided preexisting immunity [52] . Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were first explored as gene therapy vectors. Like rAd vectors, rAAV have broad tropism infecting a variety of hosts, tissues, and proliferating and non-proliferating cell types [58] . AAVs had been generally not considered as vaccine vectors because they were widely considered to be poorly immunogenic. A seminal study using AAV-2 to express a HSV-2 glycoprotein showed this virus vaccine vector effectively induced potent CD8 + T cell and serum antibody responses, thereby opening the door to other rAAV vaccine-associated studies [59, 60] . AAV vector systems have a number of engaging properties. The wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans and the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated [61] . As members of the parvovirus family, AAVs are small non-enveloped viruses that are stable and amenable to long-term storage without a cold chain. While there is limited preexisting immunity, availability of non-human strains as vaccine candidates eliminates these concerns. Modifications to the vector have increased immunogenicity, as well [60] . There are limited studies using AAVs as vaccine vectors for influenza. An AAV expressing an HA antigen was first shown to induce protective in 2001 [62] . Later, a hybrid AAV derived from two non-human primate isolates (AAVrh32.33) was used to express influenza NP and protect against PR8 challenge in mice [63] . Most recently, following the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, rAAV vectors were generated expressing the HA, NP and matrix 1 (M1) proteins of A/Mexico/4603/2009 (pH1N1), and in murine immunization and challenge studies, the rAAV-HA and rAAV-NP were shown to be protective; however, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + NP + M1 had the most robust protection. Also, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + rAAV-NP + rAAV-M1 were also partially protected against heterologous (PR8, H1N1) challenge [63] . Most recently, an AAV vector was used to deliver passive immunity to influenza [64, 65] . In these studies, AAV (AAV8 and AAV9) was used to deliver an antibody transgene encoding a broadly cross-protective anti-influenza monoclonal antibody for in vivo expression. Both intramuscular and intranasal delivery of the AAVs was shown to protect against a number of influenza virus challenges in mice and ferrets, including H1N1 and H5N1 viruses [64, 65] . These studies suggest that rAAV vectors are promising vaccine and immunoprophylaxis vectors. To this point, while approximately 80 phase I, I/II, II, or III rAAV clinical trials are open, completed, or being reviewed, these have focused upon gene transfer studies and so there is as yet limited safety data for use of rAAV as vaccines [66] . Alphaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Togaviridae family. A variety of alphaviruses have been developed as vaccine vectors, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis (SIN) virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus, as well as chimeric viruses incorporating portions of SIN and VEE viruses. The replication defective vaccines or replicons do not encode viral structural proteins, having these portions of the genome replaces with transgenic material. The structural proteins are provided in cell culture production systems. One important feature of the replicon systems is the self-replicating nature of the RNA. Despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels [67] . SIN, SFV, and VEE have all been tested for efficacy as vaccine vectors for influenza virus [68] [69] [70] [71] . A VEE-based replicon system encoding the HA from PR8 was demonstrated to induce potent HA-specific immune response and protected from challenge in a murine model, despite repeated immunization with the vector expressing a control antigen, suggesting preexisting immunity may not be an issue for the replicon vaccine [68] . A separate study developed a VEE replicon system expressing the HA from A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) and demonstrated varying efficacy after in ovo vaccination or vaccination of 1-day-old chicks [70] . A recombinant SIN virus was use as a vaccine vector to deliver a CD8 + T cell epitope only. The well-characterized NP epitope was transgenically expressed in the SIN system and shown to be immunogenic in mice, priming a robust CD8 + T cell response and reducing influenza virus titer after challenge [69] . More recently, a VEE replicon system expressing the HA protein of PR8 was shown to protect young adult (8-week-old) and aged (12-month-old) mice from lethal homologous challenge [72] . The VEE replicon systems are particularly appealing as the VEE targets antigen-presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, priming rapid and robust immune responses [73] . VEE replicon systems can induce robust mucosal immune responses through intranasal or subcutaneous immunization [72] [73] [74] , and subcutaneous immunization with virus-like replicon particles (VRP) expressing HA-induced antigen-specific systemic IgG and fecal IgA antibodies [74] . VRPs derived from VEE virus have been developed as candidate vaccines for cytomegalovirus (CMV). A phase I clinical trial with the CMV VRP showed the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and potent T cell responses. Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and considered safe [75] . A separate clinical trial assessed efficacy of repeated immunization with a VRP expressing a tumor antigen. The vaccine was safe and despite high vector-specific immunity after initial immunization, continued to boost transgene-specific immune responses upon boost [76] . While additional clinical data is needed, these reports suggest alphavirus replicon systems or VRPs may be safe and efficacious, even in the face of preexisting immunity. Baculovirus has been extensively used to produce recombinant proteins. Recently, a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use and was first available for use in the United States for the 2013-2014 influenza season [4] . Baculoviruses have also been explored as vaccine vectors. Baculoviruses have a number of advantages as vaccine vectors. The viruses have been extensively studied for protein expression and for pesticide use and so are readily manipulated. The vectors can accommodate large gene insertions, show limited cytopathic effect in mammalian cells, and have been shown to infect and express genes of interest in a spectrum of mammalian cells [77] . While the insect promoters are not effective for mammalian gene expression, appropriate promoters can be cloned into the baculovirus vaccine vectors. Baculovirus vectors have been tested as influenza vaccines, with the first reported vaccine using Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) expressing the HA of PR8 under control of the CAG promoter (AcCAG-HA) [77] . Intramuscular, intranasal, intradermal, and intraperitoneal immunization or mice with AcCAG-HA elicited HA-specific antibody responses, however only intranasal immunization provided protection from lethal challenge. Interestingly, intranasal immunization with the wild type AcNPV also resulted in protection from PR8 challenge. The robust innate immune response to the baculovirus provided non-specific protection from subsequent influenza virus infection [78] . While these studies did not demonstrate specific protection, there were antigen-specific immune responses and potential adjuvant effects by the innate response. Baculovirus pseudotype viruses have also been explored. The G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus controlled by the insect polyhedron promoter and the HA of A/Chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1) HPAIV controlled by a CMV promoter were used to generate the BV-G-HA. Intramuscular immunization of mice or chickens with BV-G-HA elicited strong HI and VN serum antibody responses, IFN-γ responses, and protected from H5N1 challenge [79] . A separate study demonstrated efficacy using a bivalent pseudotyped baculovirus vector [80] . Baculovirus has also been used to generate an inactivated particle vaccine. The HA of A/Indonesia/CDC669/2006(H5N1) was incorporated into a commercial baculovirus vector controlled by the e1 promoter from White Spot Syndrome Virus. The resulting recombinant virus was propagated in insect (Sf9) cells and inactivated as a particle vaccine [81, 82] . Intranasal delivery with cholera toxin B as an adjuvant elicited robust HI titers and protected from lethal challenge [81] . Oral delivery of this encapsulated vaccine induced robust serum HI titers and mucosal IgA titers in mice, and protected from H5N1 HPAIV challenge. More recently, co-formulations of inactivated baculovirus vectors have also been shown to be effective in mice [83] . While there is growing data on the potential use of baculovirus or pseudotyped baculovirus as a vaccine vector, efficacy data in mammalian animal models other than mice is lacking. There is also no data on the safety in humans, reducing enthusiasm for baculovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza at this time. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes disease in poultry. NDV has a number of appealing qualities as a vaccine vector. As an avian virus, there is little or no preexisting immunity to NDV in humans and NDV propagates to high titers in both chicken eggs and cell culture. As a paramyxovirus, there is no DNA phase in the virus lifecycle reducing concerns of integration events, and the levels of gene expression are driven by the proximity to the leader sequence at the 3' end of the viral genome. This gradient of gene expression enables attenuation through rearrangement of the genome, or by insertion of transgenes within the genome. Finally, pathogenicity of NDV is largely determined by features of the fusion protein enabling ready attenuation of the vaccine vector [84] .Question: Which rAd5 delivery has been tested?","answer":"A rAd5-HA expressing the HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; PR8) was delivered to humans epicutaneously or intranasally"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Prostatic epithelium proliferates in a defined medium consisting of basal medium RPMI1640 containing transferrin (1 microgram/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), and insulin (3.7 micrograms/ml or 0.1 IU/ml). Although neither dexamethasone nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and insulin. Dexamethasone at 10(-10) M or retinyl acetate at about 3 X 10(-9) M inhibits proliferation stimulated by EGF. Higher concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of EGF. Dexamethasone had a similar effect in the presence of insulin. However, retinyl acetate stimulated, but did not significantly inhibit, proliferation in the presence of insulin. These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and EGF.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"dexamethasone\\", \\"retinyl acetate\\", \\"insulin\\", \\"Dexamethasone\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"retinoids\\", \\"glucocorticoids\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": [\\"EGF\\", \\"transferrin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds with high affinity and specificity to a single site on the external domain of its transmembrane receptor to activate the tyrosine protein kinase activity of its cytoplasmic portion. The EGF receptor gene is amplified and over-expressed in several human tumors, suggesting that increased concentrations of the proto-oncogene leads to constitutive activity similar to that seen with oncogene erb B. Synthesis and degradation of the EGF receptor are regulated, in addition, covalent modification by phosphorylation regulates activity of the receptor protein. Intramolecular self-phosphorylation of Tyr1173 removes a competitive inhibitory constraint to enhance phosphorylation of substrates. Phosphorylation of Thr654 by protein kinase C decreases high affinity EGF binding and EGF-stimulated tyrosine protein kinase activity, providing a mechanism for heterologous regulation of the EGF receptor by tumor promoters and other ligand X receptor complexes. Extensive regulation contributes to normal growth control, abrogation of regulatory controls contributes to uncontrolled growth as seen with erb B transformation and EGF receptor gene amplification in human tumors.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"cytoplasmic\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"transmembrane\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases. For the 34 participants having attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.02) and severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.01) on DCP relative to placebo were statistically significant.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The largest included study that met our inclusion criteria suggested that DCP was effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralyses.For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.Chronically, acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, or potassium-sparing diuretics decrease attack frequency and severity but are of little value acutely.In the HypoPP trial, there were 13 subjects who exhibited a preference (in terms of the end point) for either DCP or placebo, and 11 of these preferred DCP. In the PSPP trial, DCP significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo. DCP also significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo in the HypoPP subjects. We conclude that DCP is effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both HypoPP and PSPP.Diclofenamid has now already been administered for 2 years. It is well tolerated and has suppressed further attacks.Three patients with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HOPP)-associated progressive interattack muscle weakness, who became unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide, responded favorably to dichlorophenamide, a more potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Dichlorophenamide in single-blind placebo-controlled trials, considerably improved functional strength in two of the patients and had a moderate but definite effect in the third.Dichlorophenamide should be considered as an alternate to acetazolamide in the treatment of patients with HOPP-associated interattack muscle weakness who have become unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide.Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP).For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). Whether these drugs prevent vacuolar myopathy, which is a pathogenic factor in hypoPP, is unknown.Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP).For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. A second trial, comparing dichlorphenamide with acetazolamide versus placebo, is currently in progress.Despite our better understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders, current treatments are largely empirical and the evidence in favor of specific therapy largely anecdotal.

The privileged efficacy of imidazoles emanates from the central role of histidine in biological machinery, particularly as a base at enzymatic active sites [2]. As histidine mimics, imidazole-containing pharmaceuticals are often only N-substituted, as in the fungicides ketoconazole and econazole (Figure 1) [3], or disubstituted as illustrated by the anesthetic etomidate [4] and the antileukemia agent nilotinib [5].</p><p>The outstanding and diverse bioactivity of imidazole-containing pharmaceuticals [6], as well as their role as ligands for tran-sition metals [7], and organocatalysis [8], has stimulated an array of creative syntheses [9,10]. Among the numerous routes to imidazoles [11,12], the condensation of metalated isocyanides with nitrogenous π-electrophiles is distinguished by excellent efficiency and modularity. Deprotonating an isocyanide 1 affords an isocyanide-stabilized anion 2 whose condensation with an imidate or nitrile generates a transient imine 3 that readily cyclizes to afford imidazole 4 (Scheme 1). The excellent efficiency is somewhat countered by requiring isocyanides that are readily deprotonated; metalation of alkylisocyanides is challenging except for methyl isocyanide which is why most isocyanides employed in accessing imida- zoles contain an adjacent electron withdrawing group (1, R 1 = EWG) [13]. Installation of an electron withdrawing group adjacent to an isocyanide facilitates the deprotonation but creates weak nucleophiles 2 that are insufficiently nucleophilic to react with nitriles [14]. Described below is the use of Asmic, anisylsulfanylmethylisocyanide (5) [15], whose deprotonation affords a potent nucleophile that reacts directly with nitriles to provide an efficient, general approach to an array of imidazoles; Asmic is a crystalline, virtually odorless isocyanide with the advantage over related methods [16,17] in being readily prepared in fewer steps on at least 20 g scale [18], applicable for the synthesis of several heterocycles [19,20], and able to generate imidazoles from a broad array of nitrile and imidate electrophiles.</p><p>Scheme 1: Asmic-condensation approach to imidazoles.</p>Results and Discussion<p>Exploratory deprotonation of Asmic (5) with BuLi followed by addition of butyronitrile afforded an essentially quantitative conversion to imidazole 7a (cf. imidazole 7f in 93% yield (Table 1, entry 6). Presumably the cyclization of 6 is followed by protonation at the former isocyanide carbon by (the C-2 of the imidazole) with the reformed LiHMDS deprotonating C-4 to form the imidazole ring.</p><p>Identifying LiHMDS as the optimal base allowed the scope of the Asmic-based imidazole synthesis to be explored (Table 1). Aliphatic nitriles including cyclopropanecarbonitrile, cyclohexanecarbonitrile, and the sterically demanding adamantanecarbonitrile efficiently gave the corresponding imidazoles (7a-e) (Table 1, entries 1-5). Aryl nitriles with electron-donating or withdrawing substituents were competent reaction partners, providing a range of aryl-substituted imidazoles ( Raney nickel hydrogenolysis was effective in interchanging the C4 anisylsulfanyl group for hydrogen (Scheme 3); attempted lithium-anisylsulfanyl exchange [19] or palladium- [22] or nickel- [23] anisylsulfanyl cross coupling was not successful. Raney nickel reduction of 7f and 7m afforded the monosubsituted imidazoles 8f and 8m, respectively.</p>Conclusion<p>Deprotonating Asmic with LiHMDS and trapping with nitriles or imidate electrophiles provides a robust, efficient synthesis of imidazoles. The method is rapid, modular and efficient. The anisylsulfanyl substituent serves as a valuable handle to the corresponding C-4 unsubstituted imidazoles providing an efficient route to diverse monosubstituted imidazoles.</p>","answer":"Substituted imidazoles are readily prepared by condensing the versatile isocyanide Asmic, anisylsulfanylmethylisocyanide, with nitrogenous π-electrophiles. Deprotonating Asmic with lithium hexamethyldisilazide effectively generates a potent nucleophile that efficiently intercepts nitrile and imine electrophiles to afford imidazoles. In situ cyclization to the imidazole is promoted by the conjugate acid, hexamethyldisilazane, which facilitates the requisite series of proton transfers. The rapid formation of imidazoles and the interchange of the anisylsulfanyl for hydrogen with Raney nickel make the method a valuable route to mono-and disubstituted imidazoles."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We have shown previously that, in sheep primary pituitary cells, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-4 inhibits FSHbeta mRNA expression and FSH release. In contrast, in mouse LbetaT2 gonadotrophs, others have shown a stimulatory effect of BMPs on basal or activin-stimulated FSHbeta promoter-driven transcription. As a species comparison with our previous results, we used LbetaT2 cells to investigate the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotrophin mRNA and secretion modulated by activin and GnRH. BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH production, but enhanced the activin+GnRH-induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion, without any effect on follistatin mRNA. BMP-4 reduced LHbeta mRNA up-regulation in response to GnRH (+/-activin) and decreased GnRH receptor expression, which would favour FSH, rather than LH, synthesis and secretion. In contrast to sheep pituitary gonadotrophs, which express only BMP receptor types IA (BMPRIA) and II (BMPRII), LbetaT2 cells also express BMPRIB. Smad1/5 phosphorylation induced by BMP-4, indicating activation of BMP signalling, was the same whether BMP-4 was used alone or combined with activin+/-GnRH. We hypothesized that activin and/or GnRH pathways may be modulated by BMP-4, but neither the activin-stimulated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 nor the GnRH-induced ERK1/2 or cAMP response element-binding phosphorylation were modified.

For such a problem, we establish a joint statistical and computational analysis. In particular, we prove that the ERM estimator in this new framework achieves an improved statistical rate of m=tilde{mathcal{O}} (knlog d /epsilon^2) recovering any G(x_0) uniformly up to an error varepsilon.Moreover, from the lens of computation, we prove that under proper conditions on the ReLU weights, our proposed empirical risk, despite non-convexity, has no stationary point outside of small neighborhoods around the true representation x_0 and its negative multiple.Furthermore, we show that the global minimizer of the empirical risk stays within the neighborhood around x_0 rather than its negative multiple.Our analysis sheds some light on the possibility of inverting a deep generative model under partial and quantized measurements, complementing the recent success of using deep generative models for inverse problems.Quantized compressed sensing investigates how to design the sensing procedure, quantizer and reconstruction algorithm so as to recover a high dimensional vector from a limited number of quantized measurements.The problem of one-bit compressed sensing, which aims at recovering a target vector θ 0 ∈ R d from single-bit observations y i = sign( a i , θ 0 ), i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , m}, m d and random sensing vectors a i ∈ R d , is particularly challenging.Previous theoretical successes on this problem (e.g. Jacques et al. (2013) ; Plan and Vershynin (2013) ) mainly rely on two key assumptions: (1) The Gaussianity of the sensing vector a i , (2) The sparsity of the vector θ 0 on a given basis.However, the practical significance of these assumptions are rather limited in the sense that it is difficult to generate Gaussian vectors and high dimensional targets in practice are often distributed * Equal Contribution 1 Here, an algorithm is \\"computationally tractable\\" if it has provable convergence guarantees.The notatioñ O(·) omits a logarithm factor of ε −1 .near a low-dimensional manifold rather than sparse on some given basis.The goal of this work is to make steps towards addressing these two limitations.Specifically, we introduce a new framework for robust dithered one-bit compressed sensing where the structure of target vector θ 0 is represented via a ReLU network G :Building upon this framework, we propose a new recovery algorithm by solving an unconstrained ERM.We show this algorithm enjoys the following favorable properties:• Statistically, when taking measurements a i to be sub-exponential random vectors, with high probability and uniformly for anyis the ball of radius R > 0 centered at the origin, the solution G( x m ) to the ERM recovers the true vector G(x 0 ) up to error ε when the number of samples m ≥ O(kn log 4 (ε −1 )(log d + log(ε −1 ))/ε 2 ).In particular, our result does not require REC type assumptions adopted in previous analysis of generative signal recovery works and at the same time weakens the known sub-Gaussian assumption adopted in previous one-bit compressed sensing works.When the number of layers n is small, this result meets the minimax optimal rate (up to a logarithm factor) for sparse recovery and simultaneously improves upon the best knownÕ(k log d/ε 4 ) statistical rate for computationally tractable algorithms.• Computationally, we show that solving the ERM and approximate the true representation x 0 ∈ R k is tractable.More specifically, we prove with high probability, there always exists a descent direction outside two small neighborhoods around x 0 and its negative multiple with radius O(ε 1/4 ), uniformly for any x 0 ∈ B k 2 (R ) with R = (0.5+ε) −n/2 R, when the ReLU network satisfies a weight distribution condition with parameter ε > 0 and m ≥ O(kn log 4 (ε −1 )(log d + log(ε −1 ))/ε 2 ).Furthermore, when ε is small enough, one guarantees that the solution x m stays within the neighborhood around x 0 (rather than its negative multiple).Our result is achieved without assuming the REC type conditions and under quantization errors, thereby improving upon previously known computational guarantees for ReLU generative signal recovery in linear models with small noise.From a technical perspective, our proof makes use of the special piecewise linearity property of ReLU network.The merits of such a property in the current scenario are two folds: (1) It allows us to replaces the generic chaining type bounds commonly adopted in previous works (e.g. Dirksen and Mendelson (2018a) ) by novel arguments that are \\"sub-Gaussian free\\".(2) From a hyperplane tessellation point of view, we show that for a given accuracy level, a binary embedding of2 (R) into Euclidean space is \\"easier\\" in that it requires less random hyperplanes than that of a bounded k sparse set.Notations.Throughout the paper, let S d−1 and B(x, r) denotes the unit sphere and the ball of radius r centered atWe say a random variable is sub-exponential if its ψ 1 -norm is bounded.A random vector x ∈ R d is sub-exponential if there exists a a constant C > 0 such that sup t∈S d−1 x, t ψ1 ≤ C.

Here, we use in vivo patch-clamp recordings to show that locomotion can be directly read out from mossy fiber synaptic input and spike output in single granule cells. The increase in granule cell spiking during locomotion is enhanced by glutamate spillover currents recruited during movement. Surprisingly, the entire step sequence can be predicted from input EPSCs and output spikes of a single granule cell, suggesting that a robust gait code is present already at the cerebellar input layer and transmitted via the granule cell pathway to downstream Purkinje cells. Thus, synaptic input delivers remarkably rich information to single neurons during locomotion.Introduction:In order to ensure generation of precise and reliable movements, information about movement parameters must be represented in neural circuits of the mammalian brain with high fidelity. Firing patterns directly related to specific movement parameters have been reported in single-unit recordings across several brain areas involved in movement representation and generation( Armstrong, 1988; Beloozerova et al., 2003). Crucial to generating such accurate representations is delivery of synaptic input patterns containing rich information about the animal's movement. However, we currently lack information about the input patterns received during movement for any neuron in the mammalian brain, and thus the input–output transformations performed in these neurons during movement are only poorly understood. The cerebellum is thought to play a key role in precise limb coordination during voluntary movements( Flourens, 1824; Vercher and Gauthier, 1988; Muller and Dichgans, 1994; Bastian et al., 1996; Holmes, 1922). Purkinje cells, the output cells of the cerebellar cortex, exhibit firing linked to the phase of the step cycle during locomotion( Orlovsky, 1972; Armstrong and Edgley, 1984; Edgley and Lidierth, 1988). How this information is represented in and transmitted by upstream neurons in the circuit, in particular in cerebellar granule cells—which form the input layer of the cerebellar cortex—remains unknown. Here we have taken advantage of the electrical compactness of granule cells, and their small number of excitatory inputs—4 on average( Eccles et al., 1967; Palkovits et al., 1971; Jakab and Hamori, 1988)—which allows for individual synaptic inputs to be resolved in vivo( Chadderton et al., 2004; Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006; Rancz et al., 2007; Arenz et al., 2008; Chadderton et al., 2014). Moreover, since granule cell activity plays a key role in regulating locomotion, including the coordination of individual limbs( Vinueza Veloz et al., 2014) as well as in in motor learning( Galliano et al., 2013), they represent particularly attractive targets for an electrophysiological dissection of their input–output relationships during locomotion. By recording the activity of mossy fiber boutons, EPSCs in granule cells, and granule cell output while mice are moving on a treadmill, we can thus reconstruct single cell integration of synaptic inputs in awake animals during locomotion, and identify the cellular representation of movement parameters in a defined site in the circuit.Discussion:Our experiments represent the first whole-cell recordings from granule cells in awake mice. Information about granule cell activity patterns in awake animals has been extremely difficult to obtain. Extracellular recordings from the granule cell layer have suffered from the fact that the exceptionally dense packing of the granule cells has made it difficult to unambiguously assign spikes as arising from single granule cells( Hartmann and Bower, 2001; Gao et al., 2012). Although two-photon imaging approaches should in principle help to resolve this issue, the scattering nature of the densely packed granule cell layer, and the lack of reliable single-spike sensitivity of current genetically encoded calcium sensors combined with the difficulty of separating synaptic and action potential-linked calcium signals in granule cells has made it difficult to reliably estimate granule cell firing rates using two-photon imaging( Ozden et al., 2012). Our patch-clamp recordings allowed us to unambiguously record from single granule cells, and demonstrate that granule cells in awake mice exhibit remarkably low firing rates when the animal is at rest, similar to those observed in mormyrid fish under paralysis using similar techniques( Sawtell, 2010). Moreover, the electrical compactness of the granule cells allows us to make voltage clamp recordings to probe synaptic currents driving spiking activity. We demonstrate that the low spontaneous firing rates observed at rest in granule cells, which are surprisingly similar to those in anaesthetized( Chadderton et al., 2004; Duguid et al., 2012) and decerebrate( Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006) preparations, persist despite far higher spontaneous EPSC rates than are present under anaesthesia. This indicates that the low firing rate of granule cells is a general property of granule cells and suggests that it is under tight control by intrinsic mechanisms and by synaptic inhibition( Duguid et al., 2012), especially in the awake animal. Despite the low firing rates observed at rest, granule cells exhibited a dramatic increase in firing at the onset of locomotion, paralleling observations using two-photon calcium imaging in the granule cell layer( Ozden et al., 2012). This increase in granule cell firing rate was widespread across the granule cell population, indicating that granule cells switch from a sparse to a dense mode of activation during locomotion. The high firing rates of granule cells during locomotion was organized in bursts, reminiscent of the high-frequency bursts observed in granule cells with some forms of sensory stimulation( van Beugen et al., 2013), which in turn can be transmitted reliably to the Purkinje cell( Valera et al., 2012). Our voltage clamp experiments reveal that the locomotion-evoked spiking is driven by a significant increase in excitatory synaptic input to the granule cells, which is paralleled by an increase in spiking in mossy fibers, as shown by direct recordings from mossy fiber boutons. Some of the increase in mossy fiber input may be provided by activity in spinocerebellar pathways, which exhibit locomotion-related activity( Arshavsky et al., 1972a, 1972b; Orsal et al., 1988). These results indicate that the sensorimotor computations in neuronal circuits upstream from the mossy fiber pathways provide sufficiently strong activation to overcome the high threshold for output spiking in the granule cells. Future experiments are required to examine how the interaction between mossy fiber input and Golgi cell inhibition( D'Angelo and De Zeeuw, 2009) jointly determine the enhanced spiking output of granule cells during locomotion. Our experiments provide the first investigation of glutamate spillover in the awake behaving animal, and demonstrate that this feature of mossy fiber-granule cell transmission( DiGregorio et al., 2002; Nielsen et al., 2004) plays a crucial role in driving movement-related output spikes from the granule cell layer. Previous investigation of glutamate spillover currents has been restricted to brain slices, both in hippocampus( Kullmann and Asztely, 1998) and cerebellum( DiGregorio et al., 2002; Nielsen et al., 2004), and it has been unclear whether the stimulus conditions and levels of glutamate uptake present in vitro are representative of the physiological pattern of in vivo activation. We demonstrate that spillover currents make a substantial contribution to the synaptic charge during locomotion-evoked mossy fiber input. Furthermore, using a realistic compartmental model of the granule cell, we show that these spillover currents are essential for driving the observed output firing rates of the granule cell associated with locomotion. The biophysical properties of spillover currents appear to be ideally suited to help ensure appropriate granule cell firing patterns under resting conditions and during locomotion. Specifically, spillover currents are synergistically enhanced by the activation of multiple neighbouring synapses( Carter and Regehr, 2000; Arnth-Jensen et al., 2002; DiGregorio et al., 2002), as is likely during the high-frequency barrage of mossy fiber inputs activated during locomotion. Thus, the requirement of the spillover current for high spiking rates provides another mechanism to both ensure sparse granule cell firing at rest, and enhance firing during locomotion, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of granule cell transmission of locomotion information. We show that granule cells exhibit very low spike rates in awake resting mice, despite high excitatory synaptic drive. Since granule cells represent the most abundant neuronal type in the brain, and spikes are energetically expensive( Attwell and Laughlin, 2001; Carter and Bean, 2009), the metabolic cost of sustained firing in this population would be considerable( Howarth et al., 2012). Therefore the ability to maintain sparse firing in granule cells at rest could be an important mechanism for energy conservation in the mammalian brain. During locomotion, however, spike rates can increase dramatically. We demonstrate that movement during locomotion exhibits an unexpectedly strong representation in mossy fiber input received by granule cells, as well as in the spiking output of individual granule cells. Remarkably, in some neurons it is possible to reconstruct the entire step sequence during locomotion from both input patterns and spike output, indicating that gait information is present even at the level of single granule cells. This indicates that a rich amount of information about movement parameters is already represented by individual synapses at the input layer of the cerebellar cortex. Thus, selective sampling of granule cells exhibiting tuning to a given phase of the step cycle may underlie the step cycle modulation of simple spikes observed in Purkinje cells( Orlovsky, 1972; Armstrong and Edgley, 1984; Edgley and Lidierth, 1988). Our results suggest that the synaptic representation of locomotion, rather than being based on a sparse code( Marr, 1969; Attwell and Laughlin, 2001; Howarth et al., 2012), relies on a population of tuned neurons, which shift from sparse activity to a dense gait code during movement.","answer":"Our voluntary movements , such as shaking hands and walking , are controlled by a region of the brain called the cerebellum .

Several viral infections are linked to hypertension, including human herpes virus 8( HHV-8) and HIV-1. The mechanisms of how viral infection contributes to hypertension or increased blood pressure are not defined. In this report, the role of CMV infection as a cause of increased blood pressure and in forming aortic atherosclerotic plaques is examined. Using in vivo mouse model and in vitro molecular biology analyses, we find that CMV infection alone caused a significant increase in arterial blood pressure( ABp)( p<0. 01∼0. 05), measured by microtip catheter technique. This increase in blood pressure by mouse CMV( MCMV) was independent of atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aorta, defined by histological analyses. MCMV DNA was detected in blood vessel samples of viral infected mice but not in the control mice by nested PCR assay. MCMV significantly increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 in mouse serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay( ELISA). Using quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR( Q-RT-PCR) and Western blot, we find that CMV stimulated expression of renin in mouse and human cells in an infectious dose-dependent manner. Co-staining and immunofluorescent microscopy analyses showed that MCMV infection stimulated renin expression at a single cell level. Further examination of angiotensin-II( Ang II) in mouse serum and arterial tissues with ELISA showed an increased expression of Ang II by MCMV infection. Consistent with the findings of the mouse trial, human CMV( HCMV) infection of blood vessel endothelial cells( EC) induced renin expression in a non-lytic infection manner. Viral replication kinetics and plaque formation assay showed that an active, CMV persistent infection in EC and expression of viral genes might underpin the molecular mechanism. These results show that CMV infection is a risk factor for increased arterial blood pressure, and is a co-factor in aortic atherosclerosis. Viral persistent infection of EC may underlie the mechanism. Control of CMV infection can be developed to restrict hypertension and atherosclerosis in the cardiovascular system.Introduction:Human cytomegalovirus( HCMV) is a member of the herpes virus family, and HCMV infection is ranked as one of the most common infections in adults, with the seropositive rates ranging from 60–99% globally. Once acquired, the infection persists lifelong and may undergo periodic reactivation. The infection with HCMV is associated with cardiovascular diseases, and some countries have reported low rates of HCMV seropositivity and a high incidence of atherosclerosis[1]–[4]. Additionally, several virus infections are associated with hypertension or an increase of blood pressure, including human herpesvirus 8( HHV-8) and HIV-1 in primary pulmonary hypertension[5]–[7]. The mechanisms underlying how viruses contribute to hypertension have not been identified. In a mouse model of pulmonary hypertension, a recent paper has explored the mechanism of pulmonary artery muscularization and arterial remodeling by inflammation and the Th2 immune response[8]. Clinical isolates of HCMV have been shown to infect endothelial cells, and the presence of HCMV antigens in endothelial cells triggers inflammation and immune response via secretion of CXC chemokines and recruiting neutrophils, which are infected by HCMV in the process of neutrophil transendothelial migration[9]. HCMV infection is also implicated in atherosclerosis, as in the report that HCMV-seropositive individuals have endothelial dysfunction and an increased atherosclerosis burden[10]. The use of the anti-CMV drug, ganciclovir, appears to lower heart transplant related atherosclerosis[11]. Studies in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice also show that MCMV infection increases atherosclerosis[12]. Other clinical studies, however, have not found an association between HCMV infection and vascular atherosclerosis[13]–[17]. It remains an important investigational subject, therefore, to define the role of CMV in vascular injury and atherosclerosis. This could also be mediated by CMV inducing vascular injury and causing hypertension, which serves as a co-factor to interact with other factors to induce atherosclerosis. As atherosclerosis is a complicated event with lipid metabolism, genetic factors and inflammatory pathways obviously playing crucial roles, it is important to define that a common widespread virus, such as CMV, might initiate atherosclerosis or inflammatory response resulting in vascular injury. This has the potential to lead to new treatments for vascular disease directed at the antiviral therapy of CMV or prevention by a vaccine against CMV. Furthermore, distinguishing the role of CMV infection in vascular cells and atherosclerosis adds to elucidating the mechanism of CMV associated cardiovascular diseases( CV), since CMV infection is reported as a primary factor and directly linked to CV as in myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary restenosis, or CV death[18]–[20]. In this study, we have employed in vivo and in vitro experimental systems and defined that MCMV infection alone results in a significant increase of blood pressure. Molecular biology analyses show that MCMV infection stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, which have previously been shown to play a role in an increase of blood pressure[21]–[23]. Specifically, we have identified that CMV infection induced expression of renin in an infection dose responsive manner in mouse renal cells and in human vascular endothelial cells. Additionally, an increased angiotensin II( Ang II) level was detected in mouse serum and in arterial blood vascular tissues after MCMV infection. This is of great interest, since renin is known as a rate limiting protein of Renin-Ang-II system( RAS) and Ang II is the effector peptide that directly binds to blood vessels, causes vasoconstriction and leads to systemic hypertension in humans[24]–[27]. Our studies have defined that CMV infection alone leads to an increase in blood pressure, whereas CMV acts as a co-factor, along with high cholesterol diet to induce atherosclerosis in the mouse aorta. A persistent CMV infection of EC and an increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, including renin and AngII, may underlie the molecular mechanism by which CMV infection induced an increase of blood pressure.Discussion:MCMV infection caused a significant increase of arterial blood pressure in vivo, independent of high cholesterol diet and atherosclerotic plaque formation in the mouse aorta( Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Tables 1 and 2). Additionally, we find that besides stimulating expression of inflammatory cytokines reported to increase blood pressure, CMV infection stimulated expression of renin, the first component of RAS, in both kidney cells and EC, in a dose-dependent manner( Fig. 4, Fig. 7). CMV infection also increased Ang II levels in mouse blood and artery tissues. Ang II has been known as the effector peptide of RAS that directly binds to blood vessels and induces vasoconstriction. Our experimental results show that CMV infection is a risk factor to cause cardiovascular diseases, specifically an increase of blood pressure or hypertension. A non-lytic CMV infection and the perturbed cellular gene expression, specifically the components of RAS, underlie a molecular mechanism by which CMV infection causes an increase of blood pressure. In the in vivo mouse model study, we examined 48 mice of the same species with the same age, similar body weight, and evenly distributed male and female in 4 assay groups. We determined that infection by MCMV induced an increase of blood pressure, and compared this to the known risk factors of hypertension: high cholesterol diet and atherosclerosis. We employed a catheter method to measure the blood pressures of all assay mice, in the right carotid under anesthesia to obtain an accurate reading and reduce the pain of experimental animals. The mean values of blood pressure of the MCMV infected mice were compared to the control groups where the blood pressure was measured by the same technique and the same procedure. The experimental results show statistically significant differences between the MCMV infected groups and the control groups. Clearly, our in vivo mouse model study demonstrates that MCMV infection induced a significant increase of arterial blood pressure, independent of the other two known risk factors, high cholesterol diet and atherosclerosis, in mice that were immune competent and with normal lipid metabolic functions. A high cholesterol diet induces an increase of blood pressure in association with weight gain[30]. MCMV infection did not contribute to a mouse weight gain( Fig. S1, P>0. 05). The weights of two groups of C57BL/6J mice fed with a high cholesterol diet were greater than the two groups fed with a regular diet( P<0. 05), and both high cholesterol diet groups, viral infected or not, had an increase of blood pressure( Fig. 1E). The high blood pressure in overweight mice suggests that obesity plays an important role in development of hypertension in mice fed with high cholesterol diet. Obesity causes hypercholesterolemia, which results in high blood viscosity, blood dynamic alterations, and vascular endothelial mechanistic injury. In our study, MCMV infected mice had significantly increased blood pressures compared to the mock-infected mice, in both diet groups( P<0. 01 and P<0. 05). The MCMV infected group did not weigh more than those in control groups fed with the same diet( Fig. S1, P>0. 05). Thus, CMV infection did not contribute to the mouse weight gain, but caused an increase of blood pressure apparently via a change in expression of cellular genes, the over expression of inflammatory cytokines, renin and Ang II in the vascular system. Mice were infected with MCMV via the intra-peritoneal injection. The viral IE-1 DNA was detected at week 6 post infection in 100% of aortas of infected mice fed high cholesterol diet, and in 92% of aortas of infected mice fed with a regular diet. We also examined MCMV DNA in other blood vessels. The majority of large vessels in the viral infected mice were positive for viral DNA, and MCMV has an affinity to infect vessel cells even though the port of viral infection is at the intra-peritoneum( Fig. 6, Table 2). Aorta and postcaval vein appear to be the main reservoirs of CMV. There was no significant difference in MCMV infection of vessel cells in mice fed with a high cholesterol diet compared to the mice fed with a regular diet( P>0. 05). Nerheim et al., however, have reported that the active HCMV infection is enhanced in atherosclerotic blood vessels compared to atherosclerosis-free vascular equivalents, and this viral activity is restricted to the subpopulations of intimal and adventitial cells[37]. Renin is a step limiting protein of RAS. Increased RAS activity results in systemic hypertension and expression of ectopic anti-renin or anti-angiotensin molecules decreases hypertension[24]–[27]. We determined renin expression in both mouse and human cells after CMV infection, and find that CMV infection increased renin expression in cells in a MOI dependent manner( Fig. 4, Fig. 7). Furthermore, in immune competent individuals, CMV causes persistent infections in certain types of cells, including EC. The course of infection is symptomless, and limited at the cell level. In our studies, all 4 groups of mice were followed for 10 weeks and no symptoms of CMV infection were observed. Examination of mouse specimens and infection of EC culture by CMV confirmed that a non-lytic infection occurred in blood vessel cells( Fig. 2, Fig. 8, Fig. S3, Fig. S4, Fig. S5). In summary, CMV infection alone caused a significant increase of arterial blood pressure. Enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, renin and Ang II underlies the pathogenic mechanism of an active CMV infection to increase blood pressure and aggravate atherosclerosis. Thus, control of CMV infection to restrict development of hypertension and atherosclerosis may provide a new strategy to prevent cardiovascular diseases associated with HCMV infection.","answer":"Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection is associated with cardiovascular diseases .

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Recent proposals for network virtualization provide a promising way to overcome the Internet ossification. The key idea of network virtualization is to build a diversified Internet to support a variety of network services and architectures through a shared substrate. A major challenge in network virtualization is the assigning of substrate resources to virtual networks (VN) efficiently and on-demand. This paper focuses on two versions of the VN assignment problem: VN assignment without reconfiguration (VNA-I) and VN assignment with reconfiguration (VNAII). For the VNA-I problem, we develop a basic scheme as a building block for all other advanced algorithms. Subdividing heuristics and adaptive optimization strategies are then presented to further improve the performance. For the VNA-II problem, we develop a selective VN reconfiguration scheme that prioritizes the reconfiguration of the most critical VNs. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve good performance under a wide range of network conditions. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Virtualizing and sharing networked resources have become a growing trend that reshapes the computing and networking architectures. Embedding multiple virtual networks (VNs) on a shared substrate is a challenging problem on cloud computing platforms and large-scale sliceable network testbeds. In this paper we apply the Markov Random Walk (RW) model to rank a network node based on its resource and topological attributes. This novel topology-aware node ranking measure reflects the relative importance of the node. Using node ranking we devise two VN embedding algorithms. The first algorithm maps virtual nodes to substrate nodes according to their ranks, then embeds the virtual links between the mapped nodes by finding shortest paths with unsplittable paths and solving the multi-commodity flow problem with splittable paths. The second algorithm is a backtracking VN embedding algorithm based on breadth-first search, which embeds the virtual nodes and links during the same stage using node ranks. Extensive simulation experiments show that the topology-aware node rank is a better resource measure and the proposed RW-based algorithms increase the long-term average revenue and acceptance ratio compared to the existing embedding algorithms. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Network virtualization provides a promising way to overcome Internet ossification. A major challenge is virtual network mapping, i.e., how to embed multiple virtual network requests with resource constraints into a substrate network, such that physical resources are utilized in an efficient and effective manner. Since this problem is known to be NP-complete, a variety of heuristic algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we re-examine this problem and propose a virtual network mapping framework, ORS TA, which is based on Opportunistic Resource Sharing and Topology-Aware node ranking. Opportunistic resource sharing is taken into consideration at the entire network level for the first time and we develop an online approximation algorithm, FFA, for solving the corresponding time slot assignment problem. To measure the topology importance of a substrate node, a node ranking method, MCRank, based on Markov chain is presented. We also devise a simple and practical method to estimate the residual resource of a substrate node/link. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework enables the substrate network to achieve efficient physical resource utilization and to accept many more virtual network requests over time. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Network virtualization has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the ossification of the Internet. A major challenge in network virtualization is the so-called virtual network embedding problem, which deals with the efficient embedding of virtual networks with resource constraints into a shared substrate network. A number of heuristics have been proposed to cope with the NP-hardness of this problem; however, all of the existing proposals reserve fixed resources throughout the entire lifetime of a virtual network. In this paper, we re-examine this problem with the position that time-varying resource requirements of virtual networks should be taken into consideration, and we present an opportunistic resource sharing-based mapping framework, ORS, where substrate resources are opportunistically shared among multiple virtual networks. We formulate the time slot assignment as an optimization problem; then, we prove the decision version of the problem to be NP-hard in the strong sense. Observing the resemblance between our problem and the bin packing problem, we adopt the core idea of first-fit and propose two practical solutions: first-fit by collision probability (CFF) and first-fit by expectation of indicators' sum (EFF). Simulation results show that ORS provides a more efficient utilization of substrate resources than two state-of-the-art fixed-resource embedding schemes.Literature Review:","answer":"(4) BFS algorithm has better performance than MCF and SP.

The transmembrane protein Dispatched is an essential component of the machinery that deploys Hedgehog family ligands from producing cells, and is absolutely required for signaling to long-range targets. Despite this crucial role, regulatory mechanisms controlling Dispatched activity remain largely undefined. Herein, we reveal vertebrate Dispatched is activated by proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage at a conserved processing site in its first extracellular loop. Dispatched processing occurs at the cell surface to instruct its membrane re-localization in polarized epithelial cells. Cleavage site mutation alters Dispatched membrane trafficking and reduces ligand release, leading to compromised pathway activity in vivo. As such, convertase-mediated cleavage is required for Dispatched maturation and functional competency in Hedgehog ligand-producing cells.Introduction:Hedgehog( Hh) ligands are produced as precursor proteins that undergo autocatalytic processing whereby a carboxyl-terminal intein-like domain cleaves itself, in a cholesterol-dependent manner, from an amino-terminal signaling domain( Guy, 2000; Lee et al., 1994). The resulting ~20 kDa signaling protein is covalently modified by cholesterol on its new carboxyl-terminal cysteine and by a long chain fatty acid on its amino-terminus( Porter et al., 1996a; Chamoun et al., 2001; Pepinsky et al., 1998; Long et al., 2015). These lipid modifications contribute to physiological Sonic Hh( Shh) activity by governing ligand distribution across developing tissues, and influencing ligand potency toward target cells( Long et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2001; Li et al., 2006; Porter et al., 1996b; Burke et al., 1999). Distribution is controlled by Shh lipid modifications conferring high membrane affinity to the mature ligand, thereby anchoring it to the producing cell surface. In order to reach long-range target cells, Shh must be deployed from producing cell membranes through a process that is dependent upon Dispatched 1( Disp), a predicted twelve-pass transmembrane protein that shares homology with the bacterial Resistance, Nodulation and Division( RND) Transporter superfamily( Burke et al., 1999; Caspary et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2002; Kawakami et al., 2002; Amanai and Jiang, 2001). Disp1 knockout mice phenocopy animals lacking the essential Shh signal transducing component Smoothened( Smo), underscoring the importance of Disp for pathway activity during early development( Caspary et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2002; Kawakami et al., 2002). In vertebrates, Disp functions with the secreted glycoprotein Scube2 to facilitate Shh membrane extraction( Ma et al., 2002; Creanga et al., 2012; Tukachinsky et al., 2012). The precise mechanism by which Disp and Scube2 mobilize Shh from the producing cell membrane is not yet clear. However, Disp contains a sterol sensing domain( SSD) that is thought to interact with the Shh cholesterol modification to position the ligand for transfer to Scube2( Creanga et al., 2012; Tukachinsky et al., 2012). Despite this advance in understanding the Disp-Scube2 functional relationship, little is known about how Disp activity is regulated. Biochemical and cell biological analyses have shown Disp must organize into trimers and localize to the basolateral cell surface to release Shh( Etheridge et al., 2010). Genetic studies in Drosophila suggest a crucial role for Disp-mediated endosomal recycling during Hh deployment, demonstrating that apically localized Hh must be internalized in a Disp-dependent manner, and then retargeted to the cell surface to exit ligand-producing cells( D'Angelo et al., 2015; Callejo et al., 2011). Loss of Disp function triggers apical accumulation of Hh and disruption of long-range signaling( D'Angelo et al., 2015; Callejo et al., 2011), suggesting the ability of Disp to appropriately traffic with Hh is imperative for ligand release. The regulatory processes influencing Disp membrane targeting and recycling have not yet been established. Herein, we demonstrate that Disp membrane targeting and recycling is dependent upon convertase-mediated cleavage. Cleavage occurs at an evolutionarily conserved site in the predicted first extracellular loop of Disp( EC1) by the proprotein convertase Furin. Mutation of the EC1 cleavage site prevents Disp processing and disrupts Shh deployment, consistent with convertase cleavage being an essential step in Disp functional maturation. Results suggest that Disp is clipped at the cell surface and that the resulting amino-terminal fragment and processed carboxyl domain are differentially trafficked post-processing. Disruption of processing by cleavage site mutation results in altered membrane distribution of Disp, leading to compromised pathway activity in vivo. Combined, these results establish cleavage as an essential step for Disp functionality, and provide novel mechanistic insight into control of Disp function in ligand-producing cells.Discussion:Disp was first identified as a crucial regulator of Hh ligand deployment in 1999 through a genetic screen conducted in Drosophila( Burke et al., 1999). A number of vertebrate genetic studies subsequently established the importance of Disp in Shh morphogen gradient formation and activity during tissue development( Caspary et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2002; Kawakami et al., 2002; Nakano et al., 2004). Owing to the comparatively small number of cell biological and biochemical interrogations of Disp activity( Creanga et al., 2012; Tukachinsky et al., 2012; Etheridge et al., 2010), mechanistic insight into its regulation and functionality has remained limited. The study presented here improves understanding of Disp regulation by revealing an evolutionarily conserved cleavage event that influences the ability of Disp to deploy Hh family ligands from ligand-producing cells. We report that Disp is cleaved at a conserved processing site in its predicted first extracellular loop by the proprotein convertase Furin. Cleavage site mutation compromises Disp-mediated ligand deployment in vitro and in vivo, leading to reduced pathway activation in target cells. As such, this study is the first to provide mechanistic insight into a process promoting functional maturation of Disp for its role in ligand deployment. Proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage of substrate proteins typically promotes their maturation by removing inhibitory prodomains, revealing active domains, releasing bioactive fragments, priming substrates for cleavage by additional proteases, or by influencing substrate subcellular localization( Seidah et al., 2013; Seidah and Prat, 2012). How prodomains affect substrate trafficking is not yet fully understood, but a logical hypothesis is that cleavage regulates association with trafficking molecules and/or tethering proteins along secretory or endosomal recycling routes. Such a model has been proposed for the convertase substrate Nodal, which accumulates on the cell surface following processing inhibition( Constam, 2014; Blanchet et al., 2008a, 2008b). Because cleavage disruption altered full-length dDisp membrane localization in polarized epithelial cells to mimic what was observed for the processed 30 kDa V5 fragment, we hypothesize that like Nodal, Disp membrane trafficking is regulated in cleavage-dependent manner. The observed colocalization of amino- and carboxyl-terminal dDispWT epitope tags on basolateral membranes of Drosophila follicle cells suggests cleavage occurs after basolateral targeting of unprocessed Disp. Consistent with this hypothesis, Furin has been demonstrated to traffic basolaterally in polarized epithelial cells( Simmen et al., 1999). Intriguingly, whereas Disp is predominantly observed to localize to basolateral membrane, Hh enriches on apical membrane, from which it must be endocytosed in a Disp-dependent manner to facilitate its release upon plasma membrane recycling( D'Angelo et al., 2015; Callejo et al., 2011; Gallet et al., 2003). Our observations that cleavage-deficient Disp( 1) accumulated uniformly along apical and basolateral membranes of Drosophila follicle cells and( 2) showed reduced colocalization with the Rab5 endosomal marker when expressed in S2 cells suggest that its endosomal trafficking is likely compromised by cleavage disruption. As such, we suggest a testable model in which basolateral Disp cleavage activates the protein for endosomal recycling, allowing it to capture, recycle and deploy apically localized Hh. We do not believe Disp cleavage is required to interact with ligand because both wild type and cleavage-deficient murine Disp proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Shh. Cleavage-deficient Disp was also capable of forming multimers, diminishing the likelihood that EC1 clipping regulates self-association. Results obtained using both murine and Drosophila experimental systems demonstrate that Disp processing is evolutionarily conserved. However, whereas mutation of a single consensus cleavage motif in EC1 of mouse Disp was sufficient to disrupt cleavage, multiple predicted sites had to be targeted in Drosophila Disp EC1. That three predicted motifs had to be deleted to block Drosophila Disp cleavage suggests cleavage site redundancy in the fly protein. Multiple redundant motifs may indicate increased reliance upon Disp cleavage for function in the Drosophila system. Notably, Drosophila lack a Scube2-like protein that partners with dDisp to extract Hh from ligand-producing cells( Creanga et al., 2012; Tukachinsky et al., 2012). Multiple redundant sites might serve as fail-safes to assure dDisp cleavage and efficient Hh membrane release in the absence of Scube2-mediated assistance. Another possible explanation is that Drosophila Disp is cleaved by additional or alternative proteases with different cleavage site preferences or efficiencies. It has been reported that although Drosophila convertases can share substrate specificity with their vertebrate counterparts, cleavage efficiency will often vary between the two systems( De Bie et al., 1995). In vertebrates, genetic loss-of-function of proprotein convertases such as Furin, PCSK5 and PACE4 triggers developmental defects leading to embryonic lethality( Seidah et al., 2013; Roebroek et al., 1998; Essalmani et al., 2008; Constam and Robertson, 2000a; Constam and Robertson, 2000b). Although Furin and Disp1 knockout mice both show axial rotation and heart looping defects that lead to death at or before embryonic days ~ E9. 5-10. 5, their phenotypes are not indistinguishable( Caspary et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2002; Kawakami et al., 2002; Roebroek et al., 1998). Most notably, whereas Disp1 mutant embryos show clear disruption of left-right asymmetry, Furin mutants do not( Ma et al., 2002; Kawakami et al., 2002; Roebroek et al., 1998). This could be due to functional compensation by other convertases in vivo. Consistent with this notion, functional redundancy between Furin, PACE4, PCSK5 and PCSK7 has been reported( Seidah et al., 2013; Roebroek et al., 1998). It is also possible that Furin-mediated Disp cleavage occurs in temporal or tissue-specific manners to scale Shh release efficiency commensurate with increased need. In such a scenario, Disp cleavage would be predicted to occur during later developmental stages or in larger developing tissues to bolster Shh deployment for a growing population of target cells. Future in vivo studies using vertebrate model systems will be required to explore these hypotheses, and to determine how Disp cleavage disruption impacts Shh-dependent developmental patterning.","answer":"As an embryo develops , its cells divide many times until they specialize to become distinct cell types that make up the tissues and organs .

This pathway is necessary so that the tissue and organs develop properly . If faulty , it can stop the embryo from developing properly and even lead to diseases such as cancer .

Now , Stewart , Marada et al . wanted to find out if and how Dispatched itself is controlled by studying embryo cells of mice . The results showed that a protein called Furin activates Dispatched by splitting it at a specific point . When the break-point on Dispatch was genetically modified , Furin could no longer cleave the protein . As a consequence , Dispatched did not reach the correct location within cells to help Hedgehog move away from signal-releasing cells . This suggests that Furin is an essential protein of the Hedgehog pathway . A next step will be to see if this is also the case in humans . Some cancer cells can produce large amounts of Hedgehog protein , which makes tumors grow faster . A better understanding of Hedgehog signaling may help to find new cancer therapies that can block this pathway in cancer cells ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

The in vitro activity of halofantrine was studied in chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant African clones of Plasmodium falciparum over a period of six months. The susceptibility level remained stable in both clones. The chloroquine-susceptible clone (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] 6.88 nM) was less susceptible to halofantrine than the chloroquine-resistant clone (IC50 2.98 nM). Using an isotopic semimicro drug susceptibility test, the in vitro activity of halofantrine was compared with the activities of chloroquine, quinine, and mefloquine to study the cross-resistance patterns against 76 African isolates of P. falciparum isolated from cases of malaria imported into France. chloroquine-resistant isolates (n = 47) were significantly less susceptible to quinine (IC50 234 nM), but were more susceptible to both mefloquine (IC50 3.20 nM) and halofantrine (IC50 1.14 nM) compared with the chloroquine-susceptible isolates (n = 29; IC50 147 nM for quinine, 7.16 nM for mefloquine, and 2.62 nM for halofantrine). A significant positive correlation was found between the activities of chloroquine and quinine and between those of mefloquine and halofantrine, indicating cross-resistance between these drugs, while a negative correlation was observed between chloroquine and mefloquine or halofantrine.

RSS Based Fingerprinting 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  One of the major challenges of Cellular network based localization techniques is lack of hearability between mobile terminals (MTs) and base stations (BSs), thus the number of available anchors is limited. In order to solve the hearability problem, previous work assume some of the MTs have their location information via Global Positioning System (GPS). These located MT can be utilized to find the location of an un-located MT without GPS receiver. However, its performance is still limited by the number of available located MTs for cooperation. This paper consider a practical scenario that hearability is only possible between a MT and its home BS. Only one located MT together with the home BS are utilized to find the location of the un-located MT. A hybrid cooperative localization approach is proposed to combine time-of-arrival and received signal strength based fingerprinting techniques. It is shown in simulations that the proposed hybrid approach outperform the stand-alone time-of-arrival techniques or received signal strength based fingerprinting techniques in the considered scenario. It is also found that the proposed approach offer better accuracy with larger distance between the located MT and the home BS.Literature Review:","answer":"The RSS approach includes two main methods: the path loss lognormal shadowing model to deduce a trilateration, and the RSS fingerprinting BIB002 . The first approach is used to estimate the distance between the serving BS and the UD based on a path loss lognormal shadowing model, as shown in Figure 5 . Then, trilateration is used to estimate the location of the UD using at least 3 serving BSs. On the other hand, the RSS-based fingerprinting firstly collects RSS fingerprints of a scene, as shown in Figure 6 , and then estimates the location of the UD by matching on-line measurements with the closest possible location that corresponds to measurements in a database BIB001 . Therefore for each possible location, ambiguity points could exist leading to high estimation errors in standalone positioning scenarios."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

The S-palmitoylation [23] is a post-translational modification on proteins by C 16 saturated-fatty acids (palmitic acids) covalently attached to certain cysteine residues via a thioester linkage (Figure 1-B) . The modification is reversibly catalyzed by protein acyltransferases and acylprotein thioesterases, and confers unique properties to the protein, such as membrane binding and targeting, immunoreactivity,Amino-acid sequence alignment of IFITM5, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 derived from mice. The conserved residues are highlighted in black. The three conserved cysteines are highlighted in red and numbered based on the sequence of IFITM5 (top) and IFITM3 (bottom). The residues unique in IFITM5 are highlighted in gray. The first and the second transmembrane domains, the extracellular sequences, and the cytoplasmic loop are indicated by arrows and denoted as TM1 and TM2, EC, and the CP loop, respectively. The TM domains were predicted by SOSUI. The aspartates at the C-terminal region in IFITM5 are shown in blue. B) The schematic illustration of the protein S-palmitoylation. The C 16 -palmitic acid is attached to cysteine via a thioester linkage. The palmitoylation and depalmitoylation are catalyzed by protein acyltransferases and acylprotein thioesterases, respectively. In this study, hydroxylamine, NH 2 OH, was used to reduce the thioester linkage. C) The amino acid sequence identity (similarity) among IFITM5, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 is summarized. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0075831.g001 and protein-protein interaction. The authors revealed that IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on three membrane proximal cysteines, Cys71 and Cys72 in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain, and Cys105 in the CP loop (Figure 1-A) [10] . In addition, IFITM3 lacking the S-palmitoylation is not clustered in the cell membrane and significantly diminishes the antiviral activity. Moreover, the cysteines in IFITM2, Cys70, Cys71, and Cys104 are also palmitoylated in the same manner, which affects the intracellular localization [24] . A resent study has revealed that murine IFITM1 has four cysteine residues (Cys49, Cys50, Cys83, and Cys103) for the S-palmitoylation, which is required for the antiviral activity and the protein stability [25] . The other IFITM family members also possess these cysteines (Figure 1-A) , and thus the role of the Spalmitoylation on the cysteines should be significant for the functions of IFITM proteins. Here, we focused on IFITM5, which is also known as bonerestricted IFITM-like (BRIL) protein [18] . Among the IFITM family proteins, IFITM5 is unique. (i) Expression of IFITM5: Unlike the other IFITM family proteins, the expression of IFITM5 is not induced by interferons because the region upstream of the ifitm5 gene lacks the interferon regulatory elements [26] . Furthermore, the expression of IFITM5 is mostly restricted to osteoblast cells [18, 19, 27] , while the other IFITM proteins are expressed ubiquitously (ii). Amino-acid sequence similarity: The amino acid sequence of IFITM5 is relatively dissimilar to IFITM1-3 proteins (~ 65% similarity), while IFITM1-3 proteins share ~ 85% similarity with each other (Figure 1 -C). In addition, IFITM5 has an aspartate-rich domain in the C-terminal region, which could be involved in calcium binding (Figure 1 -A) [26] . (iii) Role of IFITM5 in bone formation: The expression of IFITM5 is associated with mineralization during the bone formation process in osteoblast cells [18] [19] [20] [21] . Previous studies have confirmed the expression of IFITM5 in bone tissues in mice, rats, humans and tammar wallabies [2] . The ifitm5-gene knockout mice have smaller bones [19] . Moreover, the knockdown of the ifitm5 gene by small hairpin RNA induces a decrease in bone nodule formation, whereas overexpression of the gene in UMR106 cells has been shown to increase calcium uptake and bone nodule formation [18] . (iv) Role of IFITM5 for immune activity: Recent studies have revealed that IFITM5 interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-the prostaglandin F2 receptor negative regulator (FPRP) complex [28] . When the complex is formed, the expressions of 5 interferon-induced genes are induced, including bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (Bst2), interferon inducible protein 1 (Irgm), interferoninduced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (Ifit3), b(2)microglobulin (B2m), and MHC class I antigen gene. Consequently, these results indicate that IFITM5 is involved not only in the bone formation but also in the immune system activity. In this study, we investigated the S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 and its role in the interaction with FKBP11 in mouse osteoblast cells. Cells transfected by a plasmid DNA encoding mouse IFITM5 were grown in the presence of an established chemical reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) [29, 30] , or an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP) [31] . The biochemical assays using these compounds revealed that the wild-type IFITM5 is S-palmitoylated. To identify the Spalmitoylation site in IFITM5, we prepared cysteine-substituted mutants, IFITM5-C86A, -C52A/C53A, and -C52A/53A/86A (Cys-less). The chemical reporter assay suggested that at least two out of three cysteines in IFITM5 are S-palmitoylated. The interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was examined by immunoprecipitation assay, resulting in the loss of the interaction in the presence of 2BP. The same result was obtained in the two mutants, C52A/C53A and Cys-less. These results suggested that the S-palmitoylation on Cys52 and/or Cys53 in the TM1 domain of IFITM5 is necessary for the interaction with FKBP11. On the other hand, Cys86 in the CP loop of IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated but not involved in the interaction. Because this interaction is important for the immunologically relevant gene expression, it was indicated that the role of the S-palmitoylation is to promote the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 and to regulate the immune activity in the osteoblast cells. The possible interaction mechanism and the effect of the S-palmitoylation on the bone nodule formation will be discussed. For mammalian cell expression, plasmid vectors of wild-type IFITM5 (IFITM5-WT) and FLAG-fused FKBP11 (FKBP11-FLAG) were constructed by inserting the cloned genes into a pBApo-CMV Neo expression vector (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The details of the recombinant DNA constructs were the same as described previously [19] . The genes of IFITM5 mutants (IFITM5-C86A, -C52A/53A, and -C52A/C53A/C86A (Cys-less)) were prepared using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid vectors of FLAG-fused IFITM5-WT, -C52A/53A, and Cys-less were constructed by inserting the cloned genes into the pBApo-CMV Neo expression vector. For E. coli cell expression, the plasmid vector of IFITM5-WT was constructed by inserting the cloned gene into a pET22b (Novagen, Madison, WI) expression vector. The forward primer 5'-GGAATTCCATATGGACACTTCATATCCCCGTG-3' and the reverse primer 5'-CCGCTCGAGGTTATAGTCCTCCTCATCAAACTTGG-3' were used to amplify the gene encoding the entire IFITM5 from the plasmid vector for mammalian cell expression described above. The underlined letters denote an NdeI and an XhoI cleavage site, respectively. The plasmids of IFITM5 mutants were prepared using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The sense and anti-sense primers used were 5'-GGCAGTATGGCTCCAAAGCCAAGGCGTACAACATCCTGG CTGC-3' and 5'-GCAGCCAGGATGTTGTACGCCTTGGCTTTGGAGCCATACT GCC-3' for IFITM5-C86A; and 5'-GCACGATGTACCTGAATCTGGCGGCGCTTGGATTCCTGG CGC-3' and 5'-GCGCCAGGAATCCAAGCGCCGCCAGATTCAGGTACATCG TGC-3' for IFITM5-C52A/C53A, respectively (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Osteoblast-like MC3T3 cells were provided by the RIKEN, Cell Bank (RCB 1126). The procedures for cell culture, transfection, and protein expression were the same as reported previously. When necessary, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP; Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 99.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Wako) and added to differentiation medium at concentrations of 100 μM and 50 μM in less than 0.1% DMSO, respectively [30, 31] . Wild-type and mutant IFITM5 proteins were also produced using an E. coli recombinant expression system. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed by the expression plasmid were grown at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin. After four-hour induction by 1 mM isopropyl β-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,400 × g for 10 min at 4°C). The cells were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) and disrupted by a French press (Ohtake, Tokyo, Japan) (100 MPa × 4 times). The crude membrane fraction was collected by ultracentrifugation (178,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C). The collected fraction was solubilized with 1.5% n-dodecyl-β-Dmaltopyranoside (DDM) (Dojindo Lab, Kumamoto, Japan) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. After the ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with Ni 2+ -NTA agarose resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The resin was applied to a chromatography column and washed with 50 mM imidazole containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.3 M NaCl and 0.1% DDM. The DDM-solubilized IFITM5 was collected by elution with the same buffer containing 0.3 M imidazole. The sample media were replaced by the appropriate buffer solution by two passages over a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare UK, Ltd., Amersham Place, England). The experimental details are described in previous reports [19, 28] . Briefly, total proteins were extracted from the osteoblast cells which co-expressed IFITM5 and FKBP11-FLAG using a total protein extraction kit (BioChain Institute Inc., Newark, CA). Then, the cell lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C for 2 h. To recover FKBP11-FLAG, 500 ng/μL 3 × FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in Tris-buffered saline was added to the collected gel at 4°C for 1 h. The recovered proteins and the cell lysate containing total proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% ePAGEL; ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and western blot. The anti-IFITM5 polyclonal antibody, which was prepared from the amino-terminal peptide sequence (TSYPREDPRAPSSRC), and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as primary antibodies. The HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) and goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies for the anti-IFITM5 and anti-FLAG primary antibodies, respectively. The proteins were detected by chemiluminescent reaction (MercK-Millipore, Billerica, MA). The cell lysate extracted from the osteoblast cells metabolically labeled by 17-ODYA was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose gel to obtain purified FLAG-fused IFITM5 proteins. The 17-ODYA-labeled proteins were chemically labeled with azide-PEG 3 -5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA-azide; Click Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale, AZ) with reference to previous studies [10, 29, 30, 32] and the manufacturer's guide. The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were visualized using a 532-nm laser for excitation and the fluorescence by TAMRA (565 nm) was detected using a 575nm long-path filter (Typhoon FLA 9000; GE Healthcare).Question: What regulates the antiviral activity of IFITM3?","answer":"S-palmitoylation on the protein"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

The larger of the BTV outer-capsid proteins, 'VP2', can be cleaved by proteases (including trypsin or chymotrypsin), forming infectious subviral particles (ISVP) which have enhanced infectivity for adult Culicoides, or KC cells (a cell-line derived from C. sonorensis). We demonstrate that VP2 present on purified virus particles from 3 different BTV strains can also be cleaved by treatment with saliva from adult Culicoides. The saliva proteins from C. sonorensis (a competent BTV vector), cleaved BTV-VP2 more efficiently than those from C. nubeculosus (a less competent/non-vector species). Electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified a trypsin-like protease in C. sonorensis saliva, which was significantly reduced or absent from C. nubeculosus saliva. Incubating purified BTV-1 with C. sonorensis saliva proteins also increased their infectivity for KC cells ~10 fold, while infectivity for BHK cells was reduced by 2-6 fold. Treatment of an 'eastern' strain of EHDV-2 with saliva proteins of either C. sonorensis or C. nubeculosus cleaved VP2, but a 'western' strain of EHDV-2 remained unmodified. These results indicate that temperature, strain of virus and protein composition of Culicoides saliva (particularly its protease content which is dependent upon vector species), can all play a significant role in the efficiency of VP2 cleavage, influencing virus infectivity. Saliva of several other arthropod species has previously been shown to increase transmission, infectivity and virulence of certain arboviruses, by modulating and/or suppressing the mammalian immune response. The findings presented here, however, demonstrate a novel mechanism by which proteases in Culicoides saliva can also directly modify the orbivirus particle structure, leading to increased infectivity specifically for Culicoides cells and, in turn, efficiency of transmission to the insect vector.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"cell-line\\", \\"KC cells\\", \\"BHK cells\\", \\"cells\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

A Veterans Administration cooperative study.Abstract 1:Schizophrenic patients referred for day treatment at the time of discharge from ten hospitals were randomly assigned to receive day treatment plus drugs or to receive drugs alone. They were tested before assignment and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months on social functioning, symptoms, and attitudes. Community tenure and costs were also measured. The ten day centers were described on process variables every six months for the four years of the study. Some centers were found to be effective in treating chronic schizophrenic patients and others were not. All centers improved the patients' social functioning. Six of the centers were found to significantly delay relapse, reduce sumptoms, and change some attitudes. Costs for patients in these centers were not significantly different from the group receiving only drugs. More professional staff hours, group therapy, and a high patient turnover treatment philosophy were associated with poor-result centers. More occupational therapy and a sustained nonthreatening environment were more characteristic of successful outcome centers.Title 2:A controlled study of transitional day care for non-chronically-ill patients.Abstract 2:The authors randomly assigned 79 inpatients with nonchronic schizophrenia or affective disorder to either an intensive experimental day program called \\"transitional treatment\\" or a control treatment--weekly clinically believed to require intensive posthospital treatment to make the transition to the community.

Networkpruning is a potential way to achieve this. However, it requires to start from a network which is much larger than necessary for the task at hand. This cancause a lot of computations wasted on those useless connections. In addition, network pruning is not able to learn the number of units and number of layers.In this paper, we assume that data are generated by a sparse probabilistic model with multiple layers of latent variables, and view the feed-forward network to be built as a way to approximate the relationships between the observed variables and the top-level latent variables in the probabilistic model. The level1 latent variables induce correlations among the observed variables. Therefore, it is possible to determine them by analysing how the observed variables are correlated. Similarly, by analysing how the level 1 latent variables are correlated, we can determine the level 2 latent variables, and so on. We empiricallyshow that our method can significantly reduce the number of parameters in FNNs, and the resulting model still achieves better or comparable results than FNNs in 17 classification tasks.Structure learning for deep neural network is a challenging and interesting research problem.We have proposed an unsupervised structure learning method which utilizes the correlation information in data for learning parsimonious deep feed-forward networks.In comparison with standard FNN, although the resulting model of our method contains much fewer parameters, it achieves better or comparable classification performance in all kinds of tasks.Our method is also shown to learn models with better interpretability, which is also an important problem in deep learning.In the future, we will generalize our method to other networks like RNNs and CNNs.","answer":"An unsupervised structure learning method for Parsimonious Deep Feed-forward Networks."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

However, variability in the measurements may limit physician confidence to direct revascularization therapies based on specific threshold values. This study evaluated the effects of rubidium-82 ((82)Rb) tracer injection profile using a constant - activity-rate (CA) vs a constant - flow-rate (CF) infusion to improve test-retest repeatability of MBF measurements. 22 participants underwent single-session (82)Rb dynamic PET imaging during rest and dipyridamole stress using one of 2 test-retest infusion protocols: CA - CA (n = 12) or CA - CF (n = 10). MBF was quantified using a single-tissue-compartment model (1TCM) and a simplified retention model (SRM). Non-parametric test-retest repeatability coefficients (RPCnp) were compared between groups. Myocardium-to-blood contrast and signal-to-noise ratios of the late uptake images (2 to 6 minutes) were also compared to evaluate standard myocardial perfusion image (MPI) quality. MBF values in the CA - CA group were more repeatable (smaller RPCnp) than the CA - CF group using the 1TCM at rest alone, rest and stress combined, and stress / rest reserve (21% vs 36%, 16% vs 19%, and 20% vs 27%, P < 0.05, respectively), and using the SRM at Rest and Stress alone, Rest and Stress combined, and stress / rest reserve (21% vs 38%, 15% vs 25%, 22% vs 38%, and 23% vs 49%, P < 0.05, respectively). In terms of image quality, myocardium-to-blood contrast and signal-to-noise ratios were not significantly different between groups. Constant - activity-rate 'square-wave' infusion of (82)Rb produces more repeatable tracer injection profiles and decreases the test-retest variability of MBF measurements, when compared to a constant- flow-rate 'bolus' administration of (82)Rb, especially with SRM, and without compromising standard MPI quality.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"MBF\\", \\"myocardial blood flow\\", \\"multi-vessel coronary artery disease\\", \\"micro-vascular disease\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"tracer\\", \\"rubidium-82\\", \\"(82)Rb\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"flow reserve\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"stress\\", \\"diagnose\\", \\"Stress\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"therapies\\", \\"u0027bolusu0027 administration\\", \\"injection profile\\", \\"infusion\\", \\"dynamic PET\\", \\"infusion protocols\\", \\"imaging\\", \\"evaluated\\", \\"revascularization\\", \\"PET\\", \\"administration profile\\", \\"injection profiles\\", \\"evaluate\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"single-tissue-compartment model\\", \\"myocardial perfusion image\\", \\"1TCM\\", \\"SRM\\", \\"MPI\\", \\"images\\", \\"simplified retention model\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"test-retest repeatability\\", \\"study\\", \\"test-retest\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Because the Bactec MGIT system has a higher random rate of false resistance to PZA than to other drugs, phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (pDST) is not carried out at all in many countries with a high incidence of TB (2, 3). Instead, WHO has concluded that pncA sequencing may be the most reliable method for ruling in PZA resistance (2). Because several targeted next-generation sequencing assays are being developed for direct testing of clinical samples and may be used as reflex tests for resistant cases diagnosed with point-of-care assays, pncA sequencing may soon become routine even in high-incidence settings (4, 5). In this scenario, the question becomes how to interpret these sequencing results and whether pDST is still needed. This is particularly challenging given that pncA is a nonessential gene, and there is no strong selection for particular resistance mutations, which means that a large spectrum of resistance variants is possible (e.g., 3,740 single nonsynonymous changes [6]).</p><p>We propose five groups of pncA mutations to inform the use of PZA and the role of additional pDST (Table 1). Group A comprises variants for which sufficient evidence exists to confidently classify them as associated with resistance and assumed to be causative of resistance. Group E encompasses mutations that are confidently not associated with resistance (i.e., neutral) (7). Routine pDST would not be needed to refine the classification of mutations in these groups. Mutations in groups B and D are likely only associated with resistance and likely neutral, respectively (i.e., additional evidence is needed before they can be moved to group A or E). Finally, group C is reserved for variants for which insufficient evidence exists.</p><p>Performance characteristics of nonsilent pncA mutations and proposal for clinical decision making and additional pDST</p><p>This proposal assumes the use of a high-quality sequencing technology and analysis pipeline with a negligible false-positive rate. All gDST results must be interpreted considering the likely PPV in light of the prevalence of PZA resistance for the strain in question (e.g., otherwise pan-susceptible strains versus MDR strains [29]). If there is a concern regarding the PPV of a pncA result because of the low prevalence of PZA resistance, resequencing would be the appropriate initial test to exclude a random sequencing error.</p><p>The regimen may play a role (e.g., some researchers do not consider PZA resistance to be an exclusion criterion for the standardized shorter MDR regimen, despite the current World Health Organization guidelines [30–32]).</p><p>Because of the prior evidence that links group A and B mutations with resistance, we recommend not to use PZA for MICs of >50 μg/ml. We even caution against relying on a single MIC of ≤50 μg/ml because of random errors (e.g., laboratory errors). In contrast, if multiple MICs suggest that a group A or B mutation may not be classified correctly, then these findings would have to be reviewed together with the data that underpinned the original classification to revise it if warranted. Additional types of data, such as those from the Wayne assay, may be needed in this context.</p><p>For an MIC of ≤50 μg/ml, PZA could be used and counted as effective; for 100 μg/ml, the result is uncertain (i.e., because cutoff errors are possible for pncA mutations), and we recommend to continue to avoid PZA or to use it without counting it as effective; an MIC of >100 μg/ml would be an exclusion criterion for use. Where resources are limited and not all group C mutations can be tested, locally frequent mutations should be prioritized to rapidly identify mutations that are neutral and may, consequently, result in a poor PPV in that setting. If sequencing results were shared in real time, the burden of testing could be shared between countries with low and high incidence and coordinated between laboratories (e.g., different laboratories could be encouraged to test different strains with the same mutation to minimize bias, which we were not able to control for in this review).</p><p>To detect resistance due to other mechanisms. It is not clear whether some mutations in other known resistance genes (e.g., panD or rpsA), let alone the yet-unknown mechanisms, also confer MICs close to the CC that would warrant testing 50 and 100 μg/ml for strains with group E mutations (the same consideration applies to strains that harbor no or only synonymous mutations). Until this question is clarified, we propose, if pDST is done at all, to test only the CC to minimize the misclassification of truly susceptible strains as uncertain (i.e., particularly in strains that are otherwise pan-susceptible and are unlikely to be monoresistant to PZA, with the exception of Mycobacterium canettii and most Mycobacterium bovis strains [29, 33–35]).</p>INTRODUCTION<p>In 2017, we published a systematic review that introduced a statistical approach using so-called interpretative best-confidence values (iBCVs) that relied on likelihood ratios to classify mutations based on categorical pDST data at the critical concentration (CC) or results of the Wayne assay (6). We set out to explore the limitations of our original approach in light of the most important studies in this area. In particular, we aimed to increase the limited sensitivity by including types of data that were beyond the scope of the original review (e.g., results from engineered strains, quantitative pDST results, and interpretative approaches based on alternative statistical methods) and six expert rules (see Supplementary methods in the supplemental material) (3, 8–14).</p><p>Using this approach, the sensitivity of just 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 54%) for group A and B mutations from the initial classification increased to 77% (95% CI, 76% to 79%) for the final classification (Table 1). This came at an apparent decrease in specificity from 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%) to 91% (95% CI, 90% to 92%). However, we believe that the latter figure is an underestimate of the true specificity.</p><p>First and foremost, 50% (95% CI, 44% to 56%) of the 257 phenotypically susceptible strains with group A or B mutations harbored 1 of 18 mutations with MICs that were likely close to the CC given that they displayed poor reproducibility for pDST (i.e., cutoff errors). Notably, 55% (95% CI, 46% to 64%) of the 128 strains had 1 of 2 mutations that were not associated with resistance based on their iBCV (i.e., group E mutations in the initial classification [see Supplementary methods]). Among them was pncA T47A, which is known to have arisen subsequent to the acquisition of isoniazid and rifampin resistance in the progenitor of the Beijing-W clone responsible for a multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB outbreak in New York in the 1990s (15). A total of 82 results were available for this mutation, which was resistant in only 30% (95% CI, 21% to 42%) of cases. This suggested that the mode of the MIC distribution for this mutation is likely identical to or slightly below the CC, which is in line with the experimentally determined MICs (3, 8, 16). I31T, the second group E mutation in the initial classification, was resistant in 38% (95% CI, 18% to 62%) of cases. In accordance with the fourth expert rule that even modest MIC should be considered clinically relevant, it was not only logical to upgrade these 18 mutations to group A or B but also to consider all 128 pDST results to be false susceptible. This increased the specificity to 95% (95% CI, 94% to 96%) (Table 1).</p><p>In fact, it is plausible that most if not all group A and B mutations are true markers of resistance given that 14% (95% CI, 8% to 21%) of the 129 remaining strains tested phenotypically susceptible despite having a loss-of-function (LoF) mutation, contrary to the second expert rule. Assuming that these are false-susceptible results, as opposed to sequencing errors (i.e., using a composite reference of pDST and all group A and B mutations), this would increase the specificity to 100% with an associated sensitivity of 79% (95% CI, 78% to 81%) (Table 1).</p><p>Because of the possibility of cutoff errors (i.e., that mutations are misclassified as neutral if only few pDST results are available), only 11 mutations met the criteria for group D or E. It is, therefore, possible that some of the group C mutations are neutral. Nevertheless, including all 122 group C mutations would increase the sensitivity to 85% (95% CI, 84% to 86%) while reducing the specificity only marginally to 98% (95% CI, 97% to 99%) (Table 1). This supports earlier findings that the vast majority of nonsynonymous mutations in pncA cause resistance (1, 17).</p><p>In summary, false resistance, alternative resistance mechanisms, and low-frequency pncA mutations that are missed by standard Sanger sequencing have all been recognized as challenges for DST for PZA (17, 18). In contrast, false-susceptible results due to cutoff errors are understood less well. This is likely because laboratories in low-incidence settings that routinely conduct pDST for PZA usually do not encounter the same mutation sufficiently often to notice this phenomenon (the Beijing-W outbreak in New York is a notable exception). To minimize this risk, we propose two measures that would have to be tested in larger retrospective and prospective studies.</p><p>First, any new mutation within 40 bp upstream of pncA or nonsilent coding mutation that does not already meet the criteria for one of the remaining groups (e.g., LoF mutations) could be classified as a group C mutation and assumed to confer PZA resistance until disproven (i.e., PZA could either be avoided or used but not counted as effective). In effect, this would be similar to the recommendation by WHO to infer resistance to other drugs using targeted genotypic DST (gDST) assays when they do not detect a specific resistance mutation (e.g., when a wild-type probe for line probe assays [LPAs] does not bind [19, 20]). As is the case with resistance-inferred results with LPAs, this policy for pncA will result in poor positive predictive values (PPVs) in settings where strains with a neutral nonsilent mutation are frequent. This could be minimized by monitoring the frequencies of mutations and prioritizing pDST for dominant mutations when resources are limited (Table 1).</p><p>As a second measure, we propose that a CC of 100 μg/ml could be adopted as an area of technical uncertainty (ATU), as defined by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), by testing 50 μg/ml in addition to 100 μg/ml (2, 21, 22). MICs of ≤50 μg/ml may be interpreted as susceptible, 100 μg/ml as uncertain, and >100 μg/ml as resistant, depending on the pncA mutation (Table 1).</p><p>We note, however, that these proposals rest on two assumptions. First, it is not clear whether the current CC of 100 μg/ml actually corresponds to the epidemiological cutoff value (ECOFF) (8). Rather than addressing this question using the current MGIT protocol, we recommend that, pending further head-to-head comparisons, one of the protocols that have been shown to reduce the random false resistance rate be adopted as the standard protocol for MGIT testing for PZA, which would be used to rigorously define the ECOFF (3, 23–25). Indeed, it is possible that an optimized MGIT protocol may reduce the degree of overlap between MIC distributions and, therefore, the need for an ATU, as recently proposed for rifampin (26). Second, the current CC is used as a clinical breakpoint, as defined by EUCAST, even though pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical data have not been systematically assessed (e.g., it is possible that the current dose of PZA is not optimal even for strains that do not have elevated MICs or that a higher dose may compensate for modest MIC increases) (27, 28).</p><p>Supplemental material is available online only.</p>","answer":"False-susceptible phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (DST) results for pyrazinamide due to mutations with MICs close to the critical concentration (CC) confound the classification of pncA resistance mutations, leading to an underestimate of the specificity of genotypic DST. This could be minimized by basing treatment decisions on well-understood mutations and by adopting an area of technical uncertainty for phenotypic DST rather than only testing the CC, as is current practice for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In humans, alteration of the tumor suppressor gene, APC, causes adenomatous polyposis coli, a condition causing predisposition to colorectal cancer. The syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Ocular examination revealed that patients expressing CHRPE tend to cluster within specific families. The exact APC mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients. In all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein. The extent of CHRPE was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence. CHRPE lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9, but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon. Thus, the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of APC mutations..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"APC\\", \\"congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium\\", \\"CHRPE\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"colorectal cancer\\", \\"adenomatous polyposis coli\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

During the twentieth century, cases of acute febrile disease with renal compromise were described from several Eurasian countries and Japan, often in association with military engagements [15] . HFRS as a distinct syndrome, however, was first brought to the attention of western medicine in association with an outbreak that occurred among United Nations troops during the Korean conflict between 1951 and 1954, where more than 3,200 soldiers were afflicted [16] . It took more than two decades until the etiologic agent, Hantaan virus (HTNV), was isolated from the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius, detected in part by the binding of antibodies from patient serum samples to the lung tissues of healthy, wild-caught field mice [17, 18] . The virus was later found to represent the type species of a new genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae, although it was later apparent that the first hantavirus to be isolated was the shrew-borne Thottapalayam virus [19] . The categorization of hantaviruses as belonging to the family Bunyaviridae is due in part to the consistent presence of three RNA genomes that are circularized in vivo as a result of the presence of terminal complementary nucleotides that help fold the genome into a -hairpin‖ morphology, first described for the Uukuniemi phlebovirus [19, 20] . Table 1 is a list of the predominant, serologically distinct pathogenic hantaviruses. Many other named genotypes are described, but such other pathogenic forms are generally closely related to Andes or, in some cases, Sin Nombre virus. During virus maturation, the precursor form GPC is processed using a membrane -bound protease into Gn and Gc, a cleavage that occurs, and appears to be signaled, after the conserved peptide signal WAASA at the C-terminal of Gn [24] . Although the two proteins can be expressed independently through transfection, they can be retained in the wrong cellular compartment (ER or aggresome); they thus must be co-expressed to allow them stability so that the two can be assembled correctly in the Golgi [25, [27] [28] [29] . A number of activities and properties have been identified for the hantavirus envelope glycoproteins, including some features that are suspected to be involved in the pathogenicity of the disease-causing serotypes, a possibility that has engendered experimental attention. The glycoproteins are the known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors, the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor, or DAF [30, 31] ; with gC1qR/p32 also identified as another potential entry receptor [32] . Comparisons with the tick-borne encephalitis virus E protein, led Tischler et al. to consider the Gc glycoprotein as a potential class II fusion protein, perhaps imparting fusion activity to the virion, and this hypothesis has gained support in other studies [33, 34] . Additional activities have been identified with, or claimed to be related to, Gn. For many of these studies, an underlying premise has held that there are differences between the glycoproteins of -pathogenic‖ hantaviruses relative to viruses in the genus that are dubbed to be -non-pathogenic‖. While it is true that it has not yet been possible to link Prospect Hill virus (PHV) to human disease, the absence of evidence for its pathogenicity should perhaps not be equated with the evidence of its absence. One might only consider that the level of disease (e.g., lethargy, fever, proteinuria, and azotemia) associated with infection of nonhuman primates by PHV is not significantly different from that recorded for nonhuman primate models using the known-pathogen Puumala virus (PUUV) [35, 36] . For the purpose of this discussion we will presume that apathogenic hantaviruses are indeed apathogenic. While some studies have suggested that Gn glycoproteins are directed more rapidly into the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway than are apathogenic forms, others have interpreted differences in the handling of Gn glycoproteins across hantavirus species by the ubiquitin-proteosomal system as independent of pathogenicity [37] [38] [39] . Some investigators have directed their efforts toward identifying a differential capacity, either kinetic or in absolute magnitude, in the ability of pathogenic and apathogenic hantaviruses to elicit an interferon response in cells. One premise that emerges is that apathogenic forms would tend to induce an earlier innate response that would render it more likely that the virus would be quickly cleared or rendered less competent in its replication so as to blunt any pathological response in the host [40] [41] [42] . The anti-hantavirus innate response can in some cases be attributed to viral interaction as a ligand of TLR-3, but not in others, and in endothelial cells, it appears not to require more than the viral particle itself, even when introduced in replication-incompetent form [43, 44] . Proteins and mRNAs prominently induced by hantaviruses include MxA and IFIT-1 (ISG-56) and others including some with known or suspected anti-viral activity. Those hantaviruses, often highly pathogenic strains, that fail to induce a potent antiviral response, are suspected or presumed to have a (more) potent interferon-pathway antagonism mechanism relative to other viruses, a mechanism that acts positively to prevent an effective innate response from forming, at least early in infection [42, 45] . Yet some instances are reported wherein highly pathogenic hantaviruses, such as SNV, are also able to induce expression of interferon-stimulated gene mRNAs, even very early in infection, with ISG proteins, as expected, taking longer to appear in the cell [44] . Anti-interferon activities have also been attributed to the NSs protein that may be elaborated in cells infected by serotypes that encode this protein [46] . Other investigators have examined the activities of hantavirus glycoproteins and other proteins that might themselves directly affect some aspects of the pathogenic progression associated with hantavirus infection of humans, such as vascular permeability changes. While early attempts to directly cause increases in permeability of endothelial monolayers with viral particles or viral infection were largely disappointing, hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating VEG-F-induced endothelial permeability [47, 48] . The shorter (50-kD) nucleocapsid or N protein is a structural component of the viral nucleocapsid, along with the genomic viral RNA segments. As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments with high affinity [49, 50] , it limits the access of the RNA to host nucleases and helps to render viral replication a closed process within the cytoplasm. It also acts as a peripheral membrane protein, as does the L protein [51] , an activity that could play a role in its presumed, but not yet demonstrated function as matrix [52] . Until recently, it had not been appreciated that N has a wide variety of other activities, some of which can be linked, not only to fundamental requirements of replication, but also to the interference with an array of the intracellular processes of the normal cell. Thus, an interaction between the amino terminus of the hantavirus N protein and the cellular protein Daxx has been proposed, with the suggestion of potential pro-apoptotic consequences [51] . N is also reported to interact with actin microfilaments, and the SUMO-1 protein [53, 54] . Using reporter-gene based assays, Connie Schmaljohn and her colleagues have reported that Hantaan virus' nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B). The effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS [55] . In the cytoplasm of infected cells, N protein can be found in cellular P bodies where it sequesters and protects 5' caps. It may locate the caps through its interaction with DCP1, a key constituent of P bodies. During hantavirus infection, the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies, through their interaction with N and DCP1. The N protein demonstrates preferential protection of mRNAs engineered to prematurely terminate their encoded protein in comparison to native mRNAs [56] . N protein has been increasingly linked to viral replication and translation, sometimes in previously unanticipated ways. It is among a growing family of diverse viral proteins that can serve as a nonspecific -RNA chaperone‖, an activity that should facilitate the L polymerase's access to vRNA for transcription and replication, in that it can transiently dissociate misfolded RNA structures [57] . Some of N protein's effects on translation might not immediately be recognized to be adaptive in nature. It can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex, simultaneously presenting the ribosome with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eIF 4E, binding to the 43S pre-initiation complex as does eIF 4G, while replacing the helicase activity of eIF 4A, which is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure [56, 58] . These three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation. In P bodies, N protein's ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides, along with its activity in protecting capped RNAs from degradation likely facilitates the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation by L polymerase (-cap snatching‖). Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi [27] . The N proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions, and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that N tracks along microtubules but not with actin filaments [52] . The ultimate destination for N, for its assembly into viral particles is the Golgi, and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), also known as vesicular-tubular cluster [52] . A dominant negative inhibitor, dynamitin, associated with dynein-mediated transport, reduced N's accumulation in the Golgi. Later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to Old World hantaviruses such as HTNV, but that the New World hantavirus ANDV is instead associated with actin filaments [59] . However, recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the New World hantavirus SNV [60] . Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression ( Table 2 ). The pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is the topic of a continuously-updated review in the series UpToDate [61] . By the time symptoms appear in HCPS, both strong antiviral responses, and, for the more virulent viral genotypes, viral RNA can be detected in blood plasma or nucleated blood cells respectively [63, 64] . At least three studies have correlated plasma viral RNA with disease severity for HCPS and HFRS, suggesting that the replication of the virus plays an ongoing and real-time role in viral pathogenesis [65] [66] [67] . Several hallmark pathologic changes have been identified that occur in both HFRS and HCPS. A critical feature of both is a transient (~ 1-5 days) capillary leak involving the kidney and retroperitoneal space in HFRS and the lungs in HCPS. The resulting leakage is exudative in character, with chemical composition high in protein and resembling plasma. The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses. It is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. The virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia, a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections [62, 63] . By the time that secondary viremia emerges, the agents of the more severe forms of HFRS and HCPS have begun to achieve sufficient mass as to induce, through PAMP-PRR interactions and other means, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [64] . For HCPS, that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs, yet, for unknown reasons, spares the retroperitoneum and, in general, the kidney. In HFRS the situation is reversed, and yet it is often not appreciated that the expected preferential tissue tropism of HFRS-associated viruses and their HCPS-associated counterparts for the renal and pulmonary beds, respectively, is not as one would predict through the manifestations of the two diseases. Local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms, with those abnormalities sometimes culminating in shock and death. Yet it is not hypoxemia, due to the prominent pulmonary edema, that leads to death in most fatal cases of HCPS, but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators that leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome [64, 65] . It is tempting to speculate that mediators produced in the lung in connection with the inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in HCPS, a disadvantageous consequence of the close anatomic juxtaposition of the two organs. Thus, at least three classes of potential mechanisms, some overlapping and all certainly nonexclusive of the others, could be presumed to underlie the pathogenesis of HCPS. These include:(1) Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) with the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 [43] . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells [66] and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells [67] .Question: What did a review of ancient Chinese writings in 960 AD, reveal?","answer":"descriptions closely resembling hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), the syndrome caused by Old World hantaviruses"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

The standard protocol comprised STIR and T1w sequences. All patients who showed typical signs of bone metastases were included in the study. Evaluation of the images was performed by the calculation of the number of metastases by three independent readers and by visual assessment on a 4-point scale.(RESULTS) 86 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The total number of metastases was significantly higher on T1w than on STIR images at both field strengths (p<0.05). T1w revealed a sensitivity of 99.72% (3 T) and 100.00% (1.5 T) versus STIR with 70.99 % (3 T) and 79.34 % (1.5 T). In 53% (38/72) of all patients, STIR detected fewer bone metastases in comparison with T1w at 3 T. At 1.5 T, STIR showed inferior results in 37.5 % (18/48) of all patients. Qualitative analysis indicated a significantly better lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation and an improved image quality on T1w compared to STIR imaging at both field strengths (p<0.05) with similar results for T1w at 1.5 T and 3 T, but inferior results for STIR especially at 3 T.Question:MR Diagnosis of Bone Metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T: Can STIR Imaging Be Omitted?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

It integrates the character sequence features with all subsequences information matched from a lexicon. The matched subsequences serve as information shortcut tunnels which link their start and end characters directly. Gated units are used to control the contribution of multiple input links. Through formula derivation and comparison, we show that the lattice LSTM is an extension of the standard LSTM with the ability to take multiple inputs. Previous lattice LSTM model takes word embeddings as the lexicon input, we prove that subword encoding can give the comparable performance and has the benefit of not relying on any external segmentor. The contribution of lattice LSTM comes from both lexicon and pretrained embeddings information, we find that the lexicon information contributes more than the pretrained embeddings information through controlled experiments. Our experiments show that the lattice structure with subword encoding gives competitive or better results with previous state-of-the-art methods on four segmentation benchmarks. Detailed analyses are conducted to compare the performance of word encoding and subword encoding in lattice LSTM. We also investigate the performance of lattice LSTM structure under different circumstances and when this model works or fails.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Neural machine translation (NMT) models typically operate with a fixed vocabulary, but translation is an open-vocabulary problem. Previous work addresses the translation of out-of-vocabulary words by backing off to a dictionary. In this paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, making the NMT model capable of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as sequences of subword units. This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively.","answer":"BPE is a data compression algorithm which iteratively merges the most frequent pair of bytes in a sequence as a new byte.

Plasma BNP concentrations are correlated with hyponatremia in severe TBI patients but not in mild and moderate TBI patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated ICP have a higher serum BNP level in first 4 days after injury.In average, the peak of BNP level was measured at 703.9 pg/mL±179.1 pg/mL on day 3 after injury, which was correlated to the severity of TBI. Among patients with severe TBI, plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with hyponatremia were statistically higher than those without hyponatremia (p<0.05). In the hyponatremic group, the plasma NT-proBNP increased to a peak of 1001.16 pg/mL±131.52 pg/mL within 48 hours after injury and maintained at a high level for 3 days. In the normonatremic group, the plasma NT-proBNP reached a peak of 826.43 pg/mL±337.43 pg/mL on day 5 and quickly decreased thereafter. In addition, we found plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with ICP>15 mm Hg were significantly higher than those in patients with ICP≤15 mm Hg (p<0.01).There is emerging evidence to suggest that brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated after acute brain injury, and that it may play an adaptive role in recovery through augmentation of cerebral blood flow (CBF).hBNP improves neurological function in murine models of TBI and ICH, and was associated with enhanced CBF and downregulation of neuroinflammatory responses. hBNP may represent a novel therapeutic strategy after acute CNS injury.Here, we describe 2 cases of CSW in TBI patients with elevated BNP levels.These patients with TBI had findings consistent with CSW with elevated BNP levels in the setting of normal cardiac function.We measured NT-proBNP levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 14 patients suffering from severe TBI (GCS15 mm Hg (n=6), the serum (800+/-150 pg/mL) and CSF levels (55+/-9 pg/mL) of NT-proBNP were significantly increased after 24 h, as compared to patients with ICP15 mm Hg.BNP plasma concentrations are elevated shortly after head injury and are continuously elevated during the acute phase in patients with more extensive SAH and in those with elevated ICP, and correlate with poor outcomes.BACKGROUND: According to the literature, serum beta-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have been shown to increase in adult trauma patients, specifically for those with traumatic brain injury and in those with intracranial hemorrhage.","answer":"Brain natriuretic peptide concentrations are elevated in patients with traumatic brain during the acute phase and correlate with poor outcomes.

An example of the typical content of such volumes is shown in Figure 1. All the volumes processed by the network have fixed size of 128times 128times 64 voxels and a spatial resolution of 1times 1times 1.5 millimeters. During every training iteration, we fed as input to the network randomly deformed versions of the training images by using a dense deformation field obtained through a 2times 2times 2 grid of control-points and B-spline interpolation. This augmentation has been performed ”on-the-fly”, prior to each optimisation iteration, in order to alleviate the otherwise excessive storage requirements. Additionally we vary the intensity distribution of the data by adapting, using histogram matching, the intensity distributions of the training volumes used in each iteration, to the ones of other randomly chosen scans belonging to the dataset. We trained our method on 50 MRI volumes, and the relative manual ground truth annotation, obtained from the ”PROMISE2012” challenge dataset [7]. This dataset contains medical data acquired in different hospitals, using different equipment and different acquisition protocols. The data in this dataset is representative of the clinical variability and challenges encountered in clinical settings. As previously stated we massively augmented this dataset through random transformation performed in each training iteration, for each mini-batch fed to the network. The mini-batches used in our implementation contained two volumes each, mainly due to the high memory requirement of the model during training. We used a momentum of 0.99 and a initial learning rate of 0.0001 which decreases by one order of magnitude every 25K iterations. We tested V-Net on 30 MRI volumes depicting prostate whose ground truth annotation was secret. All the results reported in this section of the paper were obtained directly from the organisers of the challenge after submitting the segmentation obtained through our approach. The test set was representative of the clinical variability encountered in prostate scans in real clinical settings [7]. In this work we present our approach to medical image segmentation that leverages the power of a fully convolutional neural networks, trained end-to-end, to process MRI volumes.Differently from other recent approaches we refrain from processing the input volumes slice-wise and we propose to use volumetric convolutions instead. We propose a novel objective function based on Dice coefficient maximisation, that we optimise during training.We demonstrate fast and accurate results on prostate MRI test volumes and we provide direct comparison with other methods which were evaluated on the same test data 111Detailed results available on http://promise12.grand-challenge.org/results/.Question: Can we enclose all appearances of prostate MRI volumes?","answer":"Due to the training/testing and augmentation on the diverse set of prostate scans all appearances of prostate can be encoded with V-Net."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In our previous study, we demonstrated that the sensitivity of detection was greatly improved when the peptides were coupled to a carrier molecule such as BSA prior to immobilisation onto a solid surface (Casey et al., 2006). This strategy was adopted to test peptides Eb1-4 and H1. A set of 40 clinical samples that were classified as EBV seropositive (n = 16), seronegative (n = 16) or potentially cross-reactive sera (n = 8) were assessed for reactivity with Eb1-4 and H1 peptides individually. The cut-off level was defined as the mean optical density of the seronegative samples plus 3 standard deviations shown as a line on the graphs in Fig. 5. Readings above this level were defined as positive and below this level negative. The same set of samples were analysed on BSA alone and these values were subtracted from the peptide-BSA conjugate readings and the corrected absorbance readings were plotted individually for our new peptides Eb1-4 and H1 in Fig. 5. There was a clear difference in the detection of seropositive antibodies by all the peptides (Fig. 5A-E) compared with the analysis of BSA alone (Fig. 5F), with the majority of absorbance readings above the cut-off level. We compared the ability of our panel of peptide mimotopes to be recognised by antibodies in the same set of seropositive samples in Fig. 6A and the sensitivity of detection is shown in Fig. 6B. We also included F1 and Gp125 mimotopes specific for two mAbs in our previous study (Casey et al., 2006). Of the peptides identified from polyclonal sera Eb1, Gp125 and F1 had the highest sensitivity (94%). Slightly lower sensitivity was observed for Eb2, 3 and 4 (88%) and H1 peptide had the lowest sensitivity (81%) as summarised in Fig. 6B. The sensitivity of F1 and Gp125 was similar to that produced by the mimotopes selected in our previous study, 95% for F1 and 92% for Gp125.Fig. 5Evaluation of peptides Eb1-4 and H1 coupled to BSA as EBV diagnostic reagents. Human serum (n = 40) previously analysed using a diagnostic test for VCA IgM was allowed to react with the peptides and the bound IgM antibodies were detected using anti-human IgM HRP. The absorbance readings for 1 (positive), 2 (negative) and putative cross-reactive sera for 3 (Parvo), 4 (HSV), 5 (CMV) and 6 (RF) are plotted for (A) Eb1, (B) Eb2, (C) Eb3, (D) Eb4, (E) H1 and (F) BSA, respectively. The cut-off value is defined as the mean of the negative population +3SD indicated by a solid horizontal line; since there were no false positives, the specificity for each mimotope was 100%.Fig. 6Comparison of the reactivities of our panel of mimotopes Eb1-4, H1, F1 and Gp125 conjugated to BSA with EBV IgM-positive sera (n = 16) absorbance values are plotted and the cut-off levels are depicted by a horizontal line in (A). (B) Summary of the false-negative results from the 5/16 serum samples seropositive for IgM EBV and the overall sensitivity for each mimotope for diagnosis of EBV IgM antibodies.We also considered which seropositive EBV samples contained antibodies that did not recognise the panel of peptides, i.e. false-negative readings, listed in Fig. 6B. The antibodies in serum 1 (s1) were unreactive with all of the peptides identified in this study, s2 was not reactive with Eb3, Eb4 and H1 and s3 was unreactive with H1. Gp125 and F1 that were selected in our previous study were recognised by s1, 2 and 3; however, two different serum samples (s4 and 5) did not recognise F1 or Gp125, respectively. This demonstrates that individual peptides are not recognised by all EBV antibodies and confirms that different peptides are required to represent different epitopes. Therefore, a combination of Eb1 peptide F1 and Gp125 peptides could be recognised by antibodies present in all this set of EBV clinical samples resulting in 100% sensitivity.For the samples defined as EBV-seronegative, there were no readings above the cut-off level and therefore no false positives, resulting in 100% specificity. In addition, there were no absorbance readings above the cut-off levels for the potentially cross-reactive serum samples, inferring that the peptides identified in this study have high specificity for EBV antibodies.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"serum\\", \\"samples\\", \\"sera\\", \\"serum samples\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Herein, a viscoelastic model of the stresses during vocal fold contact is developed. This model assumes the cover to be a poroelastic structure wherein interstitial fluid translocates in response to mechanical squeezing. The maximum interstitial fluid pressure is found to generally increase with decreasing viscous dissipation and/or decreasing tissue elasticity. A global minimum in the total contact stress, comprising interstitial fluid pressure and elastic stress in the tissue, is observed over the studied dimensionless parameter range. Interestingly, physiologically reasonable estimates for the governing parameters fall within this global minimum region. The model is validated against prior experimental and computational work, wherein the predicted contact stress magnitude and impact duration agree well with published results. Lastly, observations of the potential relationship between vocal fold hydration and increased risk of tissue damage are discussed based upon model predictions of stress as functions of cover layer thickness and viscosity.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"layer\\", \\"vocal fold\\", \\"tissue\\", \\"cover\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"phonation\\", \\"viscous dissipation\\", \\"speech production\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"interstitial fluid\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"tissue elasticity\\", \\"stress\\", \\"hydration\\", \\"decreasing\\", \\"contact stress\\", \\"total contact stress\\", \\"stresses\\", \\"parameters\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"tissue damage\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"model\\", \\"viscoelastic model\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"Modeling\\", \\"observations\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

The proposed algorithm is based on a statistical model of short-term log-energy sequences for echo-free speech. Given a speech utterance recorded in a reverberant room, it computes a Maximum Likelihood estimate of the room full-band reverberation time. The estimation method is shown to require little data and to perform satisfactorily. The method has been successfully applied to robust automatic speech recognition in reverberant environments by model selection.

Striking examples of this relationship can be found in the somatosensory brainstem, thalamus, and cortex of rats and mice, where the arrangement of the facial whiskers is preserved in the arrangement of cell aggregates to form precise somatotopic maps. We show in simulation how realistic whisker maps can self-organize, by assuming that information is exchanged between adjacent cells only, under the guidance of gene expression gradients. The resulting model provides a simple account of how patterns of gene expression can constrain spontaneous pattern formation to faithfully reproduce functional maps in subsequent brain structures.Introduction:Karbowski and Ermentrout, 2004 developed a reaction-diffusion style model of how extrinsic signalling gradients can constrain the emergence of distinct fields from intrinsic cortical dynamics. Their model defines how the fraction of occupied synapses ci⁢( x, t) and the density of axon branches ai⁢( x, t) interact at time t, along a 1D anterior-posterior axis x, for N thalamocortical projections indexed by i. The model was derived from the assumption that the rates at which ai and ci grow are reciprocally coupled. Extending the original 1D model to simulate arealization on a 2D cortical sheet, we use ai⁢( 𝐱, t) and ci⁢( 𝐱, t), and model synaptogenesis as( 1) ∂⁡ci∂⁡t=-α⁢ci+β⁢( 1-∑j=1Ncj) ⁢[ai]k. Accordingly, where the total fraction of synaptic connections sums to one, connections decay at rate α. Otherwise, ci⁢( 𝐱, t) increases non-linearly( k>1) with the density of axon branching. Axon branching is modelled as( 2) ∂ai∂t= ∇ ⋅( D∇ai−ai∑j=1Mγi, j∇ρj( x) +χi) −∂ci∂t. The first term on the right describes the divergence( indicated by ∇⋅) of the quantity in parentheses, which is referred to as the ‘flux’ of axonal branching. The flux represents diffusion across the cortical sheet, at rate D, and the influence of M molecular signalling fields, ρ⁢( 𝐱). The influence of a given field( indexed by j) on a given thalamic projection( indexed by i), is determined by γi, j, which may be positive or negative in order that axons may branch in the direction of either higher or lower concentrations. Note that computing the divergence in simulation requires cells on the cortical sheet to communicate with immediately adjacent cells only( see Methods). Here χi=0 is a placeholder. The second term on the right represents the coupling between axon branching and synaptogenesis, and an assumption that the spatial distribution of synaptic density across the cortical sheet is broadly homogeneous. As such, the quantity ci can be thought of as the connection density.Discussion:The present results suggest that the key requirements for the emergence of realistic barrel patterning are( i) at each cortical location thalamocortical projections compete for a limited number of available synaptic connections( Equations 1–2),( ii) at each location the branching rate of a given projection is reduced by the density of other projections( Equation 3), and( iii) the branch density of each projection is conserved over time. The emergence of barrels in simulation required competition between thalamic projections in terms of synaptic connectivity and also competition in terms of cortical space, as represented by χ, with an implicit requirement for a self/other identifier amongst projections. This latter form of competition may account for the absence of barrels in rodents with larger brains, such as capybara, for which competition for space is presumably weaker( Woolsey et al., 1975). Hence, irrespective of whether barrels are necessary for adaptive whisker function, the emergence of somatotopically ordered modular structures may be an inevitable consequence of local competition for cortical territory driven by input from an array of discrete sensory organs( Purves et al., 1992). In reality, the Voronoi tessellation is extended by scores of smaller barrels alongside the E-row barrels, which represent the microvibrissae, and presumably form via the same competitive processes. Enforcing here the same boundary condition as used to represent the true edges of the barrel field was necessary to ensure the stability of the simulation, though we acknowledge that this region of the boundary was enforced primarily to keep the number of simulated projections, and hence the overall computational complexity of the simulation, manageable( simulating an extra projection introduces 13030 new dynamical variables). It is important to emphasize that the formulation of the model is entirely local, insofar as simulation requires no information to be communicated from a given cortical grid cell to any but those immediately adjacent( via diffusion). Hence the simulations demonstrate how a self-organizing system, constrained by genetically specified guidance cues and by the shape of the cortical field boundary, can faithfully reproduce an arrangement of cell aggregates in one neural structure as a topographic map in another. Moreover, the present results confirm that somatotopic map formation does not require the pre-specification of centre-points by as yet undetermined additional developmental mechanisms.","answer":"How does the brain wire itself up ? One possibility is that a precise genetic blueprint tells every brain cell explicitly how it should be connected to other cells . Another option is that complex patterns emerge from relatively simple interactions between growing cells , which are more loosely controlled by genetic instruction . The barrel cortex in the brains of rats and mice features one of the most distinctive wiring patterns . There , cylindrical clusters of cells – or barrels – are arranged in a pattern that closely matches the arrangement of the whiskers on the face . Neurons in a barrel become active when the corresponding whisker is stimulated . This precise mapping between individual whiskers and their brain counterparts makes the whisker-barrel system ideal for studying brain wiring . Guidance fields are a way the brain can create cell networks with wiring patterns like the barrels . In this case , genetic instructions help to create gradients of proteins across the brain . These help the axons that connect neurons together to grow in the right direction , by navigating towards regions of higher or lower concentrations . A large number of guidance fields could map out a set of centre-point locations for axons to grow towards , ensuring the correct barrel arrangement . However , there are too few known guidance fields to explain how the barrel cortex could form by this kind of genetic instruction alone . Here , James et al . tried to find a mechanism that could create the structure of the barrel cortex , relying only on two simple guidance fields . Indeed , two guidance fields should be enough to form a coordinate system on the surface of the cortex . In particular , it was examined whether the cortical barrel map could reliably self-organize without a full genetic blueprint pre-specifying the barrel centre-points in the cortex . To do so , James et al . leveraged a mathematical model to create computer simulations; these showed that only two guidance fields are required to reproduce the map . However , this was only the case if axons related to different whiskers competed strongly for space while making connections , causing them to concentrate into whisker-specific clusters . The simulations also revealed that the target tissue does not need to specify centre-points if , instead , the origin tissue directs how strongly the axons should respond to the guidance fields . So this model describes a simple way that specific structures can be copied across the central nervous system . Understanding the way the barrel cortex is set up could help to grasp how healthy brains develop , how brain development differs in certain neurodevelopmental disorders , and how brain wiring reorganizes itself in different contexts , for example after a stroke . Computational models also have the potential to reduce the amount of animal experimentation required to understand how brains are wired , and to cast light on how brain wiring is shaped by evolution ."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered quinpirole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day (P) 1 to P21. This drug treatment has been shown to produce long-term priming of the D2 receptor. Beginning on P62, rats were administered the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) or saline twice daily (i.p.) for 28 days. One day after olanzapine treatment ceased, rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) for seven consecutive days. Dopamine D2 receptor priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a D2 receptor-mediated event, before olanzapine was administered as well as after olanzapine treatment and behavioural testing were complete. Results showed that neonatal quinpirole treatment induced D2 priming that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. On the MWM place version, D2-primed rats demonstrated a significant impairment that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment, but olanzapine treatment to animals neonatally treated with saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the MWM. There were no significant deficits on the match-to-place version. Brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal NGF, BDNF and ChAT that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. Neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in BDNF and ChAT in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by olanzapine treatment. These results show that olanzapine eliminates D2 receptor priming and cognitive impairment and also alleviates decreases in neurotrophins and acetylcholinergic markers produced by D2 priming in the hippocampus.","answer":"[[\\"quinpirole\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"neurotrophic factor\\"], [\\"olanzapine\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"BDNF\\"], [\\"quinpirole\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"ChAT\\"], [\\"olanzapine\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"BDNF\\"], [\\"olanzapine\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"ChAT\\"], [\\"quinpirole\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"BDNF\\"], [\\"quinpirole\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"D2\\"], [\\"olanzapine\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"D2\\"], [\\"olanzapine\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"D2 receptor\\"], [\\"olanzapine\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"NGF\\"], [\\"quinpirole\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"NGF\\"], [\\"olanzapine\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"ChAT\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

specific immune response , for example vaccination with a tumour antigen   or with tumour antigen - loaded dendritic cells .ctla-4 ( cd 152 ) is a molecule expressed on t cells following activation and provides an internal mechanism by which t cells can limit or terminate an immune response .blockade of ctla-4 with an antagonist monoclonal antibody such as tremelimumab ( cp-675 , 206 ) promotes t cell activation   and inhibits the maintenance of self - tolerance .however , this loss of self - tolerance is not tumour specific and can lead to the development of a variety of autoimmune diseases , termed immune - related adverse events ( iraes ) .other strategies promoting generalized effector t cell activation such as the administration of ifn- and il-2 are also associated with the development of autoimmunity .two humanized ctla-4 monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab / mdx-010 ( medarex , bristol - myers squibb ) and tremelimumab ( cp-675 , 206 ) ( pfizer)are in clinical development for the treatment of a variety of malignancies including mm , renal cell , ovarian and colonic carcinoma .ipilimumab has been shown to induce a clinical response in a small minority of patients , but its use is associated with the development of a number of autoimmune phenomena including dermatitis , enterocolitis , hypophysitis and one case of nephritis [ 810 ] .enterocolitis is the most common irae observed affecting up to 20% of patients , and results in significant morbidity and mortality ( four bowel perforations , one colectomy and two deaths ) .high - dose steroid therapy settled symptoms in the majority of patients , without objectively reducing treatment response .interestingly , objective tumour regression was associated with the occurrence of enterocolitis , emphasising the non - specific nature of the break in self - tolerance achieved through use of ctla-4 antagonist antibodies . the antibody our patient received ( tremelimumab , cp-675 , 206 ) , whilst demonstrating anti - tumour activity in a phase i clinical trial , also resulted in the development of autoimmune disease   ( including enterocolitis , dermatitis , vitiligo , panhypopituitarism and autoimmune thyroid disease ) .the patient we have described developed vitiligo , nephritis and detectable levels of ana , presumably secondary to tremelimumab ( cp-675 , 206 ) associated immune dysregulation .the temporal relationship between drug administration and presentation would support this theory , as would the t lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate on renal biopsy , and prompt response to steroid therapy .( personal communication ) in one of their patients treated with ipilimumab followed an almost identical clinical course to the one we observed ( acute renal insufficiency , bland urinary sediment , interstitial nephritis on renal biopsy and prompt response to high - dose steroids ) .furthermore , other groups have reported similar histological findings in skin , bowel   and liver   biopsies from patients displaying presumed autoimmune toxicity following anti ctla-4 therapy .it is difficult to determine whether the lymphocytic interstitial infiltrate observed in our patient was secondary to an immune reaction to drug antigens or a drug - induced loss of tolerance to self - antigens .the latter theory would fit with the additional clinical findings of positive ana and vitiligo .regardless of the mechanism of immune dysregulation , however , early intervention with high - dose steroids has proven efficacious in patients experiencing other organ - threatening significant iraes .although the routine use of steroids in drug - induced interstitial nephritis is controversial , there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that early intervention with steroids after the culprit drug(s ) has been discontinued helps to minimize the risk of interstitial fibrosis and permanent renal insufficiency .if , as is more likely , the nephritis was autoimmune in nature , the benefit of steroid therapy is clear - cut with the wealth of literature surrounding the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , particularly lupus nephritis , supporting such a therapeutic approach .after an initial encouraging response to steroids , our patient 's renal function plateaued at a higher baseline , despite prompt steroid treatment . at this stage ,an alternative pathology was sought and , indeed , obstructive uropathy secondary to tumour burden was identified .an improvement in serum creatinine to original baseline was achieved with bilateral ureteric stenting , facilitating further chemotherapy administration in the form of dacarbazine .","answer":"targeted immune - modulating agents are entering clinical practice in many specialties , providing novel therapeutic possibilities but introducing new potential toxicities .  we present the first reported case , to our knowledge , of immune - mediated nephritis following the administration of tremelimumab ( cp-675 , 206 ) , an anti - cytotoxic t - lymphocyte - associated antigen 4 ( ctla-4 ) monoclonal antibody .  high - dose steroid therapy led to a rapid improvement in renal function , avoiding the need for renal replacement therapy ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

AIM To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of installing ventilation systems , and central heating if necessary , in homes of children with ' moderate ' or ' severe ' asthma . DESIGN AND SETTING An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pragmatic r and omised controlled trial of a tailored package of housing modifications design ed to improve ventilation and household heating in homes within Wrexham County Borough , Wales , UK . METHOD A total of 177 children aged between 5 and 14 years , identified from general practice registers , were studied . Parents reported on the quality of life of their children over a 12-month period . General practice s reported on health-service re sources used by those children , and their asthma-related prescriptions , over the same period . RESULTS The tailored package shifted 17 % of children in the intervention group from ' severe ' to ' moderate ' asthma , compared with a 3 % shift in the control group . The mean cost of these modifications was £ 1718 per child treated or £ 12300 per child shifted from ' severe ' to ' moderate ' . Healthcare costs over 12 months following r and omisation did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups . Bootstrapping gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) of £ 234 per point improvement on the 100-point PedsQL ™ asthma-specific scale , with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = £ 140 to £ 590 . The ICER fell to £ 165 ( 95 % CI = £ 84 to £ 424 ) for children with ' severe ' asthma . CONCLUSION This novel and pragmatic trial , with integrated economic evaluation , reported that tailored improvement of the housing of children with moderate to severe asthma is likely to be a cost-effective use of public re sources . This is a rare example of evidence for collaboration between local government and the NHSTitle 2:Retrofitting houses with insulation: a cost–benefit analysis of a randomised community trialAbstract 2:Background : Housing is an important environmental influence on population health , and there is growing evidence of health effects from indoor environment characteristics such as low indoor temperatures . However , there is relatively little research , and thus little firm guidance , on the cost-effectiveness of public policies to retrospectively improve the st and ards of houses . The purpose of this study was to value the health , energy and environmental benefits of retrofitting insulation , through assessing a number of forms of possible benefit : a reduced number of visits to GPs , hospitalisations , days off school , days off work , energy savings and CO2 savings . Methods : All these metrics are used in a cluster r and omised trial — the “ Housing , Insulation and Health Study ” —of retrofitting insulation in 1350 houses , in which at least one person had symptoms of respiratory disease , in predominantly low-income communities in New Zeal and . Results : Valuing the health gains , and energy and CO2 emissions savings , suggests that total benefits in “ present value ” ( discounted ) terms are one and a half to two times the magnitude of the cost of retrofitting insulation . Conclusion : This study points to the need to consider as wide a range of benefits as possible , including health and environmental benefits , when assessing the value for money of an intervention to improve housing quality . From an environmental , energy and health perspective , the value for money of improving housing quality by retrofitting insulation is compellingTitle 3:Retrofitting houses with insulation to reduce health inequalities: aims and methods of a clustered, randomised community-based trial.Abstract 3:This paper describes the purpose and methods of a single-blinded , clustered and r and omised trial of the health impacts of insulating existing houses . The key research question was whether this intervention increased the indoor temperature and lowered the relative humidity , energy consumption and mould growth in the houses , as well as improved the health and well-being of the occupants and thereby lowered their utilisation of health care . Households in which at least one person had symptoms of respiratory disease were recruited from seven predominantly low-income communities in New Zeal and . These households were then r and omised within communities to receive retrofitted insulation either during or after the study . Measures at baseline ( 2001 ) and follow-up ( 2002 ) included subjective measures of health , comfort and well-being and objective measures of house condition , temperature , relative humidity , mould ( speciation and mass ) , endotoxin , beta glucans , house dust mite allergens , general practitioner and hospital visits , and energy or fuel usage . All measurements referred to the three coldest winter months , June , July and August . From the 1352 households that were initially recruited , baseline information was obtained from 1310 households and 4413 people . At follow-up , 3312 people and 1110 households remained , an 84 % household retention rate and a 75 % individual retention rate . Final outcome results will be reported in a subsequent paper . The study showed that large trials of complex environmental interventions can be conducted in a robust manner with high participation rates . Critical success factors are effective community involvement and an intervention that is valued by the participantsTitle 4:Effect of insulating existing houses on health inequality: cluster randomised study in the communityAbstract 4:Objective To determine whether insulating existing houses increases indoor temperatures and improves occupants ' health and wellbeing . Design Community based , cluster , single blinded r and omised study . Setting Seven low income communities in New Zeal and . Participants 1350 households containing 4407 participants . Intervention Installation of a st and ard retrofit insulation package . Main outcome measures Indoor temperature and relative humidity , energy consumption , self reported health , wheezing , days off school and work , visits to general practitioners , and admissions to hospital . Results Insulation was associated with a small increase in bedroom temperatures during the winter ( 0.5 � C ) and decreased relative humidity ( −2.3 % ) , despite energy consumption in insulated houses being 81 % of that in uninsulated houses . Bedroom temperatures were below 10 � C for 1.7 fewer hours each day in insulated homes than in uninsulated ones . These changes were associated with reduced odds in the insulated homes of fair or poor self rated health ( adjusted odds ratio 0.50 , 95 % confidence interval 0.38 to 0.68 ) , self reports of wheezing in the past three months ( 0.57 , 0.47 to 0.70 ) , self reports of children taking a day off school ( 0.49 , 0.31 to 0.80 ) , and self reports of adults taking a day off work ( 0.62 , 0.46 to 0.83 ) . Visits to general practitioners were less often reported by occupants of insulated homes ( 0.73 , 0.62 to 0.87 ) . Hospital admissions for respiratory conditions were also reduced ( 0.53 , 0.22 to 1.29 ) , but this reduction was not statistically significant ( P=0.16 ) . Conclusion Insulating existing houses led to a significantly warmer , drier indoor environment and result ed in improved self rated health , self reported wheezing , days off school and work , and visits to general practitioners as well as a trend for fewer hospital admissions for respiratory conditionsTitle 5:Effects of improved home heating on asthma in community dwelling children: randomised controlled trialAbstract 5:Objective To assess whether non-polluting , more effective home heating ( heat pump , wood pellet burner , flued gas ) has a positive effect on the health of children with asthma . Design R and omised controlled trial . Setting Households in five communities in New Zeal and . Participants 409 children aged 6 - 12 years with doctor diagnosed asthma . Interventions Installation of a non-polluting , more effective home heater before winter . The control group received a replacement heater at the end of the trial . Main outcome measures The primary outcome was change in lung function ( peak expiratory flow rate and forced expiratory volume in one second , FEV1 ) . Secondary outcomes were child reported respiratory tract symptoms and daily use of preventer and reliever drugs . At the end of winter 2005 ( baseline ) and winter 2006 ( follow-up ) parents reported their child ’s general health , use of health services , overall respiratory health , and housing conditions . Nitrogen dioxide levels were measured monthly for four months and temperatures in the living room and child ’s bedroom were recorded hourly . Results Improvements in lung function were not significant ( difference in mean FEV1 130.7 ml , 95 % confidence interval −20.3 to 281.7 ) . Compared with children in the control group , however , children in the intervention group had 1.80 fewer days off school ( 95 % confidence interval 0.11 to 3.13 ) , 0.40 fewer visits to a doctor for asthma ( 0.11 to 0.62 ) , and 0.25 fewer visits to a pharmacist for asthma ( 0.09 to 0.32 ) . Children in the intervention group also had fewer reports of poor health ( adjusted odds ratio 0.48 , 95 % confidence interval 0.31 to 0.74 ) , less sleep disturbed by wheezing ( 0.55 , 0.35 to 0.85 ) , less dry cough at night ( 0.52 , 0.32 to 0.83 ) , and reduced scores for lower respiratory tract symptoms ( 0.77 , 0.73 to 0.81 ) than children in the control group . The intervention was associated with a mean temperature rise in the living room of 1.10 ° C ( 95 % confidence interval 0.54 ° C to 1.64 ° C ) and in the child ’s bedroom of 0.57 ° C ( 0.05 ° C to 1.08 ° C ) . Lower levels of nitrogen dioxide were measured in the living rooms of the intervention households than in those of the control households ( geometric mean 8.5 μg/m3 v 15.7 μg/m3 , P<0.001 ) . A similar effect was found in the children ’s bedrooms ( 7.3 μg/m3 v 10.9 μg/m3 , P<0.001 ) . Conclusion Installing non-polluting , more effective heating in the homes of children with asthma did not significantly improve lung function but did significantly reduce symptoms of asthma , days off school , healthcare utilisation , and visits to a pharmacist . Trial registration Clinical Trials NCT00489762Title 6:The health impacts of housing-led regeneration: a prospective controlled studyAbstract 6:Study objective : To evaluate self-reported changes in housing quality and health associated with housing-led area regeneration . Design : A prospect i ve study over 1 year using structured interviews with 50 households who moved to new housing and with 50 matched controls who did not move .  Setting and participants : Residents of two social rented housing schemes in the West of Scotl and . Results : Small but not statistically significant increases in levels of “ excellent ” or “ good ” self-reported health status were found in both groups . Both intervention and control groups experienced reductions in problems related to warmth , but no significant change in how they felt about their house . Conclusions : It is feasible to conduct prospect i ve controlled studies to evaluate the health effects of housing improvement using matched control groups . The absence of marked improvement in health after moving to new housing might be due to the small sample size or to the limited potential to improve health through this intervention aloneTitle 7:The Watcombe Housing Study: the short term effect of improving housing conditions on the health of residentsAbstract 7:Objective : To assess the short term health effects of improving housing . Design : R and omised to waiting list . Setting : 119 council owned houses in south Devon , UK . Participants : About 480 residents of these houses . Intervention : Upgrading houses ( including central heating , ventilation , rewiring , insulation , and re-roofing ) in two phases a year apart . Main outcome measures : All residents completed an annual health question  naire  : SF36 and GHQ12  ( adults ) . Residents reporting respiratory illness or arthritis were interviewed using condition-specific question naires , the former also completing peak flow and symptom diaries ( children ) or spirometry ( adults ) . Data on health service use and time lost from school were collected . Results : Interventions improved energy efficiency . For those living in intervention houses , non-asthma-related chest problems ( Mann – Whitney test , p = 0.005 ) and the combined asthma symptom score for adults ( Mann – Whitney test , z = 2.7 , p = 0.007 ) diminished significantly compared with control houses . No difference between intervention and control houses was seen for SF36 or GHQ12 . Conclusions : Rigorous study design s for the evaluation of complex public health and community based interventions are possible . Quantitatively measured health benefits are small , but as health benefits were measured over a short time scale , there may have been insufficient time for measurable improvements in general and disease-specific health to become apparentTitle 8:From local concern to randomized trial: the Watcombe Housing Project.Abstract 8:BACKGROUND A r and omized study of the effect on people 's  health of improving their housing is underway in Torbay . The link between poor health , particularly respiratory health , and poor housing conditions has been recognized for a long time , but there have been few intervention studies to demonstrate that improving housing can improve health . In 1994 , South and West Devon Health Authority set up a community development project in a deprived area of Torbay , in response to the concerns of local primary health-care workers . A community development worker helped local residents survey their homes for dampness and record their respiratory symptoms . The survey reported high levels of condensation/dampness and respiratory illness and the Council agreed to direct the majority of their housing improvement funds to the estate over the next 3 years . The Health Authority , University of Plymouth and Torbay Council were successful in obtaining funding to evaluate the housing improvements from the NHS R & D programme . PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS Of 119 houses eligible for the study , 50 were chosen at r and om and improved in the first year . The rest were improved the following year . Question naires screening for health problems were sent to all 580 residents and baseline surveys of the indoor environment were also carried out . More detailed health surveys were completed by community nurses visiting residents in their homes . All adults were asked to complete SF-36 and GHQ 12 question naires , as well as disease-specific question naires if appropriate . PROGRESS All houses in the study have now been improved , including insulation , double-glazing , re-roofing , heating , ventilation and electrical rewiring . Follow-up surveys are underway","answer":"When undertaken appropriately , economic evaluation provides the potential to make significant contributions to housing policy"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

correlation function decays as power - law  @xcite . on the other hand , in the ground state a long - range order with the partially ordered structure , characterized by two sublattices of opposite magnetizations and one sublattice of zero magnetization , can occur if the spin is larger than some critical value  @xcite .the upper bound of this critical value was estimated by the use of peierls argument  @xcite as 62 and the precise value was established by monte carlo simulations  @xcite as 11/2 .the emergence of the long - range order was argued to arise as a result of a drastic change in the ground - state degeneracy as well as some other physical quantities of this frustrated spin system with the increasing spin magnitude .nevertheless , the large degeneracy can be lifted by some perturbations , such as an external magnetic field  @xcite or selective dilution  @xcite , which have been shown to lead to long - range ordering even in the highly frustrated spin-1/2 system . for ising models with spin larger that 1/2 a single - ion anisotropy is another parameter that may play a crucial role in their critical properties ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in the present paperwe show that this is also the case for the current model and demonstrate how the inclusion of the single - ion anisotropy can change the above scenario .we show that even a small amount of the single - ion anisotropy leads to a partially ordered phase at low temperatures , while different critical phase of the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type  @xcite , characterized by a power - law decay of the spin correlation function , persists at higher temperatures .we consider the ising model described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an ising spin on the @xmath2th lattice site , @xmath3 denotes the sum over nearest neighbors , @xmath4 is the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction parameter , and @xmath5 is the single - ion anisotropy parameter .we perform standard monte carlo ( mc ) simulations following the metropolis dynamics .we simulate the triangular lattice spin systems of the linear size @xmath6 and apply the periodic boundary conditions . for thermal averagingwe typically consider @xmath7 mcs ( monte carlo sweeps or steps per spin ) after discarding another @xmath8 mcs for thermalization . in order to obtain dependencies of various thermodynamic quantities on the reduced temperature @xmath9 ,we use @xmath10 and start simulations from high temperatures with random initialization .then the temperature is gradually lowered with the step @xmath11 and the simulations start from the final configuration obtained at the previous temperature . in order to estimate the error bars , we run five simulations with different initializations . for finite - size scaling analysis ( fss ) , employed to identify different phases, we use the lattice sizes @xmath12 and @xmath13 .we calculate the following quantities .the sublattice magnetization of the sublattice x ( x = a , b and c ) is obtained as @xmath14 .then , for an antiferromagnet , as an order parameter it is useful to define the staggered magnetization per site as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes thermal average .further , from fluctuations of the above quantities we define the specific heat per site @xmath17 as @xmath18 and the staggered susceptibility per site @xmath19 as @xmath20    in the ground state the spin - correlation function of the tlia model decays as a power law  @xcite @xmath21 where the exponent @xmath22 has been shown to decrease with the spin value from @xmath23 for spin-1/2 to zero for spin larger than 11/2 , for which antiferromagnetic long - range order occurs  @xcite .the value of @xmath22 can be estimated by fss of the order parameter @xmath24 , which scales as  @xcite @xmath25 or the quantity  @xcite @xmath26bigrangle / l^2, ] ] which scales as @xmath27let us first examine the ground - state properties for different values of @xmath5 . for @xmath28 , the energetic arguments dictate that the ground - state configuration is such that the spins on each elementary triangular plaquette sum to @xmath29 .all such plaquettes are energetically equivalent with the energy per spin @xmath30 and there is no long - range order among them .it is easy to verify that for @xmath31 the preferred configurations are such that the spins on each elementary triangular plaquette again sum to @xmath29 but zero spin states are not involved .then the energy per spin is @xmath32 and the system behaves like a spin-1/2 ising model with no long - range order  @xcite . if @xmath33 the configurations with the spin @xmath34 states on one sublattice are suppressed and the partially ordered phase with the antiferromagnetic ordering on two sublattices and non - magnetic states of the third sublattice , i.e. , the @xmath35 states , can occur .such configurations are characterized by the energy per spin @xmath36 . however , for @xmath37 the energy becomes positive and therefore the non - magnetic state with all spins taking zero value is the ground state .therefore , the partial long - range order can only be expected within @xmath38 .    in order to confront the behavior of the system with no single - ion anisotropy , which is expected to show only the bkt phase transition  @xcite , with the long - range order behavior predicted to appear within the range @xmath38 , in fig .[ fig : xxx - t_l48 ] we plot the temperature dependencies of some relevant thermodynamic quantities for two values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , representing the two cases .the behavior for @xmath39 is clearly different from that observed for @xmath41 .while the former shows only one anomaly at higher temperatures , the latter displays an additional anomaly at lower temperatures . in particular , as observed in the behaviors of the sublattice magnetizations and the staggered magnetization ( order parameter ) , presented in figs .[ fig : mi - t_l48 ] and  [ fig : ms - t_l48 ] , respectively , in both cases some degree of ordering is initiated in two sublattices at higher temperatures . however , unlike the case with no anisotropy , for @xmath41 this initial increase in the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath24 is followed by another increase to the fully saturated values at lower temperatures .as the temperature is lowered , one and two anomalies are also observed in the behavior of the internal energy , tending to the expected ground - state values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for the cases of @xmath39 and @xmath41 , respectively ( fig .[ fig : e - t_l48 ] ) .the anomalies in the staggered magnetization and the internal energy are reflected in the corresponding number of peaks in the staggered susceptibility and the specific heat , shown in figs .[ fig : xis - t_l48 ] and  [ fig : c - t_l48 ] , respectively .+   +    the above anomalies in the thermodynamic quantities suggest occurrence of transitions between different phases . to identify the respective phases , we employ fss analyses of the order parameter @xmath24 and the quantity @xmath46 , defined by the relations  ( [ ms_fss ] ) and  ( [ y_fss ] ) , respectively .temperature variation of the scaling exponent @xmath22 is presented in fig .[ fig : eta - t_l48_d0 ] .the value of @xmath47 , observed for @xmath41 , means that the system displays at sufficiently low temperatures ( below @xmath48 ) long - range order  @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath39 ,the value of @xmath22 remains finite and in the low temperature region levels off at the value of @xmath49 , in agreement with the previous ground - state investigations  @xcite ., for @xmath41 and @xmath50 .the symbols and the error bars respectively represent the mean and the extreme values obtained from eqs .( [ ms_fss ] ) and  ( [ y_fss ] ) . ]    finally , we found it interesting to look into the system s behavior also at microscopic level .more specifically , we studied the snapshots of spin configurations at different temperatures both visually and quantitatively . for the latter we introduced the quantity , which we termed density of local patterns @xmath51 , which is defined as a relative number of different spin patterns @xmath52 , @xmath53  . ] , on the elementary triangular plaquettes observed in the simulated states .the temperature variations of @xmath51 for different values of the single - ion anisotropy strength are shown in figs .[ fig : dos - t_l48_d+1]-[fig : dos - t_l48_d-1 ] , with all the patterns @xmath54 listed in fig .[ fig : dos - t_l48_d+1 ] .the snapshots of the respective spin configurations in the ground state are also presented in figs .[ fig : snap_t0_d+1_l24]-[fig : snap_t0_d-1_l24 ]  . ] . for comparisonwe also included the case with positive value of @xmath55 .for @xmath55 , the degenerate spin patterns which sum to @xmath29 and include no zeros , i.e. , @xmath56 , are equally represented and , in accordance with the above ground - state arguments , for @xmath57 are the only ones present in the system . on the other hand , for @xmath41 ,due to broken symmetry the system in the partially ordered phase chooses one the two configurations involving either the set of patterns @xmath58 or @xmath59 . again , in agreement with the ground - state arguments , for @xmath57 the patterns of either set are equally represented and there are no other patterns in the system . in between the two phases for @xmath39 , the patterns @xmath56 and @xmath60 mix together since they contribute with the same energy . however , as evidenced from both figs .[ fig : dos - t_l48_d0 ] and  [ fig : snap_t0_d0_l24 ] , they do not appear with the same probabilities .namely , the patterns @xmath56 systematically prevail in all the simulations started from various initial states and in the ground state they are almost @xmath61-times more represented than the patterns @xmath60 .this can be understood by looking at larger patterns , namely , hexagonal ones formed by a central spin and its six nearest neighbors .then , only in the patterns with the so called \`\` free '' central spins ( i.e. , the spins with the nearest neighbors of alternating signs ) the state of the central spins is irrelevant with the respect to the energy and , therefore , the states @xmath62 , @xmath40 and @xmath50 are equally probable . therefore , the number of the triangular patterns @xmath60 is proportional to the number of the hexagonal patterns with the \`\` free '' central spins in the configurations such as the one shown in fig .[ fig : snap_t0_d+1_l24 ] , noting that the zero - state central spin generates six triangles with the patterns @xmath60 .we studied the geometrically frustrated spin-1 triangular ising antiferromagnet in the presence of a single - ion anisotropy .we showed that within the range of negative values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath63 the system displays a partial long - range order in the low - temperature region and another phase with algebraically decaying correlation function at higher temperatures .for @xmath64 the system is in a non - magnetic state and for @xmath65 it behaves like a spin-1/2 model , with no long - range ordering due to frustration .the ground - state phase transition at @xmath66 is characterized by the coexistence of the energetically equivalent patterns of the types @xmath67 and @xmath68 at a constant ratio of approximately @xmath69 .this work was supported by the scientific grant agency of ministry of education of slovak republic ( grant vega no .1/0234/12 ) .the authors acknowledge the financial support by the erdf eu ( european union european regional development fund ) grant provided under the contract no .itms26220120005 ( activity 3.2 . ) .wannier , phys . rev . *79 * , 357 ( 1950 ) .j. stephenson , j. math .phys . * 11 * , 413 ( 1970 ) .o. nagai , s. miyashita , t. horiguchi , phys .b * 47 * 202 ( 1993 ). y. yamada , s. miyashita , t. horiguchi , m. kang , o. nagai , j. magn .magn . mater . * 140 -

Comparison with non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs. 1. The in vivo effects of the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) amtolmetin guacyl, a pro-drug of the NSAID tolmetin, on lipid peroxidation, glutathione levels and activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) in rat gastric mucosa, colon mucosa and liver, were compared with the effects of non-selective (indomethacin, diclofenac) and COX-2 selective (celecoxib) NSAIDs. 2. Indomethacin treatment led to an increase in lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and to a decrease in catalase activity and glutathione levels in gastric mucosa. In contrast, amtolmetin guacyl treatment was without effects in gastric and colon mucosa, or liver from control animals. Like amtolmetin guacyl, celecoxib had no effect on the lipid peroxidation, or on enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant defence systems in gastric mucosa. 3. It is suggested that the lack of pro-oxidant effects in vivo associated with amtolmetin guacyl treatment contribute improved gastric tolerability.","answer":"[[\\"Indomethacin\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\\"], [\\"celecoxib\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"Indomethacin\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"glutathione peroxidase\\"], [\\"Indomethacin\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"catalase\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain.miRNA-mediated deadenylation is orchestrated by GW182 through two conserved motifs that interact with CCR4-NOT.The rate-limiting step of mRNA degradation is the removal of the poly(A) tail by deadenylases.Purified PUM complexes were found to contain subunits of the CCR4-NOT (CNOT) complex, which contains multiple enzymes that catalyze mRNA deadenylation.These findings demonstrate a conserved mechanism of PUF-mediated repression via direct recruitment of the CCR4-POP2-NOT deadenylase leading to translational inhibition and mRNA degradation.The activity and selectivity of fission yeast Pop2p are affected by a high affinity for Zn2+ and Mn2+ in the active site.In eukaryotic organisms, initiation of mRNA turnover is controlled by progressive shortening of the poly-A tail, a process involving the mega-Dalton Ccr4-Not complex and its two associated 3'-5' exonucleases, Ccr4p and Pop2p (Caf1p).Here, we show biochemically and structurally that fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) Pop2p prefers Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) over Mg(2+) at the concentrations of the ions found inside cells and that the identity of the ions in the active site affects the activity of the enzyme.The 3'-poly(A) tail, found on virtually all mRNAs, is enzymatically shortened by a process referred to as \\"deadenylation.\\" Deadenylation is a widespread means of controlling mRNA stability and translation.Dynamic changes of the lengths of mRNA poly(A) tails are catalysed by diverse deadenylase enzymes.In eukaryotes, shortening of the 3'-poly(A) tail is the rate-limiting step in the degradation of most mRNAs, and two major mRNA deadenylase complexes--Caf1-Ccr4 and Pan2-Pan3--play central roles in this process, referred to as deadenylation.Previously, we demonstrated that eukaryotic releasing factor eRF3 mediates deadenylation and decay of mRNA in a manner coupled to translation termination.PUF protein-mediated deadenylation is catalyzed by Ccr4p.Deadenylation of mRNA is often the first and rate-limiting step in mRNA decay. PARN, a poly(A)-specific 3' --> 5' ribonuclease which is conserved in many eukaryotes, has been proposed to be primarily responsible for such a reaction, yet the importance of the PARN function at the whole-organism level has not been demonstrated in any species.The trypanosomal deadenylase activity is a 3'-->5' exonuclease specific for adenylate residues, generates 5'-AMP as a product, is magnesium dependent, and is inhibited by neomycin B sulfate.Identification of multiple RNA features that influence CCR4 deadenylation activity.The CCR4 family proteins are 3'-5'-deadenylases that function in the first step of the degradation of poly(A) mRNA.PARN, Nocturnin and Angel are three of the multiple deadenylases that have been described in eukaryotic cells.Thus, deadenylation and the participating deadenylases are not simply required for preparing mRNA substrates; they play an indispensable role both structurally and functionally in P-body formation and regulation.In this context, the wide repertoire of RBPs and molecules that regulate PARN activity, together with the established role of deadenylases in miRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA expression, suggest that mRNA turnover is more complex than it was previously thought and PARN holds a key role in this process.A set of multiple poly(A)-specific deadenylases has been identified, some, if not most, of which are likely to play a role in the key first step of mRNA turnover--the regulated shortening of the poly(A) tail.","answer":"The 3'-poly(A) tail, found on mRNAs, is enzymatically shortened by a process referred to as \\"deadenylation\\" which is carried out by deadenylases.

One of the oldest and best-studied interdiction problems is minimum spanning tree (MST) interdiction. Here, an undirected multigraph with nonnegative edge weights and positive interdiction costs on its edges is given, together with a positive budget B. The goal is to find a subset of edges R, whose total interdiction cost does not exceed B, such that removing R leads to a graph where the weight of an MST is as large as possible. Frederickson and Solis-Oba (SODA 1996) presented an O(log m)-approximation for MST interdiction, where m is the number of edges. Since then, no further progress has been made regarding approximations, and the question whether MST interdiction admits an O(1)-approximation remained open. We answer this question in the affirmative, by presenting a 14-approximation that overcomes two main hurdles that hindered further progress so far. Moreover, based on a well-known 2-approximation for the metric traveling salesman problem (TSP), we show that our O(1)-approximation for MST interdiction implies an O(1)-approximation for a natural interdiction version of metric TSP.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: For a connected, undirected and weighted graph G = (V, E), the problem of finding the k most vital edges of G with respect to minimum spanning tree is to find k edges in G whose removal will cause greatest weight increase in the minimum spanning tree of the remaining graph. This problem is known to be N P-hard for arbitrary k. In this paper, we first describe a simple exact algorithm for this problem, based on the approach of edge replacement in the minimum spanning tree of G. Next we present polynomial-time randomized algorithms that produce optimal and approximate solutions to this problem. For |V| = n and |E| = m, our algorithm producing optimal solution has a time complexity of O(mn) with probability of success at least e - √ k-2 k-2 , which is 0.90 fork > 200 and asymptotically 1 when k goes to infinity. The algorithm producing approximate solution runs in O(mn+nk 2 log k) time with probability of success at least 1- 1 4 (2 n ) k 2-2 , which is 0.998 for k > 10, and produces solution within factor 2 to the optimal one. Finally we show that both of our randomized algorithms can be easily parallelized. On a CREW PRAM, the first algorithm runs in O(n) time using n 2 processors, and the second algorithm runs in O(log 2 n) time using mn log n processors and hence is RNC.","answer":"We highlight that [1] claims to present a @math -approximation for the @math most vital edges problem for MST.

New York City was affected gravely. Our hospital, a specialty orthopedic hospital unaccustomed to large volumes of patients with life-threatening respiratory infections, underwent rapid adaptation to care for COVID-19 patients in response to emergency surge conditions at neighboring hospitals. Purposes: We sought to determine the attributes, pharmacologic and other treatments, and clinical course in the cohort of patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital at the height of the pandemic in April 2020 in New York City. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all patients admitted between April 1 and April 21, 2020, who had a diagnosis of COVID-19. Data were gathered from the electronic health record and by manual chart abstraction. Results: Of the 148 patients admitted with COVID-19 (mean age, 62 years), ten patients died. There were no deaths among non-critically ill patients transferred from other hospitals, while 26% of those with critical illness died. A subset of COVID-19 patients was admitted for orthopedic and medical conditions other than COVID-19, and some of these patients required intensive care and ventilatory support.

In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors. Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib.Together, the detailed explanation of mechanisms of those mutations with brigatinib further provide several guidelines for the development of more effective ALK inhibitors.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We describe recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeting agents.RECENT FINDINGS: Five targeted drugs are currently available in the clinic via regular approval or named patient programs, including crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib.With the limit of a lower number of treated patients (n = 359), brigatinib resulted as the most frequently involved in lung toxicity (7%; n = 25).Lung toxicity is a rare albeit potentially severe side effect in NSCLC patients receiving ALK-TKIs, apparently more frequent with brigatinib.Ceritinib and alectinib are approved for metastatic ALK positive NSCLC patients, while brigatinib received granted accelerated approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration.Since the discovery, development and approval of crizotinib in 2011, three second-generation ALK-TKIs, ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib have been approved by the FDA.In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors.Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib.These ALK mutations have significant influences on the flexibility of P-loop region and DFG sequences, but do not impair the hydrogen bonds between brigatinib and the residue Met1199 of hinge region.As a potent and selective drug, brigatinib exhibits high efficacy against wild-type and mutant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) proteins to treat non-small cell lung cancer.This report describes the design and synthesis of a series of 2,4-diarylaminopyrimidine-based potent and selective ALK inhibitors culminating in identification of the investigational clinical candidate brigatinib.Brigatinib displayed low nanomolar IC50s against native ALK and all tested clinically relevant ALK mutants in both enzyme-based biochemical and cell-based viability assays and demonstrated efficacy in multiple ALK+ xenografts in mice, including Karpas-299 (anaplastic large-cell lymphomas [ALCL]) and H3122 (NSCLC).","answer":"anaplastic lymphoma kinase"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A total of 150 samples were collected, including 33 needle aspirates from lymphoid tuberculosis, 23 needle aspirates from spinal tuberculosis, 49 from tuberculous pleural effusions, 24 from cerebrospinal fluid of tuberculous cephalomeningitis, and 21 urinary sediment samples from renal tuberculosis. Smear microscopy, mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and the MTB/RIF method were used to examine these samples and their positive rates were compared. Rifampin susceptibility tests was performed for culture-positive strains using proportion method, which was compared with the result from GeneXpert MTB/RIF method. Of the 150 cases of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, 17 samples were smear-positive, with a sensitivity of 11.3% (17/150); 30 were culture-positive with a sensitivity of 20.0% (30/150); and 96 were positive by MTB/RIF method with a sensitivity of 64.0% (96/150). There was a significant difference between MTB/RIF method and the culture method (χ(2)=59.61, P<0.01). The differences were also significant when the MTB/RIF method was compared with the smear method (χ(2)=88.60, P<0.01) or compared with culture plus smear methods (χ(2)=4.26, P<0.05). Separately, the differences were statistically significant between GeneXpert MTB/RIF method and other 2 methods for diagnosis of lymphoid tuberculosis (n=33, χ(2)=20.56, P<0.01 vs. culture method; χ(2)=27.13, P<0.01 vs. smear results) while no difference was found between culture and smear method (χ(2)=0.67, P>0.05), spinal tuberculosis (n=23, χ(2)=12.74, P<0.01 vs. culture method; χ(2)=14.81, P< 0.01 vs. smear method), tuberculous pleurisy (n=49, χ(2)=32.34, P<0.01 vs. culture method; χ(2)=49.69, P<0.01 vs. smear method) and renal tuberculosis (n=21, χ(2)=4.20, P<0.05 vs. culture method; χ(2) =8.40, P<0.01 vs. smear results). The sensitivity for tuberculous meningitis had no difference among these 3 methods (n=24, P>0.05).

In this work, we develop a novel taxonomy of fine-grained\\"dialogue acts\\"frequently observed in customer service, showcasing acts that are more suited to the domain than the more generic existing taxonomies. Using a sequential SVM-HMM model, we model conversation flow, predicting the dialogue act of a given turn in real-time. We characterize differences between customer and agent behavior in Twitter customer service conversations, and investigate the effect of testing our system on different customer service industries. Finally, we use a data-driven approach to predict important conversation outcomes: customer satisfaction, customer frustration, and overall problem resolution. We show that the type and location of certain dialogue acts in a conversation have a significant effect on the probability of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and present actionable rules based on our findings. The patterns and rules we derive can be used as guidelines for outcome-driven automated customer service platforms.IntroductionThe need for real-time, efficient, and reliable customer service has grown in recent years. Twitter has emerged as a popular medium for customer service dialogue, allowing customers to make inquiries and receive instant live support in the public domain. In order to provide useful information to customers, agents must first understand the requirements of the conversation, and offer customers the appropriate feedback. While this may be feasible at the level of a single conversation for a human agent, automatic analysis of conversations is essential for data-driven approaches towards the design of automated customer support agents and systems.Analyzing the dialogic structure of a conversation in terms of the \\"dialogue acts\\" used, such as statements or questions, can give important meta-information about conversation flow and content, and can be used as a first step to developing automated agents. Traditional dialogue act taxonomies used to label turns in a conversation are very generic, in order to allow for broad coverage of the majority of dialogue acts possible in a conversation BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . However, for the purpose of understanding and analyzing customer service conversations, generic taxonomies fall short. Table TABREF1 shows a sample customer service conversation between a human agent and customer on Twitter, where the customer and agent take alternating \\"turns\\" to discuss the problem. As shown from the dialogue acts used at each turn, simply knowing that a turn is a Statement or Request, as is possible with generic taxonomies, is not enough information to allow for automated handling or response to a problem. We need more fine-grained dialogue acts, such as Informative Statement, Complaint, or Request for Information to capture the speaker's intent, and act accordingly. Likewise, turns often include multiple overlapping dialogue acts, such that a multi-label approach to classification is often more informative than a single-label approach.Dialogue act prediction can be used to guide automatic response generation, and to develop diagnostic tools for the fine-tuning of automatic agents. For example, in Table TABREF1 , the customer's first turn (Turn 1) is categorized as a Complaint, Negative Expressive Statement, and Sarcasm, and the agent's response (Turn 2) is tagged as a Request for Information, Yes-No Question, and Apology. Prediction of these dialogue acts in a real-time setting can be leveraged to generate appropriate automated agent responses to similar situations.Additionally, important patterns can emerge from analysis of the fine-grained acts in a dialogue in a post-prediction setting. For example, if an agent does not follow-up with certain actions in response to a customer's question dialogue act, this could be found to be a violation of a best practice pattern. By analyzing large numbers of dialogue act sequences correlated with specific outcomes, various rules can be derived, i.e. \\"Continuing to request information late in a conversation often leads to customer dissatisfaction.\\" This can then be codified into a best practice pattern rules for automated systems, such as \\"A request for information act should be issued early in a conversation, followed by an answer, informative statement, or apology towards the end of the conversation.\\"In this work, we are motivated to predict the dialogue acts in conversations with the intent of identifying problem spots that can be addressed in real-time, and to allow for post-conversation analysis to derive rules about conversation outcomes indicating successful/unsuccessful interactions, namely, customer satisfaction, customer frustration, and problem resolution. We focus on analysis of the dialogue acts used in customer service conversations as a first step to fully automating the interaction. We address various different challenges: dialogue act annotated data is not available for customer service on Twitter, the task of dialogue act annotation is subjective, existing taxonomies do not capture the fine-grained information we believe is valuable to our task, and tweets, although concise in nature, often consist of overlapping dialogue acts to characterize their full intent. The novelty of our work comes from the development of our fine-grained dialogue act taxonomy and multi-label approach for act prediction, as well as our analysis of the customer service domain on Twitter. Our goal is to offer useful analytics to improve outcome-oriented conversational systems.We first expand upon previous work and generic dialogue act taxonomies, developing a fine-grained set of dialogue acts for customer service, and conducting a systematic user study to identify these acts in a dataset of 800 conversations from four Twitter customer service accounts (i.e. four different companies in the telecommunication, electronics, and insurance industries). We then aim to understand the conversation flow between customers and agents using our taxonomy, so we develop a real-time sequential SVM-HMM model to predict our fine-grained dialogue acts while a conversation is in progress, using a novel multi-label scheme to classify each turn. Finally, using our dialogue act predictions, we classify conversations based on the outcomes of customer satisfaction, frustration, and overall problem resolution, then provide actionable guidelines for the development of automated customer service systems and intelligent agents aimed at desired customer outcomes BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 .We begin with a discussion of related work, followed by an overview of our methodology. Next, we describe our conversation modeling framework, and explain our outcome analysis experiments, to show how we derive useful patterns for designing automated customer service agents. Finally, we present conclusions and directions for future work.Related WorkDeveloping computational speech and dialogue act models has long been a topic of interest BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , with researchers from many different backgrounds studying human conversations and developing theories around conversational analysis and interpretation on intent. Modern intelligent conversational BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 and dialogue systems draw principles from many disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and sociology. In this section, we describe relevant previous work on speech and dialogue act modeling, general conversation modeling on Twitter, and speech and dialogue act modeling of customer service in other data sources.Previous work has explored speech act modeling in different domains (as a predecessor to dialogue act modeling). Zhang et al. present work on recognition of speech acts on Twitter, following up with a study on scalable speech act recognition given the difficulty of obtaining labeled training data BIBREF9 . They use a simple taxonomy of four main speech acts (Statement, Question, Suggestion, Comment, and a Miscellaneous category). More recently, Vosoughi et al. develop BIBREF10 a speech act classifier for Twitter, using a modification of the taxonomy defined by Searle in 1975, including six acts they observe to commonly occur on Twitter: Assertion, Recommendation Expression, Question, Request, again plus a Miscellaneous category. They describe good features for speech act classification and the application of such a system to detect stories on social media BIBREF11 . In this work, we are interested in the dialogic characteristics of Twitter conversations, rather than speech acts in stand-alone tweets.Different dialogue act taxonomies have been developed to characterize conversational acts. Core and Allen present the Dialogue Act Marking in Several Layers (DAMSL), a standard for discourse annotation that was developed in 1997 BIBREF0 . The taxonomy contains a total of 220 tags, divided into four main categories: communicative status, information level, forward-looking function, and backward-looking function. Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca develop a less fine-grained taxonomy of 42 tags based on DAMSL BIBREF1 . Stolcke et al. employ a similar set for general conversation BIBREF2 , citing that \\"content- and task-related distinctions will always play an important role in effective DA [Dialogue Act] labeling.\\" Many researchers have tackled the task of developing different speech and dialogue act taxonomies and coding schemes BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . For the purposes of our own research, we require a set of dialogue acts that is more closely representative of customer service domain interactions - thus we expand upon previously defined taxonomies and develop a more fine-grained set.Modeling general conversation on Twitter has also been a topic of interest in previous work. Honeycutt and Herring study conversation and collaboration on Twitter using individual tweets containing \\"@\\" mentions BIBREF16 . Ritter et al. explore unsupervised modeling of Twitter conversations, using clustering methods on a corpus of 1.3 million Twitter conversations to define a model of transitional flow between in a general Twitter dialogue BIBREF17 . While these approaches are relevant to understanding the nature of interactions on Twitter, we find that the customer service domain presents its own interesting characteristics that are worth exploring further.The most related previous work has explored speech and dialogue act modeling in customer service, however, no previous work has focused on Twitter as a data source. In 2005, Ivanovic uses an abridged set of 12 course-grained dialogue acts (detailed in the Taxonomy section) to describe interactions between customers and agents in instant messaging chats BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , leading to a proposal on response suggestion using the proposed dialogue acts BIBREF20 . Follow-up work using the taxonomy selected by Ivanovic comes from Kim et al., where they focus on classifying dialogue acts in both one-on-one and multi-party live instant messaging chats BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 . These works are similar to ours in the nature of the problem addressed, but we use a much more fine-grained taxonomy to define the interactions possible in the customer service domain, and focus on Twitter conversations, which are unique in their brevity and the nature of the public interactions.The most similar work to our own is that of Herzig et al. on classifying emotions in customer support dialogues on Twitter BIBREF23 . They explore how agent responses should be tailored to the detected emotional response in customers, in order to improve the quality of service agents can provide. Rather than focusing on emotional response, we seek to model the dialogic structure and intents of the speakers using dialogue acts, with emotion included as features in our model, to characterize the emotional intent within each act.ClassesTable TABREF30 shows the division of classes we use for each of our experiments. We select our classes using the distribution of annotations we observe in our data collection phase (see Table TABREF19 ), selecting the top 12 classes as candidates.While iteratively selecting the most frequently-occurring classes helps to ensure that classes with the most data are represented in our experiments, it also introduces the problem of including classes that are very well-defined lexically, and may not require learning for classification, such as Social Act Apology and Social Act Thanking in the first 10-Class set. For this reason, we call this set 10-Class (Easy), and also experiment using a 10-Class (Hard) set, where we add in the next two less-defined and more semantically rich labels, such as Statement Offer and Question Open. When using each set of classes, a turn is either classified as one of the classes in the set, or it is classified as \\"other\\" (i.e. any of the other classes). We discuss our experiments in more detail and comment on performance differences in the experiment section.Conversation Outcome AnalysisGiven our observation that Agent turns are more predictable, and that we achieve best performance in a company-independent setting, we question whether the training that agents receive is actually reliable in terms of resulting in overall \\"satisfied customers\\", regardless of company domain. Ultimately, our goal is to discover whether we can use the insight we derive from our predicted dialogue acts to better inform conversational systems aimed at offering customer support. Our next set of experiments aims to show the utility of our real-time dialogue act classification as a method for summarizing semantic intent in a conversation into rules that can be used to guide automated systems.Table 6: Dialogue Acts Used in Each Set of ExperimentsTable 7: Company-Wise vs Company-Independent Evaluation for 6-Class Sequential SVM-HMMQuestion: Which dialogue acts are more suited to the twitter domain?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"overlapping dialogue acts\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"In this work, we are motivated to predict the dialogue acts in conversations with the intent of identifying problem spots that can be addressed in real-time, and to allow for post-conversation analysis to derive rules about conversation outcomes indicating successful/unsuccessful interactions, namely, customer satisfaction, customer frustration, and problem resolution.

however , this was true only when the percentage of cells was taken into account ( table 2 ,  p = .0000 ) .as to the expression of cd62l and tnfr2 in cd4cd25cd62l and cd4cd25tnfr2 cells , respectively , flow cytometric analysis indicated that there was a significant difference in the mfi of these molecules between analyzed groups .the expression of cd62l was higher in control group ( figure 2 , p = .0001 ) , while the expression of tnfr2 was higher in dm1 group ( figure 2 , p = .0004 ) .   in dm1 group ,the association analysis correlating hba1c and crp levels versus the cd4cd25 and their subpopulations frequency was performed ( figures 3 and 4 ) . in the study group ,the level of hba1c was in significant relation with the frequency of cd4cd25 ( r = [ 0.3 ] ; p < .05 ) cd4cd25cd62l ( r = [ 0.33 ] ; p < .05 ) as well as cd4cd25tnfr2(r = 0.46 ; p < .05 ) .the significantly negative correlation was also found between crp level and the frequency of cd4cd25 ( r = [ 0.69 ] ;

The gene Prph2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific membrane glycoprotein, peripherin-2 (also known as peripherin/rds), which is inserted into the rims of photoreceptor outer segment discs in a complex with rom-1 (ref. 2). The complex is necessary for the stabilization of the discs, which are renewed constantly throughout life, and which contain the visual pigments necessary for photon capture. Mutations in Prph2 have been shown to result in a variety of photoreceptor dystrophies, including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and macular dystrophy. A common feature of these diseases is the loss of photoreceptor function, also seen in the retinal degeneration slow (rds or Prph2 Rd2/Rd2) mouse, which is homozygous for a null mutation in Prph2. It is characterized by a complete failure to develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments, downregulation of rhodopsin and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells. The electroretinograms (ERGs) of Prph2Rd2/Rd2 mice have greatly diminished a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, which decline to virtually undetectable concentrations by two months. Subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding a Prph2 transgene results in stable generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of discs containing both perpherin-2 and rhodopsin, which in many cases are morphologically similar to normal outer segments. Moreover, the re-establishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer also results in electrophysiological correction. These studies demonstrate for the first time that a complex ultrastructural cell defect can be corrected both morphologically and functionally by in vivo gene transfer..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"retinal degeneration\\", \\"autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa\\", \\"photoreceptor dystrophies\\", \\"macular dystrophy\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

However, pseudovivipary is an important reproductive strategy in some grasses. In this mode of reproduction, asexual propagules are produced in place of sexual reproductive structures. However, the molecular mechanism of pseudovivipary still remains a mystery. In this work, we found three naturally occurring mutants in rice, namely, phoenix( pho), degenerative palea( dep), and abnormal floral organs( afo). Genetic analysis of them indicated that the stable pseudovivipary mutant pho was a double mutant containing both a Mendelian mutation in DEP and a non-Mendelian mutation in AFO. Further map-based cloning and microarray analysis revealed that dep mutant was caused by a genetic alteration in OsMADS15 while afo was caused by an epigenetic mutation in OsMADS1. Thus, OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 are both required to ensure sexual reproduction in rice and mutations of them lead to the switch of reproductive habit from sexual to asexual in rice. For the first time, our results reveal two regulators for sexual and asexual reproduction modes in flowering plants. In addition, our findings also make it possible to manipulate the reproductive strategy of plants, at least in rice.Introduction:Flowering is an important process essential for sexual reproduction, seed development and fruit production. Although flowering is composed of a series of typically irreversible sequential events, reversion from floral to vegetative growth is frequently observed in nature. Reversions can be divided into two categories: inflorescence reversion, in which vegetative growth is resumed after or intercalated within inflorescence development, and flower reversion, in which vegetative growth is resumed in an individual flower[1],[2]. Reversion, which can serve a function in the life history strategy( perenniality) or reproductive habit( pseudovivipary), is essential for the life cycle of some plant species[1],[2]. Vivipary in flowering plants is defined as the precocious and continuous growth of the offspring while still attached to the parent plant[3],[4]. Vivipary can be divided into two distinct types: true vivipary and pseudovivipary[3]. True vivipary is a sexual reproduction process in which seeds germinate before they detach from maternal plant. On the other hand, pseudovivipary is a specific asexual reproductive strategy in which bulbils or plantlets replace sexual reproductive structures[3],[5]. Pseudovivipary has been widely recorded in monocots, in particular grasses that grow in extreme environments[1],[3],[5]–[11]. Characteristics of the environments which favour pseudovivipary include climate changes, high precipitation and humidity, drought, fungal infection, high altitudes and latitudes, late-thawing habitats, or arid/semi-arid areas[1],[3],[5]. Several authors have argued that pseudovivipary has evolved in response to a short growing season, enabling plants to rapidly complete the cycle of offspring production, germination and establishment during the brief periods favourable to growth and reproduction[3]. In developmental terms pseudovivipary occurs in two principal ways. The first way to proliferate, as in Festuca ovina, Poa alpina and Poa bulbosa, is through the transformation of the spikelet axis into the leafy shoot. The second way is to form the first leaf of the plantlet by lemma elongation, as is the case in Deschampsia caespitose and Poa robusta[1],[11]. In some cases, such as Deschampsia alpine and Phleum pratense, both modes of propagule development have been found in a single plant[11], indicating that the molecular difference between the two types of pseudovivipary might be rather small. Pseudovivipary has fascinated biologists, as elucidation of its mechanism could lead to an understanding of flower evolution and sexual reproduction; hence, it might provide an opportunity to manipulate a plant's reproductive strategy. As pseudovivipary is always closely associated with various environmental factors, the molecular basis of pseudovivipary is still unknown. Here we report mutations of two MADS-box transcription factors that are essential for sexual reproduction and mutations of which lead to stable pseudovivipary in rice.Discussion:Morphological studies in other grasses have revealed that pseudovivipary occurs either by proliferation of the spikelet axis or by transformation of the lemma[1],[11]. In most cases, pseudovivipary is achieved by the transformation of the spikelet axis. The grass spikelet is a structure consisting of two glumes subtending one or more small florets. The rice spikelet is generally considered to have three florets, which are subtended by two tiny glumes( rudimentary glumes)[21],[24]. The uppermost floret is fertile while the two lower florets are reduced and sterile. The two empty glumes( or sterile lemmas) are considered to be reduced lemmas of two lower florets[21],[24]. So, theoretically, rice spikelet axis is located between the palea and upper empty glume( Figure 4). In this study, new shoots in the dep mutant are merely found between paleas and upper empty glumes. Thus, we conclude that pseudovivipary in the dep mutant is also achieved by the transformation of the spikelet axis. Poa alopecurus and Poa fuegiana, which are non-pseudoviviparous and pseudoviviparous species, respectively, can also be recognized as the same species because of the close affinities between them[11]. The characters of Poa fuegiana have been well described[11]. A detailed comparison of rice dep plant with Poa fuegiana shows that there are many similarities between the two pseudoviviparous plants: the palea is reduced or rudimentary; the lemma is elongated; new shoots are only formed on the palea side; both are not stable pseudoviviparous plants; and pseudovivipary mainly happens under high rainfall conditions. Considering so many similarities, it is very likely that the occurrence of pseudovivipary in Poa fuegiana and rice dep mutant might share the same mechanism. However, the validity of this speculation remains to be verified by molecular investigations on Poa fuegiana. The pho mutant should be classified into the second type of pseudoviviparous plant since the lemma in pho undergoes elongation to form the first leaf of the propagule. However, pho, which differs from those environment-dependent pseudoviviparous grasses, shows stable pseudovivipary phenotype and is not associated with environmental factors. Till now, to our knowledge, no similar stable pseudoviviparous plant has been reported in nature. If similar stable pseudoviviparous plants are found in nature, they are very likely to be recognized as new species, because of the extreme difference in morphology and reproductive method. Early studies have showed that both OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 are expressed in the incipient floral primordium[16]–[18],[23]. Furthermore, OsMADS1 interacts with OsMADS15 in yeast two-hybrid experiments[12]. The defects of their mutants indicate that OsMADS1 might work cooperatively with OsMADS15 to determine FM, but their individual roles are divergent: OsMADS1 mainly works in promoting the determinacy of FM while OsMADS15 mainly functions in inhibiting the formation of SAM in incipient floral primordium. Consistent with those indications, the mutations of both OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 in pho result in a stable inflorescence reversion. In addition, OsMADS1 is required for the specification of lemma, PMTs and three inner whorls. On the contrary, OsMADS15 is required for the specification of PMS and empty glumes. So, it is also probably that all floral organs in the double mutant, pho, lost their modifications and transformed into their basal state, namely, leaves. It has been shown that both transcripts of OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 are eventually accumulated in lemma and palea, suggesting that OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 might also be involved in the development of lemma and palea[17],[23]. In severely affected Osmads1 spikelets, both lemma and palea are affected, but the lemma is affected to a greater extent, suggesting that OsMADS1 might function as a lemma identity gene[19],[22]. Additionally, PMTs are lost in Osmads1 spikelets, indicating that OsMADS1 is also essential for the specification of PMTs. In contrast, in severely affected Osmads15 spikelets, both lemma and palea are affected, but the palea is affected to a greater extent and PMS is completely lost, implying that OsMADS15 might be mainly involved in the specification of PMS. Collectively, both OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 might control the differentiation of lemma and palea, but their different roles might contribute to the asymmetric development of the first whorl of rice spikelets. OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 are characterized as SEP-like gene and AP1/FUL-like gene, respectively[12],[13],[15]–[23]. AP1, FUL and SEP1/2/3/4 genes in dicot model plant Arabidopsis are also involved in floral meristem identity determination[25]–[28]. In addition, previous studies in Arabidopsis have transformed floral organs into leaf-like organs[26],[29],[30]. However, transformation of flowers into true plantlets that is indicative of pseudovivipary has not been found in Arabidopsis, but has been reported in many grasses in nature[1]. The difference might be caused by the distinction of floral development between grasses and dicot plants, as well as the diversification of those floral genes during evolution[16],[21],[31]. More than 200 years ago, Goethe proposed that the floral organs are modified leaves. This belief is supported by the observation that triple mutants lacking the ABC genes in Arabidopsis have a conversion of all floral organs into leaf-like organs[29],[30]. In this study, we revealed that mutations in OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 lead to the transformation of all rice flowers into plantlets that can produce true leaves, thereby further confirming Goethe's hypothesis. The complete transformation of flowers into juvenile plantlets in rice, as well as similar transformations in other grasses, leads us to hypothesize that in grasses a flower may be a modified juvenile plantlet meant for reproduction. It is widely accepted that sexual reproduction evolves from asexual reproduction, so we speculate that pho might be an atavistic mutant, and plants with similar phenotype might play an important role in the evolution of reproductive strategy from asexual to sexual. The dep mutant, which can produce both flowers and plantlets, is more similar to most natural pseudoviviparous plants than the pho mutant. Thus, its analogous plants might play an intermediate role in this evolution, because such environment-dependent pseudoviviparous plant has the ability not only to reproduce via sexual way under favourable conditions, but also to reproduce via asexual way when the harsh conditions affect its sexual reproduction. In conclusion, we have shown that dep is a genetic mutant in OsMADS15 while afo is an epigenetic mutant in OsMADS1, and their combination led to stable pseudovivipary. These findings suggest that the two MADS-box genes might play important roles in plant adaptation to various reproductive strategies.","answer":"Sexual reproduction is essential for the life cycle of most flowering plants .

Unlike the more common Keyword Spotting, where an algorithm needs to detect lone keywords or short phrases like\\"Alexa\\",\\"Cortana\\",\\"Hi Alexa!\\",\\"Whatsup Octavia?\\"etc. in speech, CSKS needs to filter out embedded words from a continuous flow of speech, ie. spot\\"Anna\\"and\\"github\\"in\\"I know a developer named Anna who can look into this github issue.\\"Apart from the issue of limited training data availability, CSKS is an extremely imbalanced classification problem. We address the limitations of simple keyword spotting baselines for both aforementioned challenges by using a novel combination of loss functions (Prototypical networks' loss and metric loss) and transfer learning. Our method improves F1 score by over 10%.IntroductionContinuous Speech Keyword Spotting (CSKS) aims to detect embedded keywords in audio recordings. These spotted keyword frequencies can then be used to analyze theme of communication, creating temporal visualizations and word clouds BIBREF0 . Another use case is to detect domain specific keywords which ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) systems trained on public data cannot detect. For example, to detect a TV model number “W884” being mentioned in a recording, we might not have a large number of training sentences containing the model number of a newly launched TV to finetune a speech recognition (ASR) algorithm. A trained CSKS algorithm can be used to quickly extract out all instances of such keywords.We train CSKS algorithms like other Keyword Spotting algorithms by classifying small fragments of audio in running speech. This requires the classifier model to have a formalized process to reject unseen instances (everything not a keyword, henceforth referred to as background) apart from ability to differentiate between classes (keywords). Another real world constraint that needs to be addressed while training such an algorithm is the availability of small amount of labeled keyword instances. We combine practices from fields of transfer learning, few-shot learning and metric learning to get better performance on this low training data imbalanced classification task.Our work involves :Our baselines, Honk( UID9 ), DeepSpeech-finetune( UID10 ), had comparatively both lower recall and precision. We noticed an improvement when fine tuning DeepSpeech model with prototypical loss (DeepSpeech-finetune-prototypical ( UID11 )). While analysing the false positives of this model, it was observed that the model gets confused between the keywords and it also wrongly classifies background noise as a keyword. To improve this, we combined prototypical loss with a metric loss to reject background (DeepSpeech-finetune-prototypical+metric( UID14 )). This model gave us the best results.Related workIn the past, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 have been used to solve the CSKS problem. But since the HMM techniques use Viterbi algorithms(computationally expensive) a faster approach is required.Owning to the popularity of deep learning, many recent works such as BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 have used deep learning techniques for many speech processing tasks. In tasks such as ASR, Hannun et al. BIBREF3 proposed a RNN based model to transcribe speech into text. Even for plain keyword spotting, BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 have proposed various deep learning architectures to solve the task. But to the best of our knowledge, no past work has deployed deep learning for spotting keywords in continuous speech.Recently, a lot of work is being done on training deep learning models with limited training data. Out of them, few-shot techniques as proposed by BIBREF18 , BIBREF4 have become really popular. Pons et al. BIBREF16 proposed a few-shot technique using prototypical networks BIBREF4 and transfer leaning BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 to solve a different audio task.We took inspiration from these works to design our experiments to solve the CSKS task.DatasetOur learning data, which was created in-house, has 20 keywords to be spotted about television models of a consumer electronics brand. It was collected by making 40 participants utter each keyword 3 times. Each participant recorded in normal ambient noise conditions. As a result, after collection of learning data we have 120 (3 x 40) instances of each of the 20 keywords. We split the learning data 80:20 into train and validation sets. Train/Validation split was done on speaker level, so as to make sure that all occurrences of a particular speaker is present only on either of two sets. For testing, we used 10 different 5 minutes long simulated conversational recordings of television salesmen and customers from a shopping mall in India. These recordings contain background noise (as is expected in a mall) and have different languages (Indians speak a mixture of English and Hindi). The CSKS algorithm trained on instances of keywords in learning data is supposed to detect keywords embedded in conversations of test set.Data PreprocessingOur dataset consisted of keyword instances but the algorithm trained using this data needs to classify keywords in fragments of running conversations. To address this, we simulate the continuous speech scenario, both for keyword containing audio and background fragments, by using publicly available audio data which consisted of podcasts audio, songs, and audio narration files. For simulating fragments with keywords, we extract two random contiguous chunks from these publicly available audio files and insert the keyword either in the beginning, in the middle or in the end of the chunks, thus creating an audio segment of 2 seconds. Random 2 second segments taken from publicly available audio are used to simulate segments with no keywords(also referred to as background elsewhere in the paper). These artificially simulated audio chunks from train/validation set of pure keyword utterances were used to train/validate the model. Since the test data is quite noisy, we further used various kinds of techniques such as time-shift, pitch-shift and intensity variation to augment the data. Furthermore we used the same strategy as Tang et al. BIBREF2 of caching the data while training deep neural network on batches and artificially generating only 30% data which goes into a batch. By following these techniques, we could increase the data by many folds which not only helped the model to generalise better but also helped reduce the data preparation time during every epoch.Feature EngineeringFor all the experiments using Honk architecture, MFCC features were used. To extract these features, 20Hz/4kHz band pass filters was used to reduce the random noise. Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) of forty dimension were constructed and stacked using 20 milliseconds window size with 10 miliseconds overlap. For all the experiments using deep speech architecture, we have extracted spectrograms of audio files using 20 milliseconds window size with 10 milliseconds overlap and 480 nfft value.Deep Learning ArchitecturesHonk is a baseline Neural Network architecture we used to address the problem. Honk has shown good performance on normal Keyword Spotting and thus was our choice as the first baseline. The neural network is a Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Network BIBREF21 which has number of feature maps fixed for all residual blocks. The python code of the model was taken from the open source repository BIBREF22 . We tried changing training strategies of Honk architecture by the methods we will describe later for DeepSpeech, but this did not improve the accuracy.DeepSpeech-finetune is fine tuning the weights of openly available DeepSpeech BIBREF3 model (initial feature extraction layers and not the final ASR layer) for CSKS task. The architecture consists of pretrained initial layers of DeepSpeech followed by a set of LSTM layers and a Fully Connected layer (initialized randomly) for classification. Pretrained layers taken from DeepSpeech are the initial 2D convolution layers and the GRU layers which process the output of the 2D convolutions. The output of Fully Connected layer is fed into a softmax and then a cross entropy loss for classification is used to train the algorithm. Please note that the finetune trains for 21 classes (20 keywords + 1 background) as in aforementioned Honk model. The architecture can be seen in Fig. FIGREF6 .The next model we try is fine tuning DeepSpeech model but with a different loss function. This loss function is taken from BIBREF4 . Prototypical loss works by concentrating embeddings of all data points of a class around the class prototype. This is done by putting a softmax on the negative distances from different prototypes to determine the probability to belong to corresponding classes. The architecture FIGREF7 is same as DeepSpeech-finetune, except output of pre-final layer is taken as embedding rather than applying a Fully Connected layer for classification. These embeddings are then used to calculate euclidean distances between datapoints and prototypes, represented as INLINEFORM0 in formulae. The softmax over negative distances from prototypes is used to train cross-entropy loss. During training, examples of each class are divided into support and query embeddings. The support embeddings are used to determine prototypes of the class. Equation EQREF12 shows derivation of prototype of INLINEFORM1 class where INLINEFORM2 is the neural network yielding the embedding and INLINEFORM3 is the set of support vectors for the class. The distance of query vectors from the prototypes of the class they belong to are minimized and prototypes of other classes is maximized when training the prototypical loss. The negative distances from the prototypes of each class are passed into softmax to get the probability of belonging in a class as shown in equation EQREF13 . We see better results when we train the algorithm using prototypical loss than normal cross entropy. On qualitatively observing the output from DeepSpeech-finetune-prototypical we see that the mistakes involving confusion between keywords are very less compared to datapoints of the class background being classified as one of the keywords. We hypothesize that this might be due to treating the entire background data as one class. The variance of background is very high and treating it as one class (a unimodal class in case of prototypes) might not be the best approach. To address this, we propose the next method where we use prototypes for classification within keywords and an additional metric loss component to keep distances of background datapoints from each prototype high. DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1 We hypothesize the components of loss function of this variant from failures of prototypical loss as stated earlier. The architecture is same as in FIGREF7 , but the loss function is different from DeepSpeech-finetune-prototypical. While in DeepSpeech-finetune-prototypical, we trained prototype loss with 21 classes(20 keywords + 1 background), in DeepSpeech-finetune-prototypical+metric prototype loss is trained only amongst the 20 keywords and a new additional metric loss component inspired from BIBREF5 is added to loss function. This metric loss component aims to bring datapoints of same class together and datapoints of different class further. Datapoints belonging to background are treated as different class objects for all other datapoints in a batch. So for each object in a batch, we add a loss component like equation EQREF15 to prototypical loss. INLINEFORM0 is all datapoints in the batch belonging to the same class as INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 is all datapoints belonging to different classes than INLINEFORM3 (including background). This architecture gets the best results. DISPLAYFORM0 Experiments, Results and DiscussionWhile testing, the distance of a datapoint is checked with all the prototypes to determine its predicted class. Overlapping chunks of running audio are sent to the classifier to get classified for presence of a keyword.Train set numbers corresponding to all the models have shown in Table TABREF16 . DeepSpeech-finetune-prototypical+metric clearly beats the baselines in terms of both precision and recall. Honk is a respectable baseline and gets second best results after DeepSpeech-finetune-prototypical+metric, however, attempts to better Honk's performance using prototype loss and metric loss did not work at all.Our method to combine prototypical loss with metric learning can be used for any classification problem which has a set of classes and a large background class, but its effectiveness needs to be tested on other datasets.Fig. 1.

This process has important significance to human health since the reduction of toxic NO into unreactive N2O is used by pathogenic bacteria as a defense mechanism against the mammalian immune response (4–6). NORs are members of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily with catalytic subunits that anchor a high-spin heme b3 and a non-heme FeB metal center rather than copper as found in oxidases (7, 8). NORs and some heme-copper oxidases such as ba3 and cbb3 oxidases show cross-reactivity depending on the presence of O2 and NO in the environment (9–12). Despite progress in the structural characterization of NORs (8, 13–16), the mechanism of NO reduction at the binuclear active site is still under debate. A commonly suggested mechanism is the trans-pathway where one NO molecule binds at each FeII centers to form two {FeNO}7 species (17) before formation of a hyponitrite complex through a radical combination reaction (18–20). Alternatively, in the cis-heme mechanism, NO binds first to heme FeII before electrophilic attack by a second NO to form a heme FeIII-hyponitrite dianion radical further reduced by the FeBII center (21–23). A similar pathway centered on coordination at the FeB site rather than at the heme iron has also been suggested (cis-FeB mechanism) (24, 25).</p><p>There are many roadblocks to mechanistic studies of NORs, including the sub-millisecond rates of NO reaction and the presence of additional redox centers that partly mask spectroscopic signatures for the diiron active site (26–28). Synthetic biomimetic inorganic complexes and engineered proteins are exciting systems to study the mechanism of NORs (29, 30). Previous studies with engineered myoglobins called FeBMbs have been particularly fruitful (30–34). E-FeBMb1 is an engineered myoglobin with an empty FeB site composed of three His and one Glu (L29H, F43H, H64 and V68E). The next generation of FeBMb construct called FeBMb2 includes an additional Glu (I107E) at the periphery of the two metal centers; this mimics a fully conserved residue in bacterial NORs (30, 31). The crystal structures of FeII-loaded reduced FeBMb1 and FeBMb2 (FeII-FeBMb1 and FeII-FeBMb2, respectively) confirmed the anticipated FeB coordination to the three His and one Glu, and the reproduction of a short distance between the two metal ions. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we showed that both FeII-FeBMb1 and FeII-FeBMb2 bind one NO per iron(II) to form trans iron-nitrosyl dimer intermediate complexes (33). In FeBMb2, this [{FeNO}7]2 iron-nitrosyl dimer proceeds to generate N2O even though a branching reaction with NO that displaces the heme proximal histidine and forms a 5-coordinate low-spin heme dead-end complex limits the extent of N2O production. In fact, the higher rate of this inhibitory reaction in FeII-FeBMb1 prevents any significant N2O production in this construct (33). While the exact role of the peripheral Glu remains uncertain (34), these experiments strongly validate the viability of the trans mechanism in NORs.</p><p>A particularly interesting aspect of FeBMbs is that they can be loaded with other metal ions than FeII (30–32, 35). In contrast, attempts to exchange CuB/FeB in heme-copper oxidases and NORs led to disrupted protein structure and loss of activity (36, 37). Studies with different non-heme metals in E-FeBMbs showed that divalent metals result in an increase in nitroxyl-like character of the heme iron-nitrosyl complex through electrostatic interactions (32), but that this polarization of {FeNO}7 species is not sufficient to allow electrophilic attack by a second NO as proposed in the cis-heme mechanism (33). Besides the incorporation of different metals at the FeB site, substitutions of the heme cofactor have allowed tuning of the redox potential of the heme iron in FeBMbs (38). Specifically, replacing the heme b in FeBMb1 with mono-formyl or diformyl heme derivatives (Scheme 1) increases the heme redox potential by +53 mV and +148 mV, respectively (38). This same study also showed that only FeII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) (i.e., out of FeII-FeBMb1, FeII-FeBMb1(MF-heme), and FeII-FeBMb1(DF-heme)) efficiently consumes excess NO in the presence of excess reducing agent, strongly suggesting that this construct can perform multiple NOR turnovers – a first for these engineered myoglobin systems (38). Here, we further demonstrate that the product of these multi-turnovers is N2O and we compare the efficacy of FeBMb1(MF-heme) with different non-heme metal centers at the FeB site, including the non-redox active divalent ion ZnII. A major implication of this work is that raising the reduction potential of the heme iron permits N2O production through a one-electron reductive pathway.</p><p>Loading of FeII, CoII, and ZnII in the FeB site of E-FeBMb1(MF-heme) was monitored by a 4-nm red-shift of the Soret absorption feature from the ferrous mono-formyl-heme cofactor (Figure 1).</p><p>Quantitative measurements of N2O production were performed using transmittance FTIR spectroscopy on aqueous protein films exposed to NO released by the diethylamine-NONOate (DEA-NONOate) inside the IR cell (see Supporting Information for details). Monitoring the 2231 cm−1 band of N2O provides an estimation of the yield of a single turnover reaction when 1-mM solutions of FeII/CoII/ZnII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) are exposed to 4-equiv of NO generated in the course of the NONOate decay. Comparison with buffer solutions equilibrated with different N2O partial pressures indicates that 0.25 to 0.3 equiv of N2O are produced per reduced FeII/CoII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) and as little as 0.10 equiv of N2O per ZnII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) (Figure 2).</p><p>FTIR spectra of 100 μM solutions of FeII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) exposed to 10 mM DEA-NONOate in presence of 50 mM ascorbate show intense ν(NNO) bands consistent with 1.2 mM N2O production (Figure 3). Control experiments with enzyme free ascorbate/NONOate solution or supplemented with 100 μM E-FeBMb1(MF-heme) or FeII-FeBMb2, show only ~10% of this N2O signal, confirming that N2O is produced by multiple NOR catalytic turnovers from FeII-FeBMb1(MF-heme). Although the DEA-NONOate concentration used is these experiments produces a large excess of NO, FeII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) only performs 12 turnovers before losing activity. UV-vis spectra collected on the IR films show that this loss of activity is due to the formation of 5-coordinate low-spin heme (Figure S1), as previously identified as a dead-end complex in FeII-FeBMb1 (33).</p><p>Equivalent FTIR measurements with CoII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) in multi-turnover conditions show a slight decrease in numbers of turnover achieved, from 12 to 9 relative to FeII-FeBMb1(MF-heme), and UV-vis spectra consistent with the same inhibition process. Most strikingly, experiments with ZnII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) show that it can perform 7 consecutive turnovers despite the lack of redox activity from the ZnII ion (Figure 3).</p><p>While time-resolved resonance Raman experiments have shown that both iron(II) centers in FeII-FeBMb2 bind one NO molecule before generating N2O (33), the multiple turnovers exhibited by ZnII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) highlight that NO binding to the non-heme metal center is not required for activity in these constructs. Vibrational analyses of heme {FeNO}7 species in FeBMbs (32) and FeBMb1(MF-heme) (38) have shown how interactions of divalent metals at the FeB site with the heme-bound NO group result in large downshifts of the ν(NO) indicative of an increase in NO- nitroxyl-like character. Since the E-FeBMb1(MF-heme) does not turn over, our current data suggest that this increased electron density on the NO moiety facilitates a reductive catalytic route where the heme {FeNO}7 species is further reduced to an {FeNO}8 species prone to electrophilic attack by a second NO molecule and N-N bond formation (Scheme 2). Experiments with FeBMb proteins with Cu(I) bound at the FeB site support these conclusions since the monovalent ion fails to increase the NO- nitroxyl-like character of the heme {FeNO}7 (32) and does not permit multi-turnover in CuI-FeBMb1(MF-heme) (see Supporting Information for details).</p><p>The reductive pathway described in Scheme 2 differs from the cis-heme mechanism favored by Blomberg (22) or the trans mechanism (19, 24, 25), since these two mechanisms involve redox cycling of the diiron site between diferrous and diferric forms. Nevertheless, the NOR activity of ZnII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) is more in line with the cis-heme pathway favored by Blomberg (22) since it rules out the formation of a trans metal-nitrosyl dimer. A recent study by Richter-Addo and coworkers that showed how Lewis acid coordination to nitrosyl O-atom in porphyrin {FeNO}7 models can promote NO coupling reactions also brings support to the cis-heme mechanism (39).</p><p>A recent study of a nonheme diiron complex that mimics the flavodiiron nitric oxide reductase (FNORs) showed how a one-electron reduction of a stable [{FeNO}7]2 synthetic model complex was sufficient to produce N2O (40). This novel semi-reduced mechanism is distinct from the super-reduction mechanism proposed earlier by Kurtz where an [{FeNO}7]2 requires a 2-electron reduction for N-N coupling and N2O production (41). Although flavin-free FNORs has been shown to produce N2O (42), Lehnert and coworkers suggest that the reaction can proceed more efficiently with the flavin cofactor acting as a single electron donor (40). Our current study with FeBMbs supports an equivalent semi-reduced pathway with a heme-only redox active binuclear NO reduction in FeBMb1(MF-heme) and as a possible catalytic route for NORs.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of the multiple NO reduction turnovers showed 12, 9 and 7 turnovers with FeII/CoII/ZnII-FeBMb1(MF-heme) complexes, respectively. These results clearly show that the presence of a redox active metal center is not required for multiple NO reductase turnovers in metal-loaded FeBMb1(MF-heme). The higher reduction potential of MF-heme facilitates the one-electron reduction of its {FeNO}7 complex and electrophilic addition of a second NO to produce N2O through a semi-reduced pathway. The divalent metal ion at the FeB site is required for electrostatic activation. A similar semi-reduced pathway should be considered in investigations of cytochrome-c-dependent NOR activity in reducing conditions.</p>","answer":"FeBMbs are structural and functional models of native bacterial nitric oxide reductases (NORs) generated through engineering of myoglobin. These biosynthetic models replicate the heme-nonheme diiron site of NORs and allow substitutions of metal centers and heme cofactors. Here, we provide evidence for multiple NOR turnover in monoformyl-heme-containing FeBMb1 proteins loaded with FeII, CoII, or ZnII metal ions at the FeB site (FeII/CoII/ZnII-FeBMb1(MF-heme)). FTIR detection of the xcexbd(NNO) band of N2O at 2231 cmxe2x88x921 provides a direct quantitative measurement of the product in solution. A maximum number of turnover is observed with FeII-FeBMb1(MF-heme), but the NOR activity is retained when the FeB site is loaded with ZnII. These data support the viability of a one-electron semi-reduced pathway for the reduction of NO at binuclear centers in reducing conditions."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Methylation of C5 of cytosines at CpG dinucleotide sites of the DNA is one of the most important factors regulating the expression of genes. The interactions of these CpG sites with proteins are essential for recognition and catalysis and in many cases are characterized by the flipping of either of the cytosine bases out of the DNA helix. In this paper, we present results from molecular dynamics simulations indicating that methylation of CpG sites suppresses spontaneous extra-helical conformations of either of the two cytosines. Thus, cytosines in unmethylated sites flip out easier than in hemimethylated sites and the latter flip out easier than in fully methylated sites. The different propensities for base flipping is observed not only between the cytosines that differ in their methylation states but also between the cytosines on the complementary strand. From alchemical mutation calculations, we find that methylation of one of the cytosines increases the free energy of the extra-helical conformation by 10.3-16.5 kJ/mol and this increase is additive with respect to the second methylation. Potential of mean force calculations confirm these results and reveal that cytosines in unmethylated sites favor flipping via the major-groove pathway. We perform several analyses to correlate this behavior with structural changes induced by the different methylation states of the CpG site. However, we demonstrate that the driving force for these propensities is the change in the electronic distribution around the pyrimidine ring upon methylation. In particular, unmethylated cytosine interacts more favorably (primarily via electrostatic forces) with solvent water molecules than methylated cytosine. This is observed for, both, extra-helical cytosines and intra-helical cytosines in which the cytosine on the complementary strand flips out and water molecules enter the DNA double-helix and substitute the hydrogen bonds with the orphan guanine. On the basis of these results of spontaneous base flipping, we conjecture that the mechanism for base flipping observed in complexes between hemimethylated DNAs and proteins is not likely to be passive.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"pyrimidine\\", \\"hydrogen\\", \\"CpG dinucleotide\\", \\"guanine\\", \\"CpG\\", \\"cytosine\\", \\"cytosines\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

The axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by activating its receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer ). We have found that chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro. We have also found that DCC is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding, and that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of DCC and cause an increase in DCC protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants. Thus, potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on the axons, and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"Colorectal Cancer\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Soluble monomers assemble into large transmembrane pores via conformational transitions that remain to be structurally and mechanistically characterised. Here we present an 11 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy( cryo-EM) structure of the two-part, fungal toxin Pleurotolysin( Ply), together with crystal structures of both components( the lipid binding PlyA protein and the pore-forming MACPF component PlyB). These data reveal a 13-fold pore 80 Å in diameter and 100 Å in height, with each subunit comprised of a PlyB molecule atop a membrane bound dimer of PlyA. The resolution of the EM map, together with biophysical and computational experiments, allowed confident assignment of subdomains in a MACPF pore assembly. The major conformational changes in PlyB are a ∼70° opening of the bent and distorted central β-sheet of the MACPF domain, accompanied by extrusion and refolding of two α-helical regions into transmembrane β-hairpins( TMH1 and TMH2). We determined the structures of three different disulphide bond-trapped prepore intermediates. Analysis of these data by molecular modelling and flexible fitting allows us to generate a potential trajectory of β-sheet unbending. The results suggest that MACPF conformational change is triggered through disruption of the interface between a conserved helix-turn-helix motif and the top of TMH2. Following their release we propose that the transmembrane regions assemble into β-hairpins via top down zippering of backbone hydrogen bonds to form the membrane-inserted β-barrel. The intermediate structures of the MACPF domain during refolding into the β-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition from soluble monomer to pore, which may be conserved across the whole superfamily. The TMH2 region is critical for the release of both TMH clusters, suggesting why this region is targeted by endogenous inhibitors of MACPF function.Introduction:Membrane pore-forming proteins have the unique property of being expressed as metastable, water-soluble monomers that convert into a membrane inserted form. These proteins typically assemble into prepore oligomers on the target membrane surface. A dramatic conformational change then permits membrane insertion and formation of transmembrane pores[1–4]. The membrane attack complex/perforin-like family( MACPF) proteins form the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins identified to date. They include perforin and complement component-9( C9), mammalian pore-forming proteins that function as weapons of the humoral and cellular immune system, respectively[5]. The superfamily also includes a wide range of molecules implicated in defense or attack[6–8]. For example, invasion by the protozoan parasites Plasmodium spp. and egress by Toxoplasma gondii requires MACPF proteins, plants utilize the MACPF fold to combat bacterial infection[9], and MACPF-related proteins can be identified in numerous Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. Finally, a significant group of MACPF proteins play important, but poorly understood, roles in embryonic development and neurobiology[10–12]. Despite the absence of detectable sequence identity, the first crystal structures of MACPF proteins revealed that the pore-forming domain unexpectedly shared homology with the pore-forming bacterial cholesterol dependent cytolysins( CDCs) family[13–15]. This structural similarity extended across the key elements involved in pore formation( originally annotated as three non-contiguous domains 1–3 in CDCs). The central, common feature of the MACPF/CDC fold is a four stranded, highly twisted β-sheet decorated with three small clusters of α-helices. Two of these helical bundles contain the regions destined to insert into the membrane( transmembrane hairpins TMH1 and TMH2). The third α-helical region comprises a short helix-turn-helix( HTH) motif formed via a sequence insertion at the bend of the central β-sheet. The HTH motif packs on top of TMH2. These structural similarities, together with commonality of a pore-forming function, suggested that MACPF proteins share a common ancestor with CDCs and assemble into giant pores via a CDC-like mechanism[13, 14, 16–19]. Previous studies have provided important insight into pore formation by CDCs. Electron microscopy( EM), biochemical, and biophysical studies of CDCs showed that monomers assemble into prepore oligomers on the membrane surface without major conformational changes in the subunits[17, 19–22]. However, conversion to the pore form involves dramatic secondary and tertiary conformational changes in which the highly twisted β-sheet opens up and the assembly collapses ∼40 Å towards the membrane surface, allowing unfurling of TMH1 and TMH2 and their insertion into the membrane as amphipathic β-hairpins[19–22]. The CDCs form initial interactions with the membrane through a C-terminal lipid binding immunoglobulin-like( Ig) domain. In the MACPF branch of the superfamily a wide variety of domains are found both N- and C-terminal to the pore-forming MACPF domain. For example, perforin includes a C-terminal lipid and calcium binding C2 domain( a variation of the Ig fold). Similar to the CDC Ig domain, this region mediates initial interaction of perforin with the target membrane. The MACPF domains in the complement membrane attack complex proteins are flanked by arrays of small disulphide constrained domains( e. g., thrombospondin, epidermal growth factor, and complement control protein domains). Rather than interacting directly with membranes, the role of these regions includes mediation of key protein-protein interactions that recruit the MACPF domain to the target cell surface[23–25]. The molecular structures of key intermediates in the assembly of MACPF and CDC pore complexes remain obscure, but are necessary to understand the transition from a monomeric form into oligomeric membrane prepores and then into pores. Here we have analysed this transition, using a variety of structural and biophysical approaches. Structures of MACPF and CDC oligomeric assemblies by EM have been very limited in resolution, owing to their heterogeneity and flexibility. To gain further insight into the structural conversions in pore formation, we chose pleurotolysin( Ply), a MACPF protein consisting of two components, PlyA and PlyB, from Pleurotus ostreatus[26, 27]. Previous studies have shown that PlyA binds membranes and is required to recruit the pore-forming MACPF protein PlyB to the membrane surface. PlyA and PlyB together form relatively small and regular pores in liposomes[27, 28]. As well as determining the structure of the pleurotolysin pore, we used protein-engineering approaches to trap and structurally characterise three distinct prepore intermediates. Together these approaches allowed us to visualise a potential molecular trajectory of a MACPF protein during pore formation.Discussion:Here, we present a series of structures that identify the major conformational changes during MACPF pore formation. The final pore structure reveals that individual PlyB monomers in the pore have the orientation seen for those in the distantly related CDCs[17]. Although sequence-related to perforin, their pores differ in several respects. Like CDCs, perforin is a thin, key-shaped molecule, but it does not open up in the pore state[18]. This difference likely arises from the divergent structures surrounding the conserved MACPF core, as well as from its longer TMH regions. In addition, C-terminal labelling indicated the opposite β-sheet orientation in the perforin pore[18]. A model based on a more recently determined C8 structure[39] suggests that the closely related terminal complement proteins would have the CDC orientation, but there are currently no other data available for a more definitive conclusion on perforin. Our findings highlight a critical role of the interface between the top of TMH2 and the surrounding region in controlling sheet opening. The results of the constrained fitting suggest that a key trigger for the conformational change includes displacement of the HTH motif away from the bend in the sheet. Highly conserved glycine residues[14] adjacent to the HTH motif may provide the hinge point for this motion( Fig. 3D). Consistent with this model, mutation of the equivalent glycine residues in a CDC prevents oligomerisation[40]. It is notable that the HTH packs against the top of TMH2, suggesting that interactions between these two regions may govern unlocking of the bent conformation( Fig. 3D). After sheet unbending, we propose that membrane insertion and pore formation follow a top down, zippering mechanism with the barrel assembling towards the membrane surface, energetically driven by refolding of the TMH regions. This mechanism would also minimize the free energy cost of inserting naked hairpins with unsatisfied hydrogen bond potential into the membrane. Analysis of intermediate prepore structures provides the basis for a molecular movie( S1 Movie) that illustrates a possible trajectory of the core β-sheet in a MACPF protein unbending from the soluble monomer conformation to the transmembrane pore( Fig. 6). The pore structure shows that Ply shares some features with CDCs, in particular the orientation of monomers and opening of the molecule to release the TMH regions. On the other hand it resembles perforin regarding its longer TMH regions that refold into a ∼100-Å-long beta-barrel that reaches down through the membrane without any collapse of the molecule. This work provides new insights into the assembly of a two-component MACPF/CDC family member, suggesting a basis for the study of more complex assembly systems such as the complement MAC. Furthermore, the intermediate structures of the MACPF/CDC domain during its refolding into the β-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition of the prepore to pore, which is likely to be conserved across the MACPF/CDC protein family.","answer":"Animals , plants , fungi , and bacteria all use pore-forming proteins of the membrane attack complex-perforin ( MACPF ) family as lethal , cell-killing weapons . These proteins are able to insert into the plasma membranes of target cells , creating large pores that short circuit the natural separation between the intracellular and extracellular milieu , with catastrophic results . However , the pore-forming proteins must undergo a substantial transformation from soluble precursors to a large barrel-shaped transmembrane complex as they punch their way into cells . Using a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryo electron microscopy , we have visualized , for the first time , the mechanism of action of one of these pore-forming proteins—pleurotolysin , a MACPF protein from the edible oyster mushroom . This enabled us to propose a model of the pleurotolysin pore by fitting the crystallographic structures of the pore proteins into a three-dimensional map of the pore obtained by cryo electron microscopy . We then designed a set of double mutants that allowed us to chemically trap intermediate states along the trajectory of the pore formation process , and to determine their structures too . By combining these data we proposed a detailed molecular mechanism for pore formation . The pleurotolysin first assembles into rings of 13 subunits , each of which then opens up by about 70° during pore formation . This process is accompanied by refolding and extrusion of two compact regions from each subunit into long hairpins that then zipper together to form an 80-Å wide barrel-shaped channel through the membrane ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

Part I--The hard tissues.Abstract 1:A prospect i ve clinical study with a r and om allocation of 47 adolescent patients to three different functional appliance groups was established and compared with an untreated control group over a 9-month period . Treatment was undertaken with either a Bionator , Twin Block , or Bass appliance . Pre- and post-treatment cephalograms were used to quantify the skeletal and dentoalveolar changes produced by the appliances and compared with those observed in the control group as a result of growth . Both the Bionator and Twin Block appliances demonstrated a statistically significant increase in m and ibular length ( 3.9 + /- 2.7 mm ; 3.7 + /- 2.1 mm , respectively ) compared with the control group ( P < 0.05 ) , with an anterior movement of pogonion and point B. Highly statistically significant increases ( P < 0.01 ) were seen in lower face heights for all the appliance groups compared with the control group . The Twin Block group showed the least forward movement of point A due to a change in the inclination of the maxillary plane . The Bionator and Twin Block groups showed statistically significant reductions in the inclination of the upper incisors to the maxillary plane ( P < 0.05 ) . The Bass group showed minimal change in the inclination of the lower labial segment to the m and ibular plane . The Bionator group demonstrated the greatest proclination of the lower labial segment ( 4.0 + /- 3.6 degrees ) . Clinical ly important changes were measured in all the appliance groups when compared with the control group . Differences were also identified between the functional appliance groups . The Twin Block appliance and , to a lesser extent , the Bionator appeared the most effective in producing sagittal and vertical changesTitle 2:Changes in soft tissue profile following treatment with the bionator.Abstract 2:The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in the soft tissue profile in patients treated in the mixed dentition with a bionator . Two groups of 30 individuals , between 9 and 12 years old and with Class II , Division 1 , malocclusion were matched for age , sex , observation time , and dentofacial characteristics . Patients in the first group were treated with a bionator for an average of 18.7 months , result ing in a Class I molar relationship and reduction of overjet . The second group acted as a control and individuals did not receive any form of orthodontic treatment . Pretreatment and posttreatment cephalograms were analyzed and paired t-tests were used to compare the significance of changes between the two groups . Compared with the control group , the treated group demonstrated 1.97 degrees decrease in ANB , a 3.35 mm increase in anterior facial height , 2.22 degrees decrease in soft tissue profile convexity , and 17.4 degrees increase in mentolabial angleTitle 3:Facial profile changes during and after Herbst appliance treatment.Abstract 3:The short- and long-term effects of the Herbst appliance on the facial profile were determined in 69 Class II , division 1 malocclusions treated for 7 months and followed for 5 - 10 years post-treatment . Forty-nine subjects exhibited a stable long-term treatment result , while 20 cases relapsed . Lateral cephalometric radiographs from before treatment , after treatment , 6 months post-treatment , and 5 - 10 years post-treatment were analysed . As a rule Herbst treatment result ed in a reduction of the facial hard and soft tissue profile convexity . In relation to the E-line , the upper lip became retrusive , while the lower lip remained , on average , unchanged . During the post-treatment period of 5 - 10 years the hard tissue profile convexity was , on average , reduced in both the stable and relapse groups . When excluding the nose in the soft tissue profile evaluation , the facial profile convexity was , on average , reduced in the stable group while it remained unchanged in the relapse group . When including the nose in the evaluation , an average increase in the profile convexity occurred in both examination groups . Furthermore , the upper and lower lips became retrusive in both groups . For all the variables , however , large individual variations existed . In conclusion , it can be said that the Herbst appliance improves the facial hard and soft tissue profiles . Due to post-treatment growth changes the long-term effects of therapy are , however , variable and unpredictableTitle 4:Ratings of profile attractiveness after functional appliance treatment.Abstract 4:The aim of this study was to determine the change in profile attractiveness in children with Class II Division 1 malocclusion after 18 months ' treatment with functional appliances .  Changes in profile attractiveness were assessed by panels of art students , dental students , and parents of orthodontic patients . Each panel consisted of an equal number of male and female raters . The raters first decided whether the initial or 18-month profile silhouette was more attractive , and then scored the degree to which it was more attractive on an unmarked visual analog scale . There were no significant differences between either male and female raters or among panels in their assessment s of the change in profile attractiveness in the whole sample . Neither were there significant differences between the change in profile attractiveness of the untreated subjects and the subjects treated with either Fränkel function regulators or Harvold activators . It is concluded that treatment with functional appliances does not lead to more attractive profiles than nontreatmentTitle 5:A prospective evaluation of Bass, Bionator and Twin Block appliances. Part II--The soft tissues.Abstract 5:A prospect i ve clinical study with a r and om allocation of 47 patients to three different functional appliance groups was established and compared with a slightly younger control group over a 9-month period . The cephalometric hard tissue changes were assessed in relation to the soft tissue changes produced and the patients were also assessed by three-dimensional ( 3D ) laser scanning of the facial soft tissues . Each ' averaged ' appliance group scan was compared with the ' averaged ' control group face . Statistically and clinical ly significant changes occurred in the group treated with the Twin Block appliance , and to a lesser extent in the group treated with the Bionator appliance . No statistically significant facial soft tissue changes could be demonstrated in the Bass appliance group . Upper lip position remained stable despite the significant overjet reduction attained in the three appliance groups . Lower lip protrusion ( up to 3.8 mm ) , lower lip length ( up to 4.0 mm ) , and soft tissue lower and total face height increased significantly in all appliance groups by varying amounts . The long-term effect of these changes needs to be fully evaluated . The laser scanning system was found to be a sensitive and accurate method of quantitatively assessing small changes in the soft tissue facial form . Significant changes of the facial tissues in the transverse plane were highlighted by this techniqueTitle 6:A prospective optical surface scanning and cephalometric assessment of the effect of functional appliances on the soft tissues.Abstract 6:The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different functional appliances on the soft tissues as assessed by cephalometry and optical surface scanning .

METHODS Seventy-four patients with vitiligo were r and omly divided into the XBM group treated with XBM and the control group treated with 8-MOP . The therapeutic effect , nail-fold microcirculation , plasma endothelin-1 , serum immunoglobulin were observed and compared . RESULTS The therapeutic effect of XBM was better than that of 8-MOP ( P < 0.05 ) . XBM could also obviously improve the nail-fold microcirculation , elevate the plasma endothelin-1 level and lower the serum IgG ( P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION XBM has superiority in treating vitiligoTitle 2:Effectiveness of oral Ginkgo biloba in treating limited, slowly spreading vitiligoAbstract 2:Summary For effective treatment of vitiligo , it is as important to arrest the progression of the disease as it is to induce repigmentation . Recently , oxidative stress has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo . Ginkgo biloba extract has been shown to have antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties . In a double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial , we evaluated the efficacy of G. biloba extract in controlling the activity of the disease process in patients with limited and slow‐spreading vitiligo and in inducing repigmentation of vitiliginous areas . Fifty‐two patients were assigned to two treatment groups ( A and B ) in a double‐blind fashion , but only 47 patients could be evaluated , because one patient in group A and four patients in group B withdrew for reasons unrelated to the study . Patients in group A were given G. biloba extract 40 mg three times daily whereas patients in group B received placebo in similar doses . A statistically significant cessation of active progression of depigmentation was noted in patients treated with G. biloba ( P = 0.006 ) . Marked to complete repigmentation was seen in 10 patients in group A , whereas only two patients in group B showed similar repigmentation . The G. biloba extract was well tolerated . G. biloba extract seems to be a simple , safe and fairly effective therapy for arresting the progression of the diseaseTitle 3:Treatment of vitiligo vulgaris with narrow band UVB (311 nm) for one year and the effect of addition of folic acid and vitamin B12.Abstract 3:Narrow b and UVB is succeeding psoralen and UVA irradiation as the main treatment of vitiligo vulgaris in several European countries . Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency in some vitiligo patients has prompted research ers to investigate the efficacy of these vitamins in the treatment of vitiligo . In the present controlled study we investigated the value of narrow b and UVB phototherapy in the treatment of vitiligo and the possible additive effect of vitamin B12 and folic acid .  Twenty-seven patients with long-term stable vitiligo were included and r and omized in a  \\" UVB only \\" ( UVB ) or \\" UVB combined with vitamin B12 and folic acid \\" ( UVB+ ) group . Patients were irradiated thrice weekly for one year , whilst repigmentation was carefully monitored . In 92 % ( 25/27 ) of the patients up to 100 % repigmentation was seen . Repigmentation was notable in lesions on the face , neck and throat , lower arm , chest , back and lower legs , whilst repigmentation on the h and s , wrists , feet and ankles proved to be minimal . Maximum repigmentation rates did not differ significantly between the UVB group and the UVB+ group . Our study reconfirms that narrow b and UVB phototherapy is an effective treatment for vitiligo and shows that co-treatment with vitamin B12 and folic acid does not improve the outcome of treatment of vitiligo with narrow b and UVB phototherapyTitle 4:Treatment of vitiligo with local khellin and UVA: comparison with systemic PUVAAbstract 4:Vitiligo is an idiopathic leukoderma often with a progressive course causing destruction of melanocytes . The best methods for achieving cosmetically acceptable re‐pigmentation of affected skin appear to be both local and systemic PUVA . They may , however , cause serious side effects , which is an argument for conducting research into new , equally effective photo‐chemotherapeutic agents . One of these agents is khellin . We conducted a pilot study in 33 patients to evaluate the effectiveness of local KUVA and systemic PUVA therapy for vitiligo and to compare them in terms of the degree of re‐pigmentation , duration of treatment , number of procedures , total UVA dose and side effects . Local KUVA required longer duration of treatment and higher UVA doses . KUVA‐induced re‐pigmentation depended on the age of the patients ( r = −0.61 , P = 0.001 ) , and better results were achieved with younger individuals [ % re‐pigmentation = 81.76 − ( 1.48 × age in years ) ] . No side effects were observed in cases of local KUVA  treatment . Erythema , itching and gastro‐intestinal disturbances occurred with some patients treated with PUVA . The results demonstrate that local KUVA  may effectively induce re‐pigmentation of vitiligo‐affected skin areas to a degree comparable to that achieved when using systemic PUVA , provided that treatment duration is long enoughTitle 5:[Evaluation of an antioxidant and mitochondria-stimulating cream formula on the skin of patients with stable common vitiligo].Abstract 5:Vitiligo is a chronic illness of a yet unknown etiology , characterized by an acquired and progressive depigmentation of the skin . There are diverse treatments for this condition around the world , but up to now , none has been completely effective . The objective of this work was to evaluate the application of an antioxidant and mitochondrial stimulating formula , of topic use in leukodermic areas of patients with stable vulgar vitiligo . A clinical , experimental , r and omized , double blind study was carried out in 50 male and 50 female patients with stable vulgar vitiligo . The patients were distributed in five groups as follows : Group 1 ( labelled as VitilVenz AF ) : application of antioxidant and mitochondrial stimulating cream and oral administration of antioxidants and phenylalanine . Group 2 ( labelled as Placebo AF ) : application of a placebo cream and oral administration of antioxidants and phenylalanine . Group 3 ( labelled as without cream AF ) : oral administration of antioxidants and phenylalanine . Group 4 ( labelled as Placebo cream ) : application of a placebo cream . Group 5 ( labelled as VitilVenz ) : application of the antioxidant and mitochondrial stimulating cream . The following were measured in all patients : the clinical area of newly formed pigment every 30 days , during five months ; and the presence of melanocytes in the histological study , at the beginning and at the end of treatment . The test of multiple comparison of Turkey-Kramer was used for the analysis of the results . The scheme of treatment that produced the best results was that of the Group 1 , which consisted of the joint application of the antioxidant and mitochondrial stimulating cream and oral administration of antioxidants and phenylalanine ( p < 0.001 ) ; followed by Group 5 that only received the topical treatment with the antioxidant and mitochondrial stimulating cream . The clinical and histological responses of these two groups ( 1 and 5 ) were significantly different to the rest of the groups . We concluded that the melanocytes in these patients could be in a dysfunctional state , product of the formation of free radicals that cause cellular and mitochondrial toxicity ; and that these free radicals are removed by the antioxidant and mitochondrial stimulating elements present in the cream , turning the melanocytes functional and producing melanin in the achromic area of the vitiligo . This effect would be potentiated by the use of oral antioxidants and phenylalanineTitle 6:Treatment of vitiligo vulgaris with narrow-band UVB and oral Polypodium leucotomos extract: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.Abstract 6:BACKGROUND The first choice treatment for vitiligo vulgaris is narrow-b and UVB ( NB-UVB ) , but no satisfactory treatment exists . OBJECTIVES To investigate if Polypodium leucotomos , an antioxidative and immunomodulatory plant extract , improves NB-UVB-induced repigmentation . METHODS Fifty patients with vitiligo vulgaris r and omly received 250 mg oral P. leucotomos or placebo three times daily , combined with NB-UVB twice weekly for 25 - 26 weeks . RESULTS Repigmentation was higher in the P. leucotomos group vs. placebo in the head and neck area ( 44 % vs. 27 % , P = 0.06 ) . Small repigmentation increases ( P = n.s . ) were observed for the trunk ( 6 % increased repigmentation ) , extremities ( 4 % ) , and h and s and feet ( 5 % ) in the P. leucotomos group vs. placebo . Patients attending more than 80 % of required NB-UVB sessions showed increased repigmentation in the head and neck area in the P. leucotomos group vs. placebo ( 50 % vs. 19 % , P < 0.002 ) ; no significant differences were seen in the other body areas . Patients with skin types 2 and 3 showed more repigmentation in the head and neck area in the P. leucotomos group vs. placebo ( 47 % vs. 21 % , P = 0.01 ) , and no significant differences were seen in the other body areas . No conclusions could be drawn on skin types 4 and 5 due to low patient numbers . CONCLUSION There is a clear trend towards an increase in repigmentation of vitiligo vulgaris affecting the head and neck area when NB-UVB phototherapy is combined with oral P. leucotomos . This effect may be more pronounced in light skin typesTitle 7:Phenylalanine and UVA light for the treatment of vitiligoAbstract 7:Summary The administration of phenylalanine ( Phe ) combined with UVA exposure was found to be effective in vitiligo . Phe is an amino acid which constitutes part of the daily dietary protein , and when orally administered in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight , it results in an elevated plasma level . Since peak concentrations of Phe in the blood are reached between 30 and 45 min after ingestion , UVA exposure was administered at this time . After 4 months ( 32 treatments ) reasonable repigmentation preferentially occurred in the skin area of subcutaneous fat ( adipose tissue ) . Apart from the repigmentation of hypopigmented macules , vitiligo patients can tolerate more sun than usual , especially at the vitiliginous lesion , and they experience no sunburn as a result of Phe-UVA therapy . Normal skin also tans very wellTitle 8:For randomized controlled trials, the quality of reports of complementary and alternative medicine was as good as reports of conventional medicine.Abstract 8:OBJECTIVE To compare the quality of reporting of reports r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) published in English and in language s other than English ( LOE ) , and to determine whether there were differences between conventional medicine ( CM ) and complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) reports . STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING We examined more than 600 RCTs associated with 125 systematic review s. We extracted characteristics of each RCT using a st and ardized data collection form . We assessed quality using the Jadad scale and the adequacy of allocation concealment . RESULTS There were only minor differences in the quality of reports of RCTs published in English compared with other language s ( median quality score of 3 vs. 2 , P=.10 ) , and the quality of reports of CAM RCTs was similar to the CM reports ( median score of 3 vs. 2 , P=.14 ) . There was no effect of language of publication on quality of reporting for CM trials ( median score of 2 vs. 2 , P=.12 ) . Among CAM trials , however , overall quality scores were higher for reports in English than for reports in other language s ( median score of 3 vs. 2 , P=.04 ) . CONCLUSION The overall quality of reports published in language s other than English is similar to that of English- language reports . Moreover , the overall quality of reporting of RCTs of CAM interventions is as good as that for CM interventionsTitle 9:L-phenylalanine and UVA irradiation in the treatment of vitiligo.Abstract 9:In order to evaluate the efficacy of L-phenylalanine ( L-Phe ) in combination with UVA therapy for vitiligo an open trial ( 149 patients , 18 months ) and a small double-blind trial ( 32 patients , 6 months ) were conducted . Oral L-Phe loading result ed in peak plasma levels of L-Phe after 30 - 60 min and a slight increase in the plasma tyrosine level . Response to  L-Phe plus UVA irradiation  was positive , and various grade s of repigmentation not exceeding 77 % in the open and 60 % in the blind trial were observed . An increased L-Phe dose result ed in increased L-Phe plasma levels but not in improved clinical results . The optimal L-Phe dose appears to be lower than 50 mg/kg/day . Although it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the present investigation , we think that L-Phe may have a place in the treatment of vitiligo and its role merits further investigation","answer":"The studies provide weak evidence that photosensitizing plants can be effective in conjunction with phototherapy , and moderate evidence that Ginkgo biloba monotherapy can be useful for vitiligo .Conclusion Reports investigating the efficacy of NHPs for vitiligo exist , but are of poor method ological quality and contain significant reporting flaws ."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

A recurrent state transition model is constructed, which better captures a gradual process of stock movement continuously by modeling the correlation between past and future price movements. By separating the effects of news and noise, a noisy random factor is also explicitly fitted based on the recurrent states. Results show that the proposed model outperforms strong baselines. Thanks to the use of attention over news events, our model is also more explainable. To our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly model both events and noise over a fundamental stock value state for news-driven stock movement prediction.IntroductionStock movement prediction is a central task in computational and quantitative finance. With recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing technology, event-driven stock prediction has received increasing research attention BIBREF0, BIBREF1. The goal is to predict the movement of stock prices according to financial news. Existing work has investigated news representation using bag-of-words BIBREF2, named entities BIBREF3, event structures BIBREF4 or deep learning BIBREF1, BIBREF5.Most previous work focuses on enhancing news representations, while adopting a relatively simple model on the stock movement process, casting it as a simple response to a set of historical news. The prediction model can therefore be viewed as variations of a classifier that takes news as input and yields stock movement predictions. In contrast, work on time-series based stock prediction BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF5, BIBREF8, aims to capture continuous movements of prices themselves.We aim to introduce underlying price movement trends into news-driven stock movement prediction by casting the underlaying stock value as a recurrent state, integrating the influence of news events and random noise simultaneously into the recurrent state transitions. In particular, we take a LSTM with peephole connections BIBREF9 for modeling a stock value state over time, which can reflect the fundamentals of a stock. The influence of news over a time window is captured in each recurrent state transition by using neural attention to aggregate representations of individual news. In addition, all other factors to the stock price are modeled using a random factor component, so that sentiments, expectations and noise can be dealt with explicitly.Compared with existing work, our method has three salient advantages. First, the process in which the influence of news events are absorbed into stock price changes is explicitly modeled. Though previous work has attempted towards this goal BIBREF1, existing models predict each stock movement independently, only modeling the correlation between news in historical news sequences. As shown in Figure FIGREF1, our method can better capture a continuous process of stock movement by modeling the correlation between past and future stock values directly. In addition, non-linear compositional effects of multiple events in a time window can be captured.Second, to our knowledge, our method allows noise to be explicitly addressed in a model, therefore separating the effects of news and other factors. In contrast, existing work trains a stock prediction model by fitting stock movements to events, and therefore can suffer from overfitting due to external factors and noise.Third, our model is also more explainable thanks to the use of attention over news events, which is similar to the work of BIBREF10 and BIBREF11. Due to the use of recurrent states, we can visualize past events over a large time window. In addition, we propose a novel future event prediction module to factor in likely next events according to natural events consequences. The future event module is trained over gold “future” data over historical events. Therefore, it can also deal with insider trading factors to some extent.Experiments over the benchmark of BIBREF1 show that our method outperforms strong baselines, giving the best reported results in the literature. To our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly model both events and noise over a fundamental stock value state for news-driven stock movement prediction. Note that unlike time-series stock prediction models BIBREF12, BIBREF5, we do not take explicit historical prices as part of model inputs, and therefore our research still focuses on the influence of news information alone, and are directly comparable to existing work on news-driven stock prediction.MethodThe framework of our model is shown in Figure FIGREF2. We explicitly model both events and noise over a recurrent stock value state, which is modeled using LSTM. For each trading day, we consider the news events happened in that day as well as the past news events using neural attention BIBREF16. Considering the impacts of insider trading, we also involve future news in the training procedure. To model the high stochasticity of stock market, we sample an additive noise using a neural module. Our model is named attention-based noisy recurrent states transition (ANRES).Considering the general principle of sample independence, building temporal connections between individual trading days in training set is not suitable for training BIBREF5 and we find it easy to overfit. We notice that a LSTM usually takes several steps to generate a more stable hidden state. As an alternative method, we extended the time span of one sample to T previous continuous trading days ({t-T+1, t-T+2, ..., t-1, t}), which we call a trading sequence, is used as the basic training element in this paper.Method ::: LSTM-based Recurrent State TransitionANRES uses LSTM with peephole connections BIBREF9. The underlying stock value trends are represented as a recurrent state z transited over time, which can reflect the fundamentals of a stock. In each trading day, we consider the impact of corresponding news events and a random noise as:where v_t is the news events impact vector on the trading day t and f is a function in which random noise will be integrated.By using this basic framework, the non-linear compositional effects of multiple events can also be captured in a time window. Then we use the sequential state z_t to make binary classification as:where hat{p}_t is the estimated probabilities, hat{y}_t is the predicted label and x_t is the input trading day.Method ::: Training ObjectiveFor training, there are two main terms in our loss function. The first term is a cross entropy loss for the predicted probabilities hat{p}_t and gold labels y_t, and the second term is the mean squared error between the estimated future impact vector hat{a}_t and the true future impact vector a_t.The total loss for a trading sequence containing T trading days with standard L_2 regularization is calculated as:where theta  is a hyper-parameter which indicates how much important L_{mse} is comparing to L_{ce}, Phi  is the set of trainable parameters in the entire ANRES model and lambda  is the regularization weight.ExperimentsWe use the public financial news dataset released by BIBREF4, which is crawled from Reuters and Bloomberg over the period from October 2006 to November 2013. We conduct our experiments on predicting the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock (S&P 500) index and its selected individual stocks, obtaining indices and prices from Yahoo Finance. Detailed statistics of the training, development and test sets are shown in Table TABREF8. We report the final results on test set after using development set to tune some hyper-parameters.Experiments ::: SettingsThe hyper-parameters of our ANRES model are shown in Table TABREF11. We use mini-batches and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum to update the parameters. Most of the hyper-parameters are chosen according to development experiments, while others like dropout rate r and SGD momentum mu  are set according to common values.Following previous work BIBREF0, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, we adopt the standard measure of accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate S&P 500 index prediction and selected individual stock prediction. MCC is applied because it avoids bias due to data skew. Given the confusion matrix which contains true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative values, MCC is calculated as:Experiments ::: Initializing Noisy Recurrent StatesAs the first set of development experiments, we try different ways to initialize the noisy recurrent states of our ANRES model to find a suitable approach. For each trading day, we compare the results whether states transitions are modeled or not. Besides, we also compare the methods of random initialization and zero initialization. Note that the random initialization method we use here returns a tensor filled with random numbers from the standard normal distribution mathcal {N}(0, 1). In summary, the following four baselines are designed:ANRES_Sing_R: randomly initializing the states for each single trading day.ANRES_Sing_Z: initializing the states as zeros for each single trading day.ANRES_Seq_R: randomly initializing the first states for each trading sequence only.ANRES_Seq_Z: initializing the first states as zeros for each trading sequence only.Development set results on predicting S&P 500 index are shown in Table TABREF13. We can see that modeling recurrent value sequences performs better than treating each trading day separately, which shows that modeling trading sequences can capture the correlations between trading days and the non-linear compositional effects of multiple events. From another perspective, the models ANRES_Sing_R and ANRES_Sing_Z also represent the strengths of our basic representations of news events in isolation. Therefore, we can also see that using only the basic news events representations is not sufficient for index prediction, while combining with our states transition module can achieve strong results.By comparing the results of ANRES_Seq_R and ANRES_Seq_Z, we decide to use zero initialization for our ANRES models, including the noisy recurrent states also in the remaining experiments.Experiments ::: Study on Trading Sequence LengthWe use the development set to find a suitable length T for trading sequence, which is searched from lbrace 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15rbrace . The S&P 500 index prediction results of accuracy, MCC and consumed minutes per training epoch on the development set are shown in Figure FIGREF19.We can see that the accuracy and MCC are positively correlated with the growth of T, while the change of accuracy is smaller than MCC. When T ge 7, the growth of MCC becomes slower than that when T < 7. Also considering the running time per training epoch, which is nearly linear w.r.t. T, we choose the hyper-parameter T=7 and use it in the remaining experiments.Experiments ::: Predicting S&P 500 IndexWe compare our approach with the following strong baselines on predicting the S&P 500 index, which also only use financial news:BIBREF21 uses bags-of-words to represent news documents, and constructs the prediction model by using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).BIBREF1 uses event embeddings as input and convolutional neural network prediction model.BIBREF13 empowers event embeddings with knowledge bases like YAGO and also adopts convolutional neural networks as the basic prediction framework.BIBREF22 uses fully connected model and character-level embedding input with LSTM to encode news texts.BIBREF23 uses recurrent neural networks with skip-thought vectors to represent news text.Table TABREF26 shows the test set results on predicting the S&P 500 index. From the table we can see that our ANRES model achieves the best results on the test sets. By comparing with BIBREF21, we can find that using news event embeddings and deep learning modules can be better representative and also flexible when dealing with high-dimension features.When comparing with BIBREF1 and the knowledge-enhanced BIBREF13, we find that extracting structured events may suffer from error propagation. And more importantly, modeling the correlations between trading days can better capture the compositional effects of multiple news events.By comparing with BIBREF22 and BIBREF23, despite that modeling the correlations between trading days can bring better results, we also find that modeling the noise by using a state-related random factor may be effective because of the high market stochasticity.Experiments ::: Ablation Study on News and NoiseWe explore the effects of different types of news events and the introduced random noise factor with ablation on the test set. More specifically, we disable the past news, the present news, future news and the noise factor, respectively. The S&P 500 index prediction results of the ablated models are shown in Table TABREF28. First, without using the past news events, the result becomes the lowest. The reason may be that history news contains the biggest amount of news events. In addition, considering the trading sequence length and the time windows of future news, if we disable the past news, most of them will not be involved in our model at any chance, while the present or the past news will be input on adjacent trading days.Second, it is worth noticing that using the future news events is more effective than using the present news events. On the one hand, it confirms the importances to involve the future news in our ANRES model, which can deal with insider trading factors to some extent. On the other hand, the reason may be the news impact redundancy in sequence, as the future news impact on the t-1-th day should be transited to the t-th day to compensate the absent loss of the present news events.The effect of modeling the noise factor is lower only to modeling the past news events, but higher than the other ablated models, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the noise factor module. We think the reason may because that modeling such an additive noise can separate the effects of news event impacts from other factors, which makes modeling the stock price movement trends more clearly.ConclusionWe investigated explicit modeling of stock value sequences in news-driven stock prediction by suing an LSTM state to model the fundamentals, adding news impact and noise impact by using attention and noise sampling, respectively. Results show that our method is highly effective, giving the best performance on a standard benchmark. To our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly model both events and noise over a fundamental stock value state for news-driven stock movement prediction.Figure 1: Example of news impacts on 3M Company. Over the first and the second periods (from Oct. 24 to Nov. 1, 2006 and from Sep. 21 to Oct. 1, 2007), there was only one event. In the third period (from Nov. 10 to Nov. 18, 2008), there were two events affecting the stock price movements simultaneously.Figure 2: The ANRES model framework for trading day t in a trading sequence.

The red solid elbows are only used in the training procedure, while the blue dotted elbows in the evaluating procedure.Table 2: Hyper-parameters setting.Figure 3: Development set results of different trading sequence length T .Table 4: Test set results on predicting S&P 500 index.Figure 4: Attention visualization and test set results comparison of the trading sequence [07/15/2013, 07/23/2013] when predicting Apple Inc.’s stock price movements using only company news.Question: What is dataset used for news-driven stock movement prediction?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"the public financial news dataset released by BIBREF4\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"We use the public financial news dataset released by BIBREF4, which is crawled from Reuters and Bloomberg over the period from October 2006 to November 2013.

BACKGROUND: Membrane Type-1 Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a multifunctional protease implicated in metastatic progression ostensibly due to its ability to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components and allow migration of cells through the basement membrane. Despite in vitro studies demonstrating this principle, this knowledge has not translated into the use of MMP inhibitors (MMPi) as effective cancer therapeutics, or been corroborated by evidence of in vivo ECM degradation mediated by MT1-MMP, suggesting that our understanding of the role of MT1-MMP in cancer progression is incomplete. METHODS: MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell lines were created that stably overexpress different levels of MT1-MMP. Using 2D culture, we analyzed proMMP-2 activation (gelatin zymography), ECM degradation (fluorescent gelatin), ERK signaling (immunoblot), cell migration (transwell/scratch closure/time-lapse imaging), and viability (colorimetric substrate) to assess how different MT1-MMP levels affect these cellular parameters. We also utilized Matrigel 3D cell culture and avian embryos to examine how different levels of MT1-MMP expression affect morphological changes in 3D culture, and tumourigenecity and extravasation efficiency in vivo. RESULTS: In 2D culture, breast cancer cells expressing high levels of MT1-MMP were capable of widespread ECM degradation and TIMP-2-mediated proMMP-2 activation, but were not the most migratory. Instead, cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP were the most migratory, and demonstrated increased viability and ERK activation. In 3D culture, MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP demonstrated an invasive protrusive phenotype, whereas cells expressing high levels of MT1-MMP demonstrated loss of colony structure and cell fragment release. Similarly, in vivo analysis demonstrated increased tumourigenecity and metastatic capability for cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP, whereas cells expressing high levels were devoid of these qualities despite the production of functional MT1-MMP protein. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that excessive ECM degradation mediated by high levels of MT1-MMP is not associated with cell migration and tumourigenesis, while low levels of MT1-MMP promote invasion and vascularization in vivo.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"Membrane Type-1 Matrix Metalloproteinase\\", \\"MMP-2\\", \\"ERK\\", \\"TIMP-2\\", \\"MT1-MMP\\"]}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways.Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation.Chains of ubiquitin linked via lysine 48 (K48) are associated with protein degradation while chains linked via lysine 63 (K63) are associated with intracellular signaling.Lys(48)-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys(63)-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repairRemarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP(3)R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP(3)R degradationActivated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are modified by homogeneous Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, but only Lys-48-linked chains are required for degradation.","answer":"no"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Adolescent alcohol binge drinking constitutes a major vulnerability factor to develop alcoholism. However, mechanisms underlying this susceptibility remain unknown. We evaluated the effect of adolescent binge-like ethanol intoxication on vulnerability to alcohol abuse in Sprague-Dawley rats. To model binge-like ethanol intoxication, every 2 days, rats received an ethanol injection (3.0   g/kg) for 2 consecutive days across 14 days either from postnatal day 30 (PND30) to 43 (early adolescence) or from PND 45 to PND 58 (late adolescence). In young adult animals, we measured free ethanol consumption in the two-bottle choice paradigm, motivation for ethanol in the operant self-administration task and both ethanol 's rewarding and aversive properties in the conditioned place preference (CPP) and taste aversion (CTA) paradigms. While intermittent ethanol intoxications (IEI) during late adolescence had no effect on free-choice 10% ethanol consumption, we found that IEI during early adolescence promoted free-choice 10% ethanol consumption, enhanced motivation for ethanol in the self-administration paradigm and induced a loss of both ethanol-induced CPP and CTA in young adults. No modification in either sucrose self-administration or amphetamine-induced CPP was observed. As the nucleus accumbens (Nac) is particularly involved in addictive behavior, we analyzed IEI-induced long-term neuroadaptations in the Nac using c-Fos immunohistochemistry and an array of neurotransmission-related genes.

Most countries are gradually exiting their lockdown state. We are currently lacking rapid and simple viral detections, especially methods that can be performed in the household. Here, we applied RT-LAMP directly on human clinical swabs and self-collected saliva samples. We adjusted the method to allow simple and rapid viral detection, with no RNA purification steps. By testing our method on over 180 human samples, we determined its sensitivity, and by applying it to other viruses, we determined its specificity.

Full-length uPAR is released from the cell surface, but the mechanism and significance of uPAR shedding remain obscure. Here we identify transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase GDE3 as a GPI-specific phospholipase C that cleaves and releases uPAR with consequent loss of function, whereas its homologue GDE2 fails to attack uPAR. GDE3 overexpression depletes uPAR from distinct basolateral membrane domains in breast cancer cells, resulting in a less transformed phenotype, it slows tumor growth in a xenograft model and correlates with prolonged survival in patients. Our results establish GDE3 as a negative regulator of the uPAR signaling network and, furthermore, highlight GPI-anchor hydrolysis as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to alter cell behavior.Introduction:The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor( uPAR) is a central player in a complex signaling network implicated in a variety of remodeling processes, both physiological and pathological, ranging from embryo implantation to wound healing and tumor progression( Boonstra et al., 2011; Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013; Smith and Marshall, 2010). uPAR is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol( GPI)-anchored protein and hence lacks intrinsic signaling capacity. Instead, uPAR acts by binding two major ligands, namely the protease urokinase plasminogen activator( uPA) and the extracellular matrix( ECM) protein vitronectin( Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013; Madsen et al., 2007; Smith and Marshall, 2010). Through uPA binding, uPAR localizes plasmin generation to the cell surface and thereby promotes pericellular proteolysis and ECM degradation( Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013; Smith and Marshall, 2010). In addition, through vitronectin binding and functional interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors, uPAR activates intracellular signaling pathways leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, enhanced cell adhesion and motility and other features of tissue remodeling and cell transformation( Ferraris et al., 2014; Madsen et al., 2007; Smith and Marshall, 2010). As such, uPAR is a master regulator of extracellular proteolysis, cell motility and invasion. uPAR expression is elevated during inflammation and in many human cancers, where it often correlates with poor prognosis, supporting the view that tumor cells hijack the uPAR signaling system to enhance malignancy( Boonstra et al., 2011; Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013; Smith and Marshall, 2010). Increased uPAR expression in solid tumors and the corresponding activated stroma is being evaluated by PET-imaging for patient stratification( Persson et al., 2015). It has long been known that full-length uPAR is released from the plasma membrane resulting in a soluble form( suPAR)( Pedersen et al., 1993; Ploug et al., 1992), which is detectable in body fluids and considered a marker of disease severity in cancer and other life-threatening disorders( Haupt et al., 2012; Hayek et al., 2016; Shariat et al., 2007; Sidenius et al., 2000; Stephens et al., 1999). Circulating suPAR is derived from activated immune and inflammatory cells( Ferraris and Sidenius, 2013; Smith and Marshall, 2010), and also from circulating tumor cells( Mustjoki et al., 2000). Locally produced suPAR might function as a ligand scavenger to confer negative feedback on uPAR( Smith and Marshall, 2010). In addition, both uPAR and suPAR can undergo proteolytic fragmentation by uPA and other proteases, possibly leading to new signaling activities( Montuori and Ragno, 2009). Yet, despite decades of research, the mechanism of uPAR release and its physiological implications have been elusive. A GPI-specific phospholipase D( GPI-PLD)( Scallon et al., 1991) has often been assumed to mediate the shedding of GPI-anchored proteins, but this unique PLD does not function on native membranes( Mann et al., 2004). A possible clue to the mechanism of uPAR release comes from recent studies showing that a member of the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase( GDPD/GDE) family( Corda et al., 2014), termed GDE2, promotes neuronal differentiation by cleaving select GPI-anchored proteins, notably a Notch ligand regulator and heparan sulfate proteoglycans( glypicans)( Matas-Rico et al., 2016; Matas-Rico et al., 2017; Park et al., 2013). GDE2, along with GDE3 and GDE6, belongs to a GDE subfamily characterized by six-transmembrane-domain proteins with a conserved catalytic ectodomain( Figure 1A)( Corda et al., 2009; Matas-Rico et al., 2016). GDE2’s close relative, GDE3, accelerates osteoblast differentiation through an unidentified mechanism( Corda et al., 2009; Yanaka et al., 2003), while the function of GDE6 is unknown. Here we identify GDE3 as the first mammalian GPI-specific phospholipase C( GPI-PLC) that cleaves and sheds uPAR with consequent loss of uPAR activities in both HEK293 and breast cancer cells.Discussion:GPI-anchoring is a compIex post-translational modification that anchors select proteins in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Despite decades of research, the biological significance of GPI anchors has long remained a mystery( Kinoshita and Fujita, 2016; Paulick and Bertozzi, 2008). Some GPI-anchored proteins are released from their anchor and detected in body fluids, implying involvement of one or more endogenous GPI-specific hydrolases. Recent studies have advanced the field by showing that cleavage and shedding of certain GPI-anchored proteins is mediated by a cell-intrinsic transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase, termed GDE2( or GDPD5), thereby promoting neuronal differentiation through multiple signaling pathways( Matas-Rico et al., 2016; Matas-Rico et al., 2017; Park et al., 2013). In this study, we focused on the shedding of GPI-anchored uPAR because of its regulatory role in multiple cellular and( patho) physiological activities, while soluble uPAR is considered a biomarker of various human pathologies. Here we report that GDE3 functions as a long-sought GPI-specific PLC that releases uPAR from its anchor. By contrast, its homologue GDE2 failed to release uPAR. As a consequence of GDE3 action, uPAR loses its vitronectin-dependent and matrix-degrading activities, when assayed in HEK293-uPAR and triple-negative breast cancer cells that express both uPAR and uPA. Importantly, loss of uPAR expression by GDE3 was found to be restricted to certain microdomains at the basolateral plasma membrane, where signal transduction is likely to take place. Thus, by acting as a GPI-specific PLC towards uPAR, GDE3 is a negative regulator of the uPAR signaling network( Figure 7C) that includes uPAR’s proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities. Consistent with this, GDE3 overexpression in uPA/uPAR-positive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells slowed tumor progression in a xenograft mouse model. Although statistically significant, the inhibitory effect of GDE3 overexpression on tumor growth was not dramatic, which should not come as a surprise since MDA-MBA-31 cells express the strongly oncogenic mutant K-RAS protein, which tends to override the regulation of numerous signaling pathways. Yet, this finding adds to the relevance of GPI-specific phospholipases in slowing tumor progression. Furthermore, high GDE3 expression was found to correlate with increased survival probability in triple-negative breast cancer patients. Interestingly, our previous work revealed a similar association between overexpression of GDE2 and positive clinical outcome in neuroblastoma patients, which appears attributable to GDE2-induced glypican shedding( Matas-Rico et al., 2016). The present patient survival analysis should be interpreted with caution, however, since involvement of uPAR release remains to be formally proven. Furthermore, we cannot rule out that GDE3 may cleave additional GPI-anchored substrates whose functional loss could contribute to positive clinical outcome. The present results predict that, depending on its expression levels, GDE3 may downregulate normal uPAR-dependent remodeling processes. Indeed, upregulated GDE3 accelerates osteoblast differentiation( Corda et al., 2009; Yanaka et al., 2003) in a manner resembling the uPAR knockout phenotype( Furlan et al., 2007). Furthermore, a striking >200 fold upregulation of GDE3/GDPD2 is observed during blastocyst formation( Munch et al., 2016), implicating GDE3 in the invasion of pre-implantation embryos, a process in which the uPA/uPAR signaling network has been implicated( Multhaupt et al., 1994; Pierleoni et al., 1998). Although correlative, these results support the view that GDE3 is upregulated to downregulate uPAR activity in vivo. The present findings also suggest that circulating full-length suPAR should be regarded as a marker of GDE3 activity, not necessarily reflecting uPAR expression levels. It will now be important to determine how GDE3 expression and activity are regulated and, furthermore, to explore the substrate selectivity of the respective GDEs in further detail. Homology modeling revealed striking differences in electrostatic surface properties of GDE2 versus GDE3, suggesting that protein-protein interactions may determine substrate recognition by these GDE family members. Specific GPI-anchor modifications( Kinoshita and Fujita, 2016; Paulick and Bertozzi, 2008) could also determine the sensitivity of GPI-anchored proteins to GDE attack. Finally, when regarded in a broader context, the present and previous findings( Matas-Rico et al., 2016; Matas-Rico et al., 2017; Park et al., 2013) support the view that vertebrate GDEs, notably GDE2 and GDE3, have evolved to modulate key signaling pathways and alter cell behavior through selective GPI-anchor cleavage.","answer":"Every process in the body , from how cells divide to how they move around , is tightly regulated .

Contrary to our expectation, we found that GC receptor (GR) expression in immune cells was dispensable for successful therapy of allergic airway inflammation (AAI) with dexamethasone. Instead, GC treatment was compromised in mice expressing a defective GR in the nonhematopoietic compartment or selectively lacking the GR in airway epithelial cells. Further, we found that an intact GR dimerization interface was a prerequisite for the suppression of AAI and airway hyperresponsiveness by GCs. Our observation that the ability of dexamethasone to modulate gene expression in airway epithelial cells coincided with its potency to resolve AAI supports a crucial role for transcriptional regulation by the GR in this cell type.In reporter assays, dexamethasone and Palovarotene induced transcriptional activity of their respective GRE or RARE constructs and did not interfere with each other's pathway.In sum, corticosteroids and Palovarotene appear to block HO via common and distinct mechanisms.

In a multisite, observational, longitudinal study of ILI among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults, 12% of subjects were PCR‐positive for HCoV. The distribution of species was as follows: HCoV‐OC43 (34%), HCoV‐229E (28%), HCoV‐NL63 (22%), and HCoV‐HKU1 (16%). We did not observe species‐specific differences in the clinical characteristics of HCoV infection, with the exception of HCoV‐HKU1, for which the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms trended higher on the fourth day of illness. Text: Clinical manifestations of human coronavirus (HCoV) infection range from a mild, self-limiting illness of the upper respiratory tract to an acute respiratory distress syndrome with a high mortality rate. Highly virulent species of HCoV were responsible for outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); case-fatality rates ranged from 14% to 45%. [1] [2] [3] By contrast, other HCoV species (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43 , HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E) are much more prevalent, much less severe, and common causes of influenza-like illness (ILI). [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Five previous studies have described the species-specific clinical characteristics of HCoV infection among adults. 6, 7, [10] [11] [12] In two of these studies, a significant proportion of the study population had underlying medical conditions. 6, 7 Herein, we describe, among a cohort of otherwise healthy adolescents and adults with influenza-like illness (ILI), the species-specific prevalence and severity of symptoms associated with HCoV infection. 13 Patients 0-65 years of age and presenting for care <72 hours after onset of ILI symptoms were recruited for study participation. ILI was defined as a temperature ≥100.4°F and sore throat or one of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Both inpatient and outpatient subjects were eligible to participate. Patients with underlying medical conditions (eg, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma), women with a high-risk or complicated pregnancy, and patients with a poorly controlled psychiatric disorder were excluded. Information on patient demographics and presence/severity of symptoms at the time of enrollment was collected by in-person interview. Participants were then instructed on the use of a daily diary to record the presence/severity of symptoms for 7 days following initial symptom onset. Symptom severity was rated on an ordinal scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Symptom severity scores were quantified using the following five measures: (i) individual symptom score for 20 symptoms, (ii) the upper respiratory symptom score, calculated as the sum of severity scores for earache, runny nose, sore throat, and sneezing, (iii) the lower respiratory symptom score, calculated as the sum of severity scores for cough, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, and chest discomfort, (iv) the gastrointestinal symptom score, calculated as the sum of severity scores for diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, nausea, and (Table 1) . There was season-to-season variability in the leading causes of The findings of our study, conducted over a 5-year period at five geographically dispersed sites in the USA, demonstrate that human coronavirus (HCoV) is an important cause of influenza-like illness (ILI) ranged from 4% to 22%. [8] [9] [10] [11] 14 Additionally, we found  to be the most common species among adults, as has been reported elsewhere. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14   and HCoV-229E were the most common strains in alternate seasons, reflecting a season-to-season variability of HCoV strain circulation that has been reported in other multiyear studies. 4 8 The mechanisms by which this particular species elicits these symptoms are not known. The strengths of this study of HCoV in otherwise healthy adolescents and adults include its multisite and multiyear design, the use of a multiplex diagnostic panel, the prospective collection of symptom data, and the use of a symptom severity scale similar to what has been employed previously. 15 One important limitation of this study was our selective recruitment of individuals who had presented to a healthcare facility for care of an ILI. Therefore, our cases are not representative of HCoV infection in the community, where individuals with mild, self-limiting illness due to HCoV opt not to seek medical care for the management of their ILI. In summary, we have shown that HCoV is a significant cause of ILI among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults presenting for medical evaluation. Although there were differences in species distribution by age group, we did not detect any differences between species with respect to the clinical spectrum of disease.Question: What is the most common species of Human Coronavirus among adults?","answer":"HCoV-OC43"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Maintenance of high- quality seafood is important to ensure the production of a marketable product. This study assessed how sequential stressors affect the sensory and quality characteristics of catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) fillets. Three stress trials were conducted where temperature (25 or 33 °C) and dissolved oxygen (DO, approximately 2.5 or >5 mg/L) were manipulated followed by socking and transport stress. After each stage of harvest (environmental stress, socking, and transport), fillet yield, consumer acceptability, descriptive evaluation, cook loss, tenderness, and pH were evaluated. Fillet yield decreased with increasing severity of environmental stress. Fillets from the severe stress treatment (33 °C, approximately 2.5 mg/L) received the highest acceptability scores (P < 0.05). Control fillets (25 °C, >5 mg/L) were the least acceptable (P < 0.05). Increased intensity of less favorable flavor attributes commonly associated with catfish resulted in the differences in acceptability among treatments. As fish progressed through the harvest event, cook loss decreased, tenderness increased, and pH increased, indicating that stress induced textural changes. The data suggest that although environmental stress results in slight changes in flavor attributes, its effects on acceptability are minor with fillets from all treatments still liked (>6 on a 9 point scale). Socking and transport were identified to positively affect textural characteristics of catfish fillets. Although the effects observed were not likely to negatively impact consumer acceptance, a strict management plan should be followed to maintain consistency in the product and avoid changes in stressors that might alter quality more drastically.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"physiological homeostasis\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"dissolved oxygen\\", \\"DO\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"Ictalurus Punctatus\\", \\"Cultured Channel Catfish\\", \\"Ictalurus punctatus\\", \\"catfish\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"least acceptable\\", \\"negatively\\", \\"Stress\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"seafood\\", \\"fillets\\", \\"Fillets\\", \\"fillet\\", \\"Fillet\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"stress treatment\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [\\"fish culture\\"], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"consumer\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of different doses of pioglitazone alone and in combination with sulfasalazine in TNBS (trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid)-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in rats.  methods A total of 36 animals were included in the study. Animals were divided into five groups (n = 6): group I--vehicle (ethanol), group II--TNBS + ethanol, group IIIA--TNBS + pioglitazone (15 mg/kg), group IIIB--TNBS + pioglitazone (30 mg/kg), group IV--TNBS + sulfasalazine (360 mg/kg), group V--TNBS + sulfasalazine (360 mg/kg) + pioglitazone (least effective dose found in group III). Group III was divided into two subgroups, namely IIIA and IIIB, on the basis of different doses of pioglitazone used. After completion of two weeks of treatment, rats were sacrificed under ether anesthesia by cervical dislocation for assessment of intestinal inflammation, histological analysis, myeloperoxidase assay, malondialdehyde assay and TNF-α estimation.  results All the drug-treated groups showed both gross morphological and microscopic score either 1 or 2. None of them showed score of > 2 on both gross and microscopic morphological examination. Both MDA levels and MPO activity were significantly reduced in the drug-treated groups, with maximum reduction seen in the combination group. TNF-α was reduced in pioglitazone group. It was highly reduced in sulfasalazine group (group V) as compared to TNBS group thereby indicating that pioglitazone is protective in TNBS-induced inflammatory bowel disease.  conclusion The present study showed reduction in lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde levels and TNF-α levels in pioglitazone-treated group and hence, there was significant improvement in gross and microscopic features, too.

This paper presents a robust stereo vision system embedded in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The perspective view of the target image is first transformed into the reference view, and this not only improves the disparity accuracy, but also reduces the algorithm's computational complexity. The cost volumes generated from stereo matching are then filtered using a bilateral filter. The latter has been proved to be a feasible solution for the functional minimisation problem in a fully connected Markov random field model. Finally, the disparity maps are transformed by minimising an energy function with respect to the roll angle and disparity projection model. This makes the damaged road areas more distinguishable from the road surface. The proposed system is implemented on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU with CUDA for real-time purposes. It is demonstrated through experiments that the damaged road areas can be easily distinguished from the transformed disparity maps.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: [3]: [4]: [5]: A significant amount of research in the field of stereo vision has been published in the past decade. Considerable progress has been made in improving accuracy of results as well as achieving real-time performance in obtaining those results. This work provides a comprehensive review of stereo vision algorithms with specific emphasis on real-time performance to identify those suitable for resource-limited systems. An attempt has been made to compile and present accuracy and runtime performance data for all stereo vision algorithms developed in the past decade. Algorithms are grouped into three categories: (1) those that have published results of real-time or near real-time performance on standard processors, (2) those that have real-time performance on specialized hardware (i.e. GPU, FPGA, DSP, ASIC), and (3) those that have not been shown to obtain near real-time performance. This review is intended to aid those seeking algorithms suitable for real-time implementation on resource-limited systems, and to encourage further research and development of the same by providing a snapshot of the status quo.[6]: Various 3D reconstruction methods have enabled civil engineers to detect damage on a road surface. To achieve the millimeter accuracy required for road condition assessment, a disparity map with subpixel resolution needs to be used. However, none of the existing stereo matching algorithms are specially suitable for the reconstruction of the road surface. Hence in this paper, we propose a novel dense subpixel disparity estimation algorithm with high computational efficiency and robustness. This is achieved by first transforming the perspective view of the target frame into the reference view, which not only increases the accuracy of the block matching for the road surface but also improves the processing speed. The disparities are then estimated iteratively using our previously published algorithm, where the search range is propagated from three estimated neighboring disparities. Since the search range is obtained from the previous iteration, errors may occur when the propagated search range is not sufficient. Therefore, a correlation maxima verification is performed to rectify this issue, and the subpixel resolution is achieved by conducting a parabola interpolation enhancement. Furthermore, a novel disparity global refinement approach developed from the Markov random fields and fast bilateral stereo is introduced to further improve the accuracy of the estimated disparity map, where disparities are updated iteratively by minimizing the energy function that is related to their interpolated correlation polynomials. The algorithm is implemented in C language with a near real-time performance. The experimental results illustrate that the absolute error of the reconstruction varies from 0.1 to 3 mm.[7]: [8]: Recent work has shown that depth estimation from a stereo pair of images can be formulated as a supervised learning task to be resolved with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, current architectures rely on patch-based Siamese networks, lacking the means to exploit context information for finding correspondence in illposed regions. To tackle this problem, we propose PSMNet, a pyramid stereo matching network consisting of two main modules: spatial pyramid pooling and 3D CNN. The spatial pyramid pooling module takes advantage of the capacity of global context information by aggregating context in different scales and locations to form a cost volume. The 3D CNN learns to regularize cost volume using stacked multiple hourglass networks in conjunction with intermediate supervision. The proposed approach was evaluated on several benchmark datasets. Our method ranked first in the KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards before March 18, 2018. The codes of PSMNet are available at: this https URL[9]: [10]: [11]: Convolutional neural networks showed the ability in stereo matching cost learning. Recent approaches learned parameters from public datasets that have ground truth disparity maps. Due to the difficulty of labeling ground truth depth, usable data for system training is rather limited, making it difficult to apply the system to real applications. In this paper, we present a framework for learning stereo matching costs without human supervision. Our method updates network parameters in an iterative manner. It starts with a randomly initialized network. Left-right check is adopted to guide the training. Suitable matching is then picked and used as training data in following iterations. Our system finally converges to a stable state and performs even comparably with other supervised methods.[12]: [13]: In the past year, convolutional neural networks have been shown to perform extremely well for stereo estimation. However, current architectures rely on siamese networks which exploit concatenation followed by further processing layers, requiring a minute of GPU computation per image pair. In contrast, in this paper we propose a matching network which is able to produce very accurate results in less than a second of GPU computation. Towards this goal, we exploit a product layer which simply computes the inner product between the two representations of a siamese architecture. We train our network by treating the problem as multi-class classification, where the classes are all possible disparities. This allows us to get calibrated scores, which result in much better matching performance when compared to existing approaches.[14]:","answer":"The two key aspects of computer stereo vision are speed and accuracy [5] . A lot of research has been carried out over the past decades to improve either the disparity accuracy or the algorithm's computational complexity [6] . The state-of-the-art stereo vision algorithms can be classified as convolutional neural network (CNN)-based [6]2 [1] [4] [6]1 [6]7 and traditional [6] [2] [9] [3] [10] [6]5 . The former generally formulates disparity estimation as a binary classification problem and learns the probability distribution over all disparity values [6]2 . For example, PSMNet [8] generates the cost volumes by learning region-level features with different scales of receptive fields. Although these approaches have achieved some highly accurate disparity maps, they usually require a large amount of labelled training data to learn from. Therefore, it is impossible for them to work on the datasets without providing the disparity ground truth [11] . Moreover, predicting disparities with CNNs is still a computationally intensive task, which usually takes seconds or even minutes to execute on state-of-the-art graphics cards [5] . Therefore, the existing CNN-based stereo vision algorithms are not suitable for real-time applications."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Given a predicted patchwork of individual biochemical steps, some metric must be applied in deciding what pathways actually exist in the genome or metagenome represented by the sequences. Commonly, and straightforwardly, a complete biological pathway can be identified in a dataset if at least one of the steps associated with the pathway is found. We report, however, that this naïve mapping approach leads to an inflated estimate of biological pathways, and thus overestimates the functional diversity of the sample from which the DNA sequences are derived. We developed a parsimony approach, called MinPath( Minimal set of Pathways), for biological pathway reconstructions using protein family predictions, which yields a more conservative, yet more faithful, estimation of the biological pathways for a query dataset. MinPath identified far fewer pathways for the genomes collected in the KEGG database—as compared to the naïve mapping approach—eliminating some obviously spurious pathway annotations. Results from applying MinPath to several metagenomes indicate that the common methods used for metagenome annotation may significantly overestimate the biological pathways encoded by microbial communities.Introduction:Microbial whole genome sequencing has become a routine practice in recent years, because of the rapid advances of DNA sequencing technologies[1]. One of the first analyses that biologists attempt, once they obtain a complete genome sequence, is to reconstruct the biological pathways encoded by the organism, which is usually accomplished in silico by mapping the protein coding genes onto reference pathway collections, such as KEGG[2] or SEED[3], based on their homology to reference genes with previously characterized functions. For example, KAAS, the pathway annotation system based on the KEGG database[4], first annotates K numbers( each K number represents an ortholog group of genes, and is directly linked to an object( a biochemical step) in the KEGG pathway map), and then reconstructs pathways based on the assigned K numbers. Similarly, the RAST server( and MG-RAST) first annotates FIG families and then maps the identified FIG families onto the SEED subsystems[5],[6]. These automatic methods are promising for the analysis of most genomes, although they may leave “holes” in the reconstructed pathways, due to either missing genes( i. e. the genes are non-homologous to reference genes of the same specific functions, and thus cannot be identified by a homology-based method, or were simply not annotated as ORFs by annotation pipelines)[7], or alternative and novel pathways( i. e. the target organism adopts variant pathways, which are different from the reference pathway, to accommodate a specific niche or lifestyle)[8]. After all, many bacterial genomes have fewer than 60% of their genes assigned to a proposed function[9],[10]. We note that pathway reconstruction is essential for understanding the biological functions that a newly sequenced genome encodes. For instance, in a recently published report, the coupling of N2 fixation to cellulolysis was revealed within protist cells in the termite gut, based solely on the in silico pathway reconstruction of the complete genome sequence of a bacterial endosymbiont[11]. Moreover, pathway reconstruction based on some new high throughput techniques must provide conclusions from explicitly incomplete information, which poses fresh challenges. For example, in a typical proteomics experiment, the proteins represent a particular biological sample collected under a specific physiological condition or from a specific tissue( e. g. from yeast cells after the heat shock), which are in high enough abundance to be identified by tandem mass spectrometry[12],[13]. Based on these data, one may ask, what biological pathways were activated( or suppressed) under the physiological condition? A similar, but more complicated case is pathway analysis of metagenomic data, to characterize the aggregate metabolic processes of microbial communities in a given environment[14]. Metagenomic profiling data can be viewed as a sampling of the genomic sequences from many kinds of microbes living in a specific environment. Again, the incompleteness of the data makes it difficult to reconstruct the entire pathways encoded by a metagenome. Nevertheless, it is becoming routine to “reconstruct” pathways for proteomic[15] and metagenomic data[16],[17], by best similarity matches( often derived from BLAST searches): a pathway is inferred to be absent or present in a dataset if highly confident homolog protein hits identify one or more of the protein functions associated with the pathway in other organisms. In addition to the problems that arise from incomplete data, existing methods of pathway reconstruction or inference may over-estimate the number of pathways because of redundancy in the protein-pathway, at four levels. First, different pathways may share the same biological functions. The partition of pathways( as the entire cellular network is partitioned into several hundreds of biological pathway entities in KEGG database) is extremely important for understanding of biological processes, even though there is only a single large biological network within any cell and all pathways are to some extent connected[18]. It is not surprising that many pathways defined in the pathway databases are overlapping. Second, some proteins carry out multiple biological functions[19], e. g. through different protein domains, active sites, or substrate specificities. Third, neither organisms nor communities are closed boxes, and the products or intermediates of pathways may be exogenously supplied. Finally, homology-based protein searching may map one protein to multiple homologous proteins with different biological functions( i. e. paralogous proteins). In summary, it cannot be safely concluded that a pathway is present, even if one or more proteins are mapped to it. Even for single complete genomes, pathway reconstruction does not always give a clear picture of the biological functions in an organism, and human curation and experimental verification is often needed[20],[21]. We illustrate this by a rather extreme example found in the pathway analysis of the human genome. The KEGG pathway annotation of the human genome includes the reductive carboxylate cycle, with proteins annotated to 6 steps in this pathway( http://www. genome. jp/kegg-bin/show_organism? menu_type=pathway_maps&org=hsa)( as of July 2nd, 2009). The Calvin cycle is the most common method of carbon fixation, while the reductive carboxylate cycle is an alternative carbon fixation pathway, currently found only in certain autotrophic microorganisms. In fact, the reductive carboxylate cycle is essentially the reverse of the Krebs cycle( citric acid or tricarboxylic acid cycle), the final common pathway in aerobic metabolism for the oxidation of carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids, so they share reactions and functional roles. For this reason, the proteins responsible for the normal function of the Krebs cycle can be mistakenly taken as evidence for the existence of a reductive carboxylate cycle in the human genome. Here we propose a pathway reconstruction/inference method in which we do not attempt to reconstruct entire pathways from a given set of protein sequences( e. g. identified in a proteomics experiment, or encoded by the sequences sampled in a metagenomic project), but to determine the minimal set of biological pathways that must exist in the biological system to explain the input protein sequences sampled from it. In this context, we note pathway inference might be a more suitable terminology than pathway reconstruction. However, considering that pathway inference has been used in a different context to infer networks or pathways from gene express data[22], and pathway reconstruction is commonly used in the field, we use both pathway inference and pathway reconstruction in this paper. To address the issues of both incomplete data, and pathway redundancy, we formulate a parsimony version of the pathway reconstruction/inference problem, called MinPath( Minimal set of Pathways), which can be roughly described as the following: given a set of reference pathways and a set of proteins( and their predicted functions) that can be mapped to one or more pathways, we attempt to find the minimum number of pathways that can explain all proteins( functions)( see Fig. 1). Although this problem is NP-hard in general, we provide an integer programming( IP) framework to solve it. We focus on analyzing complete genomes in this study because there is a relatively good understanding of the pathways that actually exist in organisms with completely sequenced genomes( as compared to the emerging metagenomes), making this analysis a good test of our method. Besides, the pathway annotations of these genomes are still far from perfection, as in the example of a carbon fixation pathway in the human genome( as well as chickens, mosquitoes, etc). We also applied MinPath to the analyses of several metagenomic datasets, to demonstrate the potential applications of MinPath in metagenome annotation.Discussion:We have developed the MinPath approach to provide more conservative—but more reliable—estimations of biological pathways from a sequence dataset, and applied this approach to revisit the biological pathway reconstruction problem for genomes as well as metagenomes. Our results show that without further post-processing of the reconstructed pathways, the naïve mapping strategy may overestimate the biological pathways that are encoded by a genome or metagenome, which could jeopardize any conclusions drawn from the constructed biological pathways( such as the metabolic diversity/capacity of an environmental microbial or viral community, as measured by the Shannon Index)[16],[17], or other downstream analysis based on constructed pathways[23]. It was noted in[16] that most of the microbial communities in that study were approaching saturation for known pathways: more conservative estimates of pathways for each environment may allow real functional differences between the samples to be detected. Note that MinPath is not designed to directly improve the still imperfect definition of pathways and/or functions in databases such as KEGG or SEED. For example, as a result of how some pathways are grouped in the KEGG database, peptidoglycan biosynthesis is listed for the human genome by KEGG annotation and MinPath does not eliminate this pathway from the list of annotated pathways from human genome. In this sense, efforts are still needed to improve the elucidation and annotation of extent biochemical pathways. But given a database of reference pathways, we feel that MinPath provides a sensible method for inferring the pathways represented in biological sequence samples.","answer":"Even though there is only a single large biological network within any cell and all pathways are to some extent connected , the partition of the entire cellular network into smaller units ( e . g . , KEGG pathways ) is extremely important for understanding biological processes .

VRPs derived from VEE virus have been developed as candidate vaccines for cytomegalovirus (CMV). A phase I clinical trial with the CMV VRP showed the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and potent T cell responses. Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and considered safe [75] . A separate clinical trial assessed efficacy of repeated immunization with a VRP expressing a tumor antigen. The vaccine was safe and despite high vector-specific immunity after initial immunization, continued to boost transgene-specific immune responses upon boost [76] . While additional clinical data is needed, these reports suggest alphavirus replicon systems or VRPs may be safe and efficacious, even in the face of preexisting immunity. Baculovirus has been extensively used to produce recombinant proteins. Recently, a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use and was first available for use in the United States for the 2013-2014 influenza season [4] . Baculoviruses have also been explored as vaccine vectors. Baculoviruses have a number of advantages as vaccine vectors. The viruses have been extensively studied for protein expression and for pesticide use and so are readily manipulated. The vectors can accommodate large gene insertions, show limited cytopathic effect in mammalian cells, and have been shown to infect and express genes of interest in a spectrum of mammalian cells [77] . While the insect promoters are not effective for mammalian gene expression, appropriate promoters can be cloned into the baculovirus vaccine vectors. Baculovirus vectors have been tested as influenza vaccines, with the first reported vaccine using Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) expressing the HA of PR8 under control of the CAG promoter (AcCAG-HA) [77] . Intramuscular, intranasal, intradermal, and intraperitoneal immunization or mice with AcCAG-HA elicited HA-specific antibody responses, however only intranasal immunization provided protection from lethal challenge. Interestingly, intranasal immunization with the wild type AcNPV also resulted in protection from PR8 challenge. The robust innate immune response to the baculovirus provided non-specific protection from subsequent influenza virus infection [78] . While these studies did not demonstrate specific protection, there were antigen-specific immune responses and potential adjuvant effects by the innate response. Baculovirus pseudotype viruses have also been explored. The G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus controlled by the insect polyhedron promoter and the HA of A/Chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1) HPAIV controlled by a CMV promoter were used to generate the BV-G-HA. Intramuscular immunization of mice or chickens with BV-G-HA elicited strong HI and VN serum antibody responses, IFN-γ responses, and protected from H5N1 challenge [79] . A separate study demonstrated efficacy using a bivalent pseudotyped baculovirus vector [80] . Baculovirus has also been used to generate an inactivated particle vaccine. The HA of A/Indonesia/CDC669/2006(H5N1) was incorporated into a commercial baculovirus vector controlled by the e1 promoter from White Spot Syndrome Virus. The resulting recombinant virus was propagated in insect (Sf9) cells and inactivated as a particle vaccine [81, 82] . Intranasal delivery with cholera toxin B as an adjuvant elicited robust HI titers and protected from lethal challenge [81] . Oral delivery of this encapsulated vaccine induced robust serum HI titers and mucosal IgA titers in mice, and protected from H5N1 HPAIV challenge. More recently, co-formulations of inactivated baculovirus vectors have also been shown to be effective in mice [83] . While there is growing data on the potential use of baculovirus or pseudotyped baculovirus as a vaccine vector, efficacy data in mammalian animal models other than mice is lacking. There is also no data on the safety in humans, reducing enthusiasm for baculovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza at this time. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes disease in poultry. NDV has a number of appealing qualities as a vaccine vector. As an avian virus, there is little or no preexisting immunity to NDV in humans and NDV propagates to high titers in both chicken eggs and cell culture. As a paramyxovirus, there is no DNA phase in the virus lifecycle reducing concerns of integration events, and the levels of gene expression are driven by the proximity to the leader sequence at the 3' end of the viral genome. This gradient of gene expression enables attenuation through rearrangement of the genome, or by insertion of transgenes within the genome. Finally, pathogenicity of NDV is largely determined by features of the fusion protein enabling ready attenuation of the vaccine vector [84] . Reverse genetics, a method that allows NDV to be rescued from plasmids expressing the viral RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid proteins, was first reported in 1999 [85, 86] . This process has enabled manipulation of the NDV genome as well as incorporation of transgenes and the development of NDV vectors. Influenza was the first infectious disease targeted with a recombinant NDV (rNDV) vector. The HA protein of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) was inserted into the Hitchner B1 vaccine strain. The HA protein was expressed on infected cells and was incorporated into infectious virions. While the virus was attenuated compared to the parental vaccine strain, it induced a robust serum antibody response and protected against homologous influenza virus challenge in a murine model of infection [87] . Subsequently, rNDV was tested as a vaccine vector for HPAIV having varying efficacy against H5 and H7 influenza virus infections in poultry [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . These vaccines have the added benefit of potentially providing protection against both the influenza virus and NDV infection. NDV has also been explored as a vaccine vector for humans. Two NHP studies assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of an rNDV expressing the HA or NA of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; VN1203) [95, 96] . Intranasal and intratracheal delivery of the rNDV-HA or rNDV-NA vaccines induced both serum and mucosal antibody responses and protected from HPAIV challenge [95, 96] . NDV has limited clinical data; however, phase I and phase I/II clinical trials have shown that the NDV vector is well-tolerated, even at high doses delivered intravenously [44, 97] . While these results are promising, additional studies are needed to advance NDV as a human vaccine vector for influenza. Parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) is a paramyxovirus vaccine vector being explored for delivery of influenza and other infectious disease vaccine antigens. PIV5 has only recently been described as a vaccine vector [98] . Similar to other RNA viruses, PIV5 has a number of features that make it an attractive vaccine vector. For example, PIV5 has a stable RNA genome and no DNA phase in virus replication cycle reducing concerns of host genome integration or modification. PIV5 can be grown to very high titers in mammalian vaccine cell culture substrates and is not cytopathic allowing for extended culture and harvest of vaccine virus [98, 99] . Like NDV, PIV5 has a 3'-to 5' gradient of gene expression and insertion of transgenes at different locations in the genome can variably attenuate the virus and alter transgene expression [100] . PIV5 has broad tropism, infecting many cell types, tissues, and species without causing clinical disease, although PIV5 has been associated with -kennel cough‖ in dogs [99] . A reverse genetics system for PIV5 was first used to insert the HA gene from A/Udorn/307/72 (H3N2) into the PIV5 genome between the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene and the large (L) polymerase gene. Similar to NDV, the HA was expressed at high levels in infected cells and replicated similarly to the wild type virus, and importantly, was not pathogenic in immunodeficient mice [98] . Additionally, a single intranasal immunization in a murine model of influenza infection was shown to induce neutralizing antibody responses and protect against a virus expressing homologous HA protein [98] . PIV5 has also been explored as a vaccine against HPAIV. Recombinant PIV5 vaccines expressing the HA or NP from VN1203 were tested for efficacy in a murine challenge model. Mice intranasally vaccinated with a single dose of PIV5-H5 vaccine had robust serum and mucosal antibody responses, and were protected from lethal challenge. Notably, although cellular immune responses appeared to contribute to protection, serum antibody was sufficient for protection from challenge [100, 101] . Intramuscular immunization with PIV5-H5 was also shown to be effective at inducing neutralizing antibody responses and protecting against lethal influenza virus challenge [101] . PIV5 expressing the NP protein of HPAIV was also efficacious in the murine immunization and challenge model, where a single intranasal immunization induced robust CD8 + T cell responses and protected against homologous (H5N1) and heterosubtypic (H1N1) virus challenge [102] . Currently there is no clinical safety data for use of PIV5 in humans. However, live PIV5 has been a component of veterinary vaccines for -kennel cough‖ for >30 years, and veterinarians and dog owners are exposed to live PIV5 without reported disease [99] . This combined with preclinical data from a variety of animal models suggests that PIV5 as a vector is likely to be safe in humans. As preexisting immunity is a concern for all virus-vectored vaccines, it should be noted that there is no data on the levels of preexisting immunity to PIV5 in humans. However, a study evaluating the efficacy of a PIV5-H3 vaccine in canines previously vaccinated against PIV5 (kennel cough) showed induction of robust anti-H3 serum antibody responses as well as high serum antibody levels to the PIV5 vaccine, suggesting preexisting immunity to the PIV5 vector may not affect immunogenicity of vaccines even with repeated use [99] . Poxvirus vaccines have a long history and the notable hallmark of being responsible for eradication of smallpox. The termination of the smallpox virus vaccination program has resulted in a large population of poxvirus-naï ve individuals that provides the opportunity for the use of poxviruses as vectors without preexisting immunity concerns [103] . Poxvirus-vectored vaccines were first proposed for use in 1982 with two reports of recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding and expressing functional thymidine kinase gene from herpes virus [104, 105] . Within a year, a vaccinia virus encoding the HA of an H2N2 virus was shown to express a functional HA protein (cleaved in the HA1 and HA2 subunits) and be immunogenic in rabbits and hamsters [106] . Subsequently, all ten of the primary influenza proteins have been expressed in vaccine virus [107] . Early work with intact vaccinia virus vectors raised safety concerns, as there was substantial reactogenicity that hindered recombinant vaccine development [108] . Two vaccinia vectors were developed to address these safety concerns. The modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain was attenuated by passage 530 times in chick embryo fibroblasts cultures. The second, New York vaccinia virus (NYVAC) was a plaque-purified clone of the Copenhagen vaccine strain rationally attenuated by deletion of 18 open reading frames [109] [110] [111] . Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was developed prior to smallpox eradication to reduce or prevent adverse effects of other smallpox vaccines [109] . Serial tissue culture passage of MVA resulted in loss of 15% of the genome, and established a growth restriction for avian cells. The defects affected late stages in virus assembly in non-avian cells, a feature enabling use of the vector as single-round expression vector in non-permissive hosts. Interestingly, over two decades ago, recombinant MVA expressing the HA and NP of influenza virus was shown to be effective against lethal influenza virus challenge in a murine model [112] . Subsequently, MVA expressing various antigens from seasonal, pandemic (A/California/04/2009, pH1N1), equine (A/Equine/Kentucky/1/81 H3N8), and HPAI (VN1203) viruses have been shown to be efficacious in murine, ferret, NHP, and equine challenge models [113] . MVA vaccines are very effective stimulators of both cellular and humoral immunity. For example, abortive infection provides native expression of the influenza antigens enabling robust antibody responses to native surface viral antigens. Concurrently, the intracellular influenza peptides expressed by the pox vector enter the class I MHC antigen processing and presentation pathway enabling induction of CD8 + T cell antiviral responses. MVA also induces CD4 + T cell responses further contributing to the magnitude of the antigen-specific effector functions [107, [112] [113] [114] [115] . MVA is also a potent activator of early innate immune responses further enhancing adaptive immune responses [116] . Between early smallpox vaccine development and more recent vaccine vector development, MVA has undergone extensive safety testing and shown to be attenuated in severely immunocompromised animals and safe for use in children, adults, elderly, and immunocompromised persons.

The off-the-shelf deblurring or super-resolution methods may show visually pleasing results. However, applying each technique independently before matching is generally unprofitable because this naive series of procedures ignores the consistency between images. In this paper, we propose a pioneering unified framework that solves four problems simultaneously, namely, dense depth reconstruction, camera pose estimation, super-resolution, and deblurring. By reflecting a physical imaging process, we formulate a cost minimization problem and solve it using an alternating optimization technique. The experimental results on both synthetic and real videos show high-quality depth maps derived from severely degraded images that contrast the failures of naive multi-view stereo methods. Our proposed method also produces outstanding deblurred and super-resolved images unlike the independent application or combination of conventional video deblurring, super-resolution methods.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: An arbitrary rigid transformation in SE(3) can be separated into two parts, namely, a translation and a rigid rotation. This technical report reviews, under a unifying viewpoint, three common alternatives to representing the rotation part: sets of three (yaw-pitch-roll) Euler angles, orthogonal rotation matrices from SO(3) and quaternions. It will be described: (i) the equivalence between these representations and the formulas for transforming one to each other (in all cases considering the translational and rotational parts as a whole), (ii) how to compose poses with poses and poses with points in each representation and (iii) how the uncertainty of the poses (when modeled as Gaussian distributions) is affected by these transformations and compositions. Some brief notes are also given about the Jacobians required to implement least-squares optimization on manifolds, an very promising approach in recent engineering literature.

These ensuing materials have received significant attention amongst macromolecular scientists, especially for use in biocompatible and biodegradable devices.2-4,5</p><p>Interest in tuning properties of PLA has motivated the determination of its structure in atomic detail. These analyses have revealed the existence of conformational isomers, which arise from different preparation conditions.6-7 The α form of PLA has received the most attention, due to its high stability.</p><p>Fibre diffraction of α-PLA has proven challenging, and the ensuing structure has been revised several times since its first report.8-12 Recently, data from neutron diffraction and NMR spectroscopy have been used to complement X-ray diffraction data.13-14 Though refinement of the structural model continues, the overall topology appears to be consistent between studies (Fig. 2A).</p><p>We became interested in PLA due to its similarity to polyalanine. Indeed, PLA is the depsipeptide counterpart to polyalanine wherein each amide linkage is replaced by an ester. The amide-to-ester modification has proven useful for revealing the contribution of hydrogen bonds to the structure and stability of peptides and proteins because incorporation of the ester linkage deletes a backbone hydrogen-bond donor and reduces the strength of a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen.15-20</p><p>By examining the structure of a peptide-like polymer that is incapable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, we sought to isolate other interactions that bias the conformation of peptide chains. In particular, we wished to determine the role of the n→π* interaction in dictating the conformational geometry of PLA. In an n→π* interaction, the filled p-type lone pair (n) of a carbonyl oxygen overlaps with the empty π* antibonding orbital of a nearby carbonyl group (Fig. 1 and 2B). This overlap allows for orbital mixing and the subsequent release of energy. Such an interaction occurs when the donor oxygen contacts the acceptor carbonyl carbon within the sum of their van der Waals radii (rO + rC = 3.22 Å), and along the Bürgi–Dunitz trajectory for nucleophilic addition (∠O⋯C=O = ~109°).21 We have estimated that n→π* interactions between amides likely contribute 0.27 kcal/mol of stabilization energy per interaction,22 and we have shown that these interactions are present in protein structures, especially helices.23 The question remains, however, does the n→π* interaction bias a peptide toward a particular conformation, or is the interaction an artefact of a particular structural motif? By examining the structure of a polymer devoid of hydrogen bonds, we hoped to ascertain the relevance of the n→π* interaction to macromolecular conformation.</p><p>Upon inspection of the structure of α-PLA,12 we observed that its backbone torsion angles (Table 1) bear striking similarity to those of the polyproline II helix, which has backbone torsion angles of ϕ(C′i−1−Ni−Cαi−C′i)=−75° and ψ(Ni−Cαi−C′i−Ni+1)=150°, and the strands of a collagen triple helix.24 We showed previously that these torsion angles allow for effective n→π* interactions.23 Indeed, the average O⋯C distance in the α-PLA structure is 2.98 Å, which is 0.24 Å less than the sum of the van der Waals radii; moreover, the average ∠O⋯C=O is 94°, which is consistent with an n→π* interaction.23</p><p>To evaluate whether or not an n→π* interaction is operative in the structure of α-PLA, we conducted natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of its crystalline structure at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory.25-27 We observed an average n→π* energy of 0.44 kcal/mol per interaction. This value is consistent with a strong n→π* interaction between the carbonyl groups of adjacent backbone esters in α-PLA.</p><p>To establish further the presence of an n→π* interaction, we searched for a structural signature. As the n→π* interaction populates the π* orbital of the acceptor carbonyl, it induces a pyramidalization of the carbonyl group from planar sp2 geometry (Fig. 2C), which can be detected in high-resolution crystal structures.28-31,22 Unfortunately, the initial α-PLA structure-determination assumed planarity of the ester bond,12 thereby obscuring the most definitive signature of an n→π* interaction. Later structures do not provide enough resolution to determine pyramidalization accurately.13 Accordingly, we sought high-resolution structures of lactic-acid oligomers.</p><p>We analysed structures of di(l-lactic acid) and tri(l-lactic acid), which were obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database.32 To ensure that these short oligomers are appropriate models for the structure of α-PLA, we compared their backbone torsion angles to those observed in α-PLA and found gratifying agreement (Table 1). We also employed DFT calculations and NBO analysis to estimate the energy of the n→π* interaction in these molecules and found that the n→π* energies are consistent with those observed in the polymer. Confident that these structures are an accurate reflection of the structure of α-PLA, we then determined the distortion of the backbone esters from planarity, as measured by the angle Θ. In both structures, we observed substantial pyramidalization of the putative n→π* acceptor toward the putative donor. In the absence of an attractive interaction, one would expect distortion to occur in the opposite direction, so as to reduce unfavorable Pauli repulsion.33 Accordingly, the observed pyramidalization is strong evidence of an attractive n→π* interaction between the monomeric units in α-PLA.</p><p>These observations have broad implications. First, they imply a new means to modulate the structure of organic polymers. We found previously that the nucleophilicity of sulfur in thioamides can be exploited to increase the strength of an n→π* interaction28,22 and that surrogate alkenes and fluoroalkenes can be used to attenuate an n→π* interaction.33 These isosteres20 could be used to produce polymeric materials with tailored structural and thermal properties. Secondly, as the n→π* interaction is likely to reduce the electrophilicity of the acceptor carbonyl by contributing additional electron density,34-35 it could contribute to the observed hydrolytic stability of PLA. Thirdly, because n→π* interactions are extant in PLA even without the potential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, we conclude that the n→π* interaction can operate independently of the geometric constraints imposed by hydrogen-bonding patterns. Finally, the observation of polyproline-like structure in PLA is itself significant, given that this structural motif is prevalent in the unfolded state of proteins.36-40 During their folding, polypeptide chains are likely to sample highly local interactions sooner than less local ones. Operating between adjacent residues (that is, i→i+1), the n→π* interaction is considerably more local than common hydrogen-bonding patterns such as that in the α-helix (i→i+4). Thus, the presence of n→π* interactions in the structure of PLA suggests that—before hydrogen bonds can form—the conformation of polypeptide chains can be guided by n→π* interactions.41</p>","answer":"Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a versatile synthetic polyester. We noted that this depsipeptide analog of polyalanine has a helical structure that resembles a polyproline II helix. Using natural bond orbital analysis, we find that nxe2x86x92xcfx80* interactions between sequential ester carbonyl groups contribute 0.44 kcal/mol per monomer to the conformational stability of PLA helices. We conclude that analogous nxe2x86x92xcfx80* interactions could direct the folding of a polypeptide chain into a polyproline II helix prior to the formation of hydrogen bonds between backbone amides."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

We investigate limitations of st and ard funnel plots and tests when applied to meta-analyses of test accuracy and look for improved methods . METHODS Type I and type II error rates for existing and alternative tests of sample size effects were estimated and compared in simulated meta-analyses of test accuracy . RESULTS Type I error rates for the Begg , Egger , and Macaskill tests are inflated for typical diagnostic odds ratios ( DOR ) , when disease prevalence differs from 50 % and when thresholds favor sensitivity over specificity or vice versa . Regression and correlation tests based on functions of effective sample size are valid , if occasionally conservative , tests for sample size effects . Empirical evidence suggests that they have adequate power to be useful tests . When DORs are heterogeneous , however , all tests of funnel plot asymmetry have low power . CONCLUSION Existing tests that use st and ard errors of odds ratios are likely to be seriously misleading if applied to meta-analyses of test accuracy . The effective sample size funnel plot and associated regression test of asymmetry should be used to detect publication bias and other sample size related effectsTitle 3:Citrus red mite (Panonychus citri) may be an important allergen in the development of asthma among exposed childrenAbstract 3:Background Recent investigations have demonstrated that spider mites are important allergens in the development of asthma in fruit‐cultivating farmersTitle 4:Sensitivity to citrus red mite and the development of asthma.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The citrus red mite ( Panonychus citri , CRM ) is an important allergen in the development of asthma and /or rhinitis in citrus farmers and a common sensitizing allergen among exposed children .

Skin prick tests to CRM were carried out and serum-specific IgE , IgG4 , and IgG1 levels were measured using ELISA . RESULTS Fourteen subjects ( 14 % ) had experienced wheezing during last 12 months . The wheal size formed by CRM was larger than 3 mm in 23 subjects ( 23 % ) .

Skin responses to CRM showed a significant correlation with serum-specific IgE levels , but not with IgG1 and IgG4 levels . Serum CRM-specific IgE levels correlated with specific IgG1 and IgG4 levels , but no significant correlation was found between serum IgG1 and IgG4 levels .

Acute insulin secretion determines the efficiency of glucose clearance. Moreover, impaired acute insulin release is characteristic of reduced glucose control in the prediabetic state. Incretin hormones, which increase β-cell cAMP, restore acute-phase insulin secretion and improve glucose control. To determine the physiological role of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a mouse model was developed to increase PKA activity specifically in the pancreatic β-cells. In response to sustained hyperglycemia, PKA activity potentiated both acute and sustained insulin release. In contrast, a glucose bolus enhanced acute-phase insulin secretion alone. Acute-phase insulin secretion was increased 3.5-fold, reducing circulating glucose to 58% of levels in controls. Exendin-4 increased acute-phase insulin release to a similar degree as PKA activation. However, incretins did not augment the effects of PKA on acute-phase insulin secretion, consistent with incretins acting primarily via PKA to potentiate acute-phase insulin secretion. Intracellular calcium signaling was unaffected by PKA activation, suggesting that the effects of PKA on acute-phase insulin secretion are mediated by the phosphorylation of proteins involved in β-cell exocytosis. Thus, β-cell PKA activity transduces the cAMP signal to dramatically increase acute-phase insulin secretion, thereby enhancing the efficiency of insulin to control circulating glucose.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Glucose\\", \\"calcium\\", \\"glucose\\", \\"cAMP\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

pde6 lipid modifications . based on studies of prenyltransferase caax  box specificity , the mutation is predicted to alter the prenyl group from a geranylgeranyl to a farnesyl group .the patient was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at age 12 , had difficulty seeing at night , and no loss of visual acuity or color vision .animal models replicating a similar mutation in pde6 show progressive rod cell degeneration and dysfunction ( singh r. and ramamurthy v. , unpublished studies ) .our interest in prenylation is due to our earlier work investigating the mechanism of a severe childhood blindness called leber congenital amaurosis ( lca ) caused by mutations in aryl - hydrocarbon interacting protein - like 1 ( aipl1 ) .yeast two hybrid ( y2h ) analysis showed aipl1 interacts with prenylated proteins . in agreement with our y2h results , mouse knockouts of aipl1 affected the assembly , stability and function of prenylated phosphodiesterase 6 ( pde6 ) .altogether , these studies suggest a model where aipl1 acts as a chaperone for farnesylated pde6 and promotes folding and proper assembly with its partner subunits . absence or defects in aipl1affect the initial phase of biosynthesis of pde6 leading to its degradation and subsequent loss in visual response .another chaperone involved in pde6 membrane interaction is prenyl binding protein/ ( prbp/ ) formerly known as pde6/. prbp/ interacts with farnesylated proteins by binding to the farnesylated / methylated cysteine and the proximal upstream amino acid residues .prbp/ extracts pde6 from rod os membrane preparations and is thought to be important for pde6 transport to the os in cones .the initial lipidation is thought to be the primary determinant for membrane attachment of pde6 .the role of subsequent  caax  processing events in assembly , transport and function was recently elucidated from our studies in an animal model lacking rce1 in retinal neurons .conditional knockout of rce1 eliminated both proteolysis and subsequent methylation of prenylated proteins including pde6 at embryonic day 9.5 in the retina and forebrain .timing of degeneration corresponded to the requirement for efficient protein trafficking from is to os .another key finding from conditional rce1 animal model was that pde6 requires rce1-mediated proteolysis for transport to the os while the other farnesylated proteins , transducin  subunit and rhodopsin kinase are transported normally .additionally , lack of postprenylation processing did not affect the assembly or function of pde6 .mislocalized pde6 appeared as discrete vesicular structures at the distal end of the inner segment below the connecting cilia .our preliminary ultrastructural studies confirm the presence of these vesicular structures in retina lacking rce1 .animal models that exhibit impaired protein trafficking to the os accumulate excess protein at photoreceptor synapses . for example , rod pde6 is localized in the is and synaptic region in addition to the os in prenyl binding protein/ ( prbp/ ) knockout mice .in contrast , pde6 was exclusively present in is in retina lacking rce1 . based on our findings , we propose the following models to explain the requirement for complete  caax  processing of pde6 for proper trafficking to os .pde6 catalytic subunits exit the er and form the holoenzyme on vesicles in the cytoplasm .vesicular pde6 trafficking has a unique pathway , that utilizes small gtpases or adaptor protein ( akin to rho gdi ) that also require  caax  processing . in the absence of rce1 ,the vesicles are not able to dock and release from the ciliary transport machinery for further transport to os ( fig . assembly of the pde6 holoenzyme occurs at the er membrane and a putative prenyl binding protein specifically interacts with the methyl esterified isoprenyl cysteine group of pde6 subunits .this prenyl binding protein is required for pde6 extraction from er membranes and further transport to os ( fig . we do not believe this prenyl binding protein to be prbp/ , because the majority of rod pde6 is transported to the os in the absence of prbp/. pde6 has a large phospholipid binding footprint with contributions from the prenyl groups , further methyl esterification and polybasic regions similar to ras proteins . in the absence of rce1-mediated proteolysis , the presence of investigating the composition and identity of proteins present in vesicular structures seen by light and electron microscopy will be crucial in differentiating these possibilities

ANTACID (Magnesium-Aluminum Hydroxide): Cerivastatin plasma concentrations were not affected by co-administration of antacid. CIMETlDINE: Cerivastatin plasma concentrations were not affected by co-administration of cimetidine. CHOLESTYRAMINE: The influence of the bile-acidsequestering agent cholestyramine on the pharmacokinetits of cerivastatin sodium was evaluated in 12 healthy males in 2 separate randomized crossover studies. In the first study, concomitant administration of 0.2 mg cerivastatin sodium and 12 g cholestyramine resulted in decreases of more than 22% for AUC and 40% for Cmax when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone. However, in the second study, administration of 12 g cholestyramine 1 hour before the evening meal and 0.3 mg cerivastatin sodium approximately 4 hours after the same evening meal resulted in a decrease in the cerivastatin AUC of less than 8%, and a decrease in Cmax of about 30% when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone. Therefore, it would be expected that a dosing schedule of cerivastatin sodium given at bedtime and cholestyramine given before the evening meal would not result in a significant decrease in the clinical effect of cerivastatin sodium. DIGOXIN: Plasma digoxin levels and digoxin clearance at steady-state were not affected by co-administration of 0.2 mg cerivastatin sodium. Cerivastatin plasma concentrations were also not affected by co-administration of digoxin. WARFARIN: Co- administration of warfarin and cerivastatin to healthy volunteers did not result in any changes in prothrombin time or clotting factor VII when compared to co-administration of warfarin and placebo.

In this study, we report the identification of MELK as a novel oncogenic kinase from an in vivo tumorigenesis screen using a kinome-wide open reading frames( ORFs) library. Analysis of clinical data reveals a high level of MELK overexpression in BBC, a feature that is largely dependent on FoxM1, a master mitotic transcription factor that is also found to be highly overexpressed in BBC. Ablation of MELK selectively impairs proliferation of basal-like, but not luminal breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, depletion of MELK in BBC cells induces caspase-dependent cell death, preceded by defective mitosis. Finally, we find that Melk is not required for mouse development and physiology. Together, these data indicate that MELK is a normally non-essential kinase, but is critical for BBC and thus represents a promising selective therapeutic target for the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer.Introduction:Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a high degree of diversity in histology, therapeutic response, and treatment outcomes. Transcriptional profiling analyses have reproducibly identified at least five major ‘intrinsic’ subtypes of breast cancer: normal breast-like, luminal A, luminal B, HER2/Neu-enriched, and basal-like breast cancer( BBC)( Perou et al., 2000; Sorlie et al., 2001). These molecular subtypes have recently been confirmed in a comprehensive characterization of human breast tumors at the genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels( Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012). Among these subtypes, basal-like breast cancer( BBC) is strongly associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis( Rakha et al., 2008). Unlike their luminal counterparts, BBC cells lack expression of estrogen receptor( ER) and progesterone receptor( PR). Most BBC tumors also lack expression of HER2 and thus this subtype largely overlaps with the clinically defined ‘triple-negative’ breast cancer( TNBC), which is also characterized by the lack of ER, PR, and HER2 expression( Rakha et al., 2008; Foulkes et al., 2010). The lack of these molecular targets renders BBC or TNBC cells relatively unresponsive to the targeted therapies that are highly effective in the treatment of luminal or HER2 positive breast cancer. Thus, establishing the molecular pathogenesis of this subtype and identifying potential targets for treatment remains a key challenge for BBC/TNBC. Kinases comprise a large family of proteins that is frequently involved in tumor pathogenesis. Indeed, a large number of mutations, alterations in copy number, and/or expression level have been observed in genes encoding kinases across multiple types of human cancers. In addition, kinases have proven to be pharmacologically tractable, making inhibition of kinase activity with small molecules a highly effective strategy for cancer treatment( Zhang et al., 2009). Therefore, identifying kinases critical for the growth and survival of BBC cells could not only provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of BBC, but also define potential druggable targets for therapeutic interventions. Kinases that regulate progression through mitosis, including Aurora A, Aurora B and PLK1, are essential for cell proliferation. Inhibiting them in cancer cells causes mitotic arrest and/or abnormalities in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, which in turn trigger apoptosis( Taylor and Peters, 2008; Lens et al., 2010). Inhibitors of these kinases are effective at eradicating human cancer cells in culture and in mouse xenograft models, but their efficacy in the clinic has been limited by killing of normal proliferating cells especially the bone marrow( Dar et al., 2010). If a kinase exists that is required for mitosis in a specific type of cancer cell, but not other tumor cells or in normal cells, inhibitors of that kinase might make highly effective and safe drugs. To date, this type of cancer-specific mitotic kinase has not been identified for any cancer. In this study, we report the identification of MELK as a novel oncogenic kinase that emerged from an in vivo tumorigenesis screen. Analyses of breast cancer patient data according to subtypes revealed a remarkable overexpression of MELK in BBC. We further demonstrate that MELK is directly regulated by the FoxM1 transcription factor, a master mitotic regulator also found to be overexpressed in BBC. We discover that MELK is essential in basal-like, but not in luminal breast cancer cells. Notably, mice in which MELK has been genetically ablated display normal development and hematopoiesis. Together, our data establish MELK as a mitosis-regulating kinase involved in the pathogenesis of BBC and a promising molecular target for patients with basal-like breast malignancy.Discussion:Patients with basal-like breast cancer remain faced with limited treatment options due to the aggressive nature of the disease and the current lack of suitable molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we report that MELK, a novel oncogenic kinase that emerged from an unbiased, in vivo tumorigenesis screen, may indeed be a therapeutic target in this tumor type. In a comprehensive analysis of databases with multiple cohorts of breast cancer, we find MELK to be highly overexpressed in breast cancer lacking the expression of ER/PR, including basal-like breast cancer. Remarkably, overexpression of wild-type MELK induces robust oncogenic transformation both in vitro and in vivo with a transforming potency comparable to that of the highly oncogenic mutant allele of PIK3CA. Even more striking is the finding that only basal-like, but not luminal breast cancer cells, depend on MELK for proliferation. In addition, the dispensable nature of Melk in normal development and hematopoiesis in mice underlines its selective role in BBC. Notably, the kinase activity of MELK is required for its transforming activity as well as for the survival and proliferation of BBC cells. Thus, MELK is potentially a novel oncogenic driver of basal-like breast carcinoma and a promising target for small molecule-based therapeutic intervention. Our data point to a potential role for MELK as a marker in predicting disease outcome. In multiple independent breast cancer cohorts analyzed, we found a strong association of high expression levels of MELK with a higher grade of malignancy and an unfavorable prognosis regardless of the treatment modality. While high MELK expression seems to be a unique phenomenon for BBC in breast cancer, MELK overexpression has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor outcome in a number of other cancer types, including glioblastoma( Nakano et al., 2008), astrocytoma( Marie et al., 2008), and prostate cancer( Kuner et al., 2013). The prognostic feature of MELK expression is likely due to its correlation with cell proliferation. In fact, MELK and other proliferation-related genes are major components of multi-gene signature for predicting disease outcome. For example, a recent study developed a cell proliferation signature that consists of the top 1% genes whose expression is most positively correlated with that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen( PCNA). The authors found that adjusting breast cancer expression data for this cell proliferation signature causes a dramatic reduction in outcome association of most published breast cancer signatures( Venet et al., 2011). Notably, MELK expression strongly correlates with cell proliferation, and in fact is one of the top-ranking signature genes of cell proliferation that correlate with PCNA expression( Venet et al., 2011). Previous studies demonstrated that, while MELK is a member of the AMPK family, it is not activated via phosphorylation by the tumor suppressor kinase LKB1( Lizcano et al., 2004). Recombinant MELK expressed in bacteria is catalytically active( Davezac et al., 2002; Lizcano et al., 2004; Beullens et al., 2005). Consistent with these findings, overexpression of wild-type MELK readily drives transformation in vitro and in vivo. This behavior is similar to that of other established proto-oncoproteins, such ERBB2( Di Fiore et al., 1987; Hudziak et al., 1987), and Aurora A kinase( Bischoff et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1998), the transforming activity of which is driven by overexpression of the wild-type protein. While a number of substrates have been proposed for MELK, such as Bcl-G( Lin et al., 2007), CDC25B( Davezac et al., 2002), p53( Seong and Ha, 2012), and PDK1( Seong et al., 2012), the substrates that mediate the oncogenic activity of MELK in breast cancer remain to be identified. An intriguing question is how the selective overexpression of MELK is achieved in BBC. Our finding that the mitotic transcription factor FoxM1( Laoukili et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005a) plays a major role in regulating MELK expression has shed some light on this enigma. Notably, the expression levels of FoxM1 and MELK demonstrate a striking correlation across all breast cancer samples and subtypes examined. Like MELK, FoxM1 is significantly overexpressed in BBC. Consistent with our results, FoxM1 was recently proposed as a transcriptional driver of proliferation-associated genes in BBC( Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012). However, why MELK is selectively required for cell division in BBC cells, but not in other types of breast cancer or normal cells, remains an open question. MELK was not observed as a hit in systematic screens for essential cell division proteins in HeLa cells( Kittler et al., 2004). Both C. elegans and mice are tolerant of mutation or deletion of MELK ortholog( Cordes et al., 2006; Figure 7G–I). However, MELK can be essential in some circumstances. It is expressed in early frog embryos, where it seems to play some role in cell division( Le Page et al., 2011), and we observed it accumulating in dividing cells( Figure 3F), and playing an important role during cell division in BBC cells( Figure 6). To reconcile these apparently disparate findings, we propose that one or more MELK-related kinase is required for cell division in many, if not all vertebrate cells. In BBC cells, MELK must play this role uniquely and is selectively overexpressed, perhaps because redundant kinases are down-regulated. In other cells, MELK may function during division, but it is not essential due to redundancy with related kinases. Consistent with this hypothesis, the MELK-related kinase AMPK was recently shown to play a role in mitosis( Vazquez-Martin et al., 2009). Perhaps AMPK, or other kinases in the same family, can substitute for MELK in some cells, but not in BBC cells, which seem to have become addicted to MELK for proper execution of cell division. Determining the precise function of MELK in cell division, and the reason this function is selectively required in BBC cells, will require further analysis. Nevertheless, our studies firmly establish MELK as a molecular target for the treatment of BBC. Unlike other mitotic factors like Aurora A, Aurora B, and PLK1, that are normally essential, MELK presents a unique mitotic kinase that is only required by a subset of cancer cells, and is therefore an excellent therapeutic target. In summary, recent comprehensive characterization of basal-like breast cancer demonstrates that this subtype of disease has high genetic heterogeneity, but lacks commonly occurring genetic alterations, with the exception of the frequent inactivation of p53( Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012). In contrast, the relative uniform overexpression of MELK in basal-like breast cancer makes it a potential common target in an otherwise heterogeneous disease. Thus our data on MELK provide important information for guiding the development of targeted therapies in basal-like breast cancer.","answer":"Not all cancers are the same .

By exploiting these differences , scientists have developed therapies that target specific tumor types , and these targeted therapies have proven useful against most breast cancers . One type of breast cancer , however , has proven hard to treat . Basal-like breast cancer grows rapidly and there are few treatment options for women with this type of cancer . One reason for this is that , unlike other forms of breast cancer , these cancers do not have the hormone receptors that are the targets of existing therapies . Enzymes called kinases are promising alternate targets , and many kinase-inhibiting drugs can kill tumor cells in mice . Nevertheless , it has proven difficult to develop kinase inhibitors that are safe for use in humans because these drugs can also kill normal cells . To avoid this side effect , cancer researchers have been searching for a kinase that is active in cancer cells but not in normal cells . Wang et al . tested a large collection of kinases and found that one called MELK caused tumors to grow in the mammary glands of mice . Further examination of tumor samples collected from hundreds of women in previous clinical studies revealed that MELK expression was increased in basal-like breast cancers and other breast cancer tumors that lack the usual hormone receptor targets . When Wang et al . treated tumor cells and mice with tumors with a chemical that stops MELK working , basal-like breast cancer cells stopped multiplying and died . On the other hand , tumor cells that had the usual hormone receptors continued to multiply . To see if MELK is important in healthy mice , Wang et al . genetically engineered mice to delete the MELK gene and found that these mutant mice appear normal . The next challenge will be to test if drugs that inhibit MELK can kill basal-like breast cancer cells without having the side effect of harming normal cells ."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

CGP 12177A mediates cardiostimulation by activation of the 'putative' beta(4)-adrenoceptor; however, it has recently been reported that disruption of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor gene abolishes this effect. We have adenovirally overexpressed beta(1)-adrenoceptors in isolated, cultured adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and observed the inotropic potency of isoprenaline and CGP 12177A (in the presence of 1 microm propranolol). 2. Isoprenaline was a full inotropic agonist at rat ventricular myocytes (pD(2) 7.69+/-0.12). CGP 12177A was a nonconventional partial agonist (pD(2) 6.34+/-0.09), increasing inotropy and lusitropy, with an intrinsic activity of 0.34 and antagonised by bupranolol. 3. beta(1)-adrenoceptor overexpression enhanced the inotropic potency of isoprenaline by 11.7-fold (pD(2) 8.76+/-0.14) and CGP 12177A by 5.9-fold (7.11+/-0.10), respectively. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) overexpression did not alter the potency of isoprenaline or CGP 12177A (pD(2) 7.41+/-0.24 and pD(2) 6.60+/-0.50, respectively). 4. The cardiostimulant effects of CGP 12177A were enhanced by IBMX (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and decreased by Rp-cAMPS (cAMP antagonist). CGP 12177A also increased cAMP levels. CGP 12177A but not isoprenaline initiated arrhythmias at lower concentrations following beta(1)-adrenoceptor overexpression. 5. (125)I-Cyanopindolol saturation binding in Adv.beta(1) myocytes demonstrated approximately 18-fold increase in beta(1)-adrenoceptors. (3)H-CGP 12177A saturation binding, in the presence of propranolol, increased approximately 5-fold following overexpression of beta(1)-adrenoceptors. 6. This study demonstrates enhanced cardiostimulation by CGP 12177A (in the presence of propranolol) in rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing beta(1)-adrenoceptors, mediated by a Gs/cAMP signalling pathway. 'Putative' beta(4)-adrenoceptor pharmacology appears to be mediated by activation of a novel affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"(125)I-Cyanopindolol\\", \\"Isoprenaline\\", \\"isoprenaline\\", \\"Rp-cAMPS\\", \\"cAMP\\", \\"propranolol\\", \\"bupranolol\\", \\"(3)H-CGP 12177A\\", \\"CGP 12177A\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"phosphodiesterase\\", \\"beta(1)-adrenoceptors\\", \\"beta 4-adrenoceptor\\", \\"beta(1)-adrenoceptor\\", \\"beta(4)-adrenoceptor\\", \\"beta 1-adrenoceptors\\", \\"Gs\\", \\"beta(1)-adrenocepto\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We evaluated associations between mood, cognitive and cardiovascular responses to d-amphetamine and four polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3): rs460000, rs3756450, rs37022 and rs6869645. Healthy Caucasian male and female volunteers (N = 152) participated in a double-blind, crossover design study in which they received placebo, 10 and 20 mg of d-amphetamine. We measured self-reported rating of mood, performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task, blood pressure and heart rate. Individuals with the C/C genotype at rs460000 (N = 83) reported approximately twofold higher ratings of stimulation and euphoria relative to the A/A+A/C (N = 69) genotype group, at both the 10 and 20 mg doses. No other responses or SNPs showed significant effects. rs460000 is in perfect LD with rs463379 (CEU: D' = 1; r (2) = 1), which was not studied here, but has been associated with etiology of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These findings suggest a pleiotropic effect of this polymorphic locus on both ADHD and sensitivity to the subjective effects of amphetamine.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"amphetamine\\", \\"d-amphetamine\\", \\"D-amphetamine\\", \\"dopamine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"SLC6A3\\", \\"dopamine transporter\\"]}"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

The efficacy of astemizole, a new, long acting, oral histamine H1-receptor antagonist was compared to placebo for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis during the grass pollen season of 1982. Sixty-three patients with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen and current symptoms participated in an 8 week, double-blind, randomized study. Astemizole, 10 mg, was significantly better than placebo in alleviating both nose (P less than 0.05) and eye (P less than 0.01) symptoms despite significantly greater use of the reserve medication, clemastine, by the placebo group (P less than 0.003). There was a lag period of 5 days after initiation of therapy before treatment benefit became manifest. Subdivision of nasal symptoms indicated significant improvement compared to placebo over the 8 weeks for sneezing (P less than 0.05) and runny nose (P less than 0.05) but not blocked nose. The absence of effect on nasal blockage was confirmed by parallel measurement of nasal calibre by body plethysmography. The antihistaminic potency of astemizole was indicated by an 80% inhibition of the histamine induced skin weal response after 8 weeks therapy.

To evaluate these factors, an Internet-based survey was conducted among U.S. adults aged >/=18 years during June 24-30, 2020. Overall, 85.2% of respondents reported always or often engaging in hand hygiene following contact with high-touch public surfaces such as shopping carts, gas pumps, and automatic teller machines (ATMs).(dagger) Respondents who were male (versus female) and of younger age reported lower handwashing and hand sanitizing rates, as did respondents who reported lower concern about their own infection with SARS-CoV-2( section sign) and respondents without personal experience with COVID-19.

Measuring early onset , however , requires a sensitive and clinical ly responsive tool . This study evaluates the psychometric properties of a patient-reported Global Anxiety - Visual Analog Scale ( GA-VAS ) . Methods Data from a double-blind , r and omized , placebo-controlled study of lorazepam and paroxetine in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder were analyzed to assess the reliability , validity , responsiveness , and utility of the GA-VAS . The GA-VAS was completed at clinic visits and at home during the first week of treatment . Targeted psychometric analyses — test-retest reliabilities , validity correlations , responsiveness statistics , and minimum important differences — were conducted . Results The GA-VAS correlates well with other anxiety measures , at Week 4 , r = 0.60 ( p < 0.0001 ) with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and r = 0.74 ( p < 0.0001 ) with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale . In terms of convergent and divergent validity , the GA-VAS correlated -0.54 ( p < 0.0001 ) , -0.48 ( p < 0.0001 ) , and -0.68 ( p < 0.0001 ) with the SF-36 Emotional Role , Social Function , and Mental Health subscales , respectively , but correlated much lower with the SF-36 physical functioning subscales . Preliminary minimum important difference estimates cluster between 10 and 15 mm . Conclusions The GA-VAS is capable of validly and effectively capturing a reduction in anxiety as quickly as 24 hours post-doseTitle 2:Cognitive reappraisal increases neuroendocrine reactivity to acute social stress and physical painAbstract 2:Cognitive re appraisal can foster emotion regulation , yet less is known about whether cognitive re appraisal alters neuroendocrine stress reactivity . Some initial evidence suggests that although long-term training in cognitive behavioral therapy techniques ( which include re appraisal as a primary training component ) can reduce cortisol reactivity to stress , some studies also suggest that re appraisal is associated with heightened cortisol stress reactivity . To address this mixed evidence , the present report describes two experimental studies that r and omly assigned young adult volunteers to use cognitive re appraisal while undergoing laboratory stressors . Relative to the control condition , participants in the re appraisal conditions showed greater peak cortisol reactivity in response to a socially evaluative speech task ( Experiment 1 , N=90 ) and to a physical pain cold pressor task ( Experiment 2 , N=94 ) . Participants in the cognitive re appraisal group also reported enhanced anticipatory psychological appraisal s of self-efficacy and control in Experiment 2 and greater post-stressor self-efficacy . There were no effects of the re appraisal manipulation on positive and negative subjective affect , pain , or heart rate in either experiment . These findings suggest that although cognitive re appraisal fosters psychological perceptions of self-efficacy and control under stress , this effortful emotion regulation strategy in the short-term may increase cortisol reactivity . Discussion focuses on promising psychological mechanisms for these cognitive re appraisal effectsTitle 3:Mind over matter: reappraising arousal improves cardiovascular and cognitive responses to stress.Abstract 3:Research ers have theorized that changing the way we think about our bodily responses can improve our physiological and cognitive reactions to stressful events . However , the underlying processes through which mental states improve downstream outcomes are not well understood . To this end , we examined whether reappraising stress-induced arousal could improve cardiovascular outcomes and decrease attentional bias for emotionally negative information .  Participants were r and omly assigned to either a re appraisal condition in which they were instructed to think about their physiological arousal during a stressful task as functional and adaptive , or to 1 of 2 control conditions : attention reorientation and no instructions . Relative to controls , participants instructed to reappraise their arousal exhibited more adaptive cardiovascular stress responses-increased cardiac efficiency and lower vascular resistance- and decreased attentional bias . Thus , reappraising arousal shows physiological and cognitive benefits . Implication s for health and potential clinical applications are discussedTitle 4:Does the perception that stress affects health matter? The association with health and mortality.Abstract 4:OBJECTIVE This study sought to examine the relationship among the amount of stress , the perception that stress affects health , and health and mortality outcomes in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults . METHODS Data from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey were linked to prospect i ve National Death Index mortality data through 2006 . Separate logistic regression models were used to examine the factors associated with current health status and psychological distress . Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the impact of perceiving that stress affects health on all-cause mortality . Each model specifically examined the interaction between the amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health , controlling for sociodemographic , health behavior , and access to health care factors . RESULTS 33.7 % of nearly 186 million ( unweighted n = 28,753 ) U.S. adults perceived that stress affected their health a lot or to some extent . Both higher levels of reported stress and the perception that stress affects health were independently associated with an increased likelihood of worse health and mental health outcomes . The amount of stress and the perception that stress affects health interacted such that those who reported a lot of stress and that stress impacted their health a lot had a 43 % increased risk of premature death ( HR = 1.43 , 95 % CI [ 1.2 , 1.7 ] ) . CONCLUSIONS High amounts of stress and the perception that stress impacts health are each associated with poor health and mental health . Individuals who perceived that stress affects their health and reported a large amount of stress had an increased risk of premature deathTitle 5:Adaptive Appraisals of Anxiety Moderate the Association between Cortisol Reactivity and Performance in Salary NegotiationsAbstract 5:Prior research suggests that stress can be harmful in high-stakes context s such as negotiations . However , few studies actually measure stress physiologically during negotiations , nor do studies offer interventions to combat the potential negative effects of heightened physiological responses in negotiation context s. In the current research , we offer evidence that the negative effects of cortisol increases on negotiation performance can be reduced through a re appraisal of anxiety manipulation . We experimentally induced adaptive appraisal s by r and omly assigning 97 male and female participants to receive either instructions to appraise their anxiety as beneficial to the negotiation or no specific instructions on how to appraise the situation . We also measured participants ’ cortisol responses prior to and following the negotiation . Results revealed that cortisol increases were positively related to negotiation performance for participants who were told to view anxiety as beneficial , and not detrimental , for negotiation performance ( appraisal condition ) . In contrast , cortisol increases were negatively related to negotiation performance for participants given no instructions on appraising their anxiety ( control condition ) . These findings offer a means through which to combat the potentially deleterious effects of heightened cortisol reactivity on negotiation outcomesTitle 6:Re-conceptualizing stress: Shifting views on the consequences of stress and its effects on stress reactivityAbstract 6:Background The consequences of stress are typically regarded from a deficit-oriented approach , conceptualizing stress to be entirely negative in its outcomes . This approach is unbalanced , and may further hinder individuals from engaging in adaptive coping . In the current study , we explored whether negative views and beliefs regarding stress interacted with a stress framing manipulation ( positive , neutral and negative ) on measures of stress reactivity for both psychosocial and physiological stressors . Method Ninety participants were r and omized into one of three framing conditions that conceptualized the experience of stress in balanced , unbalanced-negative or unbalanced-positive ways . After watching a video on stress , participants underwent a psychosocial ( Trier Social Stress Test ) , or a physiological ( CO2 challenge ) method of stress-induction .  Subjective and objective markers of stress were assessed . Results Most of the sample d population regarded stress as negative prior to framing . Further , subjective and objective reactivity were greater to the TSST compared to the CO2 challenge . Additionally , significant cubic trends were observed in the interactions of stress framing and stress-induction method ologies on heart rate and blood pressure . Balanced framing conditions in the TSST group had a significantly larger decrease in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure following stress compared to the positive and negative framing conditions . Conclusion Findings confirmed a deficit-orientation of stress within the sample d population . In addition , results highlighted the relative efficacy of the TSST compared to CO2 as a method of stress provocation . Finally , individuals in framing conditions that posited stress outcomes in unbalanced manners responded to stressors less efficiently . This suggests that unbalanced framing of stress may have set forth unrealistic expectations regarding stress that later hindered individuals from adaptive responses to stress . Potential benefits of alternative conceptualizations of stress on stress reactivity are discussed , and suggestions for future research are madeTitle 7:Validation of a verbally administered numerical rating scale of acute pain for use in the emergency department.Abstract 7:OBJECTIVES Verbally administered numerical rating scales ( NRSs ) from 0 to 10 are often used to measure pain , but they have not been vali date d in the emergency department ( ED ) setting . The authors wished to assess the comparability of the NRS and  visual analog scale ( VAS )  as measures of acute pain , and to identify the minimum clinical ly significant difference in pain that could be detected on the NRS . METHODS This was a prospect i ve cohort study of a convenience sample of adults presenting with acute pain to an urban ED . Patients  verbally rated pain intensity as an integer from 0 to 10 ( 0 = no pain , 10 = worst possible pain ) , and marked a 10-cm horizontal VAS bounded by these descriptors .  VAS and NRS data were obtained at presentation , 30 minutes later , and 60 minutes later . At 30 and 60 minutes , patients were asked whether their pain was \\" much less , \\" \\" a little less , \\" \\" about the same , \\" \\" a little more , \\" or \\" much more . \\" Differences between consecutive pairs of measurements on the VAS and NRS obtained at 30-minute intervals were calculated for each of the five categories of pain descriptor . The association between VAS and NRS scores was expressed as a correlation coefficient . The VAS scores were regressed on the NRS scores in order to assess the equivalence of the measures . The mean changes associated with descriptors \\" a little less \\" or \\" a little more \\" were combined to define the minimum clinical ly significant difference in pain measured on the VAS and NRS . RESULTS Of 108 patients entered , 103 provided data at 30 minutes and 86 at 60 minutes . NRS scores were strongly correlated to VAS scores at all time periods ( r = 0.94 , 95 % CI = 0.93 to 0.95 ) . The slope of the regression line was 1.01 ( 95 % CI = 0.97 to 1.06 ) and the y-intercept was -0.34 ( 95 % CI = -0.67 to -0.01 ) . The minimum clinical ly significant difference in pain was 1.3 ( 95 % CI = 1.0 to 1.5 ) on the NRS and 1.4 ( 95 % CI = 1.1 to 1.7 ) on the VAS . CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that the verbally administered NRS can be substituted for the VAS in acute pain measurementTitle 8:The effects of arousal reappraisal on stress responses, performance and attentionAbstract 8:ABSTRACT Background and Objectives : This study examined the effects of arousal re appraisal on cardiovascular responses , dem and and re source evaluations , self-confidence , performance and attention under pressurized conditions . A recent study by Moore et al. [ 2015 . Reappraising threat : How to optimize performance under pressure . Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology , 37(3 ) , 339–343 . doi:10.1123/jsep.2014 - 0186 ] suggested that arousal re appraisal is beneficial to the promotion of challenge states and leads to improvements in single-trial performance . This study aim ed to further the work of Moore and colleagues ( 2015 ) by examining the effects of arousal re appraisal on cardiovascular responses , dem and and re source evaluations , self-confidence , performance and attention in a multi-trial pressurized performance situation . Design and Methods : Participants were r and omly assigned to either an arousal re appraisal intervention or control condition , and completed a pressurized dart throwing task . The intervention encouraged participants to view their physiological arousal as facilitative rather than debilitative to performance . Measures of cardiovascular reactivity , dem and and re source evaluations , self-confidence , task performance and attention were recorded . Results : The re appraisal group displayed more favorable cardiovascular reactivity and reported higher re source evaluations and higher self-confidence than the control group but no task performance or attention effects were detected . Conclusion : These findings demonstrate the strength of arousal re appraisal in promoting adaptive stress responses , perceptions of re sources and self-confidenceTitle 9:Effects of emotion regulation strategies on anxiety during job interviews in Chinese college studentsAbstract 9:Background and objectives : Few studies related to the impact of different emotion regulation strategies on anxiety have used externally and ecologically valid emotion-eliciting stimuli or Eastern population s. The present study compares the effects of re appraisal , suppression , and acceptance on anxiety induced by a simulated job interview in a Chinese sample . Methods : Eighty-two subjects were r and omly assigned to one of four instructions : re appraisal , suppression , acceptance , or no-regulation strategies during a simulated job interview .  Anxiety was assessed with an  observer-based behavior rating scale during the interview and the State Anxiety Inventory before , during , and after the interview . Results : A repeated- measures MANOVA indicated a significantly greater reduction in anxiety in the re appraisal and acceptance groups compared to the control group during the interview ( re appraisal : d = 1.42 ; acceptance : d = 1.30 ; each p < .001 ) , but not during the recovery stage . The suppression and control group did not differ in any stage . Suppression led to a higher ( pmax < .04 ) anxiety than re appraisal /acceptance in the anticipation ( d = 0.65/0.68 ) , interview ( d = 0.87/0.79 ) , and recovery stages ( d = 0.94/1.03 ) . No significant differences were found between re appraisal and acceptance . Conclusions : In Chinese students re appraisal and acceptance seem to be more effective anxiety regulation strategies than suppression","answer":"RESULTS Findings from both the meta- analysis and systematic review revealed that overall , re appraisal interventions are effective in attenuating subjective responsivity to stress .On one h and , findings may suggest a promising avenue for the effective management of self-reported stress and optimization of stress responses ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

known of these are pp - waves ( see @xcite and references therein ) which admit a covariantly constant null vector field .there are also vsi and csi spacetimes @xcite for which all polynomial scalar invariants constructed from the riemann tensor and its derivatives vanish and are constant , respectively . moreover , all the relativistic gyratons known so far @xcite , representing the fields of localised spinning sources that propagate with the speed of light , are also specific members of the kundt class .vacuum and conformally flat pure radiation kundt spacetimes provide an exceptional case for the invariant classification of exact solutions @xcite , and all type  d pure radiation solutions are also known @xcite .all vacuum kundt solutions of type  d were found and classified a long time ago @xcite and generalized to electrovacuum and any value of the cosmological constant @xcite .these contain a subfamily of direct -

Trypanosoma rangeli is a hemoflagellate parasite which is able to infect humans. Distinct from Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, T. rangeli is non-pathogenic to the vertebrate host. The manner by which the T. rangeli interacts with the host is still unknown, but it certainly depends on the surface molecules. Major surface proteins (MSP) are GPI-anchored, zinc-dependent metalloproteases present in the surface of all trypanosomatids studied so far, which are implicated as virulence factors in pathogenic trypanosomatids, such as Leishmania spp and T. cruzi. The aims of this work were to generate the complete sequence of a T. rangeli MSP (TrMSP) gene and to determine the 3D-structure of the predicted protein by homology modeling. The plasmid bearing a complete copy of a TrMSP gene was completely sequenced and the predicted protein was modeled using Modeller software. Results indicate that TrMSP open reading frame (ORF) codes for a predicted 588 amino acid protein and shows all elements required for its posttranslational processing. Multiple sequence alignment of TrMSP with other trypanosomatids' MSPs showed an extensive conservation of the N-terminal and central regions and a more divergent C-terminal region. Leishmania major MSP (LmMSP), which had its crystal structure previously determined, has an overall 35 % identity with TrMSP. This identity allowed the comparative molecular modeling of TrMSP, which demonstrated a high degree of structural conservation between MSPs from other trypanosomatids (TrypMSPs). All modeled MSPs have a conserved folding pattern, apart from structural divergences in the C-domain and discrete differences of charge and topology in the catalytic cleft, and present the same geometry of the canonical HEXXH zinc-binding motif. The determination of surface charges of the molecules revealed that TrMSP is a predominantly positive protein, whereas LmMSP and Trypanosoma cruzi MSP (TcMSP) are negative proteins, suggesting that substrates recognized by TcMSP and LmMSP could not interact with TrMSP. Moreover, the comparison between TrMSP and TcMSP protein sequences has revealed 45 non-neutral amino acid substitutions, which can be further assessed through protein engineering. The characteristics of TrMSP could explain, at least in part, the lack of pathogenicity of T. rangeli to humans and point to the necessity of identifying the biological targets of this enzyme.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"zinc\\", \\"amino acid\\", \\"C\\", \\"N\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

For SBM-Transformer, we test the model trained under lambda=10^{-1}. Due to lack of support for sparse tensor operations in existing FLOP-counters, we measure FLOP counts by manually enumerating through each tensor operation. Table 3 shows that SBM-Transformer is comparably efficient across all tasks except for Text, where SBM-Transformer showed the largest average mask density. Note that while the cost of other baselines are fixed after initialization, the cost of SBM-Transformer is data-adaptive and can vary input-by-input. Further analysis and qualitative examples demonstrating the input-dependent attention mask densities can be found in Appendix C. Nonetheless, there are limitations due to sparse tensor operations being less optimized on GPU kernels. In the LRA experiments, we found that SBM-Transformer can result in longer runtimes compared to dense counterparts while its memory usage is much lower. While previous sparsity-based attention mechanisms with block-sparse attention are much more amenable for GPU computation [51, 9, 3], our work requires an architecture with better workload balancing and acceleration under unstructured sparsity, for which there is ongoing work [46, 54].Question: The forward step of SBM-Transformer requires additional parameters and computation compared to the original Transformer architecture due to SBM sampling.

Mycophenolate mofetil , the prodrug of mycophenolic acid , is widely used for maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplant recipients . The effect of renal graft function on mycophenolic acid pharmacokinetics parameters is still controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of renal graft function on mycophenolic acid pharmacokinetics during the early posttransplant period.  Materials And Methods Our study was done on 13 patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, impaired group) and 13 patients with normal graft function (glomerular filtration rate < 70 mL/min, control group), at a steady mycophenolic acid plasma level, during the first month after transplant. All patients received a fixed dose of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily) in combination with cyclosporine and steroids. mycophenolic acid plasma levels were determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. mycophenolic acid area under the time concentration curve from 0 to 12 hours and apparent mycophenolic acid plasma clearance (CL/f) were measured for each patient.  results mycophenolic acid area under the time-concentration curve (0-12 h), mycophenolic acid area under the time-concentration curve (6-10 h), first peak concentration (Cmax1), and secondary peak concentration (Cmax2) were higher in the impaired group, while mycophenolic acid plasma clearance was higher in the control group (P < .05). Trough levels (C0) were similar for both groups (P < .05). There was a negative correlation between glomerular filtration rate and area under the time-concentration curve (r=-0.422, P = .04), while there was a positive correlation between glomerular filtration rate and mycophenolic acid plasma clearance (r=0.463, P = .02).  conclusions mycophenolic acid pharmacokinetics parameters in normal renal function patients and severe renal impairment patients are different, and renal graft function correlates with total mycophenolic acid area under the time-concentration curve and apparent mycophenolic acid plasma clearance. However, the necessity of dosage adjustment based on renal graft function requires further studies.sentence: Mycophenolate mofetil , the prodrug of mycophenolic acid , is widely used for maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplant recipients .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications.(METHODS) An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events.(RESULTS) One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications.

This multi-institutional , prospect i ve , r and omized trial compares 2 established methods for controlling symptomatic unilateral MPEs . Patients with unilateral MPEs were r and omized to either daily tunneled catheter drainage ( TCD ) or bedside talc pleurodesis ( TP ) . This trial is patterned after a previous r and omized trial that showed that bedside TP was equivalent to thoracoscopic TP ( CALGB 9334 ) . The primary end point of the current study was combined success : consistent/reliable drainage/pleurodesis , lung expansion , and 30-day survival . A secondary end point , survival with effusion control , was added retrospectively . This trial r and omized 57 patients who were similar in terms of age ( 62 years ) , active chemotherapy ( 28 % ) , and histologic diagnosis ( lung , 63 % ; breast , 12 % ; other/unknown cancers , 25 % ) to either bedside TP or TCD .  Combined success was higher with TCD ( 62 % ) than with TP ( 46 % ; odds ratio , 5.0 ; P = .064 ) . Multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients treated with TCD had better 30-day activity without dyspnea scores ( 8.7 vs. 5.9 ; P = .036 ) , especially in the subgroup with impaired expansion ( 9.1 vs. 4.6 ; P = .042 ) . Patients who underwent TCD had better survival with effusion control at 30 days compared with those who underwent TP ( 82 % vs. 52 % , respectively ; P = .024 ) . In this prospect i ve r and omized trial , TCD achieved superior palliation of unilateral MPEs than TP , particularly in patients with trapped lungsTitle 2:A randomized comparison of indwelling pleural catheter and doxycycline pleurodesis in the management of malignant pleural effusionsAbstract 2:The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of a chronic indwelling pleural catheter with doxycycline pleurodesis via tube thoracostomy in the treatment of patients with recurrent symptomatic malignant pleural effusions ( MPE )Title 3:Phase III intergroup study of talc poudrage vs talc slurry sclerosis for malignant pleural effusion.Abstract 3:STUDY OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the efficacy , safety , and appropriate mode of instillation of talc for sclerosis in treatment of malignant pleural effusions ( MPEs ) . DESIGN A prospect i ve , r and omized trial was design ed to compare thoracoscopy with talc insufflation ( TTI ) to thoracostomy and talc slurry ( TS ) for patients with documented MPE . MEASUREMENTS The primary end point was 30-day freedom from radiographic MPE recurrence among surviving patients whose lungs initially re-exp and ed > 90 % . Morbidity , mortality , and quality of life were also assessed . RESULTS Of 501 patients registered , those eligible were r and omized to TTI ( n = 242 ) or TS ( n = 240 ) . Patient demographics and primary malignancies were similar between study arms . Overall , there was no difference between study arms in the percentage of patients with successful 30-day outcomes ( TTI , 78 % ; TS , 71 % ) . However , the subgroup of patients with primary lung or breast cancer had higher success with TTI than with TS ( 82 % vs 67 % ) . Common morbidity included fever , dyspnea , and pain . Treatment-related mortality occurred in nine TTI patients and seven TS patients . Respiratory complications were more common following TTI than TS ( 14 % vs 6 % ) . Respiratory failure was observed in 4 % of TS patients and 8 % of TTI patients , accounting for five toxic deaths and six toxic deaths , respectively . Quality -of-life measurement demonstrated less fatigue with TTI than TS . Patient ratings of comfort and safety were also higher for TTI , but there were no differences on perceived value or convenience of the procedures . CONCLUSIONS Both methods of talc delivery are similar in efficacy ; TTI may be better for patients with either a lung or breast primary . The etiology and incidence of respiratory complications from talc need further explorationTitle 4:Comparing cost of indwelling pleural catheter vs talc pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND Malignant pleural effusion is associated with short life expectancy and significant morbidity . A r and omized controlled trial comparing indwelling pleural catheters ( IPCs )  with talc pleurodesis found that IPCs reduced in-hospital time and the need for additional procedures but were associated with excess adverse events . METHODS Using data from the clinical trial , we compared costs associated with use of IPCs and with talc pleurodesis . Re source use and adverse events were captured through case report forms over the 1-year trial follow-up . Costs for outpatient and inpatient visits , diagnostic imaging , nursing , and doctor time were obtained from the UK National Health Service reference costs and University of Kent 's Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2011 and inflated to 2013 using the UK Consumer Price Index . Procedure supply costs were obtained from the manufacturer . Difference in mean costs was compared using nonparametric bootstrapping . All costs were converted to US dollars using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Purchasing Power Parity Index . RESULTS Overall mean cost ( SD ) for managing patients with IPCs and talc pleurodesis was  4,993 (  5,529 ) and  4,581 (  4,359 ) , respectively . The incremental mean cost difference was  401 , with 95 % CI of -1,387 to  2,261 . The mean cost related to ongoing drainage in the IPC group was  1,011 (  732 ) vs  57 (  213 ) in the talc pleurodesis group ( P = .001 ) . This included the cost of drainage bottles , dressing changes in the first month , and catheter removal . There was no significant difference in cost of the initial intervention or adverse events between the groups . For patients with survival < 14 weeks , IPC is significantly less costly than talc pleurodesis , with mean cost difference of -1,719 ( 95 % CI , -3,376 to -85 ) . CONCLUSIONS There is no significant difference in the mean cost of managing patients with IPCs  compared with talc pleurodesis . For patients with limited survival , IPC appears less costly .

Pleurodesis was considered achieved when three consecutive outputs were scant and imaging showed no residual fluid . RESULTS All catheters were successfully placed . Dyspnea improved in 94 % ( 29 of 31 hemithoraces ) at 48 hours and 91 % ( 20 of 22 patients ) at 30 days . Control of the MPE was achieved in 90 % of hemithoraces ( 28/31 ) , although five required ancillary procedures . Pleurodesis occurred in 42 % ( 13 of 31 ) of hemithoraces , including both that underwent an earlier attempt at chemical sclerotherapy and one treated locule . Continued drainage without pleurodesis controlled the effusion in 48 % ( 15 of 31 ) . In only 7 % was hospital time necessary for care related to the TPC .  Early , transient catheter-related pain was common , but only three complications ( in two patients ) occurred . Neither of these altered patient care . CONCLUSIONS Regardless of whether pleurodesis is achieved , TPCs provide effective long-term outpatient palliation of MPEsTitle 6:Indwelling pleural catheters reduce inpatient days over pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion.Abstract 6:BACKGROUND Patients with malignant pleural effusion ( MPE ) have limited prognoses . They require long-lasting symptom relief with minimal hospitalization . Indwelling pleural catheters ( IPCs ) and talc pleurodesis are approved treatments for MPE . Establishing the implication s of IPC and talc pleurodesis on subsequent hospital stay will influence patient choice of treatment . Therefore , our objective was to compare patients with MPE treated with IPC vs pleurodesis  in terms of hospital bed days ( from procedure to death or end of follow-up ) and safety . METHODS In this prospect i ve , 12-month , multicenter study , patients with MPE were treated with IPC or talc pleurodesis , based on patient choice . Key end points were hospital bed days from procedure to death ( total and effusion-related ) . Complications , including infection and protein depletion , were monitored longitudinally . RESULTS One hundred sixty patients with MPE were recruited , and 65 required definitive fluid control ; 34 chose  IPCs  and 31 pleurodesis .  Total hospital bed days ( from any causes ) were significantly fewer in patients with IPCs ( median , 6.5 days ; interquartile range [ IQR ] = 3.75 - 13.0 vs pleurodesis , mean , 18.0 ; IQR , 8.0 - 26.0 ; P = .002 ) . Effusion-related hospital bed days were significantly fewer with IPCs ( median , 3.0 days ; IQR , 1.8 - 8.3 vs pleurodesis , median , 10.0 days ; IQR , 6.0 - 18.0 ; P < .001 ) . Patients with IPCs spent significantly fewer of their remaining days of life in hospital ( 8.0 % vs 11.2 % , P < .001 , χ(2 ) = 28.25 ) . Fewer patients with IPCs  required further pleural procedures ( 13.5 % vs 32.3 % in pleurodesis group ) . There was no difference in rates of pleural infection ( P = .68 ) and protein ( P = .65 ) or albumin loss ( P = .22 ) . More patients treated with IPC reported immediate ( within 7 days ) improvements in quality of life and dyspnea . CONCLUSIONS Patients treated with IPCs required significantly fewer days in hospital and fewer additional pleural procedures than those who received pleurodesis . Safety profiles and symptom control were comparableTitle 7:Effect of an indwelling pleural catheter vs chest tube and talc pleurodesis for relieving dyspnea in patients with malignant pleural effusion: the TIME2 randomized controlled trial.Abstract 7:CONTEXT Malignant pleural effusion causes disabling dyspnea in patients with a short life expectancy . Palliation is achieved by fluid drainage , but the most effective first-line method has not been determined . OBJECTIVE To determine whether indwelling pleural catheters ( IPCs ) are more effective than chest tube and talc slurry pleurodesis ( talc ) at relieving dyspnea . DESIGN Unblinded r and omized controlled trial ( Second Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Effusion Trial [ TIME2 ] ) comparing IPC and talc ( 1:1 ) for which 106 patients with malignant pleural effusion who had not previously undergone pleurodesis were recruited from 143 patients who were treated at 7 UK hospitals . Patients were screened from April 2007-February 2011 and were followed up for a year . INTERVENTION Indwelling pleural catheters were inserted on an outpatient basis , followed by initial large volume drainage , education , and subsequent home drainage . The talc group were admitted for chest tube insertion and talc for slurry pleurodesis . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Patients completed daily 100-mm line visual analog scale ( VAS ) of dyspnea over 42 days after undergoing the intervention ( 0 mm represents no dyspnea and 100 mm represents maximum dyspnea ; 10 mm represents minimum clinical ly significant difference ) . Mean difference was analyzed using a mixed-effects linear regression model adjusted for minimization variables . RESULTS Dyspnea improved in both groups , with no significant difference in the first 42 days with a mean VAS dyspnea score of 24.7 in the IPC group ( 95 % CI , 19.3 - 30.1 mm ) and 24.4 mm ( 95 % CI , 19.4 - 29.4 mm ) in the talc group , with a difference of 0.16 mm ( 95 % CI , −6.82 to 7.15 ; P = .96 ) . There was a statistically significant improvement in dyspnea in the IPC group at 6 months , with a mean difference in VAS score between the IPC group and the talc group of −14.0 mm ( 95 % CI , −25.2 to −2.8 mm ; P = .01 ) . Length of initial hospitalization was significantly shorter in the IPC group with a median of 0 days ( interquartile range [ IQR ] , 0 - 1 day ) and 4 days ( IQR , 2 - 6 days ) for the talc group , with a difference of −3.5 days ( 95 % CI , −4.8 to −1.5 days ; P < .001 ) . There was no significant difference in quality of life . Twelve patients ( 22 % ) in the talc group required further pleural procedures compared with 3 ( 6 % ) in the IPC group ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.21 ; 95 % CI , 0.04 - 0.86 ; P = .03 ) . Twenty-one of the 52 patients in the catheter group experienced adverse events vs 7 of 54 in the talc group ( OR , 4.70 ; 95 % CI , 1.75 - 12.60 ; P = .002 ) . CONCLUSION Among patients with malignant pleural effusion and no previous pleurodesis , there was no significant difference between IPCs and talc pleurodesis at relieving patient-reported dyspnea .

Please write an abstract for this paper. Your response should include the abstract and no additional text.Paper text:was discovered as part of the hamburg / eso quasar survey and was first identified as a gravitational lens candidate by wisotzki et al .( @xcite ) .it consists of two lensed images of a radio - quiet quasar at @xmath1= 2.319 that are separated by @xmath23.2 .the lensing galaxy was discovered from ground based near - ir ( courbin , lidman & magain , @xcite ) and hst optical observations ( remy et al . @xcite ; hereafter r98 ) and is 1 from the brighter quasar image ( component a ) .    from a spectrophotometric monitoring program that lasted several years , wisotzki et al .( @xcite ; hereafter w98 ) measured a time delay of 0.73 years between the two components . to convert this into an estimate of the hubble constant, one needs to determine the geometry of the system ( astrometry and lens and source redshifts ) and to model the mass distribution of the lens .several mass models for the lens have been published ( w98 ; r98 ; courbin et al .@xcite ; hereafter c2000 ; lehar et al .@xcite ) and precise astrometry from hst images is available .since the source redshift is known , the remaining unknown is the redshift of the lens .    in their discovery paper ,wisotzki et al .( @xcite ) noted that the continuum of component a was considerably harder than that of component b , and that the broad emission lines of the two components were identical , only scaled by a factor of 2.8 .this was still the case during the spectrophotometric monitoring carried out by wisotzki et al .( @xcite ) and in ir spectra covering the 1 to 2.5  @xmath3 m range ( c2000 ) .this has been interpreted as microlensing of the continuum emitting region of the quasar in component a , which is twice as close to the lensing galaxy as component b. presumably , the broad line region is too large to be affected. it may be possible to use this information to gain insight into the geometries and sizes of the continuum emitting and broad line regions ; however , detailed predictions require the lens redshift .    from high resolution spectroscopic observations ( smette et al .@xcite ; lopez et al .@xcite ) , several metallic absorption line systems have been detected : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .the systems at @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 contain lines that are mostly detected in component a , the component that is closest to the lens . at one time or another ,each system has been individually proposed to be the lens .    despite its importance, the redshift of the lensing galaxy has proved elusive .apart from the many unpublished attempts to measure it , the redshift of the lens has been estimated by indirect means . from ir and optical photometry , c2000 gave a redshift in the range @xmath9 to @xmath10 while from the time delay and a model of the lens , w98 estimated @xmath11 . from the position of the lens on the fundamental plane , kochanek et al .( @xcite ) derived @xmath12 .although model dependent , the two latter estimates prove to be very close to the truth .    in this paperwe describe the successful measurement of the lens redshift , @xmath13 , using the spectral deconvolution method described by courbin et al .( @xcite ) .the observations were taken with fors2 on kueyen ( vlt / ut2 ) at the cerro paranal observatory on april 1st , 2000 , which also happened to be the first scheduled observing night for this telescope , and consisted of three 1080 second exposures with the g200i grism and the high resolution collimator .this gives a scale of 0.1 per pixel in the spatial direction and a scale of approximately 4 per pixel in the spectral direction .the observing conditions were clear and the external seeing varied between 0.5 and 0.9 .we used the movable slits in the fors2 focal plane to select targets and set the slit width .one slit was placed on and aligned along the two quasar components , three slits were placed on field stars that were used to determine the psf required for the deconvolution ( see below ) and to correct for telluric absorption . used in this mode , the slits of fors2 have a fixed length .this is less flexible than punched or laser designed masks , but it was adequate for our experiment .the slit width was set to 1 , which is larger than the fwhm of the images . for the deconvolution to work well ,it is important that the targets are not too heavily occulted by the slit edges , since this can lead to differential occultation between the psf stars and the quasar images and hence to a less accurate deconvolution .this can be minimized by carefully centroiding the stars in the slits and by having slits that are significantly wider than the psf .additionally , preparing the mask from an image that was taken with the same instrument , as was done in this case , also minimises differential alignment errors .instrumental signatures were removed in the standard manner using iraf .the bias was removed by subtracting a constant from each frame and the pixel - to - pixel sensitivities were normalised with screen flats .the arc frames were used to correct for slit distortion and to set the wavelength scale .all spectra were rebinned to the same linear wavelength scale .the position of the night sky lines and the absorption features in component a were used to check the accuracy of the wavelength calibration , which was found to be around @xmath14 .the lensing galaxy is four to five magnitudes fainter than component a of and only one arc second away .even with excellent seeing , the spectrum of the lens is heavily contaminated by that of the quasar and needs to be extracted with sophisticated techniques .    the technique implemented by courbin et al .( @xcite ) spatially deconvolves spectra and decomposes them into point - sources and extended components .it is therefore very well suited to the present problem : extracting the spectrum of a faint extended lens galaxy close to a bright quasar spectrum .as is the case with image deconvolution , a reference psf is necessary . out of the three psf stars that were available , two were unfortunately too faint . in order to build the psf spectrum , we therefore used only one psf star ( which was slightly fainter than the quasar itself ) in combination with the spectrum of the bright quasar image itself .only half of the spatial profile of the quasar was actually used , the one unaffected by light contamination from the lensing galaxy .the deconvolved spectrum has a pixel size of 0.05 while the undeconvolved data have a pixel size of 0.1 . the deconvolved spectrum is displayed in fig .  [ 2d_spec ] .as the psf stars were observed at exactly the same time and under the same conditions as the lensed quasar , they could also be used to remove telluric features .the spectra of the psf stars were combined and then divided directly into the spectra of the lens and the two components of the quasar . before division , the continuum of the psf stars was normalised with a high - order function and obvious absorption features , such as @xmath15 and the calcium triplet at 8600  , were removed . as we do not know the spectral type of the psf stars ,weaker features may be present .ideally , one should choose hot , featureless stars to make such a correction . despite this, the correction works rather well .    the 1-d spectrum of the lens , extracted directly from the 2-d deconvolved image ( extended component only ) , is shown in fig .[ lens ] . an unsmoothed version and a smoothed version shifted by 0.03 units on the vertical scaleare shown in the lower half of the figure . also shown , but reduced by a factor of 20 ,is the spectrum of component a. the calcium h and k absorption lines of the lensing galaxy are clearly detected and the g - band is marginally detected .the redshift was measured by cross correlating the lens spectrum with the elliptical template from the kinney - calzetti spectral atlas ( kinney et al .@xcite ) , which has been plotted ( third curve from the bottom ) with a shift of 0.05 units in fig .for this we used the iraf task rvsao v2.0 ( kurtz and mink 1998 ) .the redshift is @xmath0 , where the error incorporates the internal error reported by the cross - correlation routine and the error in the wavelength calibration .an alternative measure of the accuracy is given by the r - statistic of tonry and davis ( @xcite ) , which is the signal - to - noise ratio of the main peak in the cross correlation .we find that @xmath16 , which indicates that the redshift is reliable ( kurtz & mink @xcite ) .the redshift is in good agreement with the redshift of the multiple absorption line system at a redshift of @xmath6 ( smette et al .@xcite ; lopez , @xcite ) .this absorption line system is made up of many sub - components spread over a range of redshifts ( @xmath17 ) .although it is not possible to say if the absorption line system and the lens are the same object , the two systems are probably dynamically associated .as the quality of the psf was not optimal , the quasar spectra from the deconvolved images are noisier than what one would calculate from the photon noise only .therefore , the extraction of the quasar spectra was not done from the deconvolved spectrum but with narrow apertures from the undeconvolved spectrum . since the galaxy is much fainter than either component of the quasar and since it is not spatially coincident , the contamination of the quasar spectra by the lensing galaxy is negligible .the spectra of the two components of the quasar are shown in fig .[ quasar ] . in this figurewe plot the data before and after the telluric features have been removed .the a and b atmospheric bands are removed very well and the feii absorption lines at @xmath18 become visible . additionally , the mgii emission line , which is almost obscured by the strong telluric feature at 9300 , is recovered .    as in w98 and c2000, we also plot the difference between the spectrum of component a and a scaled version of the spectrum of component b , that is @xmath19 , where , @xmath20 , is set to 2.8 .the difference is plotted in fig .[ diff ] , where we plot it before and after telluric correction .apart from a slight excess at 6390 and the metallic absorption lines in component a , the broad lines of the quasar disappear and only the excess continuum from component a remains .the strongest absorbers are now clear and are marked with the vertical dotted lines .the wavelengths of the main absorption lines and the redshifts of the corresponding absorption line systems are given in smette et al .( @xcite ) .the aim of our observations were modest : to measure the redshift of the lensing galaxy in , one of the ever growing list of lenses with known time delays .this was possible with only one hour of vlt time during average weather conditions .the prospects of measuring the lens redshifts in other systems are therefore very good , at least for double systems , where aligning the slit simultaneously on the quasar images and on the lens is straightforward .    with the time delay andthe lens and source redshifts known and several mass models published , it is relatively straight forward to derive the hubble constant .w98 present two models to describe the lens : a singular isothermal sphere with external shear and a singular isothermal ellipsoid without external shear .for the former ( the model presented by r98 is very similar ) , one derives @xmath21 km / s / mpc and for the latter , one derives @xmath22 km / s / mpc .we have set @xmath23 . c2000also present two models : a singular ellipsoid without external shear and a two component model which consists of a singular isothermal ellipsoid to represent the lensing galaxy and a more extended component representing a galaxy cluster centered on the lensing galaxy .the first model leads to @xmath24 km / s / mpc , but the second leads to values for the hubble constant which are a factor of 1.5 to 2 lower .    is somewhat unusual in that the lensing galaxy is closest to the brighter component .it has been pointed out by several authors that the lens probably does not consist of a single galaxy ( w98 , r98 , c2000 ; lehar et al .additional extended mass is required to match all the observational constraints : the position of the two images relative to the lens , the magnification ratio of the images , and the lens orientation and ellipticity .deep images in the near - ir may be able to reveal the distribution of this additional mass .    as the lens appears to be associated with the absorption system seen in the quasar spectrum at @xmath6, one could use the velocity spread in this system to constrain the lens velocity dispersion .however , this assumes that the absorption line system and the lens are the same object or , at the very least , in the same potential well . without further supporting evidence that links the absorption line system to lens , it is premature to use the velocity spread as a constraint on the mass models .the lens redshift estimates of w98 and kochanek et al .( @xcite ) have proven to be accurate , whereas the estimate of c2000 from ir and optical photometry is less so .the optical photometry is in good agreement with the vlt spectrum ; however , if the lens is an elliptical galaxy , then the ir points are over - estimated by 0.3 magnitudes .the cause of this discrepancy requires further investigation .it is a pleasure to thank thomas szeifert for his expert support at the telescope .frdric courbin acknowledges financial support from the chilean grant fondecyt/3990024. additional support from the european southern observatory , through cnrs / conicyt grant 8730 \`\` mirages gravitationnels avec le vlt : distribution de matire noire et contraintes cosmologiques''as well as through the tmr lensnet network ( erbfmrxct97 - 0172 ) , is also gratefully acknowledged .","answer":"using fors2 , mounted on kueyen ( ut2 of the vlt ) , we have obtained the redshift of the lensing galaxy in the gravitational lens system .  we measure @xmath0 , in good agreement with previous estimates based on the time delay and the position of the lens on the fundamental plane .  it also coincides with one of the metal line absorption systems that are seen in high resolution spectra of ."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

We aim to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib-based regimens in CLL. Seven databases were searched in accordance with PRISMA statement guidelines using the following keywords: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, and PCI-32765. Data from only prospective clinical trials was included. In a phase 3 trial (n = 136), the overall response rate (ORR) with ibrutinib was 92% whereas 18% patients had a complete response (CR). Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 89% and 95% respectively. Phase 3 trial (n = 195) with single agent ibrutinib showed ORR of 63%.

Subsequent to this discovery, lyconadins B–F were isolated and characterized [2–4]. Biological assays revealed that 1 exhibits cytotoxicity against murine lymphoma L1210 and human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells (IC50 = 0.46 μg/mL and 1.7 μg/mL, respectively) [1]. Moreover, 1 has been shown to promote nerve growth factor biosynthesis in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells [2]. In addition to its interesting bioactivity, lyconadin A presents a significant synthetic challenge by virtue of its unique pentacyclic skeleton, which contains six stereocenters and a pyridone ring. It is therefore not surprising that 1 has attracted the attention of the organic synthesis community. The first total synthesis of lyconadin A was reported in 2007 by Smith and Beshore [5–6], and efforts from the Sarpong [7–8] and Fukuyama [9–10] groups have also culminated in the construction of 1.</p><p>Lyconadin A.</p>Introduction<p>Our initial interest in lyconadin A was sparked by recognition that a 7-exo–6-exo cyclization cascade would efficiently furnish its bicyclo[5.4.0]undecane system, which is shown in bold in Figure 1. Subsequent to this observation, we performed model studies that demonstrated the viability of highly stereoselective 7-exo-trig acyl radical–6-exo-trig alkyl radical cyclizations as a means of preparing bicyclo[5.4.0]undecanes fused to aromatic rings [11]. Then, we devised an annulation protocol inspired by the work of Donohoe and co-workers [12–13] that provided access to substituted pyridones of the type found in 1 from thioester precursors [14]. Based on these encouraging results, we decided to target lyconadin A for synthesis. Herein, we provide an account of our studies directed toward the construction of this alkaloid. Specifically, we describe our efforts to prepare advanced intermediates that could be employed in the aforementioned pyridone annulation and tandem radical cyclization processes. In the course of this work, we discovered an unusual Payne-like rearrangement process that occurred in preference to the ring-opening of a hindered epoxide.</p>Results and Discussion<p>Our retrosynthetic analysis of lyconadin A is shown in Scheme 1. We reasoned that 1 could be formed by an alkylation cascade triggered by exposure of trimesylate 2 or a related electrophile to ammonia. A sequential alkylation process would serve as a viable alternative in the event of problems with this approach. In turn, cis-fused trimesylate 2 could be derived from trans-fused tricyclic ketone 3 by epimerization and standard functional-group manipulations. Based on the aforementioned model study [11], 7-exo–6-exo tandem radical cyclization of phenyl selenoester 4 was expected to produce ketone 3. Disassembly of the pyridone moiety of 4 according to our annulation protocol [14] revealed thioester 5 as a suitable precursor. We believed that this compound could be prepared from alkene 6 in two consecutive epoxidation–ring-opening sequences involving vinyl nucleophiles. We anticipated that a chiral catalyst such as one of the ketones developed by Shi and co-workers [15–18] would control the stereochemistry of the epoxidation of 6. Presumably, the identity of the protecting groups on this substrate (i.e., R2 and R3) would be critical to the success of the reaction. After formation of the epoxide, the bulky trityl ether was envisioned to direct the subsequent ring-opening to the distal carbon [19–22]. Alkene 6 would ultimately be formed by a Myers alkylation [23] of (+)-pseudoephedrine derived amide 7 with allylic iodide 8.</p><p>Retrosynthetic analysis of 1.</p>Results and Discussion<p>The initial epoxidation substrate of type 6 that we targeted possessed benzyl and TBDPS ethers as the protecting groups. First, allylic iodide 8 was synthesized by iodination of the mesylate derived from known alcohol 9 [24] (Scheme 2). Then, coupling of methyl γ-hydroxybutyrate (10) [25] with lithiated (+)-pseudoephedrine afforded amide 11 in excellent yield. Selective silylation of the primary alcohol of 11 delivered substrate 12. Alkylation of the enolate derived from 12 with 8 according to the Myers protocol [23] furnished adduct 13 in very high yield. Although not measured directly, the dr of this compound was assumed to be very high (i.e., ≥95:5) based on the results of an alkylation conducted on a very similar substrate (see below). The configuration of the newly formed stereocenter of 13 was assigned based on the established stereochemical course of the Myers alkylation [23]. Finally, reductive removal of the chiral auxiliary with lithium amidotrihydroborate [26] produced alcohol 14, and benzylation yielded triether 15.</p><p>Synthesis of triether 15.</p>Results and Discussion<p>Asymmetric epoxidation of alkene 15 was somewhat sluggish and required superstoichiometric amounts of Shi's fructose-derived ketone 16 [27]. The resulting epoxide 17 was produced in moderate yield but excellent (<95:5) diastereomeric ratio (Scheme 3). The epoxide stereochemistry was assigned based on the reported outcomes of epoxidations mediated by 16 [27]. Epoxide 17 was then subjected to ring-opening reactions with vinyl Grignard reagents in the presence of various copper salts. Surprisingly, only trace amounts of the desired product were detected, with recovered starting material and multiple byproducts typically comprising the majority of the mass balance. Although not investigated in detail, analysis of these reactions by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry indicated that partial debenzylation was occurring. Accordingly, we decided to replace the benzyl ether with a 2-naphthylmethyl (NAP) ether [28]. Unfortunately, attempted protection of alcohol 14 produced varying yields of triether 19 along with byproducts derived from migration and/or scission of the TBDPS ether (Scheme 4). Modification of the reaction conditions failed to suppress the deleterious silyl migration and cleavage.</p><p>Synthesis and attempted ring-opening of epoxide 17.</p><p>Attempted protection of 14 and silyl migration.</p>Results and Discussion<p>With the hope that a more robust silyl ether would not migrate, we installed a TIPS group on alcohol 11 (Scheme 5). Gratifyingly, TIPS-protected amide 20 was alkylated by 8 in the same yield as TBDPS-protected amide 12. Reductive removal of the chiral auxiliary furnished alcohol 22 in 91% yield. Fortunately, naphthylmethylation of 22 was achieved without migration of the TIPS group. Surprisingly, Shi epoxidation of the NAP ether derivative of 22 was low-yielding (<10%), and ring-opening of the resulting epoxide did not proceed. These results prompted us to swap the bulky TIPS moiety for a smaller TBDPS group, and triether 24 was obtained uneventfully in 77% overall yield from 22. Notably, the high (94%) ee of 24 as established by chiral HPLC analysis demonstrated that the Myers alkylation of 20 had proceeded with excellent diastereoselectivity. Then, we were pleased to find that Shi epoxidation of 24 provided 25 in reasonable (72%) yield and high (>95:5) dr. After considerable experimentation, we discovered that CuBr•Me2S [29] in conjunction with vinylmagnesium bromide was uniquely effective at facilitating the ring-opening of 25. However, careful inspection of the 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of one less hydrogen atom than expected in the 3–4 ppm region and one more hydrogen atom than expected in the 1–2 ppm region. Clearly, neither the anticipated product 27 nor the regioisomer derived from attack at the more hindered epoxide carbon had been generated. Instead, the NMR data were consistent with the formation of a different regioisomer, tentatively identified as alcohol 26, which had been produced in good yield.</p><p>Synthesis and ring-opening rearrangement of epoxide 25.</p>Results and Discussion<p>Presumably, the extremely hindered nature of internal epoxide 25 precluded its direct ring-opening, allowing alcohol 26 to form by means of a Payne rearrangement [30]. A possible mechanistic pathway for this transformation is given in Scheme 6. Coordination of a Lewis acid (likely a copper or magnesium species) to the trityl ether moiety of 25 could promote migration of the trityl group [31–32] to the epoxide, generating intermediate A. Payne rearrangement of A would then furnish epoxide B. Finally, attack of the vinylcopper complex [29] at the less-hindered carbon of the epoxide would provide 26. Acid- and Lewis acid promoted Payne rearrangements of epoxy alcohols [33–34] and epoxy methyl ethers [35] have been described, but we are unaware of any prior reports of Payne rearrangements of the bulkier epoxy trityl ethers. However, previous observations of trityl migration [31–32], although rare, do lend support to our mechanistic proposal. The NMR data for 26, while strongly supportive of the carbon backbone as drawn, do not permit an unambiguous assignment of the trityl ether to the C4 or C5 oxygen atom. An alternative pathway to this carbon skeleton involving a Payne rearrangement without trityl migration can also be envisioned, and under this scenario, the trityl ether would be located at C4 rather than C5. This possibility cannot be ruled out, but it would require opening of an activated epoxonium species at the less-substituted carbon instead of the more-substituted carbon as is typically observed. Thus, we favor the mechanism shown in Scheme 6.</p><p>Proposed mechanism for generation of alcohol 26.</p>Results and Discussion<p>To provide additional evidence for the structure of 26, this compound was converted into epoxide 29 as outlined in Scheme 7. Selective detritylation was accomplished by exposure to BCl3 at low temperature [36]. Camphorsulfonic acid was also effective for this transformation, although lengthy reaction times were required. Treatment of the resulting diol 28 with 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl imidazole (TrisIm) effected regioselective sulfonylation (presumably of the less-hindered homoallylic alcohol, although this cannot be known for sure) followed by cyclization [37], delivering a single trans-disubstituted epoxide 29 of uncertain absolute stereochemistry in good yield. Examination of the 1H NMR spectrum of 29 clearly demonstrated that a disubstituted epoxide had been generated. Alcohol 27, or the aforementioned regioisomer that would have resulted from ring-opening of epoxide 25 at the more hindered carbon, would have afforded terminal epoxide 30 or oxetane 31, respectively, when subjected to this two-step sequence. While these observations do not shed light on the location of the trityl ether in 26, they do provide compelling evidence that the carbon backbone of this compound is correct as drawn and is produced by a Payne rearrangement of some type.</p><p>Synthesis of epoxide 29 from alcohol 26 (asterisks indicate relative but not absolute stereochemistry).</p>Conclusion<p>In the context of synthetic efforts targeting the polycyclic alkaloid lyconadin A, we prepared scalemic epoxide 25. A Myers alkylation and a reagent-controlled Shi epoxidation were used to construct this compound in a highly stereoselective fashion. The bulky trityl group of 25 was intended to serve as a means of directing a ring-opening reaction to the distal carbon of the epoxide [19–22]. However, an unanticipated Lewis acid promoted Payne rearrangement intervened, producing alcohol 26 instead of the expected regioisomer 27. We believe that the extremely hindered nature of epoxide 25 prevented the desired ring-opening process, thereby enabling the unusual rearrangement to proceed. Conceivably, future studies of the scope and limitations of Lewis acid promoted Payne rearrangement–ring-opening cascades could establish their utility in organic synthesis.</p><p>Name: Experimental procedures and characterization data for all new compounds.</p>","answer":"In the context of synthetic efforts targeting the alkaloid lyconadin A, scalemic epoxide 25 was prepared by a highly stereoselective sequence involving a Myers alkylation and a Shi epoxidation.

Physcion is well known for the treatment of carcinoma. However, the therapeutic effect of physcion on atopic dermatitis (AD) through the inhibition of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) level remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti-AD effect of physcion using HMC-1 cells, splenocytes, and a murine model. Treatment with physcion decreased production and mRNA expression levels of TSLP, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in activated HMC-1 cells. Physcion reduced the expression levels of RIP2/caspase-1 and phospho (p)ERK/pJNK/pp38 in activated HMC-1 cells. Physcion suppressed the expression levels of pIKKbeta/NF-kappaB/pIkB in activated HMC-1 cells. Moreover, physcion attenuated the production levels of TSLP, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-gamma from activated splenocytes. Oral administration of physcion improved the severity of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced AD-like lesional skin through reducing infiltration of inflammatory cells and mast cells, and the protein and mRNA levels of TSLP, IL-4, and IL-6 in the lesional skin tissues. Physcion attenuated histamine, IgE, TSLP, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF- levels in serum. In addition, physcion inhibited caspase-1 activation in the lesional skin tissues. These findings indicate that physcion could ameliorate AD-like skin lesions by inhibiting TSLP levels via caspase-1/MAPKs/NF-kB signalings, which would provide experimental evidence of the therapeutic potential of physcion for AD.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"IL-1beta\\", \\"thymic stromal lymphopoietin\\", \\"IL-4\\", \\"IFN-gamma\\", \\"ERK\\", \\"TNF-alpha\\", \\"NF-kappaB\\", \\"IL-6\\", \\"RIP2\\", \\"JNK\\", \\"IkB\\", \\"caspase-1\\", \\"p38\\", \\"TSLP\\", \\"Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin\\", \\"TNF\\", \\"IKKbeta\\", \\"MAPK\\", \\"NF-kB\\"]}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

In addition, regulation of miRNAs varies in blood, and cerebral spinal fluid may indicate alterations in AD.miRNA microarray analysis was carried out on blood of rats at 1 week and 2 months after injection. RESULTS: Many up- and downregulated miRNAs were detected.Blood miRNAs could be useful as biomarkers for exposure to nanoparticles. miR-298 regulates β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor protein-converting enzyme-1 (BACE1) in Alzheimer's disease.We previously studied microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD autopsy brain samples and reported a connection between miR-137, -181c, -9, -29a/b and AD, through the regulation of ceramides. In this study, the potential role of these miRNAs as diagnostic markers for AD was investigated. We identified that these miRNAs were down-regulated in the blood serum of probable AD patients.287 with Alzheimer disease (AD) as compared with 344 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, we evaluated expression levels of hnRNP-A1 and its regulatory microRNA (miR)-590-3p in blood cells from patients and controls.Decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-590-3p was observed in patients with AD versus controls (0.685 ± 0.080 versus 0.931 ± 0.111, p = 0.079), and correlated negatively with hnRNP-A1 mRNA levels (r = -0.615, p = 0.0237).expression analysis of Sp1 and its regulatory microRNAs (hsa-miR-29b and hsa-miR-375) has been performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), together with Sp1 protein analysis.Significantly decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-29b, but not of hsa-miR-375, were observed in AD patientsSp1 and its regulatory hsa-miR-29b are deregulated in AD patients, possibly leading to aberrant production of downstream target genes involved in the pathogenesis.We previously observed that miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b post-transcriptionally regulate SPT levels, and the corresponding miRNA levels in the blood sera are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Here, we observe a negative correlation between cortical Aβ42 and sera Aβ42, and a positive correlation between cortical miRNA levels and sera miRNA levels suggesting their potential as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

However, it is difficult to link cellular signals at will. Here, we describe signal-connectors—a series of RNA devices—that connect one signal to another signal at the translational level. We use them to either repress or enhance the translation of target genes in response to signals. Application of these devices allows us to construct various logic gates and to incorporate feedback loops into gene networks. They have also been used to rewire a native signaling pathway and even to create novel pathways. Furthermore, logical AND gates based on these devices and integration of multiple signals have been used successfully for identification and redirection of the state of cancer cells. Eventually, the malignant phenotypes of cancers have been reversed by rewiring the oncogenic signaling from promoting to suppressing tumorigenesis. We provide a novel platform for redirecting cellular information.Introduction:A basic ability of living cells is to sense extracellular signals by translating them into changes in regulation of cell signaling genes. They use the natural signaling network to execute complex physiological functions, such as cell survival, behavior and identity. As an interdisciplinary branch of biology, genetic engineering has developed rapidly during recent years with the objective of reconstituting the signaling network of the cell for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Genetic devices have been used to construct novel signaling circuits such as genetic switches( Gardner et al., 2000; Green et al., 2014), digital logic circuits( Moon et al., 2012; Ausländer et al., 2012; Siuti et al., 2013), rewired signaling pathways( Kiel et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2012; Flock et al., 2014) and feedback loops( Stricker et al., 2008; Prindle et al., 2014). It proved easy to construct networks between synthetic genes using standardized building blocks( Zhang and Jiang, 2010; Schreiber et al., 2016). By controlling the gene expression, there are both positive and negative gene connections. The key difference between them is that in positive connection, the regulated gene is activated for expression, while in negative connection, the regulated gene is silenced. The native intracellular communication can be rewired using genetic devices that block or redirect signals, but connecting native input-output signals at will remains a challenge. For example, the previously developed trans-acting ligand-responsive RNA regulators( Bayer and Smolke, 2005; Win and Smolke, 2007; Ausländer et al., 2010; Beisel et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2012) can be used to engineer novel connections by inhibiting native gene expression in response to extracellular molecules. The conversion of signals into specific cellular events has been accomplished via inducible or repressible antisense RNAs or miRNAs. However, they can only build negative gene connections and the antisense or RNAi-based regulation often exhibits relative low efficiency. Our group has developed a newly-engineered class of genetically encoded devices–‘CRISPR signal conductors'( Liu et al., 2016) –that can sense and respond to cellular signals of interest and in turn activate/repress transcription of specific endogenous genes through a CRISPR interference or activation mechanism. The advantage of these devices is to construct both negative and positive connections between various selected biomolecules and it is only limited by the availability of functional RNA aptamers. However, they require an additional transgene encoding a large protein( dCas9) which further increases the complexity of the system. From an application point of view, the use of a compact RNA-based device is likely to be much more compatible with the limitations of transgene delivery technology than the use of a rather large protein-coding construct. Regretfully, except for miRNAs and siRNAs, no other RNA-based mechanism has been adapted as a wide-spread tool for controlling native gene expression. In this work, we describe the multiple uses of ‘RNA-based signal connectors’ in mammalian cells to modulate translation of mRNAs transcribed from the native genome and from provided plasmids. This new technology acts at the translational stage, apparently promoting or suppressing recruitment of ribosomes to the target mRNA. Without the requirement for an exogenous protein, these small artificial RNAs can establish both negative and positive linkages between input and output signals at will. The work described here is an improvement on the past design of ‘signal conductors’ and shows that they can be used in multiple different applications.Discussion:In this study, we used antisense RNA to target the desired mRNA and the aptamer domain-ligand complex to repress translation of the target gene. Although it has been reported that an aptamer inserted in the 5ʹ-UTR-mRNA can effectively repress translation of a synthetic gene( expressed in an exogenous vector) through the road-block mechanism, this is the first work to propose that aptamers could also repress endogenous genes of interest in a trans manner by linking with the antisense RNAs. It should also be noted that some natural non-coding RNAs( Loh et al., 2009; Mellin et al., 2013; Price et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015) were found to inhibit their target gene through a similar mechanism, which suggests that the method used in this study is a universal approach for cellular RNAs to interact with genes of interest. More importantly, we showed that the aptamer tethering translation initiation factor could be used to enhance endogenous gene translation. In a similar case, this new mechanism was also proposed by one previous work which reported that the uchl1 gene lncRNA enhances the translation of its target mRNA via base-pairing and by recruiting additional ribosomes via the functional element( Carrieri et al., 2012). Therefore, this approach allows simultaneous activation and repression of different target genes, thus enabling robust reprogramming of cellular networks. It is interesting that the signal-connectors mainly located in the cytoplasm. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the device binds the mRNA in the nucleus and remains bound to the mRNA during and after export. This observation is consistent with an earlier study which indicated that nuclear-localized sgRNA targeting mRNA can also be exported to the cytoplasm( Nelles et al., 2016). In the applications of this methodology, we used two signal connectors targeting luciferase gene, but containing aptamers to different ligands, to construct circuits which are somewhat similar to computer logic gates. We also applied this methodology to couple unrelated signaling pathways and to connect oncogenic signals with an antioncogenic pathway. The signal connectors may provide an alternative approach to traditional cancer gene therapy which usually targets only one single gene. In the construction of activator devices( with eIF4G), some basic thermodynamic/kinetics parameters, such as binding affinity and kinetics behaviors, still require quantitative studies in future works. The potential impact of the secondary structures in the targeted region of mRNA may also not be ignored. It seems that other small RNA regulators that are enzymatically amplified( such as shRNAs and miRNAs) exhibit much lower efficiencies than what we report here when expressed from the U6 promoter. We will compare efficacy of this new approach with that of the existing, simpler treatment method in future works. Although conceptually simple, these devices may be included in the biology toolbox that allows for construction of novel signaling circuits and regulatory loops with predetermined properties and may enable development of strategies for treating disease networks. With regard to research applications of this methodology, one clear limitation is the fact that functional aptamers still usually need to be selected from random libraries. With the discovery and development of more and more aptamers, any signal not associated with gene regulation can be directed to inhibit/enhance translation of the targeted gene through the designed signal-connector which is very important to the signal transmission of parts of the gene circuits. Our results showed that these devices could be used to create genetic switches, logic gates, novel signaling and feedback loops, which led to practical applications such as detection of cancer cell state and inhibition of cancer cell survival. Signal-connectors that rewire multiple oncogenic signaling networks may provide an effective network-based strategy to increase the efficiency of current cancer treatment. In addition, mammalian cells harboring digital logic gates can function as living bio-computers and open new avenues for artificial control of future gene- or cell-based therapies in a specific condition-dependent manner. Our novel technique will provide a useful platform for editing the common network structures and their signaling processes and will bring many applications in biology and medicine.","answer":"Cells respond to signals from their surrounding environment .

To efficiently filter or rank the candidates, existing methods use different sources of external information, including manually curated mention tables Ganea and Hofmann (2017), incoming Wikipedia link popularity Yamada et al. (2016), and gold Wikipedia entity categories Gillick et al. (2019). In this paper, we show that BERT-based models set new state-of-the-art performance levels for large scale entity linking when used in a zero shot setup, where there is no external knowledge and a short text description provides the only information we have for each entity. We also present an extensive evaluation of the accuracy-speed trade-off inherent to large pre-trained models, and show is possible to achieve very efficient linking with modest loss of accuracy. Two recent results are most closely related to our work. Logeswaran et al. (2019) proposed the zero-shot entity linking task. They use cross-encoders for entity ranking, but rely on traditional IR-techniques for candidate generation and did not evaluate on large scale benchmarks such as TACKBP.Gillick et al. (2019) show that dense embeddings work well for candidate generation, but they did not do pre-training and included external category labels in their bi-encoder architectures, limiting their linking to entities in Wikipedia. Our approach can be seen as generalizing both of these lines of work, and showing for the first time that pre-trained zero-shot architectures are both highly accurate and computationally efficient at scale. We also study zero-shot entity linking Logeswaran et al. (2019). Here the document setup is the same, but the knowledge base is separated in training and test time. Formally, denote mathcal{E}_{train} and mathcal{E}_{test} to be the knowledge base in training and test, we require mathcal{E}_{train}capmathcal{E}_{test}=emptyset.The set of text documents, mentions, and entity dictionary are separated in training and test so that the entities being linked at test time are unseen.Question: Why author emphasized their model as “Zero-shot”?","answer":"In the zero-shot settings, the set of documents/mentions/entities from training data is not visible in test data, which means the information of the entity that should be linked at test time is not learned directly from the training set. This setting is related to scalability, which is important for the entity linking tasks since there can be lots of possible entity candidates for each mention. The proposed BERT-based models can deal with these settings and show their accuracy and efficiency in scale."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Much past work has considered how to compute personalized PageRank from a given source node to other nodes. In this work we consider the problem of computing personalized PageRanks to a given target node from all source nodes. This problem can be interpreted as finding who supports the target or who is interested in the target. We present an efficient algorithm for computing personalized PageRank to a given target up to any given accuracy. We give a simple analysis of our algorithm's running time in both the average case and the parameterized worst-case. We show that for any graph with @math nodes and @math edges, if the target node is randomly chosen and the teleport probability @math is given, the algorithm will compute a result with @math error in time @math . This is much faster than the previously proposed method of computing personalized PageRank separately from every source node, and it is comparable to the cost of computing personalized PageRank from a single source. We present results from experiments on the Twitter graph which show that the constant factors in our running time analysis are small and our algorithm is efficient in practice.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Recent web search techniques augment traditional text matching with a global notion of \\"importance\\" based on the linkage structure of the web, such as in Google's PageRank algorithm. For more refined searches, this global notion of importance can be specialized to create personalized views of importance--for example, importance scores can be biased according to a user-specified set of initially-interesting pages. Computing and storing all possible personalized views in advance is impractical, as is computing personalized views at query time, since the computation of each view requires an iterative computation over the web graph. We present new graph-theoretical results, and a new technique based on these results, that encode personalized views as partial vectors. Partial vectors are shared across multiple personalized views, and their computation and storage costs scale well with the number of views. Our approach enables incremental computation, so that the construction of personalized views from partial vectors is practical at query time. We present efficient dynamic programming algorithms for computing partial vectors, an algorithm for constructing personalized views from partial vectors, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our techniques.[2]: We introduce a novel bookmark-coloring algorithm (BCA) that computes authority weights over the web pages utilizing the web hyperlink structure. The computed vector (BCV) is similar to the PageRank vector defined for a page-specific teleportation. Meanwhile, BCA is very fast, and BCV is sparse. BCA also has important algebraic properties. If several BCVs corresponding to a set of pages (called hub) are known, they can be leveraged in computing arbitrary BCV via a straightforward algebraic process and hub BCVs can be efficiently computed and encoded.[3]: The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.","answer":"Personalized PageRank was first suggested in the original PageRank paper [3] , and much follow up work has considered how to compute it efficiently. Our approach of propagating estimate updates is similar to the approach taken by Jeh and Widom [1] and Berkin [2] to compute personalized PageRank from a single source. Our equation appears as equation (10) in [1] . Both of these works suggest the heuristic of propagating from the node with the largest unpropagated estimate. Our work is different because we are interested in estimating the values @math for a single target @math , while earlier work was concerned with the values for a single source @math . Because of this, our analysis is completely different, and we are able to prove running time bounds."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

likewise , a signal is of interest if it can be described with just a handful of basis elements . since we do not know where these few terms are located , conventional wisdom would indicate that one has to first measure the full sample at the desired resolution , since overlooking an important component of a signal seems almost inevitable if the whole haystack is nt thoroughly searched over .there would seem to be no alternative to processing each signal in its entirety before we can compress it and store only the desired information ( such as the location of the atoms in a molecule ) .    buta new theory of \`\` compressive sampling '' has shown how an image of interest or structured signals generally can be reconstructed , exactly , from a surprisingly small set of direct measurements .cands and colleagues @xcite have defined a notion of \`\` uniform uncertainty '' that guarantees , with arbitrarily high probability , an exact solution when the signal is sparse and a good approximation when it is compressible or noisy .their uniform uncertainty condition is satisfied , among others , by fourier measurements of a sparse real space object .the question of whether modern sensing theory is applicable to fourier amplitude measurements was first raised by moravec , romberg and baraniuk @xcite who provide an upper bound sampling condition for the successful retrieval of a sparse signal autocorrelation , and discuss other conjectures with far reaching consequences for low - resolution undersampled phase retrieval .since the theory is relatively new and not widely known to the phase retrieval community , modern sampling theory is briefly reviewed .the notion that a diffraction pattern from a sparse object can be reconstructed at sub - nyquist sampling is not entirely new .the so called \`\` direct methods '' are routinely used for atomic resolution imaging of increasing complex molecular structures .direct methods enforce the condition that the resulting molecule is composed of a finite number of atoms .the conditions for successful ab - initio phase retrieval using these methods are strict : it requires ( 1 ) atomic resolution and ( 2 ) about 5 strong peaks per atom .condition ( 2 ) means that the algorithms do not scale well with a large number of atoms since the number of strong reflections decreases rapidly with the number of atoms .suppose that one collects an incomplete set of frequency samples ( amplitude and phase ) of a discrete signal @xmath2 of length @xmath3 .the goal is to reconstruct the full signal @xmath4 given only @xmath5 samples in the fourier domain where the \`\` visible frequencies '' are a subset @xmath6 ( of size @xmath5 ) of the set of all frequencies @xmath7 .    at first glance ,solving the underdetermined system of equations appears hopeless , as it is easy to make up examples for which it clearly can not be done . but suppose now that the signal @xmath4 is compressible , meaning that it essentially depends on a number of degrees of freedom which is smaller than @xmath3 . then in fact , accurate and sometimes exact recovery is possible by solving a simple convex optimization problem .( candes romberg and tao @xcite ) : assume that @xmath4 is @xmath8 -sparse , ( e.g. @xmath8 atomic charges in real space with @xmath3 resolution elements ) , and that we are given @xmath5 fourier coefficients with frequencies selected uniformly at random .suppose that the number of observations obeys @xmath9 .then minimizing @xmath10 reconstructs @xmath4 exactly with overwhelming probability . in particular , writing @xmath11 , then the probability of success exceeds @xmath12 .the theorem shows that a simple convex minimization will find the exact solution without any knowledge about the support , the number of nonzero coordinates of @xmath13 , their locations , and their amplitudes which we assume are all completely unknown a priori .following @xcite we formulate this more explicitly . the algorithm that optimizes the @xmath10 norm : latexmath:[ ] ] although this result describes only local convergence , it shows how a few wrong peaks can be recovered easily .27 l. pauling and m. d. shappell , zeits .* 75 * , 128 ( 1930 ) .bernal , i. fankuchen , m. f. perutz , \`\` an x - ray study of chymotrypsin and haemoglobin .

Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephropathy, with antioxidants significantly reducing the proteinuria. The temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and proteinuria was examined in this study. Rats were treated with a single IV injection of puromycin aminonucleoside, (PAN, 7.5 mg/kg) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior to sacrifice on days 3,5,7,10,17,27,41 (N = 5-10 per group). The kidneys were removed, flushed with ice cold TRIS buffer. Kidney cortices from each animal were used to prepare homogenates. Tissue lipid peroxidation was measured in whole homogenates as well as in lipid extracts from homogenates as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Proteinuria was evident at day 5, peaked at day 7 and persisted to day 27. Lipid peroxidation in homogenates was maximal at day 3 and declined rapidly to control levels by day 17. This study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the proteinuric injury in PAN nephropathy.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"oxygen\\", \\"puromycin aminonucleoside\\", \\"PAN\\", \\"thiobarbituric acid\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"nephropathy\\", \\"Proteinuria\\", \\"proteinuric injury\\", \\"proteinuria\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Cheese samples were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion to measure total phenolic conten t (TPC) and antioxidant activity of the cheese digesta, and to determine the catechin recovery after digestion by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Addition of catechin or green tea extract significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased TPC and antioxidant activity (measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen radical absorbance capacity) of the full-fat cheese without affecting pH or proximate composition. HPLC analysis confirmed retention of encapsulated catechins in the cheese curd; however, individual catechins were recovered in differing amounts (15-52%) from cheese digesta after 6 h of digestion. Transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy provided evidence for association of nanoliposomes with the surface of milk fat globules inside the cheese matrix. The study shows the potential for using cheese as a delivery vehicle for green tea antioxidants.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"ripened\\", \\"antioxidant activity\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"phenolic\\", \\"catechins\\", \\"green tea extract\\", \\"delivery vehicle\\", \\"(+)-Catechin\\", \\"green tea antioxidants\\", \\"milk fat globules\\", \\"liposomal\\", \\"green tea catechins\\", \\"nanoliposomes\\", \\"soy lecithin\\", \\"catechin\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [\\"full-fat cheese\\", \\"cheese curd\\", \\"cheese\\", \\"full-fat hard cheese\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"HPLC analysis\\", \\"HPLC\\", \\"oxygen radical absorbance capacity\\", \\"high performance liquid chromatography\\", \\"ferric reducing antioxidant power\\", \\"Transmission electron microscopy\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy\\", \\"simulated\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"surface\\", \\"matrix\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

It is characterized by oral mucosal burning and may be associated with dysgeusia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, and xerostomia.Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as an \\"intraoral burning or dysaesthetic sensation, recurring daily… more than 3 months, without clinically evident causative lesions\\" (IHS 2013).Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic orofacial pain disorder that is defined by a burning sensation in the oral mucosa.Burning mouth syndrome.Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings.Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning, painful sensation of the oral mucosa that most commonly involves the anterior tongue.Burning mouth syndrome is a complicated, poorly understood, predominantly oral condition that affects more than 1 million people in the United States.Burning mouth syndrome is a common disorder, usually affecting elderly females, characterised by intractable pain and burning in the oral cavity, evident especially in the tongue, together with a normal mouth mucosa.BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a disorder usually associated with an unexplained, prolonged sensation of burning inside the oral cavity.Burning mouth syndrome is an idiopathic pain disorder, which appears to be neuropathic in origin.Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a predominantly oral condition characterized by the occurrence of a chronic burning that commonly involves the anterior tongue, painful sensation, dryness and taste alterations.The burning mouth syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant sensation of burning in the oral cavity, without clinical signs.BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a disorder usually associated with an unexplained, prolonged sensation of burning inside the oral cavity.BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a burning sensation or stinging disorder affecting the oral mucosa in the absence of any clinical signs or mucosal lesions.Burning mouth syndrome is a chronic pain condition characterized by burning, painful sensations within the oral cavity.BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is common conditions that affects menopause women, patients suffer from sever burning sensation.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning pain in the tongue or other oral mucous membrane often associated with symptoms such as subjective dryness of the mouth, paraesthesia and altered taste for which no medical or dental cause can be found.When a burning sensation in the mouth is caused by local or systemic factors, it is called secondary burning mouth syndrome and when these factors are treated the pain will resolve.Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by an intense burning or stinging sensation, preferably on the tongue or in other areas of mouth.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic oral pain or burning sensation affecting the oral mucosa, often unaccompanied by mucosal lesions or other evident clinical signs.Burning mouth syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, which is used only after nutritional deficiencies, mucosal disease, fungal infections, hormonal disturbances and contact stomatitis have been ruled out.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic disease characterized by burning of the oral mucosa associated with a sensation of dry mouth and/or taste alterations.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning sensations of the oral cavity in the absence of abnormalities of the oral mucosa.Burning mouth syndrome generally presents as a triad: Mouth pain, alteration in taste, and altered salivation, in the absence of visible mucosal lesions in the mouth.We analyzed the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome and of the burning oral sensation and currently, we could not find a consensus on the diagnosis and classification of BMS.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is multifactorial in origin which is typically characterized by burning and painful sensation in an oral cavity demonstrating clinically normal mucosa.According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, burning mouth Syndrome (BMS) is defined as a burning pain in the tongue or other oral mucous membrane in the absence of clinical signs or laboratory findings.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by the presence of burning sensation of the oral mucosa in the absence of clinically apparent mucosal alterations.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) refers to a chronic orofacial pain disorder usually unaccompanied by mucosal lesions or other clinical signs of organic disease.Burning mouth syndrome may present as an idiopathic condition (primary BMS type) distinct from the symptom of oral burning that can potentially arise from various local or systemic abnormalities (secondary BMS type), including nutritional deficiencies, hormonal changes associated with menopause, local oral infections, denture-related lesions, xerostomia, hypersensitivity reactions, medications, and systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus.","answer":"Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS), a chronic intraoral burning sensation or dysesthesia without clinically evident causes, is one of the most common medically unexplained oral symptoms/syndromes. It predominately affects middle-aged women in the postmenopausal period. The condition is distinguished by burning symptoms of the oral mucosa and the absence of any clinical signs.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) has been analyzed by gel electrophoresis and by quantitative assay in an unselected sample of 1524 schoolboys from the province of Matera (Lucania) in southern Italy. We have identified 43 subjects with a G6PD variant. Of these, 31 had severe G6PD deficiency, nine had mild to moderate deficiency, and three had a non-deficient electrophoretic variant. The overall rate of G6PD deficiency was 2. 6%. The frequency of G6PD deficiency, ranging from 7. 2% on the Ionian Coast to zero on the eastern side of the Lucanian Apennines, appears to be inversely related to the distance of each town examined from the Ionian Coast, suggesting that this geographic distribution may reflect, at least in part, gene flow from Greek settlers. Biochemical characterization has shown that most of the G6PD deficiency in this population is accounted for by G6PD Mediterranean.

PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire, gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml. Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results. Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination. Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire, small testes and gynecomastia. Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. RESULTS: Testosterone was less than 3 ng./ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination. The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older). Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination. Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%). Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low testosterone, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. Prolactin exceeded 20 ng./ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination. Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered. These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng./ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, prolactinomas in 7, 0.38%). Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. (8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng./ml.). Testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination. However, cost-effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors. We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire, gynecomastia and/or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Bromocriptine\\", \\"testosterone heptylate\\", \\"Testosterone\\", \\"bromocriptine\\", \\"testosterone\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"gynecomastia\\", \\"hypothalamic dysfunction\\", \\"low sexual desire\\", \\"prolactinoma\\", \\"pituitary tumors\\", \\"hyperprolactinemia\\", \\"prolactinomas\\", \\"erectile dysfunction\\", \\"hypogonadism\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

In this research we investigate how meteorological conditions and air pollution, as concurring factors, impact COVID-19 transmission, using data on new confirmed cases from 219 prefecture cities from January 24 to February 29, 2020. Results revealed a kind of nonlinear dose-response relationship between temperature and coronavirus transmission. We also found that air pollution indicators are positively correlated with new confirmed cases, and the coronavirus further spreads by 5-7% as the AQI increases by 10 units. Further analysis based on regional divisions revealed that in northern China the negative effects of rising temperature on COVID-19 is counteracted by aggravated air pollution. In the southern cities, the ambient temperature and air pollution have a negative interactive effect on COVID-19 transmission, implying that rising temperature restrains the facilitating effects of air pollution and that they jointly lead to a decrease in new confirmed cases. These results provide implications for the control and prevention of this disease and for the anticipation of another possible pandemic.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\", \\"Transmission\\"]"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns? OBJECTIVE: Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth. The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates. METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns. Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36). RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups. Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group. CONCLUSION: In utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells. These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure. Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate's hearing acuity.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"smoking\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"hearing impairment\\", \\"hearing loss\\", \\"decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviour later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid- to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5–6 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2,5], and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2]. Text: It is now 6 weeks since Chinese health authorities announced the discovery of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1] causing a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the major transport hub of central China. The earliest human infections had occurred by early December 2019, and a large wet market in central Wuhan was linked to most, but not all, of the initial cases [2] . While evidence from the initial outbreak investigations seemed to suggest that 2019-nCoV could not easily spread between humans [3] , it is now very clear that infections have been spreading from person to person [2] . We recently estimated that more than 75,000 infections may have occurred in Wuhan as at 25 January 2020 [4] , and increasing numbers of infections continue to be detected in other cities in mainland China and around the world. A number of important characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection have already been identified, but in order to calibrate public health responses we need improved information on transmission dynamics, severity of the disease, immunity, and the impact of control and mitigation measures that have been applied to date. Infections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person, and in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days [2] . The serial interval was not precisely estimated, and a potentially shorter mean serial interval would have corresponded to a slightly lower basic reproductive number. Control measures and changes in population behaviour later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number. However, it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1 because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid-to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5-6 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days [2, 5] , and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average [2] . Chains of transmission have now been reported in a number of locations outside of mainland China. Within the coming days or weeks it will become clear whether sustained local transmission has been occurring in other cities outside of Hubei province in China, or in other countries. If sustained transmission does occur in other locations, it would be valuable to determine whether there is variation in transmissibility by location, for example because of different behaviours or control measures, or because of different environmental conditions. To address the latter, virus survival studies can be done in the laboratory to confirm whether there are preferred ranges of temperature or humidity for 2019-nCoV transmission to occur. In an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases of infection, 73% of cases with illness onset between 12 and 22 January reported no exposure to either a wet market or another person with symptoms of a respiratory illness [2] . The lack of reported exposure to another ill person could be attributed to lack of awareness or recall bias, but China's health minister publicly warned that pre-symptomatic transmission could be occurring [6] . Determining the extent to which asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission might be occurring is an urgent priority, because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control. Data on viral shedding dynamics could help in assessing duration of infectiousness. For severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset [7] , consistent with the peak in viral load at around that time  [8] . This allowed control of the SARS epidemic through prompt detection of cases and strict isolation. For influenza virus infections, virus shedding is highest on the day of illness onset and relatively higher from shortly before symptom onset until a few days after onset [9] . To date, transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV appear more similar to influenza, with contagiousness occurring around the time of symptom onset, rather than SARS. Transmission of respiratory viruses generally happens through large respiratory droplets, but some respiratory viruses can spread through fine particle aerosols [10] , and indirect transmission via fomites can also play a role. Coronaviruses can also infect the human gastrointestinal tract [11, 12] , and faecal-oral transmission might also play a role in this instance. The SARS-CoV superspreading event at Amoy Gardens where more than 300 cases were infected was attributed to faecal-oral, then airborne, spread through pressure differentials between contaminated effluent pipes, bathroom floor drains and flushing toilets [13] . The first large identifiable superspreading event during the present 2019-nCoV outbreak has apparently taken place on the Diamond Princess cruise liner quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan, with at least 130 passengers tested positive for 2019-nCoV as at 10 February 2020 [14] . Identifying which modes are important for 2019-nCoV transmission would inform the importance of personal protective measures such as face masks (and specifically which types) and hand hygiene. The first human infections were identified through a surveillance system for pneumonia of unknown aetiology, and all of the earliest infections therefore had Modelling studies incorporating healthcare capacity and processes pneumonia. It is well established that some infections can be severe, particularly in older adults with underlying medical conditions [15, 16] , but based on the generally mild clinical presentation of 2019-nCoV cases detected outside China, it appears that there could be many more mild infections than severe infections. Determining the spectrum of clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infections is perhaps the most urgent research priority, because it determines the strength of public health response required. If the seriousness of infection is similar to the 1918/19 Spanish influenza, and therefore at the upper end of severity scales in influenza pandemic plans, the same responses would be warranted for 2019-nCoV as for the most severe influenza pandemics. If, however, the seriousness of infection is similar to seasonal influenza, especially during milder seasons, mitigation measures could be tuned accordingly. Beyond a robust assessment of overall severity, it is also important to determine high risk groups. Infections would likely be more severe in older adults, obese individuals or those with underlying medical conditions, but there have not yet been reports of severity of infections in pregnant women, and very few cases have been reported in children [2] . Those under 18 years are a critical group to study in order to tease out the relative roles of susceptibility vs severity as possible underlying causes for the very rare recorded instances of infection in this age group. Are children protected from infection or do they not fall ill after infection? If they are naturally immune, which is unlikely, we should understand why; otherwise, even if they do not show symptoms, it is important to know if they shed the virus. Obviously, the question about virus shedding of those being infected but asymptomatic leads to the crucial question of infectivity. Answers to these questions are especially pertinent as basis for decisions on school closure as a social distancing intervention, which can be hugely disruptive not only for students but also because of its knock-on effect for child care and parental duties. Very few children have been confirmed 2019-nCoV cases so far but that does not necessarily mean that they are less susceptible or that they could not be latent carriers. Serosurveys in affected locations could inform this, in addition to truly assessing the clinical severity spectrum. Another question on susceptibility is regarding whether 2019-nCoV infection confers neutralising immunity, usually but not always, indicated by the presence of neutralising antibodies in convalescent sera. Some experts already questioned whether the 2019-nCoV may behave similarly to MERS-CoV in cases exhibiting mild symptoms without eliciting neutralising antibodies [17] . A separate question pertains to the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection or of disease [18, 19] . If either of these were to be relevant, the transmission dynamics could become more complex. A wide range of control measures can be considered to contain or mitigate an emerging infection such as 2019-nCoV. Internationally, the past week has seen an increasing number of countries issue travel advisories or outright entry bans on persons from Hubei province or China as a whole, as well as substantial cuts in flights to and from affected areas out of commercial considerations. Evaluation of these mobility restrictions can confirm their potential effectiveness in delaying local epidemics [20] , and can also inform when as well as how to lift these restrictions. If and when local transmission begins in a particular location, a variety of community mitigation measures can be implemented by health authorities to reduce transmission and thus reduce the growth rate of an epidemic, reduce the height of the epidemic peak and the peak demand on healthcare services, as well as reduce the total number of infected persons [21] . A number of social distancing measures have already been implemented in Chinese cities in the past few weeks including school and workplace closures. It should now be an urgent priority to quantify the effects of these measures and specifically whether they can reduce the effective reproductive number below 1, because this will guide the response strategies in other locations. During the 1918/19 influenza pandemic, cities in the United States, which implemented the most aggressive and sustained community measures were the most successful ones in mitigating the impact of that pandemic [22] . Similarly to international travel interventions, local social distancing measures should be assessed for their impact and when they could be safely discontinued, albeit in a coordinated and deliberate manner across China such that recrudescence in the epidemic curve is minimised. Mobile telephony global positioning system (GPS) data and location services data from social media providers such as Baidu and Tencent in China could become the first occasion when these data inform outbreak control in real time. At the individual level, surgical face masks have often been a particularly visible image from affected cities in China. Face masks are essential components of personal protective equipment in healthcare settings, and should be recommended for ill persons in the community or for those who care for ill persons. However, there is now a shortage of supply of masks in China and elsewhere, and debates are ongoing about their protective value for uninfected persons in the general community. The Table summarises research gaps to guide the public health response identified. In conclusion, there are a number of urgent research priorities to inform the public health response to the global spread of 2019-nCoV infections. Establishing robust estimates of the clinical severity of infections is probably the most pressing, because flattening out the surge in hospital admissions would be essential if there is a danger of hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients who require inpatient care, not only for those infected with 2019-nCoV but also for urgent acute care of patients with other conditions including those scheduled for procedures and operations. In addressing the research gaps identified here, there is a need for strong collaboration of a competent corps of epidemiological scientists and public health workers who have the flexibility to cope with the surge capacity required, as well as support from laboratories that can deliver on the ever rising demand for diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV and related sequelae. The readiness survey by Reusken et al. in this issue of Eurosurveillance testifies to the rapid response and capabilities of laboratories across Europe should the outbreak originating in Wuhan reach this continent [23] . In the medium term, we look towards the identification of efficacious pharmaceutical agents to prevent and treat what may likely become an endemic infection globally. Beyond the first year, one interesting possibility in the longer term, perhaps borne of wishful hope, is that after the first few epidemic waves, the subsequent endemic re-infections could be of milder severity. Particularly if children are being infected and are developing immunity hereafter, 2019-nCoV could optimistically become the fifth human coronavirus causing the common cold.

BACKGROUND: Activated platelets tether and activate myeloid leukocytes. To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA. Throughout the study period, CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes (flow cytometry) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients (mean + /-SE of fluorescence [ channels ] before PTCA: 77 + /-16 versus 35 + /-9; P =. 003). In vitro, thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes. Within 2 hours, this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL), 1 beta, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) -1 in unfractionated leukocytes. After 4 hours, IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 + /-36% and 210 + /-7%, respectively, and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 + /-8%. Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AMI, leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased. Binding of activated platelets induces IL-1 beta, IL-8, and MCP-1 in leukocytes. Our findings suggest that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"leukocytes\\", \\"activated platelets\\", \\"monocytes\\", \\"neutrophils\\", \\"thrombin - stimulated fixed platelets\\", \\"myeloid leukocytes\\", \\"Activated platelets\\", \\"thrombin - stimulated platelets\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"IL - 1 beta\\", \\"nuclear factor - kappa B\\", \\"interleukin (IL) , 1 beta\\", \\"MCP - 1\\", \\"anti - P selectin antibodies\\", \\"IL - 8\\", \\"monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1\\", \\"cytokine\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

The objective of this study was to assess the role of income level (IL) and the perception of older adults, regarding COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, on adopting stay-at-home preventive behavior during the first week of the outbreak in Mexico. Participants in this cross-sectional study were urban community dwellers, aged >/= 65 years from Mexico City. A total of 380 interviews were conducted over the phone. The mean respondent age was 72.9 years, and 76.1% were women. Over half (54.2%) of the participants perceived their susceptibility to COVID-19 as very low or low. Similarly, 33.4% perceived COVID-19 severity as being very low or low, and 57.6% had decided to stay at home: this behavior was associated with IL (beta = 1.05, p < 0.001), and its total effect was partially mediated (15.1%) by perceived severity. Educational attainment was also associated with staying at home (beta = 0.10, p = 0.018) and its total effect was partially mediated (15.0%) by perceived susceptibility.

An example of social network from GUESS 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  We study the topology of e-mail networks with e-mail addresses as nodes and e-mails as links using data from server log files. The resulting network exhibits a scale-free link distribution and pronounced small-world behavior, as observed in other social networks. These observations imply that the spreading of e-mail viruses is greatly facilitated in real e-mail networks compared to random architectures. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  'Six degrees of separation' is a cliche, as is 'it's a small world', both cliches of the language and cliches of everyone's experience. We all live in tightly bonded social networks, yet linked to vast numbers of other people more closely than we sometimes think. Only in recent years, however, have scientists begun to apply insights from the theoretical study of networks to understand forms of network as superficially different as social networks and electrical networks, computer networks and economic networks, and to show how common principles underlie them all. Duncan Watts explores the science of networks and its implications, ranging from the Dutch tulipmania of the 17th century to the success of Harry Potter, from the impact of September 11 on Manhattan to the brain of the sea-slug, from the processes that lead to stockmarket crashes to the structure of the world wide web. As stimulating and life-changing as James Gleick's Chaos, Six Degrees is a ground-breaking and important book. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  In recent years, the analysis and modeling of networks, and also networked dynamical systems, have been the subject of considerable interdisciplinary interest, yielding several hundred papers in physics, mathematics, computer science, biology, economics, and sociology journals (Newman 2003c), as well as a number of books (Barabasi 2002, Buchanan 2002, Watts 2003). Here I review the major findings of this emerging field and discuss briefly their relationship with previous work in the social and mathematical sciences. 4.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing. We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others — a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.Literature Review:","answer":"A small social network may be modeled by regular graphs such as that of a small world network BIB001 [6] BIB005 .

Subtraction images were automatically obtained by chemical shift imaging and dynamic studies. Each sequence was scored using a scale of 1 to 5 according to its ability to demonstrate margins separate from surrounding parenchyma. Breast parenchyma was evaluated as fatty and dense. The results were compared with the histopathologic results.(RESULTS) Twenty-eight (31.8%) of the lesions were localized in fatty breast, and the remaining 60 (68.2%) lesions were localized in dense breast. There were 34 (38.6%) benign and 54 (61.4%) malignant masses. In fatty breast, chemical shift subtraction and T1-weighted images were valuable both for the demonstration and differentiation of benign lesions (P<.05). None of the sequence was valuable for both the demonstration and differentiation of malignant lesions in fatty breasts (P>.05).

This reversible transition has relevance both in biology and materials science (e.g., ion-exchange columns and controlled release). Cation exchange plays a central role in many physiological processes such as storage and release of secretory products,19 tight packaging of DNA in the cell nucleus and within viruses,20 formation of membraneless organelles,21 cellular excitation,22 and muscle contraction.23 Systematic studies made on well-defined synthetic polyelectrolyte gels may lead to a better understanding of these biological processes and their underlying molecular mechanisms.8–12,17,18</p><p>Earlier we investigated Ca2+ induced volume transition in fully neutralized sodium polyacrylate (NaPA) gels at constant temperature. We found that (i) replacing Na+ ions by Ca2+ did not affect the elastic modulus of the gels, i.e., Ca2+ ions did not form cross-links between neighboring polymer chains,10 and (ii) the Flory–Huggins polymer–solvent interaction parameter (χ-parameter) gradually increased as the volume transition was approached, indicating the reduction of the thermodynamic quality of the diluent.10,17</p><p>These findings suggest that similarities might exist between ion- and temperature-induced transitions.</p><p>Surprisingly, certain aspects of the volume phase transition in gels have not yet been fully explored. For example, none of the previous studies addressed the effects of cross-link density, degree of neutralization of the network chains, and temperature on the volume transition in polyelectrolyte gels induced by varying the ratio of divalent to monovalent counterions in the equilibrium bath. In such systems ion exchange is superposed onto the elastic and mixing interactions.10</p><p>In this Letter we compare the effects of various factors on the volume transition induced by calcium/sodium cation exchange in NaPA gels. Specifically, we investigate the effects of the cross-link density of the gel, the concentration of the ionized groups of the network chains, the concentration of the monovalent salt (NaCl) in the equilibrium bath, and the temperature on the swelling degree of gels as a function of the CaCl2 concentration. Our objective is to examine whether the volume transition in NaPA gels exhibits similar and universal behavior.</p><p>Equilibrium swelling measurements were made on NaPA gels prepared by copolymerization of mixtures of acrylic acid and sodium acrylate monomers in aqueous solutions containing 30% (w/w) monomers and 0.04% (w/w) N,N′-methylene-bis(acrylamide) cross-linker at 95 °C. Ammonium persulfate (0.7 g/L) was used to initiate the polymerization reaction. A detailed description of the gel preparation process is given in ref 18.</p><p>Volume transition was induced in gel samples equilibrated with NaCl solutions by stepwise addition of CaCl2. The variation of the equilibrium swelling degree was measured as a function of the CaCl2 concentration in gels (i) made with different cross-link densities (160, 320, 800, and 1600 monomer units per cross-linker), (ii) containing different amounts of charged monomers (40 mol %, 70 mol % and 100 mol %), (iii) in equilibrium with NaCl solutions of different concentrations (10, 40, 100, and 200 mM), and (iv) at different temperatures (4, 25, 40, 50, and 55 °C). In each case the reversibility of the swelling/shrinking process was carefully checked by gradually decreasing/increasing the CaCl2 concentration in the surrounding bath. The collapsed gels always reswelled completely as the Ca2+ concentration was reduced in the bath.10</p><p>Figure 1 illustrates the dependence of the swelling degree q (= V/Vdry, where V and Vdry are the volumes of the swollen and dry networks, respectively) of NaPA gels as a function of the CaCl2 concentration, c, at constant NaCl concentration in the surrounding solution. All the curves exhibit similar behavior. (Vdry was determined gravimetrically in the absence of water and added salt.) Introducing CaCl2 gradually reduces q, and at a threshold concentration, c0, a sudden volume change occurs. The ionized form of the NaPA is hydrophilic because of the presence of negatively charged carboxyl groups. Adsorbed Ca2+ ions gradually reduce the hydrophilic character of the NaPA molecule. At a certain threshold concentration of the Ca2+ ions, NaPA precipitates because the uncharged polymer is hydrophobic and does not dissolve in water.</p><p>The similarity of the swelling curves suggests that the transition is the result of the competition between mono- and divalent counterions for the charged groups on the polymer chains. Volume transition takes place when the concentration of CaCl2 exceeds c0. However, the shape of the individual curves strongly depends on the cross-link density (Figure 1a), the concentration of the ionized groups of the network chains (Figure 1b), the concentration of the NaCl in the surrounding solution (Figure 1c), and the temperature (Figure 1d).</p><p>Figure 1a shows that increasing the cross-link density practically does not affect c0 but significantly reduces q. The reduction of q reflects that the swelling ability of the gels decreases as the average length of the network chains decreases. Decreasing the concentration of the charged groups on the polymer molecules shifts the transition toward higher CaCl2 concentrations (Figure 1b), and the difference between q in the swollen and collapsed states gradually decreases. Interestingly, the degree of swelling slightly decreases with increasing amount of ionized groups. This effect is fully reproducible and may reflect increased screening of charge–charge interactions. Gels made with less charged monomers (≤40 mol %) do not exhibit a sharp volume transition. Large excess of NaCl over CaCl2 also prevents discontinuous volume transition (Figure 1c). In the present system the threshold concentration is ~200 mM NaCl. Above this NaCl concentration q decreases continuously with increasing CaCl2 concentration. The absence of a sudden transition resembles the behavior of neutral polymer gels when the solvent quality decreases. As the temperature increases, q decreases and the volume transition occurs at lower Ca2+ concentration (Figure 1d). The latter observation indicates that NaPA exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), typical of aqueous solutions of neutral polymers.24</p><p>In what follows, we make an attempt to describe the behavior of the volume transition induced by divalent–monovalent ion exchange in polyelectrolyte gels using the classical Flory–Rehner network model.25,26 According to this model the equilibrium condition is given as(1)Aν*V1q−1/3−Bν*V1q−1−A2q−2−A3q−3=0where A and B are constants, which depend on the topology of the network, e.g., functionality of the cross-links;25ν* is the concentration of the elastic chains in the dry network; V1 is the partial molar volume of the solvent; A2 and A3 are the second and third virial coefficients, respectively. The second virial coefficient is a measure of the polymer–solvent interaction. In good solvent conditions A2 > 0, and in poor solvent conditions A2 < 0. In an ideal (Θ) solvent, i.e., in the absence of excluded volume interaction, A2 = 0. We note that eq 1 is the simplest model to describe gel swelling. In polyelectrolyte gels an additional term taking into account the electrostatic interactions (Donnan contribution) is also present. However, recent molecular dynamics simulations indicated that in the presence of added salt this additional term is negligible, because cancellation arises between the electrostatic contribution and the counterion excluded volume contribution to the free energy.27 Indeed, this finding is consistent with experimental observations made on various polyelectrolyte gel systems.10,11,28–30 We note that more recent theories provide further details, but they contain more parameters which cannot be determined experimentally or estimated from molecular considerations.7,15,16</p><p>In neutral polymer solutions, near the Θ temperature, A2=(12−χ)=uτ, where χ is the polymer–solvent interaction parameter, u the excluded volume parameter, τ(=T−ΘΘ) the reduced temperature, and Θ the Θ-temperature. At the Θ-temperature the attractive and repulsive forces are balanced and A2 = 0. A3 is supposed to be affected by the chain flexibility.31</p><p>In the present gels, however, volume transition occurs at constant temperature as the Ca2+ ion concentration increases. Because the volume transition induced by divalent–monovalent ion exchange resembles the transition caused by changing the temperature,10,11 it is conceivable to assume that A2 is proportional to the reduced concentration, defined as cr(=c−c0c0, where c0 is the ion concentration at the transition). In general, A3 may depend on the concentration and composition of the equilibrium salt solution (e.g., the ratio of divalent to monovalent counterions). For example, multivalent counterions may affect the stiffness of the polymer chains.32,33 However, at high degrees of swelling (q > 10) the contribution of the last (third-order) term in eq 1 is very small. Thus, for highly swollen gels it is reasonable to use A3 ≈ constant.</p><p>At A2 = 0 the quadratic term in eq 1 vanishes. Thus, we have(2)Aν*V1q0−1/3−Bν*V1q0−1−A3q0−3=0where q0 is the swelling degree of the gel at A2 = 0. Combining eqs 1 and 2 yields(3)Q5/3−Q−1+κ(Q5/3−Q)=Ψq0where Q=qq0, κ=Bν*V1q02A3, and Ψ=A2A3. Ψ can be rewritten in the form Ψ=αq0cr and we obtain(4)Q5/3−Q−1+κ(Q5/3−Q)=αcrwhere κ and α are dimensionless constants for homologous networks.</p><p>Equation 4 predicts that Q is the function of the scaled variable, cr, only. It also captures the transition from discontinuous to continuous volume changes as κ is varied. This is illustrated in Figure 2, where for κ < 45 the swelling degree decreases continuously, while for κ > 45 a sharp transition takes place.</p><p>Previous observations have shown that most of the Na+ counterions in NaPA gels are replaced by Ca2+ ions at much lower CaCl2 concentration than needed to induce volume transition, and in the gels the divalent ion concentration is more than 1 order of magnitude greater than in the equilibrium solution.12,17 It has also been demonstrated that divalent ions do not form permanent cross-links (ion-bridges) between neighboring polymer molecules.18,27 Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that divalent–monovalent ion exchange primarily affects the shape of the experimental Q versus cr curves by modifying the thermodynamic interactions (A2) in the system.</p><p>In Figure 3 calculated curves are shown to illustrate the effect of cross-link density (a) and that of the concentration of charged groups of the network chains (b) on the shape of the q versus c curves. Figure 3a depicts the effect of cross-link density (by varying Aν*V1 and Bν*V1). It can be seen that q decreases with increasing cross-link density but the volume transition of the gels occurs at the same CaCl2 concentration. This behavior is expected because the polymer–solvent interaction is practically unaffected by the presence of cross-links. Figure 3b shows the corresponding curves for gels containing different number of charged groups. The figure illustrates that the volume transition is shifted toward lower CaCl2 concentrations with increasing concentration of charged groups. The dashed curves show the unstable region of the q–c phase diagram; in this region, a polymer solution eventually separates into two distinct phases, namely, a polymer-poor and a polymer-rich phase (spinodal decomposition). In gels, however, cross-links prevent macroscopic phase separation, and the low- and high-concentration domains coexist.34Figure 3b also captures the situations illustrated in Figure 1c,d, because varying either the monovalent salt concentration or the temperature modifies the mixing free energy term. It is also important to note that the present formalism is applicable only for the swollen state of the gels; in the collapsed regime the polymer concentration is high and higher-order terms/specific interactions may also play a role (e.g., effect of calcium ions on A3).</p><p>Upon replotting the dependencies, shown in Figure 3a,b, in terms of reduced variables Q = q/q0 (y-axis) vs cr/(q0c) (x-axis), all curves collapse onto a single master curve (Figure 3c).</p><p>In Figure 4 we applied the same normalization procedure to the experimental swelling data displayed in Figure 1a–d. Here q0 is the swelling degree measured in the swollen state at which the volume transition occurs. Clearly, rescaling the data eliminates differences arising from nonuniversal factors and yields good agreement between measurements made under various experimental conditions. This finding implies that addition of CaCl2 primarily affects gel swelling by changing the thermodynamic quality of the solvent (mixing free energy contribution). Consequently, the universal dependence shown in Figure 4 remains unchanged.</p><p>In summary, changes of the cross-link density, the concentration of charged groups on the network chains, the salt concentration in the surrounding bath, and the temperature have a qualitatively similar effect on the volume transition induced by divalent–monovalent counterion exchange in weakly cross-linked NaPA hydrogels. Addition of CaCl2 reduces q, and above a critical concentration of Ca2+ ions a reversible volume transition takes place. However, the shape of the individual curves depends on the cross-link density, the amount of the charged groups of the polymer, the concentration of the monovalent (NaCl) salt in the equilibrium solution, and the temperature.</p><p>Normalization of the swelling data by variables such as the degree of swelling and the CaCl2 concentration at which the transition occurs leads to superposition of all data obtained under different experimental conditions; that is, in the present polyelectrolyte gels the reversible volume transition caused by divalent–monovalent ion exchange exhibits universal behavior.</p>","answer":"Introduction of high valence counterions into polyelectrolyte gels results in a reversible volume phase transition. In the present work new experimental results are reported for the volume transition induced by calcium/sodium exchange in sodium polyacrylate gels. The effects of cross-link density, concentration of ionized groups on the network chains, composition of the equilibrium salt solution containing both mono- and divalent cations, and temperature on the swelling degree of these gels are systematically investigated. It is demonstrated that the normalized swelling data fall on a master curve, indicating that the ion-exchange-induced volume transition exhibits universal behavior in sodium polyacrylate gels. Model calculations made on the basis of the classical Floryxe2x80x93Rehner theory are in reasonable agreement with the measured dependencies."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Anergy is a major mechanism to ensure antigen-specific tolerance in T lymphocytes in the adult. In vivo, anergy has mainly been studied at the cellular level. In this study, we used the T-cell-activating superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) to investigate molecular mechanisms of T-lymphocyte anergy in vivo. Injection of SEA to adult mice activates CD4 + T cells expressing certain T-cell receptor (TCR) variable region beta-chain families and induces strong and rapid production of interleukin 2 (IL-2). In contrast, repeated injections of SEA cause CD4 + T-cell deletion and anergy in the remaining CD4 + T cells, characterized by reduced expression of IL-2 at mRNA and protein levels. We analyzed expression of AP-1, NF-kappa B, NF-AT, and octamer binding transcription factors, which are known to be involved in the regulation of IL-2 gene promoter activity. Large amounts of AP-1 and NF-kappa B and significant quantities of NF-AT were induced in SEA-activated CD4 + spleen T cells, whereas Oct-1 and Oct-2 DNA binding activity was similar in both resting and activated T cells. In contrast, anergic CD4 + T cells contained severely reduced levels of AP-1 and Fos / Jun-containing NF-AT complexes but expressed significant amounts of NF-kappa B and Oct binding proteins after SEA stimulation. Resolution of the NF-kappa B complex demonstrated predominant expression of p50-p65 heterodimers in activated CD4 + T cells, while anergic cells mainly expressed the transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer. These alterations of transcription factors are likely to be responsible for repression of IL-2 in anergic T cells.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"SEA - activated CD4 + spleen T cells\\", \\"anergized CD4 + T cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"anergic CD4 + T cells\\", \\"CD4 + T cells\\", \\"T cells\\", \\"T lymphocytes\\", \\"anergic T cells\\", \\"activated CD4 + T cells\\", \\"activated T cells\\", \\"CD4 + T - cell\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"p50 homodimer\\", \\"NF - AT\\", \\"Fos / Jun - containing NF - AT complexes\\", \\"p50 - p65 heterodimers\\", \\"Oct binding proteins\\", \\"NF - kappa B complex\\", \\"T - cell - activating superantigen\\", \\"CD4 + T - cell deletion\\", \\"SEA\\", \\"T - cell receptor (TCR) variable region beta - chain families\\", \\"octamer binding transcription factors\\", \\"AP - 1\\", \\"staphylococcal enterotoxin A\\", \\"NF - kappa B\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"transcription factors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

By parameters @math and @math , this model controls degree-dependent hopping of packets and forwarding of packets with higher performance at more busy nodes. Through a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we derive the condition for the concentration of packets at a few hubs. In particular, we show that the optimal @math and @math are involved in the trade-off between a detour path for @math ; In the low-performance regime at a small @math , the wandering path for @math and @math is small, neither the wandering long path with short wait trapped at nodes ( @math ), nor the short hopping path with long wait trapped at hubs ( @math ) is advisable. A uniformly random walk ( @math ) yields slightly better performance. We also discuss the congestion phenomena in a more complicated situation with packet generation at each time step.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We numerically investigate jamming transitions in complex heterogeneous networks. Inspired by Internet routing protocols, we study a general model that incorporates local traffic information through a tunable parameter. The results show that whether the transition from a low-traffic regime to a congested phase is of first- or second-order type is determined by the protocol at work. The microscopic dynamics reveals that these two radically different behaviors are due to the way in which traffic jams propagate through the network. Our results are discussed in the context of Internet dynamics and other transport processes that take place on complex networks and provide insights for the design of routing policies based on traffic awareness in communication systems.[2]: We propose a routing strategy to improve the transportation efficiency on complex networks. Instead of using the routing strategy for shortest path, we give a generalized routing algorithm to find the so-called efficient path, which considers the possible congestion in the nodes along actual paths. Since the nodes with the largest degree are very susceptible to traffic congestion, an effective way to improve traffic and control congestion, as our strategy, can be redistributing traffic load in central nodes to other noncentral nodes. Simulation results indicate that the network capability in processing traffic is improved more than 10 times by optimizing the efficient path, which is in good agreement with the analysis. DOI: 10.1103 PhysRevE.73.046108 PACS numbers: 89.75.Hc Since the seminal work on scale-free networks by Barabasi and Albert BA model1 and on the small-world phenomenon by Watts and Strogatz 2, the structure and dynamics of complex networks have recently attracted a tremendous amount of interest and attention from the physics community see the review papers 3‐5 and references therein. The increasing importance of large communication networks such as the Internet 6, upon which our society survives, calls for the need for high efficiency in handling and delivering information. In this light, to find optimal strategies for traffic routing is one of the important issues we have to address. There have been many previous studies to understand and control traffic congestion on networks, with a basic assumption that the network has a homogeneous structure 7‐11. However, many real networks display both scale-free and small-world features, and thus it is of great interest to study the effect of network topology on traffic flow and the effect of traffic on network evolution. present a formalism that can cope simultaneously with the searching and traffic dynamics in parallel transportation systems 12. This formalism can be used to optimize network structure under a local search algorithm, while to obtain the formalism one should know the global information of the whole networks. Holme and Kim provide an in-depth analysis on the vertex edge overload cascading breakdowns based on evolving networks, and suggest a method to avoid[3]: networks. The strategy is governed by a single parameter. Simulation results show that maximizing the network capacity and reducing the packet travel time can generate an optimal parameter value. Compared with the strategy of adopting exclusive local static information, the new strategy shows its advantages in improving the efficiency of the system. The detailed analysis of the mixing strategy is provided for explaining its effects on traffic routing. The work indicates that effectively utilizing the larger degree nodes plays a key role in scalefree traffic systems.[4]: We define a minimal model of traffic flows in complex networks in order to study the trade-off between topological-based and traffic-based routing strategies. The resulting collective behavior is obtained analytically for an ensemble of uncorrelated networks and summarized in a rich phase diagram presenting second-order as well as first-order phase transitions between a free-flow phase and a congested phase. We find that traffic control improves global performance, enlarging the free-flow region in parameter space only in heterogeneous networks. Traffic control introduces nonlinear effects and, beyond a critical strength, may trigger the appearance of a congested phase in a discontinuous manner. The model also reproduces the crossover in the scaling of traffic fluctuations empirically observed on the Internet.","answer":"Other routing schemes [3] [1] [4] have also been considered, taking into account lengths of both the routing path and of the queue.
