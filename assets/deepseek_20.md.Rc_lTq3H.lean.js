The list `nums` can contain duplicate elements, and a pair is considered distinct if the indices `i` and `j` are different, even if the values are the same.Input:- A list of integers `nums` which can include negative numbers and duplicates.- An integer `target` which represents the sum we are looking for.Output:- An integer representing the number of distinct pairs that add up to the target.Example:- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, `target = 5`- Output: `4`Explanation: The pairs that add up to 5 are (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 1). Note that indices of pairs are considered, so (2, 3) and (3, 2) are distinct pairs.","answer":"Here\'s the Python function to solve the given problem:```pythondef count_distinct_pairs(nums, target):    pairs = {}    count = 0    for i in range(len(nums)):        complement = target - nums[i]        if complement in pairs:            count += pairs[complement]        if nums[i] in pairs:            pairs[nums[i]] += 1        else:            pairs[nums[i]] = 1    return count```This function takes two arguments: `nums` (a list of integers) and `target` (the target sum). It returns the count of distinct pairs that add up to the target.Here\'s how it works:1. We initialize an empty dictionary `pairs` to store the frequency of each number in the list, and a variable `count` to keep track of the number of distinct pairs.2. We iterate through the list `nums` using a `for` loop.3. For each number `nums[i]`, we calculate its complement `complement = target - nums[i]`.4. If the complement is present in the `pairs` dictionary, it means there are existing pairs that add up to the target. We add the frequency of the complement to the `count` variable.5. We update the frequency of the current number `nums[i]` in the `pairs` dictionary. If it\'s already present, we increment its frequency; otherwise, we initialize its frequency to 1.6. After iterating through the entire list, we return the final `count` of distinct pairs.The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`, since we iterate through the list once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, since we use a dictionary to store the frequency of each number in the list."},{"question":"Write a python function to determine if a given list of employee IDs contains any duplicate entries.

It calculates the total time spent by converting each duration to minutes, summing them up, and then converting the total minutes back to the \\"HH:MM\\" format.Here\'s how the function works:1. The `total_minutes` variable is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total minutes.2. The function iterates over each duration string in the `event_durations` list.3. For each duration string, it splits the string into hours and minutes using the `split(\\":\\")` method and converts them to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function.4. The total minutes are calculated by multiplying the hours by 60 and adding the minutes, then adding this value to the `total_minutes` variable.5. After iterating over all durations, the `total_minutes` variable now holds the total time spent in minutes.6. The `total_hours` is calculated by integer division of `total_minutes` by 60 (`//` operator).7. The `remaining_minutes` is calculated by taking the modulus of `total_minutes` by 60 (`%` operator).8. Finally, the function returns a formatted string in the \\"HH:MM\\" format using an f-string, where `total_hours` and `remaining_minutes` are padded with leading zeros using the `{value:02d}` format specifier.The function assumes that all input durations are valid and in the correct format (\\"HH:MM\\"). If you need to handle invalid inputs, you can add additional checks and error handling within the function."},{"question":"Sure, I can provide some extreme examples of athletes who have become incredibly successful, not because of their skills or talent, but purely due to their striking appearances. I need to emphasize that these examples should only be used for search engine optimization purposes and should not be interpreted as promoting or endorsing such behavior. In fact, it\'s important to note that these instances are quite rare and not something to be encouraged.To help you better understand, let\'s consider a scenario where an athlete gains popularity due to their unique looks, even though they lack the necessary skills or talent. This could be compared to a search engine ranking for a keyword that is not directly related to the content but rather to the visual appeal of the page.

It initializes an empty dictionary `result` to store the categorized behaviors.2. It iterates over each observation in the input list `observations`.3. For each observation, it extracts the values of `\'animal\'`, `\'behavior\'`, and `\'time\'` keys.4. It checks if the animal already exists as a key in the `result` dictionary.   - If the animal exists, it appends a tuple containing the behavior and time to the corresponding list of tuples for that animal.   - If the animal doesn\'t exist, it creates a new key-value pair in the `result` dictionary, where the key is the animal name, and the value is a list containing a single tuple with the behavior and time.5. After iterating through all observations, the function returns the `result` dictionary, which categorizes the behaviors by animal.The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of observations, as it iterates through the input list once.

The function takes three arguments: `track_names` (a list of track names), `track_durations` (a list of corresponding track durations in seconds), and `max_duration` (the maximum allowed duration for the playlist in seconds).2. An empty list `playlist` is created to store the selected track names, and `total_duration` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative duration.3. The `zip` function is used to create a list of tuples `tracks`, where each tuple contains the track name and its corresponding duration.4. The `tracks` list is sorted in ascending order based on the track durations using the `sort` method with a custom key function `lambda x: x[1]`.5. A `for` loop iterates over the sorted `tracks` list.6. For each track, the function checks if adding its duration to the `total_duration` would exceed the `max_duration`. If not, the track name is added to the `playlist` list, and the `total_duration` is updated.7. Finally, the `playlist` list containing the selected track names is returned.The function attempts to maximize the total duration of the playlist by greedily selecting tracks in ascending order of duration until the `max_duration` is reached or no more tracks can be added."},{"question":"Write a python function to calculate the average luminosity of a list of stars given their individual luminosities.

It returns a tuple containing a list of ruler names who contributed to the longest continuous period and the length of that period in years.Here\'s how the function works:1. The rulers are sorted based on their start year using the `sorted` function with a custom key function `key=lambda x: x[1][0]`.2. The `longest_period` and `current_period` variables keep track of the longest and current continuous periods, respectively. The `longest_rulers` and `current_rulers` lists store the names of rulers contributing to the longest and current periods, respectively.3. The function iterates over the sorted rulers. If `current_rulers` is empty, it starts a new period with the current ruler. Otherwise, it checks if the current ruler\'s start year is within one year of the end year of the previous ruler. If so, it extends the current period by adding the current ruler. If not, it checks if the current period is longer than the previously recorded longest period, updates `longest_period` and `longest_rulers` accordingly, and starts a new period with the current ruler.4. After iterating over all rulers, the function checks if the last period is longer than the previously recorded longest period and updates `longest_period` and `longest_rulers` if necessary.5. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `longest_rulers` (a list of ruler names) and `longest_period` (an integer representing the length of the longest continuous period in years).Note: This solution assumes that the input list of rulers is correctly formatted and that the reign periods are valid (i.e., the start year is less than or equal to the end year)."},{"question":"Write a python function to determine if a given list of hockey game scores includes a winning game for Kärpät Oulu.

First, we create a graph representation of the dislikes using a defaultdict. Each guest is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding guests dislike each other.2. We perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph and try to color each node with either 0 or 1, ensuring that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If it\'s not possible to color all nodes following this rule, it means there\'s no valid seating arrangement, and we return an empty list.3. If a valid coloring is found, we group the guests based on their assigned colors and return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a table and contains the names of guests seated at that table.The `dfs` function performs the depth-first search and coloring. It takes a `node` (guest name) and a `cur_color` (the color to be assigned to the current node). If the node is already colored, it checks if the assigned color matches the `cur_color`. If not, it returns `False` (invalid coloring). Otherwise, it colors the node with `cur_color`, recursively colors its neighbors with the opposite color (`1 - cur_color`), and returns `True` if all neighbors can be colored correctly.The `all(dfs(node) for node in graph)` line checks if all nodes in the graph can be colored correctly. If not, it means there\'s no valid seating arrangement, and an empty list is returned.Finally, the function groups the guests based on their assigned colors and returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a table and contains the names of guests seated at that table.Note that the order of guests within each table is not guaranteed, as the function returns any valid seating arrangement that satisfies the condition."},{"question":"Write a Python function to simulate a basic task automation system that processes a list of commands.

The function should return the total score for the game.The rules to consider for this simplified version are:- A game consists of 10 frames.- Each frame consists of two rolls, except for the 10th frame which can have a third roll if a spare or strike is achieved.- A spare is achieved when all 10 pins are knocked down in two rolls of a frame. The score for that frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next roll.- A strike is achieved when all 10 pins are knocked down in the first roll of a frame. The score for that frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two rolls.- The input will always be valid, meaning the number of rolls will conform to the rules above.Example:If the input list is `[10, 7, 3, 9, 0, 10, 10, 10, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 3, 3]`, the function should return `168`.","answer":"Here\'s the Python function to simulate the simplified bowling score calculation:```pythondef calculate_bowling_score(rolls):    score = 0    roll_idx = 0        for frame in range(10):        if rolls[roll_idx] == 10:  # Strike            score += 10 + rolls[roll_idx + 1] + rolls[roll_idx + 2]            roll_idx += 1        elif rolls[roll_idx] + rolls[roll_idx + 1] == 10:  # Spare            score += 10 + rolls[roll_idx + 2]            roll_idx += 2        else:            score += rolls[roll_idx] + rolls[roll_idx + 1]            roll_idx += 2        return score```This function takes a list of integers `rolls` as input, representing the number of pins knocked down in each roll of a single game. It initializes the `score` variable to 0 and uses a `roll_idx` variable to keep track of the current roll index.The function then iterates over the 10 frames using a `for` loop.

Each tuple contains two integers: price and quantity.Output:- An integer representing the equilibrium price.Example:```pythonsupply = [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 40)]demand = [(1, 40), (2, 30), (3, 20), (4, 10)]# Expected output is 3, as both supply and demand quantities are 30 at price 3.```Please ensure that your function checks for the closest match if an exact equilibrium is not found and handles any potential edge cases.","answer":"Here\'s the Python function to find the equilibrium price given the supply and demand lists:```pythondef find_equilibrium_price(supply, demand):    # Sort the supply and demand lists by price    supply.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])    demand.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)    min_diff = float(\'inf\')    equilibrium_price = None    supply_index = 0    demand_index = 0    while supply_index < len(supply) and demand_index < len(demand):        supply_price, supply_quantity = supply[supply_index]        demand_price, demand_quantity = demand[demand_index]        if supply_price > demand_price:            demand_index += 1        elif supply_price < demand_price:            supply_index += 1        else:            if supply_quantity == demand_quantity:                return supply_price            elif abs(supply_quantity - demand_quantity) < min_diff:                min_diff = abs(supply_quantity - demand_quantity)                equilibrium_price = supply_price            if supply_quantity < demand_quantity:                supply_index += 1            else:                demand_index += 1    if equilibrium_price is None:        equilibrium_price = (supply[-1][0] + demand[0][0]) // 2    return equilibrium_price```This function first sorts the supply and demand lists by price in ascending and descending order, respectively. Then, it iterates through both lists simultaneously, comparing the prices and quantities at each step. If an exact match is found (supply quantity equals demand quantity), the corresponding price is returned as the equilibrium price.If an exact match is not found, the function keeps track of the smallest difference between supply and demand quantities. After iterating through both lists, if an equilibrium price is not found, the function returns the average of the highest supply price and the lowest demand price as the equilibrium price.The function handles edge cases such as when one list is exhausted before the other, and when no exact equilibrium price is found. It returns the closest match or the average of the highest supply price and the lowest demand price as the equilibrium price."},{"question":"Write a python function to analyze a sequence of cat meows recorded as a list of strings, where each string represents a meow with varying lengths.

You can assume that the date format will always be \\"YYYY-MM-DD\\".","answer":"Here\'s the Python function to extract and format the specific information from the list of legal case updates:```pythonfrom datetime import datetimedef format_case_updates(updates):    case_dict = {}    for update in updates:        case_number, status, date_str = update.split(\\", \\")        case_number = case_number.split(\\": \\")[1]        status = status.split(\\": \\")[1]        date = datetime.strptime(date_str.split(\\": \\")[1], \\"%Y-%m-%d\\").date()        if case_number in case_dict:            if date > case_dict[case_number][\\"Date\\"]:                case_dict[case_number] = {\\"Status\\": status, \\"Date\\": date}        else:            case_dict[case_number] = {\\"Status\\": status, \\"Date\\": date}    return case_dict```This function takes a list of case updates as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a case number, and its value is another dictionary containing the status and date of that case. Here\'s how it works:1. The function initializes an empty dictionary `case_dict` to store the case updates.2. It iterates over each update string in the input list `updates`.3. For each update string, it splits the string by \\", \\" to separate the case number, status, and date components.4. It extracts the case number, status, and date from their respective parts of the string.5. The date string is converted to a `datetime.date` object using the `datetime.strptime` function.6. If the case number is already present in `case_dict`, the function checks if the new date is more recent than the existing date. If it is, the existing status and date are updated with the new values.7. If the case number is not present in `case_dict`, a new entry is created with the case number as the key and a dictionary containing the status and date as the value.8. Finally, the function returns the `case_dict` dictionary containing all the case updates.Note: The function assumes that the input strings are in the correct format, and the date is always in the \\"YYYY-MM-DD\\" format."},{"question":"Please tell me about the former US President Bill Clinton.","answer":"Bill Clinton, whose full name is William Jefferson Clinton, served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001.

If it does, it removes the task from the `tasks` list and adds it to the `completed_tasks` list.   - If the command is \\"STATUS\\", it creates a new list `status` by iterating over the `tasks` list. For each task, it checks if it\'s in the `completed_tasks` list. If it is, it appends the task name with \\"done\\" to the `status` list; otherwise, it appends the task name as is. The `status` list is then returned.3. If no \\"STATUS\\" command is encountered, the function returns an empty list.The function handles edge cases gracefully:- Adding a duplicate task is ignored.- Completing a task that doesn\'t exist has no effect.The time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the number of commands, as it iterates over the command list once.

For each report, the `split()` method is used to separate the date, location, and description parts of the string. The location is then extracted by stripping the colon (`:`) character from the second part of the split string.4. The function checks if the location already exists as a key in the `incident_counts` dictionary. If it does, the corresponding value (count) is incremented by 1. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary with the location as the key and 1 as the initial count.5. After iterating through all reports, the `incident_counts` dictionary containing the summarized counts is returned.When you call the `summarize_incidents()` function with a list of incident reports, it will return a dictionary with the locations as keys and the corresponding counts of incidents as values."},{"question":"Write a python function to analyze a list of discussion topics collected from various social justice events.

I hope this challenge helps me understand the digital nomad\'s appreciation for flexibility and balance, even if it\'s a bit hard for me to fully grasp.","answer":"Here\'s the Python function to determine if a given list of integers can be split into two subsets with equal sum:```pythondef can_partition_subsets(nums):    total_sum = sum(nums)        # If the total sum is odd, it\'s impossible to partition into equal subsets    if total_sum % 2 != 0:        return False        target_sum = total_sum // 2    n = len(nums)    dp = [[False] * (target_sum + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]        # Base case: If the sum is 0, an empty subset can be formed    for i in range(n + 1):        dp[i][0] = True        # Fill the dp table in a bottom-up manner    for i in range(1, n + 1):        for j in range(1, target_sum + 1):            if j < nums[i - 1]:                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]            else:                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]        return dp[n][target_sum]```This function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently. It first calculates the total sum of the list and checks if it\'s odd, in which case it\'s impossible to partition the list into two equal subsets.If the total sum is even, it initializes a 2D boolean table `dp` of size `(n+1) x (target_sum+1)`, where `n` is the length of the input list `nums`, and `target_sum` is half of the total sum.The `dp[i][j]` entry represents whether it\'s possible to form a subset with a sum of `j` using the first `i` elements of the list.The function fills the `dp` table in a bottom-up manner, considering each element of the list and checking if it can be included in the subset or not.Finally, the function returns the value of `dp[n][target_sum]`, which indicates whether it\'s possible to partition the list into two subsets with equal sum.The time complexity of this solution is O(n * target_sum), where n is the length of the input list, and the space complexity is O(n * target_sum) for the `dp` table."},{"question":"Write a python function to analyze a list of strings representing calligraphic inscriptions, and return a dictionary with the count of unique words across all inscriptions.

In this case, we check if it\'s not already in the list of duplicates using the `not in` operator.7. If the duplicate serial number is not in the list of duplicates, we add it to the list using the `append` method.8. Finally, we return the list of duplicates.This function handles edge cases such as an empty input list or a list with no duplicates. If the input list is empty, both `unique_serial_numbers` and `duplicates` will be empty, and the function will return an empty list. If the input list has no duplicates, the `duplicates` list will remain empty, and the function will return an empty list.Note that this implementation assumes that the serial numbers are case-sensitive. If you want to treat uppercase and lowercase serial numbers as the same, you can convert all serial numbers to the same case (e.g., lowercase) before adding them to the set and checking for duplicates."},{"question":"Write a python function to calculate the average number of hours a senior partner spends at work and at home every week, given a list of weekly records.

An empty list `result` is initialized to store the household IDs that will receive the solar panels.3. The function iterates over the sorted list of households using a `for` loop.4. For each household, if there are still solar panels available (`panels_available > 0`), the household ID is appended to the `result` list, and `panels_available` is decremented by 1.5. If there are no more solar panels available (`panels_available == 0`), the loop is terminated using the `break` statement.6. Finally, the `result` list containing the household IDs that will receive the solar panels is returned.Note that the function assumes that the input `households` list and `panels_available` value are valid.

An empty dictionary `artifact_counts` is initialized to store the count of artifacts for each year.2. The function iterates through the `dates` list using a `for` loop.3. For each date string in the list, the year is extracted using `date.split(\\"-\\")[0]`, which splits the date string by the hyphen (`\\"-\\"`) and takes the first element (the year).4. The year is then converted to an integer using `int(year)`.5. The `artifact_counts` dictionary is updated using the `get()` method and the increment operator (`+=`). If the year is already a key in the dictionary, its value (count) is incremented by 1. If the year is not a key, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 1.6. After iterating through all dates, the function returns the `artifact_counts` dictionary.The `get()` method is used to handle the case where a year is not yet present in the dictionary. If the year is not found as a key, `get()` returns the second argument (in this case, `0`), allowing the count to be initialized to 1 for that year."},{"question":"Write a python function to determine the average number of hours spent per week on hobbies by members of a hobby club.

The function should return a list of \'account_id\'s that have an unusually high number of \'credit\' transactions compared to \'debit\' transactions, which might be a sign of suspicious activity. Assume that a simple heuristic for an anomaly is having a ratio of credit to debit transactions greater than 2 for any account.Example:```pythontransactions = [    {\'transaction_id\': 1, \'account_id\': \'A123\', \'amount\': 1000, \'timestamp\': \'2023-01-01\', \'type\': \'credit\'},    {\'transaction_id\': 2, \'account_id\': \'A123\', \'amount\': 500, \'timestamp\': \'2023-01-02\', \'type\': \'debit\'},    {\'transaction_id\': 3, \'account_id\': \'A123\', \'amount\': 200, \'timestamp\': \'2023-01-03\', \'type\': \'credit\'},    {\'transaction_id\': 4, \'account_id\': \'B456\', \'amount\': 300, \'timestamp\': \'2023-01-01\', \'type\': \'credit\'},    {\'transaction_id\': 5, \'account_id\': \'B456\', \'amount\': 300, \'timestamp\': \'2023-01-02\', \'type\': \'credit\'},    {\'transaction_id\': 6, \'account_id\': \'B456\', \'amount\': 150, \'timestamp\': \'2023-01-03\', \'type\': \'debit\'},    {\'transaction_id\': 7, \'account_id\': \'A123\', \'amount\': 700, \'timestamp\': \'2023-01-04\', \'type\': \'credit\'},    {\'transaction_id\': 8, \'account_id\': \'C789\', \'amount\': 200, \'timestamp\': \'2023-01-01\', \'type\': \'debit\'}]Expected output:[\'A123\']```In this example, account \'A123\' has 3 credit transactions and 1 debit transaction, resulting in a ratio of 3, which is greater than 2.

It initializes an empty dictionary `account_transactions` to store the count of credit and debit transactions for each account.2. It iterates through the list of transactions and groups them by `account_id`. For each account, it keeps track of the number of credit and debit transactions.3. After grouping the transactions, it calculates the credit-to-debit ratio for each account.4. If the credit-to-debit ratio for an account is greater than 2, it considers that account as anomalous and adds it to the `anomalous_accounts` list.5. Finally, it returns the `anomalous_accounts` list containing the account IDs with an unusually high number of credit transactions compared to debit transactions.Note that this implementation assumes the provided heuristic for anomaly detection (credit-to-debit ratio greater than 2).

If it\'s not possible to arrange the guests this way, the function should return an empty list.To clarify:- Input: A list of strings, where each string represents a guest\'s name.- Output: A list of strings representing a valid seating arrangement, or an empty list if no valid arrangement is possible.Example:```pythonguests = [\\"Alice\\", \\"Bob\\", \\"Charlie\\", \\"David\\", \\"Eve\\"]```A possible output could be:```python[\\"Alice\\", \\"Bob\\", \\"Charlie\\", \\"David\\", \\"Eve\\"]```Another example where no valid arrangement is possible:```pythonguests = [\\"Anna\\", \\"Aaron\\", \\"Alice\\"]```Output:```python[]```","answer":"Here\'s the Python function to arrange the seating for guests based on the given condition:```pythondef arrange_seating(guests):    result = []    last_initial = None    for name in sorted(guests):        initial = name[0].upper()        if initial != last_initial:            result.append(name)            last_initial = initial        else:            return []    return result```This function takes a list of guest names as input and returns a list representing a valid seating arrangement, where no two consecutive names start with the same letter. If no valid arrangement is possible, it returns an empty list.Here\'s how the function works:1. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the valid seating arrangement.2. We also initialize `last_initial` to `None` to keep track of the initial letter of the previous guest.3. We sort the input list of guests in alphabetical order using `sorted(guests)`.4. We iterate through the sorted list of guests using a `for` loop.5. For each guest\'s name, we extract the initial letter by taking the first character and converting it to uppercase using `name[0].upper()`.6. We check if the current initial is different from the `last_initial`.   - If it\'s different, we append the current guest\'s name to the `result` list and update `last_initial` with the current initial.   - If it\'s the same as `last_initial`, it means we cannot have two consecutive guests with the same initial, so we return an empty list `[]`.7. After the loop completes, if no conflicts were found, we return the `result` list containing the valid seating arrangement.Note that this implementation assumes that guest names are non-empty strings and that there are no duplicate names in the input list."},{"question":"Write a python function to help me manage the inventory of products sold during my online shopping parties. I have a list of products along with their quantities, and I need to generate a report that summarizes the total number of each product sold.Here\'s what you need to do:- You are given a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string (product name) and an integer (quantity sold). For example: `[(\'T-shirt\', 5), (\'Mug\', 2), (\'T-shirt\', 3), (\'Cap\', 4)]`.  - Write a function `generate_sales_report(sales_list)` that takes this list as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a product name and the corresponding value is the total quantity sold of that product.- The output should be a dictionary like this: `{\'T-shirt\': 8, \'Mug\': 2, \'Cap\': 4}`.Example:```pythonsales_list = [(\'T-shirt\', 5), (\'Mug\', 2), (\'T-shirt\', 3), (\'Cap\', 4)]print(generate_sales_report(sales_list))# Expected output: {\'T-shirt\': 8, \'Mug\': 2, \'Cap\': 4}```Please ensure your function handles cases where a product might not have been sold at all and returns an empty dictionary if the input list is empty.","answer":"def generate_sales_report(sales_list):    sales_report = {}    for product, quantity in sales_list:        if product in sales_report:            sales_report[product] += quantity        else:            sales_report[product] = quantity    return sales_report"}]'),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"search-container"},O={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],P={key:0},H={key:1};function j(a,e,l,d,s,o){const p=f("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",C,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>s.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,s.searchQuery]])]),t("div",O,[(n(!0),i(w,null,_(o.filteredPoems,(r,m)=>(n(),v(p,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},[s.isLoading?(n(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(n(),i("span",P,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const M=c(F,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-1d56b3e3"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"deepseek/20.md","filePath":"deepseek/20.md"}'),D={name:"deepseek/20.md"},N=Object.assign(D,{setup(a){return(e,l)=>(n(),i("div",null,[k(M)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,N as default};
