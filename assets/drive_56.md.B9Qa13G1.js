The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story. And a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. To sum up, you should write the second sentence of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the new ending(last three sentences) of the story.--------Question: Premise: The sky was dark and cloudy.

I brought my new girlfriend to my parents house to meet my family. I introduced her to everyone and everyone was pretty nice except my sister. She’s not the most pleasant person to begin with and my girlfriend sensed it. When she left my sister blurted out loud “wow she’s ugly, you can do better!” I wasn’t entirely shocked because she says dumb and rude shit all the time. But it pissed me off, she laughed a little and said she was complimenting me and that I could do better. I got angry and lost it I told her she was a mentally challenged loser and whore and that’s why her husband left her stupid ass to be a single mother, and that kid would be better off with his dad than with her, because at least then he might have a chance at being a normal human being. She lost it and started screaming at me, calling me names and throwing shit at. I left soon after and a few days later I got a call from my dad telling me not to come over because my sister is still angry and will call the cops on me and say I hit her if I come by. Was I in the wrong here? Ex Output:EVERYBODYEx Input:Okay so let me start with me being sick. Because that's important. So I suffer from a pretty sever chronic illness called gastroparesis. As well as a whole other host of stomach issues caused by it. Bassicly I have really really delayed stomach emptying. My stomach only works at a 25% rate. This causes a LOT of nausea, vomiting, and pain. I go in &amp; out of flares. But when I'm in a flare? It feels like having the constant stomach flu. I feel 10/10 absolutely sick to my stomach from the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep. So my mom has become really good friends work a lady from work. And she kept trying to introduce me to her son. Because he got into a really bad car accident, and suffered some brain trauma. And because of that, hes disabled. He can walk and talk and everything for the most part. But he has definitely lost some of his motor skills, and some memory issues. But ours moms collectively thought we may get along, both struggling from being young &amp; having some form of disability. So we started talking on Facebook. And hes a really nice guy. He also grows weed. (I live in northern California). I talked to him about how weed is one of the only things that makes me feel better, and he told me he has a bunch of extra laying around his house. And he dosent smoke, so I can have it. I expect it to just be like a little bit, but he brought me quite a bit. At least 4 or 5 ounces. As well as some shatter. A few weeks later, he came over to hang out, and brought me like another 4 ounces. I didnt even know he was bringing any the second time. I am VERYYYYY thankful for this. It has helped me SO much. And I've definitely let him know this. I have tried to pay him, and he wont accept it. And I never once asked for any of it. So he grew quite a bit this year. And sense the prices are so bad, he couldnt really afford to hire trimmers. And it's just him. He asked me if I would come trim, and I told him I would be totally down to help him out. So I went and trimmed for him for a few days. He tried to pay me, and I refused it. Ever sense Christmas, I've been in a REALLY bad flare. I've lost 20 lbs sense then, just from not being able to eat/keep down anything. He asked me if I could come trim for him yesterday. He said he needed to have a certain amount ready by Monday, and there is no way he can do it on his own. If I was able to? Hell yea I'd go help him! And i told him that. But I'm just not physically able to do anything at all right now. I can barely get out of bed.. Plus his house is a hour and a half drive away, on a windy ass road. I get SO carsick. So that, on top of already being absolutely sick to my stomach? Would be MISERABLE. I would 10000% puke the whole way. I really thought he would understand. As he knows what it's like to have a dissability that stops you from doing things. But his demeanor changed right away. He usually is very talkative with me. But started giving me like a one sentence, a couple word, answers. I asked him if he was upset with me, and he went on this huge rant about how he Is done helping other people. Because when it comes time for him to need help, nobody ever returns the favor. And how hes givin me hundreds of dollars worth of bud, and the least thing I could do is to help him trim some more. I never once lost my temper with him. I just calmly tried to explain to him, that I'm sorry, I really am, but I'm way to sick right now. I can barley get out of bed. I cant keep down any solid food. I'm dropping more and more weight each week. I barley have enough energy to function as a human, let alone go sit up and trim for 2 days straight. And he just wouldn't listen to me. Idk if he thinks I'm lying to him or what.. I mean hear friends with me on Facebook. So he could easily see all my recent status updates for the last few weeks talking about how sick I am. I just dont know. And i honestly do feel so bad about it. I really truly do. I know he really needs help.. And he really has helped me soooo much. But I never asked him to help me. I never asked him for any of that weed. But because of the type of person I am, I can't help to feel like i am being an asshole.. Ex Output:NOBODYEx Input:I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 5 and a half years, and I love her very much. We don’t have sex as often as we used to because we both work a lot and are exhausted late, and that’s fine. When she isn’t feeling up to having sex, which is way more often than it is for me to have those feelings, I usually don’t say anything. Also, I understand if she’s not comfortable if we don’t do anything on her period, but I feel like if we are together for like 5 days in a row and we don’t have sex, it doesn’t make me an asshole to ask for a blowjob or handjob. I have asked in the past and she usually just kind of gets flustered and brushes it off as a joke, or she has said if she’s on her period it’s not fair. I asked this past week in a joking way, and she got angry with me. Just also wanted to note I don’t bring it up or make jokes like that often.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

What a great book! Characters were well developed as though you knew them, the storyline was good, it had a plot, and Odelia is just a great person. I could do without her boss, Steele, but he plays a role in the book other than just being a jerk.Odelia is likable, smart, all while being plus sized, knowing it and embracing it. She's quite a character. I happened upon The Curse of the Holy Pail as a Kindle freebie, but within 5 minutes of my finishing it, purchased book #1, Too Big To Miss. I think that there are people and incidents that are in this book that lend itself to the entire series, which I plan on reading at some point. Once done with this review, I will start book 1 and I know that it will be thoroughly enjoyed.This started out as a delightful series, even though I started with book 2, and the reviews have all been positive that I can hardly wait to continue. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?Ans: flattering(Q).Title: Don't use this approach Product review: Someone gave me this book and I really could not believe that people use this. The suggestions on how to deal with accidents are demeaning to children and may have dangerous consequences with sensitive children. This book advocates walking your child in wet clothes back and forth from the potty ten times and telling them how other people will be upset if they have an accident. It says to yell \\"No\\" if your child starts to wet himeself and show extreme disapproval. As you can see from some of the other reviews, some children have become traumatized from this approach, and I would never use it with my daughter who is already fearful of the potty and very upset by accidents. There are many other ways to train your child without punishment.

It was the first time a shark had been caught in the beach area, a popular tourist site in Hainan. Local fishermen said they caught the 3-meter-long, l-ton shark by chance when they were fishing in sea water 1,000 metres deep near the beach. Police temporarily protected the shark while oceanographers  decided whether it was a species belonging to State protection. Fishermen later killed and sold the shark after oceanographers _ that it was a whale shark and therefore not under State protection. The shark was believed to have drifted into the area from the deep sea due to strong waves caused last week by Typhoon Imbudo.It had no open injuries but experts said they believed it suffered from internal bleeding. Local police officer Fu Chenggeng said beachgoers should not feel threatened by sharks because the fish never attack human beings on their own initiative.Fu said he had never heard of any shark attacks at the Sanya beach since he first started work there eight years ago. However, police said they will improve the security system to safeguard tourists' safety on the beach.  Question: A possible title of the article should be  _  .  Options: (A) Tourists in Danger (B) Killing Whale Shark (C) Shark Caught in Beach Area (D) Whale Shark in DangerA: CQ: Article: Why do people run? That is, why do thousands get up early and put their knees and ankles and hearts and lungs through the hell of 10,000 meters on the roads? For those who stick with it and are lucky, they get into another world: a state of physical and mental grace reached when their blood is racing through every vein  . And in Austin, those who long to get better, even when they know it's impossible, hang on Gilbert's every word. Gilbert's methods are simple. It's all about form: how the arms move and the feet land. He pushes his students hard. When they feel like they're about to die, they look at Gilbert's scars   -- the burns along his right arm, and then to his right leg, where the flames ate down to the bone. Whatever they feel, how bad, really, could it be? \\"He gets people to believe in themselves,\\" says Lisa Spenner, one of the _ , who are crazy about Gilbert. \\"He treats everyone like they're amazing.\\" If Gilbert is their savior, they are his saviors too. \\"Eventually, I realized I had to help people. When I help people, I feel good,\\" he says. Gilbert's right leg was so badly burnt that the knee was stuck at a 90-degree angle. The doctor said it would take six months to heal. Frustrated, Gilbert got on a bike. The biking led to walking, which finally led to running a year after he had been left to die. In truth, runners don't race other runners. They race against themselves to conquer their wills. So Gilbert spent the spring and summer of 2007 trying to do that, racing men faster than he is, knowing it would make him better. Gilbert's students, of course, keep rooting for him, though sometimes they wonder, \\"How much better can he get?\\" After all, they see him as more than just a runner and a coach. He's a flesh-and-blood symbol: the daily struggle to show what you're made of.  Question: What do we learn about Gilbert after reading the passage?  Options: (A) He used to work as a fireman. (B) He has determination and strong will-power. (C) He learnt running from a coach. (D) He was advised to ride a bike when he was badly burnt.A: BQ: Article: Letters to the next president Dear Mr. President: I would like to personally thank you for your time and concern for our great country. I would like to take a few minutes to address a few concerns that I have with the United States. First of all, I would like to address the war. In my opinion, we should have never been involved with Iraq to the extent that we are now. I believe we should pull our troops out. However, I think there should be a time table that we follow but the time table should not be released  because the enemy does not need to know when we are going to pull out. Also, the war takes out a ton of our money, which leads me to my next issue. The economy right now, in the opinion of many Americans is the biggest issue with which we are facing right now. No one can predict what will happen one day or the next. The obvious thing to do is to put 700 billion dollars in the economy, but that bill failed and was rejected by the House of Representatives . Instead of putting 700 billion dollars in, I think the money should be equally distributed among Americans to pay off their debts. I'm not sure if this would work, but I think it is a positive alternative  we could take. My final issue I would like to call to your attention is teacher's salaries. The high school students of today are America's future. In a way, America's future depends greatly on the high school teachers of America. Saying this, it is sad that teacher's salaries are where they are. While teachers are working harder and harder every day to teach high school students, CEO's of big companies that are driving our countries economy into the ground are getting bonuses. I'm not saying that teacher's salaries should be the same of CEO's of companies, but I do strongly believe that action should be taken to increase the salaries of teachers because they have one of the most important jobs in America - - preparing our country for the future. Once again, thank you for your time and your effort you put in to making this great country a better place. Sincerely, Walker  Question: What's the author's attitude towards the Iraq War?

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\".Q: Weird title, I know.Here’s a little bit of backstory: I dated this girl for almost 6 months, but we “quickly” found out we were more like great friends than a couple, so we broke it up and continued to talk regularly. During the time we were together, me and my family would give her gifts. I would often get her clothes from the store I used to work at.Anyway, about a two ago, I ordered a hoodie from a Chinese girl on instagram, at 400. The hoodie came about a month later. Once it got here, I realized that the size was actually in the asian size chart, instead of american, so it didn’t fit me right at all. I call the girl and she tells me she could change it for me, so I wait another month for the hoodie to arrive, and when it does, the girl has the audacity to tell me that she can’t change it, but rather lower the price of the original by 10, because the one she first gave me didn’t have a tag anymore, even though it never had a tag in the first place! So I just say fuck it and buy the hoodie for a second time at 30, it just so happened that the day I went to get it, my ex was waiting for me at my house, so we started talking and I let her know about the hoodie and she says she’ll take it off my hands. Since I didn’t feel like making her pay full price, I told her I would do 30 to at least make up for having to buy it again. She posts a picture of it on instagram and my dad happened to see, he then casually tells me “hey, isn’t that the same hoodie you bought like two months ago?” and I then explained the situation. He then scolded me and told me I should have given it to her for free (even though I used to make 260 a month, so 70 for a hoodie is a lot of money for me) so I call her up and let her know she could keep it.Now it’s eating me up, I’m not sure if I should have just given it to her to begin with or if giving it to her for 30 wasn’t such a big deal. AITA here?A: RIGHTQ: On Friday night I had a sleepover with my friends after going ice skating for my birthday. We had a blast but stayed up pretty late (2:30ish). I got about 5-5 &amp; 1/2 hours of sleep. I tried to take a small nap before dinner on Saturday to catch up on a little bit of sleep but my family was being very loud in the kitchen. I didn’t get mad because as it wasn’t time to be sleeping I didn’t expect them to walk on eggshells for me.So I maybe got ~10 minutes extra. Then last night I went to bed at 11:30 and popped two melatonins. My family came up at 12:10 to get ready. I slept through them getting ready for bed even though the bathroom is right next to my room and their rooms surround mine. I was asleep by 11:40 and had been asleep half an hour before they burst into my room.So they burst into my room and my dad goes “Hi, finfp!” And my sister trying to trick disoriented me goes “It’s time to leave for vacation!” As if it was actually next week. I immediately woke up to my family filing into my room and I yelled “No it’s not, get out!” As I was now awake, and my family was still getting ready for bed, it was noisy in the upstairs and I have trouble sleeping (hence the melatonin) and sat in bed for about 10 minutes. My dad was yelling (not angrily, just being really loud when he spoke). So I yelled “please be quiet!” And my sister, trying to keep the joke going, said: “Finfp, it’s time for spring break, chill.” My dad said “finfp, settle down.” I was fuming at this point, as they had run into my room, knowing full well I was sleeping and woke me up, then got mad because I was trying to go back to sleep. I got up and ran into my dads room and yelled at him and then ran back into my room. He says I was too mouthy and that it was just a joke.A: RIGHTQ: I had to pick them up, I forgot where my car was so I walked in the opposite direction. They laughed and told me where the car was ( they could see it from the door). I, still in the playful mindset, did the door lock thing ( lock the door when they touch the handle) so the older one (11) of them decided they'll walk. I thought they were joking but watched them walk. I drove up to them and let them play the handle again, they walked away laughing. I drove again and got out the car, I was kind of done by then because I start feeling sick. I asked if they were going to get in and they said no and walked off again. They had cross a busy street to get to the other side to the neighborhood, I doubted the younger one(8) could do it but couldn't do much about it. I tried parking near the light but couldn't so parked at the elementary school further away. My mom drove pass and I told her they were walking and she blew up on me saying that I wanted people to go to jail.  Let me note that even kindergartners walk home because are neighborhood has two elementary schools and a middle school. She drove to pick them and I drove behind her, she got them and did the whole pointy angry finger thing. When I got home she acted like nothing happen but later I heard she plans to take the car away so I have to find a way to get to uni after spring break.The story the kids are telling everyone is that I refused to drive them and they were forced to walk home which isnt possible considering they were laughing and joking the whole time.

Though locked in the house, the HouseGuests are free to quit the game, though will not be allowed entry back into the house.

Frank Baum. The film stars Judy Garland; Terry the dog, billed as Toto; Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, Margaret Hamilton, with Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick, and the Singer Midgets as the Munchkins, with Pat Walshe as leader of the flying monkeys. Notable for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and unusual characters, over the years it has become one of the best-known films and part of American popular culture. It was a box office disappointment on its initial release, earning only 3,017,000 on a 2,777,000 budget, despite receiving largely positive reviews. The film was MGM's most expensive production at that time, and did not recoup much of the studio's investment until subsequent re-releases. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but lost to Gone with the Wind. It did win in two other categories including Best Original Song for \\"Over the Rainbow\\".[The Wizard of Oz] can be placed into how many genres?original question: Find electric system whose locomotive class is [SBB-CFF-FFS Re 420].answer: 15 kv ac railway electrificationanswer type: Electric system.auxiliary information: The Re 420, originally Re 4/4·¥µ·¥µ, series are the most common electric locomotives of the Swiss Federal Railways. They are used for passenger services throughout Switzerland alone or in pairs. For freight services, they are sometimes paired with the Re 620, especially in mountainous regions. That pairing is referred to by the term Re 10/10. The Re 430, originally known as the Re 4/4·¥µ·¥µ·¥µ, are a derivative of the Re 420 modified for higher traction but lower speed. The Re 420 locomotives were produced over a period of 21 years, from 1964 to 1985.

Tamika drove 85 miles farther.The answer: 85What was the question?Question: Tamika drove for 8 hours at an average speed of 45 miles per hour. Logan drove for 5 hours at 55 miles an hour. How many miles farther did Tamika drive?Connie spent 10 tickets on earbuds + 15 tickets on glow bracelets = 25 tickets. Since Connie spends half of her tickets on a stuffed koala bear, that means the 25 tickets she spent on earbuds and glow bracelets is the other half, so she spent 25 tickets on the stuffed koala bear. In all, Connie spent 25 tickets on earbuds and glow bracelets + 25 tickets on a stuffed koala bear = 50 tickets.The answer: 50Reverse engineering the question: Connie redeemed all her arcade tickets today. She spent half of them on a stuffed koala bear. She spent 10 tickets on a pair of earbuds. She spent another 15 tickets on glow bracelets. How many tickets did Connie redeem today?Reasoning and answer: Matthew rode 350 feet to the first sign, so there are 1000 - 350 = 650 feet between the first sign and the end. After passing the second sign Matthew road 275, so 650 - 275 = 375 feet remain.The answer: 375What was the question?Question: Matt rode his bike away from the house, he rode a total of 1000 feet. Along the way, he passed a stop sign that was 350 feet away from his house. He continued his ride and passed a second sign. After passing the second sign he road an additional 275 feet. How many feet are between the first and second signs?Twice the number of pigs is 10 x 2 = 20. So, Hannah's family has 20 - 3 = 17 cows. They also have 17 + 6 = 23 goats. So, they have a total of 10 + 17 + 23 = 50 animals on their farm.The answer: 50Reverse engineering the question: Hannah's family has ten pigs on their farm. They also have three fewer than twice as many cows as pigs and six more goats than cows. How many animals do they have on their farm?Reasoning and answer: First, calculate how many square feet of road Mark needs to cover by multiplying the length by the width: 2000 feet * 20 feet = 40,000 sq ft. Then divide the square footage of road by the number of square feet each truckload will cover: 40,000 sq ft / 800 sq ft / truckload = 50 truckloads. Now multiply the number of truckloads by the cost per truckload: 75 / truckload * 50 truckloads = 3750. Now calculate the sales tax by multiplying 3750 by 20%: 3750 * .2 = 750. Now add the sales tax to the cost of the asphalt to find the total: 750 + 3750 = 4500.The answer: 4500What was the question?Question: Mark is buying asphalt to pave a new section of road. The road will be 2000 feet long and 20 feet wide. Each truckload of asphalt will cover 800 square feet of road. If each truckload costs 75, and there's a 20% sales tax, how much will Mark need to pay for asphalt?Reasoning and answer: First, find the price of the sandwiches 5 per sandwich * 18 sandwiches = 90. Now add in the delivery fee 90 + 20 = 110. Now the tip 110 * 0.10 = 11.

What is the combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all of her hats?Answer with step-by-step thinking: Four hats, each with three stripes, is 4 * 3 = 12 stripes. Three hats with four stripes each is 3 * 4 = 12 stripes. Six hats with no stripes is 6 * 0 = 0 stripes. And two hats with 5 stripes each is 2 * 5 = 10 stripes. The combined total number of stripes Vaishali has on all of her hats is 12 + 12 + 0 + 10 = 34 stripes.So the answer is 34.Question: Jenny collects cans and bottles to take down to the recycling center.

Thus, Jenny has the capacity to carry 100 oz - 40 oz = 60 oz of bottles. Jenny can carry 60 oz / 6 oz per bottle = 10 bottles. Jenny earns 10 bottles * 10 cents per bottle = 100 cents for the bottles. Jenny earns 20 cans * 3 cents per can = 60 cents for the cans. In total, she earns 100 cents + 60 cents = 160 cents.So the answer is 160.Question: Sue works in a factory and every 30 minutes, a machine she oversees produces 30 cans of soda.

Hence, a machine that Sue oversees can produce 30 cans x 16 = 480 cans of soda in 8 hours.So the answer is 480."},{"question":"TASK DEFINITION: In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.PROBLEM: Deep learning algorithms are increasingly used in modeling chemical processes. However, black box predictions without rationales have limited used in practical applications, such as drug design. To this end, we learn to identify molecular substructures -- rationales -- that are associated with the target chemical property (e.g., toxicity). The rationales are learned in an unsupervised fashion, requiring no additional information beyond the end-to-end task. We formulate this problem as a reinforcement learning problem over the molecular graph, parametrized by two convolution networks corresponding to the rationale selection and prediction based on it, where the latter induces the reward function. We evaluate the approach on two benchmark toxicity datasets. We demonstrate that our model sustains high performance under the additional constraint that predictions strictly follow the rationales. Additionally, we validate the extracted rationales through comparison against those described in chemical literature and through synthetic experiments.SOLUTION: We use a reinforcement learning over molecular graphs to generate rationales for interpretable molecular property prediction.PROBLEM: We introduce a parameter sharing scheme, in which different layers of a convolutional neural network (CNN) are defined by a learned linear combination of parameter tensors from a global bank of templates.   Restricting the number of templates yields a flexible hybridization of traditional CNNs and recurrent networks.   Compared to traditional CNNs, we demonstrate substantial parameter savings on standard image classification tasks, while maintaining accuracy. Our simple parameter sharing scheme, though defined via soft weights, in practice often yields trained networks with near strict recurrent structure; with negligible side effects, they convert into networks with actual loops. Training these networks thus implicitly involves discovery of suitable recurrent architectures. Though considering only the aspect of recurrent links, our trained networks achieve accuracy competitive with those built using state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) procedures. Our hybridization of recurrent and convolutional networks may also represent a beneficial architectural bias.   Specifically, on synthetic tasks which are algorithmic in nature, our hybrid networks both train faster and extrapolate better to test examples outside the span of the training set.SOLUTION: We propose a method that enables CNN folding to create recurrent connectionsPROBLEM: The top-k error is a common measure of performance in machine learning and computer vision. In practice, top-k classification is typically performed with deep neural networks trained with the cross-entropy loss. Theoretical results indeed suggest that cross-entropy is an optimal learning objective for such a task in the limit of infinite data. In the context of limited and noisy data however, the use of a loss function that is specifically designed for top-k classification can bring significant improvements. Our empirical evidence suggests that the loss function must be smooth and have non-sparse gradients in order to work well with deep neural networks. Consequently, we introduce a family of smoothed loss functions that are suited to top-k optimization via deep learning. The widely used cross-entropy is a special case of our family. Evaluating our smooth loss functions is computationally challenging: a na{\\"i}ve algorithm would require mathcal{O}(binom{n}{k}) operations, where n is the number of classes. Thanks to a connection to polynomial algebra and a divide-and-conquer approach, we provide an algorithm with a time complexity of mathcal{O}(k n). Furthermore, we present a novel approximation to obtain fast and stable algorithms on GPUs with single floating point precision. We compare the performance of the cross-entropy loss and our margin-based losses in various regimes of noise and data size, for the predominant use case of k=5. Our investigation reveals that our loss is more robust to noise and overfitting than cross-entropy.SOLUTION:","answer":"Smooth Loss Function for Top-k Error Minimization"},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example.

Late in 2010, Stanley earned a 2011 PGA Tour card through Q-School where he finished in a tie for ninth. In his debut season on tour, he recorded four top-10 finishes, with the best of these coming at the John Deere Classic where he finished runner-up to Steve Stricker by a single stroke. The runner-up finish did however help Stanley secure the final available spot at the 2011 Open Championship. It was his first ever appearance in an Open Championship and he made the cut to finish in a tie for 44th. He also made the third FedEx Cup playoff event, the BMW Championship, finishing tied for 10th, though that wasn't good enough to provide entrance to the final event of the year, The Tour Championship.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine. <sep>Who were the first Europeans to control the greatest port in the East?<sep>South Africansanswer:Noquestion:Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. <sep>Who were the jihadists that met in Germany and determined that fluency in English would better their odds in a successful attack on the US?<sep>Ziad Jarrahanswer:","answer":"Yes"},{"question":"Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.Abstract: We have developed a variable suction system for irrigation, aspiration and vitrectomy.

Then find the number of gallons of white paint by multiplying the gallons of green paint by the ratio between the white and green paint: 5 white gallons / 2 green gallons * 6 gallons = 15 gallons. Then add the number of gallons of each color to find the total number of gallons of paint: 6 gallons + 3 gallons + 15 gallons = 24 gallons.

A mafia \\"sugar daddy\\" savior who always appears at just the right time. It is all too mundane, like a soap opera, and boring. Harlan Coben has written some good books.

The man in the Mercury  capsule was alone, but friendly voices reached him by radio. On the dark land 100 miles below, he saw a sprinkling of light. They marked the city of Perth, where people had turned on their lights as a greeting to him. In Friendship7, Glenn radioed, \\" The lights show up very well. Thank for everybody for turning them on.\\" His capsule raced on to the east. During his three orbits(......) of the earth, Glenn could always reach one of eighteen tracking stations. Some of them were on ship at sea. Others were in the United States. Many of the stations had been built with the help of other countries. These countries allowed Americans to bring in radio equipment and set it up. Without the help of such lands as Nigeria , Zanzibar(,), and Mexico, there would have been breaks in the worldwide radio network. John H. Glenn. Jr., was the first America to orbit the earth. For his flight, the tracking network  covered 60,000 route miles. Five hundred men worked in the stations along the route. Since his flight, the network has grown. Today, it covers more than 100,000 route miles and has about one hundred stations. One-third of these stations are outside of the United States.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set.

Then multiply that weekly cost by the number of weeks per year to find the annual cost: 120 / week * 52 weeks / year = 6240. Then find the annual cost of the pasture: 500 / month * 12 months / year = 6000. Then add all the costs to find the total cost: 6000 + 6240 + 3650 = 15890.

The most notable example of this is the Bekir Pasha Aqueduct, built under the auspices of Ebubekir Pasha between 1746 and 1748. This aqueduct supplied fresh water to Larnaca and prior to its construction, local residents had to carry water on their backs for two hours. Silihtar aqueduct, built between 1801 and 1803, and the Arab Ahmet aqueduct supplied water to Nicosia. The authorities also encouraged the construction and improvement of artificial channels for water supply and irrigation, which greatly increased crop yield and allowed large-scale fruit production. Among villages described as prosperous due to artificial irrigation upon the British takeover of the island are Morphou, Lapithos, Polis, Lefka, Avdimou and Kolossi. Samuel Baker, who visited Cyprus in 1879, noted \\"mills turned by water\\" and \\"narrow lanes streaming with water\\" in Lefka. He also wrote that \\"every garden and farm was irrigated by water conducted from the mountains in artificial channels\\" in the northern slopes of the Kyrenia Mountains extending to the Karpas Peninsula. In Karavas, streams were diverted into artificial channels to supply water to the village. In the 19th century, a major effort was undertaken by a series of Ottoman governors to straighten and regulate the course of the Pedieos. Edhem Pasha, who served as governor in the 1840s, completed the construction of the Larnaca-Nicosia road and several bridges. Governor Mehmet Halet in the 1850s further improved the road network and harbour of Larnaca and established a grain store and market in Nicosia to encourage cattle breeding.Answer this question based on the article: How many years did the construction of the Silihtar aqueduct take?A: 2Question:Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Cardinals, the Bengals stayed at home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played a Week 12 duel with the Tennessee Titans.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati pounced first with RB Rudi Johnson getting a 5-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Titans answered with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 28-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Bengals responded with QB Carson Palmer completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Chad Johnson.  Tennessee would end the half with Bironas nailing a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati began to pull away as RB Kenny Watson managed to get a 6-yard TD run, while Palmer hooked up with Chad Johnson on a 2-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals sealed the victory with Palmer hooking up with Chad for the third time on a 3-yard TD pass. Chad Johnson (12 receptions for 103 yards and 3 touchdowns) ended the game as the Bengals' All-Time receptions leader with 531.  Also, this marked the third time in his career that he caught 3 touchdown passes in one game.What all touchdown passes did Chad Johnson receive?Answer:2-yardQ: Coming out of their bye week the Chiefs flew to Lucas Oil Stadium for an AFC duel with the Colts.

In the third quarter the Colts increased their lead with Vinatieri's 47-yard field goal, followed by Succop's 35 and 43-yard field goals to tie the game. In the fourth quarter the Chiefs trailed slightly with Vinatieri getting a 42-yard field goal. After that, the Chiefs defense was finally broken down with RB Mike Hart getting an 11-yard TD run.

For this week he was able to bake triple the number of cheesecakes, muffins, chocolate moist cakes, and red velvet cakes. How much more cakes was Carter able to bake for this week?[Answer]Carter can make 6 + 5 + 8 = 19 cakes regularly for a week. For this week, he made 6 x 3 = 18 cheesecakes. He made 5 x 3 = 15 muffins. And also made 8 x 3 = 24 red velvet cakes. Carter was able to make 18 + 15 + 24 = 57 cakes for this week. Therefore, Carter was able to make 57 - 19 = 38 more cakes for this week. The answer is 38.[Question]Katy, Wendi, and Carrie went to a bread-making party. Katy brought three 5-pound bags of flour. Wendi brought twice as much flour as Katy, but Carrie brought 5 pounds less than the amount of flour Wendi brought. How much more flour, in ounces, did Carrie bring than Katy?[Answer]Katy's three 5 - pound bags of flour weigh 3 * 5 = 15 pounds. Wendi brought twice as much flour as Katy, or 15 * 2 = 30 pounds of flour. Carrie brought 5 pounds less flour than Wendi, or 30 - 5 = 25 pounds of flour. Thus, Carrie brought 25 - 15 = 10 pounds of flour more than Katy. In ounces, the 10 pound difference is 10 * 16 = 160 ounces. The answer is 160.[Question]In a fundraiser car wash activity, the 5th graders raised 147 on Friday. On Saturday, they made 7 more than twice their Friday earnings.

We've been doing it for most of the past decade. The idea is that it's just us guys on the mountain, enjoying the good company and snow. We cherish these moments and can't wait for the week to arrive every year.The problem is that, once we land at our ski destination, time seems to go by at light speed. The week ends amazingly quickly, and when we look back at our time together it seems even shorter. I know that \\"time flies when you are having fun,\\" but is there a way to perceive the week as longer?Given the way that you phrased the question, the answer is simple: Take your wives with you. (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)But more to the point: I suspect that one of the reasons your vacations seem so short, both during the experience and in your memory after the fact, is that the days of skiing are so similar to each other. In your memory, they blend together into one very long day rather than a weeklong vacation.Does your memory of a trip go downhill fast? Change things up to create more distinct memories.On your next trip, try to make the days more different from one another. Try snowboarding one day, take a lesson on another day, or just change your ski equipment from time to time. You could take a day off from skiing and go sledding or meet the locals. Even if you end up on some days doing activities that you enjoy less at the moment (like bowling, for example), the ability to differentiate that day from the other days will help you to categorize the vacation as a series of distinct experiences rather than as one big glob of skiing. It will let you get more joy from the memory of these experiences.A few weeks ago in your column, you suggested spinning a penny as a way to make decisions between two similar options. You argued that having to face the moment of truth makes us realize what we really want as the outcome.This approach might be useful when deep down inside it is clear which way you want the penny to fall, but what about decisions where what you desire is not good for you? For example, when the decision is between chocolate cake and fruit. In this case, you know very well how you want the coin to fall, and flipping the coin doesn't seem to be very useful.Any advice on how to deal with such conflicts between the head and the heart?You're right. The coin trick is indeed only useful for cases where the two options are of the same type (two cameras, two movies, etc.). In your example, one option is more tempting in the short term (chocolate cake) while the other is better in the long term (fruit). In such cases we should not trust our gut feelings to drive us to the best decisions.Looking around, it is easy to see that we often succumb to temptation and take the option that has short-term benefits and long-term downsides (in your example, this is the chocolate cake). The basic problem is that when we make such decisions we are often \\"under the influence\\" of the chocolate cake. Its closeness blinds us to the comparative long-term benefits of a piece of fruit (or just not eating the cake).So what can we do? Every time you face such a decision, pretend that it is not about what to do now but what you would like to do a week from now. For example, think of the choice between chocolate cake and fruit for dessert as a decision that you are making for exactly one week from today. When the choice is framed this way, you might be more able to override the influence of your current emotional state and pick the option with long-term benefits.I just bought a pair of NBA basketball tickets, and I plan to treat my friend to an afternoon of slack-jawed wonder as Kevin Durant dismantles our hometown Raptors. Here's the thing: My friend is very generous and semiwealthy. If I tell him the tickets are on me, he'll insist on paying, but if I tell him the tickets were free (the only way he'll let me off the hook about the price), I'll lose the cachet that comes from giving an expensive gift. What to do?Here is what I would do: Take your income per month (say 10,000) and divide it by the number of hours you work per month (say 160). Take this number (62.50 per hour) and divide it into the cost of the two tickets (say 200) and you get how long you need to work to pay for the tickets (3.2 hours). Now tell your friend \\"it took me more than three hours of hard labor to get these tickets.\\" (After all, you might not want to tell your friend exactly how much you make.) With this kind of framing, not only will your friend not be able to pay for the tickets, but he will also appreciate your investment in him and your friendship to a higher degree.A version of this article appeared January 5, 2013, on page C12 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Time Flies—Here's How to Ground It."},{"question":"In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that agree with each other.

Follow the example to solve a new instance of the task.In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.Solution: Development and evaluation of an efficient 3 -noncoding region-based SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RT-PCR assay for detection of SARS-CoVWhy? It's a correct title because the paragraph described the development of 3 -noncoding region of SARS-CoV genome and assay efficiently detecting SARS-CoV from clinical specimens.New input: Maria was distraught after reading about the 'potential' epidemic, yet to happen, and the horror stories on Facebook needing reassurance and certainty about what she should do. She requested an urgent appointment to review her treatment plan. Maria was a 26-year-old woman with relapsing multiple sclerosis who had recently experienced brainstem relapse with double vision and ataxia despite treatment with pegylated interferon-beta for the last 18 months. A brain MRI performed one month prior had shown 16 new T2 lesions, four of which were enhancing. One of the enhancing lesions was at the pontomedullary junction and was certainly the cause of her relapse. Treatment was to be escalated to ocrelizumab with the first dose in a week's time. In view of the emerging coronavirus pandemic, she was questioning whether or not she should go ahead with ocrelizumab. This was despite only a handful of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country and none in her town and region. If this scenario sounds plausible what should neurologists do? Human coronaviruses are predominantly associated with respiratory tract infections and includes those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and now the COVID-19 pandemic. In an uncertain world, where we do not have a clear evidence-base, you often have to default to scientific principles, rather than using the wisdom of the crowd. Not surprising, with Italy being one of the epicentres of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Italian society of neurology or SIN (Società Italiana di Neurologia) broke cover first producing recommendations on the management of patients with MS during the COVID-19 epidemic (see Box 1). The SIN guidelines provide relatively straightforward, and one could argue arbitrary, advice on how to manage patients with MS in the short-term, but do not address supervision of these patients in the intermediate or long-term especially those with highly active MS. If the public health measures being taken flatten the peak of the epidemic, but extend its tail, the problem of community-acquired SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 may be with us for many months and potentially years. Are the SIN guidelines compatible with the best interests of our patients or a knee-jerk response to an undefined problem that may not be a problem at all?Solution:","answer":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the use of MS disease-modifying therapies"},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Persian.

The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus to the left. Eventually, it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery. The larger anterior interventricular artery, also known as the left anterior descending artery (LAD), is the second major branch arising from the left coronary artery. It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk. Along the way it gives rise to numerous smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular artery, forming anastomoses. An anastomosis is an area where vessels unite to form interconnections that normally allow blood to circulate to a region even if there may be partial blockage in another branch. The anastomoses in the heart are very small. Therefore, this ability is somewhat restricted in the heart so a coronary artery blockage often results in myocardial infarction causing death of the cells supplied by the particular vessel.Question: Based on this passage, where does the left coronary artery supply blood to?Solution:OK... The important part for answering this question is: The left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the interventricular septum.the left side of the heart , the left atrium and ventricle , and the interventricular septum.Problem:Preterm birth, also known as premature birth, is the birth of a baby at fewer than 37 weeks' gestational age.

Two packages of flour are required for making a cake. If 1 package of flour is 3, how much does she pay for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes?Answer with step-by-step thinking: She needs 2 * 2 = 4 packages of flour for 2 cakes. 4 packages of flour cost 4 * 3 = 12.So the answer is 12.Question: Shonda is throwing an Easter egg hunt for her 2 kids and their 10 friends. She is also supplying enough eggs for herself and the 7 other adults there to find eggs as well. If there are 15 Easter egg baskets for everyone to share and each ends up holding 12 Easter eggs, when they equally distribute all of the Easter eggs to everyone, how many eggs does each person get?Answer with step-by-step thinking: There are 15 Easter egg baskets with 12 Easter eggs in them, 15 x 12 = 180 Easter eggs. There are 7 adults + Shonda (1) + 2 of Shonda's kids + 10 of their friends = 20 people at the Easter egg hunt.

Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?Answer with step-by-step thinking:","answer":"The solid wall is 8 ft. * 20 ft. = 160 sq. ft. The doorway is 3 ft. * 7 ft. = 21 sq. ft. The window is 6 ft. * 4 ft. = 24 sq. ft. The closet door is 5 ft. * 7 ft. = 35 sq. ft. The total area of the doors and windows is 21 sq. ft + 24 sq. ft. + 35 sq. ft. = 80 sq. ft. The solid wall is 160 sq. ft., so before the areas of the doors and window are taken into account, the total wall area is 4 * 160 sq. ft. = 640 sq. ft. Taking into account the doors and window, the total wall area Linda will have to paint is 640 sq. ft. - 80 sq. ft. = 560 sq. ft.So the answer is 560."},{"question":"Teacher:Given the sentence, generate \\"yes, and\\" response. \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\"). 1 In short, a \\"Yes, and\\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker.

This means that before Miguel applied the 12 discount, the cost was 128 + 12 = 140 dollars. We get the weight by dividing the cost by the price of strawberries per pound, 140 / 20 = 7 pounds.The answer: 7What was the question?Question: When the strawberries at Fruity Farm are ready for harvest, Miguel charges each interested picker 4 to access the strawberry fields. Once there, people pick as many strawberries as they wish, and then take them to Miguel for weighing and pricing. This year, the standard price of a pound of strawberries is 20. Miguel is a very generous man. He deducts the entrance charge from the cost of the harvest. Sally, Jenny and Moses have just finished their strawberry picking and are headed home. They paid 128 for their harvest. How many pounds of strawberry did they pick?The manuscript is 400 pages and the printers charge 0.05 per page for a total of 400 * .05 = 20.00 per manuscript. She needs 10 copies made and it costs 20.00 per manuscript so that's 10 * 20 = 200.00. She also needs each of the 10 copies to be bound, which is 5.00 per manuscript so that's 5 * 10 = 50.00. It will cost 200.00 to have them printed and 50.00 to have them bound for a total of 200 + 50 = 250.00.The answer: 250Reverse engineering the question: Clarissa is responsible for getting 10 copies of a manuscript printed and having each copy bound. The printers charge 0.05 per page to copy it and 5.00 per manuscript to have it bound. If the manuscript is 400 pages, how much will it cost to have it copied and bound 10 times?Reasoning and answer: 20 tulip bulbs at .50 each is 20 * .50 10.00. She planted half that amount of iris' so 20 / 2 = 10 bulbs. 10 iris bulbs at .50 each is 10 * .50 = 5.00. 30 daffodil bulbs at .50 each is 30 * .50 = 15.00. She planted three times that amount of crocus bulbs to 30 * 3 = 90 bulbs. 90 crocus bulbs at .50 = 45.00. All total, she earned 10 + 5 + 15 + 45 = 75.00.The answer: 75What was the question?Question: Jane's mother agreed to pay her .50 for every flower bulb that Jane planted. Jane planted 20 tulip bulbs and half that amount of iris bulbs. She also planted 30 daffodil bulbs and three times that amount of crocus bulbs.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.Q: Article: If you have ever been rock climbing, you will know that it is not a very easy sport. In fact, you probably felt quite defeated when you first tried to do any serious climbing. Indoor and outdoor rock climbing are both extremely demanding and require practice to get good at. It is one of the most physically and mentally demanding sports. There are three basic types of rock climbing. Top roping is the most common type and the climber need to climb with a partner. The second type, which is very similar to top roping, is called lead climbing. In both of the types, the climber can sit off the wall and rest on the rope. The third type is called bouldering. Bouldering is a type of free climbing without any ropes. This is the most demanding of all climbing types. The climber must be able to complete the climbing without taking a rest on the rope. Believe it or not, climbing is said to be about 75% legs and only 25% arms. To climb efficiently and successfully, a person needs to have a wonderful technique. One of the major rules of rock climbing is to always have three points touching the wall, whether it is both feet and one hand, or one foot and both hands, as it is much easier to have your weight  cases will not do the climbing; they only hold you into the wall so that your legs are actually pushing you upward. Also, the closer you are to the wall, the easier it is to climb. Rock climbing may sound a bit too extreme for the everyday person, but it is really an amazing workout. Once you get into the sport, and learn how to position your body and rest your weight, then you can begin to deal with some difficult problems. The great thing about rock climbing is that it is mentally challenging as well. You are constantly analyzing the way your body moves and how to do certain moves on the wall. For anyone who wants to get into shape, rock climbing is a fun and effective way to exercise muscles.

On Wednesday  TBS’ Samantha Bee — a woman enmeshed in a running gun battle for least funny human being with Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah — unleashed her latest screed of humorless outrage  this time with regard to the backlash against the #MeToo movement brought about by Babe.net’s idiotic report alleging sexual abuse against comedian Aziz Ansari. Bee  stated: She  then played clips of Tucker Carlson  Condoleezza Rice  and Liam Neeson  among others  questioning whether #MeToo has gone too far.  She  continued:This is imbecilic. Let’s say I constructed a list  called “S*y Human Beings.” On that list were three people: Hitler  Charles Manson  and  Samantha Bee . Now  I think  Samantha Bee  seems like a rather sy human being  but I’m obviously not saying that  she ’s a mass murderer. But  she  might be miffed to be placed in that company. The #MeToo movement has set no limits on what ought to be a career-ending or career-affecting offense. That’s not the fault of men. And it’s not even the fault of most women who find the #MeToo movement inspirational. It’s the fault of people like  Samantha Bee  who make excuses for conflation  then suggest that no conflation has taken place.Then  Bee  moved onto ripping into Aziz Ansari:Banfield was  of course  correct.

The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for the eventual removal of urine. The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein. Each kidney consists of functional units called nephrons. Following filtration of blood and further processing, wastes (in the form of urine) exit the kidney via the ureters, tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel urine towards the urinary bladder, where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination (voiding). The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing only in the length of the urethra.Question: Based on this passage, list the main functions of the urinary system?to eliminate waste from the body , regulate blood volume and blood pressure , control levels of electrolytes and metabolites , and regulate blood pHStream of consciousness: To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH.Ques & Ans: Love Island Australia will return for a second season in 2019.

You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.Let me give you an example:  Mark Hunter (Slater), a high school student in a sleepy suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, starts an FM pirate radio station that broadcasts from the basement of his parents' house. Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station's theme song is \\"Everybody Knows\\" by Leonard Cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Camper Van Beethoven, Primal Scream, Soundgarden, Ice-T, Bad Brains, Concrete Blonde, Henry Rollins, and The Pixies. By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show.Nobody knows the true identity of \\"Hard Harry\\" or \\"Happy Harry Hard-on,\\" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro (Mathis), a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicide at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on. She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release.Eventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the FCC is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school's principal (Annie Ross) has been expelling \\"problem students,\\" namely, students with below-average standardized test scores, in an effort to boost the district's test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) in order to retain government funding.Realizing he has started something huge, Mark decides it is up to him to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother's old jeep, creating a mobile transmitter so his position can't be triangulated. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, Mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As they are taken away, Mark reminds the students to \\"talk hard.\\" As the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.The answer to this example can be: What does Paige do with her medals?Here is why: This is a good question and can be answered based on the story.OK. solve this: In September 1965, on the fictional New England island called New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by Scoutmaster Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura, both attorneys, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent and mature for their age, met in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noye's Fludde and have been pen pals since then. Their relationship having become romantic over the course of their correspondence, they have made a secret pact to reunite and run away together. Sam brings camping equipment, and Suzy brings her binoculars, six books, her kitten, and her brother's battery-powered record player. They hike, camp and fish together in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island. They are confronted by a group of Khaki Scouts who try to capture them, and during the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader, Redford, with her scissors and Camp Ivanhoe's dog is killed by a stray shot from a bow and arrow wielded by one of the Scouts. The Scouts flee and Sam and Suzy hike to the cove which they name Moonrise Kingdom. They set up camp and go swimming. Later, while drying off, they begin dancing to Fran oise Hardy in their underwear. As the romantic tension between them grows, they kiss repeatedly.Suzy's parents, Scoutmaster Ward, the Scouts from Camp Ivanhoe, and Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp find Sam and Suzy in their tent at the cove. Suzy's parents take her home and when Sharp contacts the foster parents he is told that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of \\"Social Services\\"   an otherwise nameless woman with plans to place Sam in a \\"juvenile refuge\\" and to explore the possibility of treating him with electroshock therapy.The Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help the couple. Together, they paddle to a fictional neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Cousin Ben, an older relative of one of the Scouts. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp located on St. Jack Wood Island and run by Commander Pierce, who is Ward's boss and views Ward as incompetent. Ben decides that the best available option is to try to get Sam and Suzy aboard a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services, but before leaving he performs a \\"wedding\\" ceremony, which he admits is not legally binding. Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat, and instead are pursued by Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services and the Scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scoutmaster Ward, who displays great leadership after Commander Pierce is incapacitated.A violent hurricane and flash flood strike only three days after Sam and Suzy first ran away from home and, after many twists and turns, Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. The steeple is destroyed by lightning, but everyone survives. During the storm, Sharp decides to become Sam's legal guardian, thus saving Sam from the orphanage, as well as allowing him to remain on New Penzance Island and maintain contact with Suzy.At Summer's End, Sam is painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner. On slipping out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car, Sam tells Suzy that he will see her the following day.Answer:","answer":"When did Suzy and Sam meet?"},{"question":"In this task, you will be presented with a question and you have to answer the question based on your knowledge.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

He has made two things from it; one was okay, the other was great (a Moroccan chicken dish). He found the recipes very easy to follow, and he has fun looking through the book deciding what to try. I am a very experienced cook, and I like the way the book has all the basic information presented, the table of equivalents, measures, that kind of stuff. It has some very good information for beginners in general, too, such as very basic instructions. That being said, having looked at most of the recipes, I don't think that they are that appetizing.

Review: I bought this hoping it would work as well as my Mr. Clean Autodry System because that too has been discontinued. It did not. I've washed my car 4 times with it and each time I end up with lots of spots. Oddly enough, when it rains on my car after a wash the spots go away. Weird! Unless, I'm using the product wrong it does not leave a spotless shine without wiping the car down with a chamois afterwards(which I haven't tried yet). I do like the way it soaps up the car.

Review: I bought this book on the basis of the large number of rave reviews and was sorely disappointed.

Our aim was the identification of CT imaging features that corroborate the olfactory cleft as the site of origin for woodworkers' adenocarcinoma.\\", 'We designed a retrospective study to compare CT scans of 27 unilateral olfactory cleft adenocarcinomas with 30 cases of nasosinusal polyposis (NSP) and 33 healthy sinus controls. Enlargement of the olfactory cleft, lateralization of the ethmoidal turbinate wall, and contralateral bulging of the nasal septum were measured on coronal scans passing through crista galli and posterior half of both ocular globes. Comparisons have been performed by using analysis of variance and the Bonferroni procedure.', 'The nasal septum was significantly bulging across the midline in adenocarcinoma (4.6 +/- 3 mm; range, -0.1-13.7 mm) compared with NSP (0.7 +/- 1 mm; range, -2.1-2.3 mm) or healthy sinus controls (0.5 +/- 1 mm; range, -1.2-2 mm) (P < .001). The olfactory cleft was significantly wider in adenocarcinoma (15.1 +/- 4.5 mm; range, 8.6-25.7 mm) than in NSP (3.6 +/- 0.4 mm; range, 2.8-4.6 mm) or healthy sinus controls (3.3 +/- 0.7 mm; range, 1.4-4.6 mm). The ethmoidal labyrinth width was significantly smaller on the pathologic side in adenocarcinoma (7.2 +/- 2.7 mm; range, 3.2-14.2 mm) than in the control groups (P < .001). Whereas the angle between the conchal lamina and vertical midline was close to zero degrees in NSP (0.03 +/- 2.25 degrees ; range, -5 degrees -3 degrees ) and healthy sinus controls (0.45 +/- 2.13 degrees , range, -5 degrees -5 degrees ), it reached 39.76 +/- 13.83 degrees (P < .001) in adenocarcinoma.Answer: Radiologists should suspect nasal adenocarcinoma on sinus CT scans showing a unilateral expanding opacity of the olfactory cavity.A: ","answer":"Does cT assessment of woodworkers ' nasal adenocarcinomas confirm the origin in the olfactory cleft?"},{"question":"Please answer this: \\"Rakkamma Kaiya Thattu\\" (English: \\"Rakkamma, Clap Your Hands\\") is a Tamil language song from which year, an Indian film \\"Thalapathi\\", the song was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with S.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.Problem:Step 1: find the number of rows of each value of Location in school table.Step 2: find Location in school table whose corresponding value in step 1 is greater than 1Solution:","answer":"SELECT Location FROM school GROUP BY Location HAVING Count ( * ) > 1"},{"question":"In this task, you are given a sentence in English, and your task is to translate it into Persian.[EX Q]: The 21-year-old and 16-year-old, who met when the older woman tutored the younger, recently eloped from southwestern Pirojpur and came to the capital city of Dhaka to marry and start living together.[EX A]: این دو دختر که یکی‌ ۱۶ و دیگری ۱۸ ساله هستند اخیرا با هم از جنوب غربی منطقه پیرجپور فرار کرده و به پایتخت بنگلادش، داکا، آمده و با هم ازدواج‌ و شروع به زندگی کردند.[EX Q]: Zambia: The low tax economy · Global Voices[EX A]: زامبیا: سرمایه گذاری[EX Q]: Iraqi blogger Raed Jarrar posts a video which shows what could be done with the money going towards the war in Iraq - a staggering 720 million a day.[EX A]:","answer":"راید جرار ویدئویی منتشر کرده که نشان می‌دهد با هزینه یک روز جنگ در عراق که حدود ۷۲۰ میلیون دلار است چه می‌توان کرد"},{"question":"Q: Given the sentence \\"Two workmen add dirt to a freshly planted tree.\\" can we conclude that \\"The men are working in 95 degree heat.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noA: Adding dirt to a freshly planted tree does not imply that men were working in 95 degree heat.The answer is it is not possible to tell.QUESTION: If \\"Three women chat while sitting in the grass by a tree.\\" does that mean that \\"Three women are outside.\\"?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noLet's solve it slowly: Three women chat while sitting in the grass by a tree which is outside.The answer is yes.[QUESTION] Premise: \\"A large black dog leaps a fallen log.\\"Hypothesis: \\"A canine is jumping.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noA large black dog leaps a fallen log does not indicate that a canine is jumping.The answer is it is not possible to tell.Q: Test for natural language inference.Premise: \\"Muzzled greyhounds are racing on the track.\\"Hypothesis: \\"Greyhounds are racing on a track.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- no- it is not possible to tellA: Greyhounds may be muzzled or otherwise but they are on a track.The answer is yes.QUESTION: Premise: \\"A young boy standing next to a woman is helping her cook.\\"Hypothesis: \\"Two children are making cookies.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- it is not possible to tell- noLet's solve it slowly: A boy implies a single person.

In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.question:Article: The Lego Group had a very low beginning in the workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen,a carpenter from Denmark.Christiansen began creating wooden toys in 1932.Two years later, he came upon the Lego name by putting together the first two letters of the Danish words Leg and Godt,which mean \\"play well.\\"The name could be interpreted as \\"I put together\\" in Latin;it is also similar to the Greek verb meaning \\"gather\\" or \\"pick up\\". In 1947,the company enlarged to making plastic toys.At first,the use of plastic for toy production was not highly regarded by salesmen and consumers of the time.Many of the Lego Group's shipments were returned,following poor sales.However, Christiansen's son,Godtfred Kirk Christiansen,saw the great potential in Lego bricks to become a system for creative play-As the junior managing director of the Lego Group,he spent years trying to improve the \\"locking\\" ability of the bricks and made the bricks more versatile .In 1958, the modem interlocking brick design was finally developed and patented . Today Lego is sold in more than 1 30 countries.Every minute 33,824 Lego bricks are made,and kids around the world spend 5 billion hours a year playing with Lego.There will be more than 400 million people playing with Lego bricks this year.On average,every person in the world owns 62 Lego bricks,and about seven Lego sets are sold every second. This year Lego fans all over the world are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the tiny building blocks.Though already 50 years old,Lego is still the same product it was in the 1950s. Bricks bought then are still compatible  with present bricks and that is probably the reason the toy has never fallen out of favor.  Answer: It came from Danish words meaning \\"play\\" and \\"well.\\"answer:Which of the following is true about the name Lego?question:Article: Discover the beautiful, silent, white world or Antarctica on the holidays of a life-time.Head South to Buenos Aires and then transfer to the world's most southern city, Ushuaia.From there, it's about 1,000 kilometers on a special icebreaker ship to the freezing temperature of Antarctica. Getting off the ship and taking your first step onto the ice, you will imagine what it is like to be an explorer.Meet penguins  sitting on their eggs, or see an Antarctic seal that lives all the year round on the ice.But do not get closer than five meters to any animal, in case you frighten it or make it angry. The friendly crew of the ship will look after you as you explore the ice continent. We promise you fantastic meals and a comfortable bed -- you sleep in a four-person cabin -- as well as many special treats.If you don't think it is cold enough, try the ''polar plunge\\" -- jump into a special hole dug in the ice and dip your head under the water.You can then jump into a hot bath and if you succeed we will give you a certificate. After you wake up for the first time in the Antarctica you will understand why everybody who goes there falls in love with the place.The scenery is different every day because the sea ice is always moving. Our ships travel to Antarctica from November to March -- phone today and book your dream holiday!  Answer: Never make them angry.answer:How should you behave when you see animals on Antarctica?question:Article: What would you do if your pet cat died just before Christmas? Many cat lovers would go out and buy another cat. But one American woman was unable to bear life without her much loved pet cat Nicky. He had been with her for 17 years; and when she knew he was going to die, she had him cloned. Little Nicky was cloned by an American company, called GSC. But the new cat cost his owner 50,000. \\"He is the same. His characteristics are the same,\\" the woman told news reporters. The company, Sausalito-based Genetic Savings and Clone, made her available to speak to reporters only on condition that her name or hometown was not used. The woman said she feared being the target of groups against cloning. \\"Nicky loved water, which is an unusual characteristic of cats. Little Nicky jumped into my bath. Most cats are afraid of water, but Little Nicky is different: he loves it, just like my old cat,\\" said the woman, who said she was in her early 40s and worked in the airline industry. The company delivered Little Nicky two weeks ago and was expected to publicly announce the news on Thursday. However, the cat's creation has raised heated debate. Many people have said they felt disgusted at the amount of money spent on cloning a cat. They said that she should have chosen one of the many cats without a home -- cats like this are a common problem in many countries. The woman has only told news reporters her first name, Julia, but she has already received nearly 100 frightening letters from angry people, who say that cloning is against nature. Little Nicky was not only expensive, but also, like all cloned animals, may have more health problems than an animal which was born in the usual way. GSC said it had to try 80 times before it succeeded in producing a cloned cat. The company is now using new techniques and soon they hope to produce cloned dogs as well as cats. GSC said that if people were not happy with the cloned cats or dogs, they could have their money back. At the moment the cost of cloning is very high, but the manager of CSC said he hoped that eventually it would go down, and that in five years, the cost should be 20,000 for a dog or 10,000 for a cat.  Answer: Because other cats are afraid of water.answer:","answer":"Why did Julia have her cat Nicky cloned?"},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to count the number of nouns/verbs in the given sentence.Q: Sentence: 'A rear mirror of a city bus in the back of the car'.

One - third of capacity is 1200 / 3 = 400 people. 100 less than one - third capacity is 400 - 100 = 300 people.The answer: 300What was the question?Question: The spacecraft Gibraltar is a mountain-sized intergalactic vehicle for transporting equipment, building materials, and families to establish colonies on far-away planets. At full capacity, the vehicle can carry 300 family units with four people per family. The space flight is expected to take years, and it is expected that the size of families will grow during the space voyage. Therefore, when the spacecraft leaves the earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of the ship's capacity. How many people will be on the ship to start the journey?Reasoning and answer: First, we need to determine how many slices of bread Jimmy will use to make the sandwiches. We determine this by performing 8 * 2 = 16 slices of bread needed. We then divide the number of slices needed by the number of slices per bread pack, performing 16 / 4 = 4 packs of bread needed.The answer: 4What was the question?Question: Jimmy decides to make sandwiches for a picnic. He makes 8 sandwiches in total, using two slices of bread each. How many packs of bread does he need to buy to make these sandwiches, assuming he starts with no bread and each pack has 4 slices of bread in it?Reasoning and answer: In a year with 12 months, the total number of vehicles passing through the old bridge is 2000 * 12 = 24000. The new bridge has a capacity of 60 / 100 * 2000 = 1200 more vehicles passing through it in a month than the old one. The total number of vehicles passing through the new bridge in a month is 2000 + 1200 = 3200. There are 3200 * 12 = 38400 vehicles passing through the new bridge in a year. Altogether, the two bridges have 38400 + 24000 = 62400 vehicles passing through them in a year.The answer: 62400What was the question?Question:","answer":"The country of Belize had a 5 lane bridge that had 2000 vehicles passing through it every month.

Your task is to summarize them.PROBLEM: More than 100,000 Chinese have signed a petition on a White House website urging the US to deport the chief suspect in a 19-year-old case of poisoning.    Chinese citizens dubious about their country’s legal system are seeking justice in an unusual place for the victim of an alleged attempted murder in China. They are taking the case to the White House.    More than 100,000 people have signed a petition on a White House website urging the US to deport the chief suspect in a 19-year-old unsolved case of poisoning that continues to excite strong emotions here. Adding piquancy to the case: The suspect is very well-connected politically in China.    In 1994, a chemistry student at one of China’s top universities, Tsinghua, called Zhu Ling was poisoned with Thallium, a chemical often used in rat poison. She did not die, but was left nearly blind, paralyzed, and brain-damaged, needing constant care from her increasingly aged parents.    Her fate has not been forgotten, says Wu Hongfei, a former journalist who has followed Ms. Zhu’s case closely, partly because she was pretty and smart and partly because Tsinghua is so prestigious. But the main reason, says Ms. Wu, is that the only real suspect in the case “had close ties to high ranking officials.”    Sun Wei, Zhu’s roommate at Tsinghua, was investigated by the police at the time of the incident, but was never charged, though reports at the time said she had access to Thallium. The police said there was not enough evidence to pursue the case; many ordinary citizens believe that evidence was covered up because Ms. Sun’s father's cousin had been deputy mayor of Beijing and her grandfather was reputedly a friend of then President Jiang Zemin.    “Because of her family background … she avoided punishment,” complained one netizen, posting as “@Jinse Guniang” on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform.    Sun changed her name and is believed to now be living in the United States.    The case has erupted again into the public consciousness in the wake of last month’s arrest of a student for fatally poisoning his roommate at another prestigious university, Fudan, in Shanghai. The suspect in that case has confessed to putting poison in his dorm-mate’s water dispenser, saying he did it for a joke.    Zhu's case continues to rankle. On Monday, after just three days on the White House website, the petition concerning Sun had drawn more than the 100,000 signatures required for the US administration to offer a response. On Sina Weibo, terms relating to the case accounted for three of the top five search words.    Journalist Wu has little hope that the White House petition will do any good. Dissident artist Ai Weiwei “attracted a lot of international attention but he is still not allowed to leave China,” she points out. But as public pressure mounts at home, the authorities appear to be listening. Over the weekend, social media posts including such words as “Thallium” or “Zhu Ling” were being scrubbed from the Internet by Chinese censors, apparently afraid of criticism of the Chinese judicial system.    By Monday, the censors had lifted their search blocks. And even the state owned media have joined in the chorus of demands.    The online version of Peoples’ Daily, organ of the ruling Communist Party and Xinhua, the official news agency, shared a headline: “China, Ruled by Law, Should Seek Justice.” At long last, the victim of that unsolved poisoning seems to have friends in high places, too. ||||| Bei, who later went on to start a software development company, for the first time realized that the Internet was going to be a game-changer. “Before that you could not imagine there are nearly, I think, 200 doctors all over the world who can join together to diagnose this girl, and make the right diagnosis, and give treatment advice. It’s impossible to imagine, it’s like a dream,” he told me.    Unfortunately, this story has far from a happy ending. Over the years there has been intense netizen speculation that Sun Wei, Zhu’s roommate, was saved from prosecution by her family connections. Sun Wei was reportedly the only person in Zhu's circle with access to thallium. (Sun Wei denies this.) One theory is that she was motivated by jealousy. Online bulletin board sites were flooded with rumors, accusations of guilt and attempts to even hunt down Sun Wei.    We may never know what really happened. But as a satisfying verdict was never reached in Chinese courts, someone appearing to be Sun Wei ended up testifying in the court of online opinion. The pressure grew so fierce that in 2005, Sun Wei issued a statement on the popular Tianya bulletin board site. “I am innocent,” she wrote. “I am also a victim of the Zhu Ling case.” She claimed that she had been questioned by police and subsequently cleared of suspicion. Sun Wei even went as far as to scold Chinese netizens for their behavior: “On the Internet, even though everyone is just a virtual ID, one should still be rational and objective, and responsible for his own words and actions.”    Netizens, of course, were far from convinced. Now many believe that Sun Wei has left China, and is residing in the United States. There is even a petition on the White House Web site demanding the deportation of Sun Wei. It already has thousands of signatures. And now, making matters worse, netizens suspect that weibo is covering something up. As of May 4, when you searched for Zhu Ling’s name on Sina weibo you learn that according to Chinese law, the results cannot be displayed. Even “thallium” has become a sensitive word, as are other words connected to the case.    This level of Zhu Ling-related censorship is new. Zhu Ling’s story has been floating around the Internet for years, and has even been covered by Chinese state media. But now censors are getting worried, in large part because at the end of the day, people are not simply angry about one unsolved crime. Rather, anger over this case reflects a widespread lack of trust in China’s rule of law. As long as the truth of Zhu Ling’s case hasn’t come to light and nobody has been brought to justice, one netizen wrote, “the Chinese dream can only be the powerful officials’ dream.”    Weibo censorship has only made people more angry and suspicious. One netizen wrote, “A lot of information about Zhu Ling has been censored. So we can then see that Sun Wei is the murderer.” Another said, “You can delete Weibo and the two characters for Zhu Ling. Can you [also] delete the truth?” One person encouraged microbloggers to continue inundating weibo with comments related to the crime. That way, short of Sina shutting down weibo itself, it would be impossible to erase the people’s pursuit of justice.    Of course, it would be far better if this pursuit took place through the actual legal system, rather than on the Internet. The silver lining is that intense interest on weibo is yet another sign of increasing rights awareness among ordinary Chinese, as well as a collective desire for a fairer system. From the beginning of the Zhu Ling drama, the Internet has helped ordinary citizens form networks to solve problems. It helped to save Zhu Ling’s life, and now it is ensuring that her case is not forgotten. Nor is this online activism in pursuit of an abstract notion of justice. If we don’t stand up for Zhu Ling, people reason, who will stand up for me?    That's why so many people remain fascinated by Zhu Ling's case. Bei Zhicheng puts it best: “Many of our generation have successful careers and comfortable lives,” he said. \\"Zhu Ling should have been one of us.”    Ting Zhao contributed research to this article.

Zhu Ling was a chemistry student at a top Chinese university when she was poisoned with Thallium in 1994, the Christian Science Monitor explains. She survived, but is now almost blind, paralyzed, and suffering from brain damage. Her case attracted quite a bit of attention at the time owing to the fact that she was young, smart, and attractive; it was never solved, and now a recent, similar poisoning has re-ignited interest. Police investigated Zhu's roommate, Sun Wei, who was said to have access to Thallium, but she was never charged due to a lack of evidence. Many speculated, however, that evidence was actually covered up because Sun's family was politically connected. She changed her name and is thought to live in the US now; in 2005, she even issued a statement declaring her innocence, the New Republic adds. The case was brought back to the forefront of public attention last month, when a student was arrested for fatally poisoning his university roommate. A journalist who has followed the case doubts the petition will do any good, but the Chinese government has definitely taken notice: Censors were briefly removing social media posts about the case, but now even state media are calling for further investigation.PROBLEM: \\"The president is thinking about pardoning nobody,\\" Anthony Scaramucci said.    | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Scaramucci: 'The president is thinking about pardoning nobody'    New White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci insisted that President Donald Trump isn't considering any pardons for family members or staffers targeted by special counsel Robert Mueller, and also dismissed Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a lawyer linked to Russian intelligence as a \\"non-event.\\"    \\"The president is thinking about pardoning nobody,\\" Scaramucci said in a combative interview Sunday on CNN's \\"State of the Union.\\"    Story Continued Below    After host Jake Tapper pressed him on why Trump would tweet about his pardon powers, Scaramucci responded: \\"It has been coming up a lot, because there's an undercurrent of nonsensical stuff.\\"    Morning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Scaramucci, who said the White House needed to be better about its messaging, also alleged the investigations into a meeting among Trump Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner and a lawyer with ties to Russian intelligence agencies were much ado about nothing.    \\"Once they realized there was no legitimacy to it, people were walking out or they were on their iPhones,\\" he said. \\"It was a non-event, and if we want to turn it into a two-week, four-week news cycle, that's fine.

ADVERTISEMENT    “While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS,” Trump said Saturday.    The president has previously dismissed the investigation into Russia’s election meddling and any potential ties between Trump campaign staff members and Russia associated as a “witch hunt.”    “Pardons have not been discussed. Pardons are not on the table,” Sekulow stressed during his television appearance on Sunday.    But Sekulow said a court would have to decide if the president could grant himself a pardon, noting the issue has never been adjudicated.    “We’re not researching the issue because the issue of pardons is not on the table.

Both enjoy stirring the pot and shifting political loyalties. (Both had high praise for Hillary.) They savor counterpunching, especially in donnybrooks with CNN. Trump was taken with Scaramucci’s win in getting CNN to retract a story linking him to a Russian investment fund supposedly under Senate investigation, a debacle that ended in three reporters losing their jobs.    The Mogul and the Mooch have the same fluid relationship with the truth and the same definition of loyalty.    Donald Trump made it clear in an interview with Michael Schmidt, Maggie Haberman and Peter Baker in The Times on Wednesday that he was hurt that Jeff Sessions essentially put the Constitution over him, calling his attorney general’s decision to recuse himself on the Russia investigation “very unfair to the president.”    And Politico reported about Scaramucci: “A few years ago, while interviewing PR firms, he was blunt about what he was looking for, according to one person present for the meeting. During the 90-minute meeting, Scaramucci told this person: ‘I need someone who’s prepared to go to the mat and lie for me.’”    Sean Spicer had the impossible task of defending a president who didn’t believe in telling the truth to a press fixated on the president’s lying.

Prior to Trump's inauguration, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an unclassified report showing the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency all concluded the Russian government attempted to influence the election to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump.    Scaramucci, speaking on CNN's \\"State of the Union,\\" suggested Trump does not yet accept the conclusion of the intelligence community and questioned the media's pursuit of the story, saying it tarnished Trump's victory in November.    \\"The mainstream media position on this, that they interfered in the election,\\" Scaramucci said. \\"It actually in his mind, what are you guys suggesting? You're going to delegitimize his victory?\\"    Scaramucci said he intended to review the intelligence community's evidence once he had his security clearance and pledged to give Trump his personal thoughts on the conclusions. He said Trump would make up his own mind in time and that if Trump believed Russia was responsible for the 2016 efforts and a threat to future elections, he would act.    \\"A person that's going to be super, super tough on Russia is President Donald J. Trump,\\" Scaramucci said.    Trump has offered varied responses on Russian efforts to influence the election over the past few months. Speaking ahead of his first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in early July, Trump said, \\"It was Russia, and I think it was probably others also.\\" He also cast doubt on the strength of the intelligence community's conclusions, citing the erroneous assessment that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.    On Sunday, Trump posted a tweet that called the Russia probe a \\"witch hunt,\\" saying Democrats were using the Russian hacking allegations as an \\"excuse for a lost election.\\"    \\"As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!\\" he wrote.    In a separate interview earlier on CNN's \\"State of the Union,\\" Democratic Sen. Al Franken appeared at a loss, responding, \\"What can you say? It's just bizarre.\\"    'Mr. President, I apologize'    Prior to becoming a Trump supporter, Scaramucci had backed Scott Walker and criticized Trump on several occasions. He wrote a scathing piece last year arguing against what he called \\"unbridled demagoguery\\" taking over the GOP. Asked about his shift of position, Scaramucci said both he and Trump didn't care, and addressed the President directly.    \\"If I said some things about him when I was working from another candidate, Mr. Trump, Mr. President, I apologize for that,\\" Scaramucci said.    He dismissed the scrutiny around his past comments as part of an unfair political purity test, and said it was totally untrue that he was suppressing his own beliefs to get closer to the power and prestige of the White House.    And now that he is in his new job, Scaramucci said it was time for things to change in the White House communications shop.    \\"There's obviously a communications problem,\\" Scaramucci said.    For one thing, he said in his own opinion -- which he said was not the final decision -- the White House should agree to put press briefings on camera again. For another, he said he would address leaks to the press from within the White House on Monday.    He said he would tell the staff, \\"If we don't stop the leaks, I'm going to stop you.\\"    Executive power    Fresh on the job, Scaramucci found himself talking about one of the President's tweets.    Following a story in The Washington Post that stated Trump and his legal team were exploring the mechanics of the President's pardoning authority, including whether he could pardon himself, Trump tweeted, \\"While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS.\\"    While all agree the U. S.

Among other things, he rejected the idea that President Trump is considering pardons and defended his own move to delete old tweets in which he was critical of Trump.

Pardons, take II: Trump attorney Jay Sekulow also dismissed the idea of pardon discussions, per the Hill. “We have not and I continue to not have conversations with the president of the United States about pardons,” he said on ABC's This Week. Not convinced: Scaramucci said Trump is still not convinced Russia interfered in the election. \\"He basically said to me, 'Hey you know, this is, maybe they did it, maybe they didn't do it.'\\" He also said he was speaking with somebody recently who asserted that if the Russians did indeed meddle, they would leave behind no evidence of it. Upon questioning, he told Jake Tapper the person who said that was, in fact, Trump, per Politico. Deleting tweets: Earlier over the weekend, Scaramucci deleted old tweets critical of Trump, explaining that \\"past views evolved & shouldn't be a distraction.\\" The Hill notes that Scaramucci also publicly apologized to Trump on Friday. Moving on: \\"If I said some things about [Trump] when I was working for another candidate, Mr. Trump, Mr. President, I apologize for that. Can we move on off of that?\\" he said Sunday. Old column: One piece of criticism gaining attention is a 2016 column Scaramucci wrote for Fox Business in which he warned about \\"unbridled demagoguery\\" taking over the GOP. He did not, however, mention Trump by name in the column. Maureen Dowd: In her New York Times column, Dowd describes Scaramucci as a \\"wealthy mini-me Manhattan bro\\" who has much in common with Trump, including a big ego.

He was identified Wednesday afternoon as Nate Carrigan, who has coached football and baseball at Platte Canyon High School.    Master Patrol Deputy Kolby Martin, who has 11 years with Park County, was shot multiple times in the lower extremities, and Capt. Mark Hancock, who has 21 years with Park County, was grazed in the ear, the sheriff's office said.    Martin was airlifted to Saint Anthony’s Hospital in Denver with life-threatening injuries and Hancock was also transported by ambulance to Saint Antony’s. Martin remains in critical condition and Hancock has been released, Medina said in an afternoon news conference.    -- Suspect Martin Wirth known to authorities --    Wirth's body remained outside the home, in the snow, hours after the shootout, as investigators combed through the crime scene.

Wirth had previously run for office and had been fighting foreclosure for years. He recently posted on Facebook that the cops wanted him dead.    When the deputies went to the home in the Friendship Ranch subdivision, they were prepared for the eviction to be contentious, and there were eight deputies on hand, Medina said.    The person in the home was known to authorities, and \\"they had background information on the suspect in this case,\\" Medina said, but didn’t elaborate.    The bomb squad. the SWAT team and the ATF, were called to the shooting scene as a precaution but they were sent home later in the day.    During the initial response to the shootout, the Park County Sheriff's Office asked for help for all nearby law enforcement agencies. More than 100 law enforcement responded.    \\"I contacted the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and requested that they take the lead in this ongoing investigation,\\" Gore said. \\"The response from our brother and sister Law Enforcement agencies, and our community, is truly heartwarming and overwhelming.

Capt. Mark Hancock, a 21-year veteran of the office, was shot in the ear but was treated and released.    READ: Slain deputy was a beloved high school coach.    Eight members of the sheriff's office — including Sheriff Fred Wegener — converged on the snow-covered, three-acre property on Iris Drive Wednesday morning for what they termed \\"a high-risk writ of restitution.\\"    Advertisement    They were seeking to evict Martin Wirth, a 58-year-old Occupy Denver activist and former Green Party candidate for state Senate who had complained previously about law enforcement harassment.    Property records show Wirth defaulted on the property in 2013 and has been battling foreclosure and eviction.    \\"Wirth came out on his deck paused and then went back inside,\\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. \\"Officers quickly followed Wirth inside the residence. As they entered Wirth fired upon them. Officers returned fire.\\"    Wirth was armed with a rifle, the sheriff's office said.

In 1994 he was arrested in the shooting death of another man after becoming upset during a chess game. He was later acquitted.    Terry Rogers, Wirth's neighbor and a pastor in Bailey, said people knew Wirth as having strong anti-government views. He heard about Wirth's involvement in groups that supported that cause.    Sheriff's deputies would periodically be at Wirth's house, Rogers said, and one time he fought with the county about code violations for the number of animals he had on his property.    \\"He was kind of a loner — a recluse,\\" Rogers said.    Rogers said he interacted only occasionally with Wirth, like once when Wirth's goats got loose.    Federal, state and law enforcement officials from other counties came to Bailey to assist in the investigation. Officers in body armor and carrying long guns were behind police tape near the shooting scene.    \\"Right now what we can do as a community is come together,\\" Medina said    Residents brought food and water to law enforcement officers at the scene.    At about 4 p.m., an ambulance escorted by several sheriff's vehicles left Bailey and headed toward Jefferson.    Jeff Scott owns the Crow Hill Cafe in Bailey and lives in Friendship Ranch. The neighborhood is typically quiet, he said.    \\"I usually hear horses making noise and livestock,\\" Scott said. \\"Certainly not gunshots other than people doing target practice.\\"    At about 6 p.m., people began congregating at the Platte Canyon Community Church in Bailey for a vigil.    \\"When you're from a small mountain community, you care,\\" Chris Whetzel said, tears running down his face, before walking into the chapel. \\"When you live in the mountains, you have to take care of each other.\\"    Inside the small church, community members — some of them in high school letter jackets and others in cowboy hats — packed in and gathered in hushed circles to mourn and remember. There was no planned service, but rather just a need to be with each other.    Mourners hugged and whispered words of encouragement.    \\"We'll be here as long as we need to be,\\" Pastor Rogers told the group.

(AP) — A shooting killed a sheriff's deputy and a suspect in a Colorado mountain community Wednesday and left two other deputies wounded, authorities said.    The shooting happened in the town of Bailey, about 45 miles southwest of Denver in Park County, said Jacki Kelley, spokeswoman of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.    Park County is a smaller, largely rural county and sometimes gets assistance from larger outside agencies. Neither the circumstances of the shooting nor the conditions of the wounded deputies were immediately clear.    The picturesque town is where a gunman took several girls hostage in a high school classroom a decade ago, killing one of them before himself. Duane Morrison, a 53-year-old drifter, held the girls for nearly four hours and sexually assaulted them in September 2006.    He fatally shot 16-year-old Emily Keyes and then killed himself as SWAT team members stormed the classroom at Platte Canyon High School. |||||SOLUTION:","answer":"One sheriff's deputy was killed and two others were injured during a shooting in the \\"picturesque town\\" of Bailey, Colorado, on Wednesday morning, the AP reports. The suspect was also killed by deputies returning fire, the Denver Channel reports. One of the deputies who was shot has life-threatening injuries, according to the Denver Post. 9News identified the deceased deputy as Nate Carrigan, who had been with the Park County Sheriff's Office for 12 years. A Colorado Bureau of Investigation spokesperson says the resident of the home, Martin Wirth, was armed with a rifle and attacked the deputies. The Post says Wirth was an Occupy Denver activist who faced foreclosure after defaulting on the house in 2013, and notes that the Colorado Foreclosure Resistance Coalition had called for a \\"non-violent eviction resistance\\" for Wirth, who \\"has been an invaluable part of Occupy Denver from the very early days.\\" Wirth also ran for Colorado senate in 2014—the same year Fannie Mae took control of his home—as a member of the Green Party, losing to a Republican incumbent."},{"question":"(Q).You are considering whether to buy a product.

Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.question:Supervised deep learning requires a large amount of training samples with annotations (e.g. label class for classification task, pixel- or voxel-wised label map for segmentation tasks), which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. During the training of a deep neural network, the annotated samples are fed into the network in a mini-batch way, where they are often regarded of equal importance. However, some of the samples may become less informative during training, as the magnitude of the gradient start to vanish for these samples. In the meantime, other samples of higher utility or hardness may be more demanded for the training process to proceed and require more exploitation. To address the challenges of expensive annotations and loss of sample informativeness, here we propose a novel training framework which adaptively selects informative samples that are fed to the training process. The adaptive selection or sampling is performed based on a hardness-aware strategy in the latent space constructed by a generative model. To evaluate the proposed training framework, we perform experiments on three different datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10 for image classification task and a medical image dataset IVUS for biophysical simulation task. On all three datasets, the proposed framework outperforms a random sampling method, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.answer:This paper introduces a framework for data-efficient representation learning by adaptive sampling in latent space.question:Generative modeling of high dimensional data like images is a notoriously difficult and ill-defined problem. In particular, how to evaluate a learned generative model is unclear. In this paper, we argue that *adversarial learning*, pioneered with generative adversarial networks (GANs), provides an interesting framework to implicitly define more meaningful task losses for unsupervised tasks, such as for generating \\"visually realistic\\" images. By relating GANs and structured prediction under the framework of statistical decision theory, we put into light links between recent advances in structured prediction theory and the choice of the divergence in GANs. We argue that the insights about the notions of \\"hard\\" and \\"easy\\" to learn losses can be analogously extended to adversarial divergences. We also discuss the attractive properties of parametric adversarial divergences for generative modeling, and perform experiments to show the importance of choosing a divergence that reflects the final task.answer:Parametric adversarial divergences implicitly define more meaningful task losses for generative modeling, we make parallels with structured prediction to study the properties of these divergences and their ability to encode the task of interest.question:While real brain networks exhibit functional modularity, we investigate whether functional mod- ularity also exists in Deep Neural Networks (DNN) trained through back-propagation. Under the hypothesis that DNN are also organized in task-specific modules, in this paper we seek to dissect a hidden layer into disjoint groups of task-specific hidden neurons with the help of relatively well- studied neuron attribution methods. By saying task-specific, we mean the hidden neurons in the same group are functionally related for predicting a set of similar data samples, i.e. samples with similar feature patterns. We argue that such groups of neurons which we call Functional Modules can serve as the basic functional unit in DNN. We propose a preliminary method to identify Functional Modules via bi- clustering attribution scores of hidden neurons. We find that first, unsurprisingly, the functional neurons are highly sparse, i.e., only a small sub- set of neurons are important for predicting a small subset of data samples and, while we do not use any label supervision, samples corresponding to the same group (bicluster) show surprisingly coherent feature patterns. We also show that these Functional Modules perform a critical role in discriminating data samples through ablation experiment.answer:","answer":"We develop an approach to parcellate a hidden layer in DNN into functionally related groups, by applying spectral coclustering on the attribution scores of hidden neurons."},{"question":"Hiring a driver makes no sense when your car is unusable.This justifies what answer for what question?

I use all of the above occasionally, but the one I use the most is this little paperback dictionary that sits on my desk beside my bed.

ExampleBy Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation reporter, BBC News The adverts show the Democratic Party challenger with an earpiece, and say that he refused to have his ears checked for devices prior to the debate. The Biden campaign rejected the claims. The Trump campaign adverts ask: \\"Why won't Sleepy Joe commit to an ear test?\\" and \\"Who is in Joe's ear?\\" Accusations that presidential candidates have received debate help via hidden hearing devices are familiar, albeit unproven. Such allegations have been levelled against both Republican and Democratic candidates in the past. Prior to Tuesday's debate, the rumour about Mr Biden's supposed earpiece was circulating on several social networks, and was being promoted by the Trump campaign. At least 15 versions The advertising campaign was launched after the debate, and also promotes two other baseless but widely shared rumours about Mr Biden. One suggested he asked for breaks during the debate, and another accused him of refusing a \\"drug test\\". The photo featured in the advert is not from Tuesday's debate. It was first shared online in September 2019. In a number of the adverts, it has been doctored to show Mr Biden wearing wireless Apple headphones. This was not the case in the original image. Some versions circle the ear featuring the headphone. By Wednesday evening, there were at least 15 different versions of the advert, and according to Facebook's Ad Library, they had reached at least 10 million users. Facebook has pledged to label posts containing voting misinformation and point users towards accurate information ahead of the election. However its policy does not involve fact-checking political speech, including in advertisements. The company declined to comment about the latest Trump ad campaign. Rumour origins Hours before the debate, the claims went viral on Facebook and YouTube. Identical memes were pushed by a number of popular Facebook pages with names such as US Conservative and Unhinged Left. They claimed \\"Joe Biden should be inspected for a hidden earpiece as well as submit to a drug test before the debate\\". These memes are subject to fact-checks - and some have had warning labels applied to them on Facebook. The claims were picked up by Fox News and other conservative news outlets. They were further amplified by supporters of QAnon, an unfounded a conspiracy theory that claims President Trump is fighting a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles. Those who believe in QAnon are known for promoting political disinformation on social media which targets opponents of the president. They shared close-up pictures of Mr Biden's ears, alleging a listening device was visible. During the debate, some also shared photos of a fold in Mr Biden's shirt, claiming it was caused by a wire, and of a supposed device on his wrist, where he wears a rosary in memory of his late son Beau. Nothing new Conspiracy theories about secret listening devices have been recycled in presidential election campaigns for the past two decades. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton faced similar unfounded claims ahead of the 2016 presidential election. In 2004, rumours circulated among left-wing sites and blogs that President George W Bush was being aided by a secret earpiece. None of those allegations were found to be true. Even if a candidate did wear an earpiece, any advantage would be questionable. As TV and radio presenters can attest, listening to someone while simultaneously talking during the back-and-forth of a live event is a difficult skill to master.Answer: US President Donald Trump's re-election campaign is running hundreds of Facebook advertisements pushing an unfounded conspiracy theory that Joe Biden cheated during the first US presidential debate.Explanation: This is a relevant summary for the given paragraph.

ExerciseBy Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News Karina Acevedo-Whitehouse's technique is used to collect gases and mucus exhaled by the giant mammals. The tongue-in-cheek Ig Nobel awards for \\"improbable research\\" have become almost as famous as the real Nobels. Other research lauded at the Igs ceremony included proof that germs tend to cling to bearded scientists. Other slightly wacky science celebrated at the US ceremony included research that proved the symptoms of asthma could be treated by riding on a roller-coaster and wearing socks outside your shoes could reduce your chances of slipping on an ice path. Dr Acevedo-Whitehouse, of the Zoological Society of London, was present at the Sanders Theater at Harvard University, US, to receive her award. Colleagues Agnes Rocha-Gosselin and Diane Gendron were also there. Not to put it too finely, the trio collect \\"whale snot\\". They hang petri dishes under a mini-chopper and fly the vehicle over a surfacing whale just as it evacuates its blow-hole. The exhaled gases and mucus blast the dishes which are then taken back to the lab to study the disease-causing micro-organisms carried by the animals. The remarkable method of obtaining the samples was featured in the BBC series Oceans. You can see how it is done by watching the video at the top of this page. Dr Acevedo-Whitehouse told BBC News she was delighted to receive the spoof honour: \\"I was slightly bemused at first, to be honest, but I think that it is important to recognize (and communicate) that science can be fun. My colleagues and I are actually quite proud to receive this award now. Beyond the actual results (which are actually very interesting) we certainly have had fun doing our whale-snot research!\\" This was the 21st Ig Nobel ceremony. The awards are run by the science humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research. They are supposed to \\"first make people laugh, and then make them think\\". All the research, bar some special prizes, is real and published in bona fide academic journals. As part of the fun, the prizes are also handed over by genuine Nobel Laureates. As usual, UK-based scientists featured heavily among the winning teams. \\"Usually when you are an eccentric, you get punished. But in Britain, if you are an eccentric, you're kind of celebrated,\\" awards organiser Marc Abrahams told BBC News. The full list of winners: Engineering Prize: Karina Acevedo-Whitehouse (UK) and colleagues for perfecting a method to collect whale snot, using a remote-control helicopter. Medicine Prize: Simon Rietveld (Netherlands) and colleagues for discovering that symptoms of asthma can be treated with a roller-coaster ride. Transportation Planning Prize: Toshiyuki Nakagaki (Japan) and colleagues for using slime mould to determine the optimal routes for railroad tracks. Physics Prize: Lianne Parkin (New Zealand) and colleagues for demonstrating that, on icy footpaths in wintertime, people slip and fall less often if they wear socks on the outside of their shoes. Peace Prize: Richard Stephens (UK) and colleagues for confirming the widely held belief that swearing relieves pain. Public health Prize: Manuel Barbeito (US) and colleagues for determining by experiment that microbes cling to bearded scientists.

Title: Two failed in under 1 year Review: These CFL bulbs are designed for bathroom use, but I have a feeling they are not good for the on/off lighting condition normally used in a bathroom. My plan was that as the old globe bulbs fail, I would replace with the CFL design. But while the incandecent bulbs would continue to work, the two replacement CFL from Feit had failed. They first started as quick on and near full brightness, but as time went on, the bulbs would be dim, then increase in light over a 45-60 seconds time until full bright. Finally, nothing. Dead. At 5-10 per bulb, there isn't enough savings to use these again.I have replaced with another brand CFL. I hope to get years of operation from those bulbs.

This error was soon nicknamed the \\"Red Ring of Death\\", echoing Windows' Blue Screen of Death error. Warning signs may include freeze-ups, graphical problems in the middle of gameplay, such as checkerboard or pinstripe patterns on the screen, and sound errors; mostly consisting of extremely loud noises that can be affected by the volume control, and the console only responds to pressing the power button to turn it off. These events may happen once or several times until the hardware failure occurs, or not at all. If the console freezes occasionally, the error will not necessarily follow. The technical problems seem to affect some generations of consoles more than others, e.g. Xenon or Zephyr. Those problems may also cause some freezing screens.Answer this question based on the passage: what do the green lights on xbox 360 mean?Solution:OK...

Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party.Based on this passage, where was the first gold strike in california setting off the 1849 gold rush?Student B:OK...

Low energy x-rays (less than 30 keV) contribute little to the resultant image as they are heavily absorbed by the patient's soft tissues (particularly the skin). Additionally, this absorption adds to the risk of stochastic (e.g. cancer) or non stochastic radiation effects (e.g. tissue reactions) in the patient. Thus, it is favorable to remove these low energy X-rays from the incident light beam. X-ray filtration may be inherent due to the X-ray tube and housing material itself or added from additional sheets of filter material. The minimum filtration used is usually 2.5 mm aluminium (Al) equivalent, although there is an increasing trend to use greater filtration. Manufacturers of modern fluoroscopy equipment utilize a system of adding a variable thickness of copper (Cu) filtration according to patient thickness. This typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 mm Cu.Based on this passage, the function of an x ray beam filter in diagnostic radiology is to?Solution:","answer":"OK...

Darius scored 5 points less than Matt, so Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points in total. So all three friends gathered 13 + 15 + 10 = 38 points.

They didn't wipe anything down inside of the car and the people who did the actual \\"cleaning\\" were a little rude. Not to mention this place is pricy compared to other places I've been where they at least attempt to do a good job. Would recommend skipping this one!Q: positiveA: Overall I really like this airport.  Access to the airport from multiple roadways helps reduce the traffic coming in.  I usually fly United or US Airways (star alliance) here and security is always quite fast.  Once you are inside the concourses are laid out efficiently and there are plenty of people movers in between.  There is free wifi here that is actually quite fast 3.89Mbps download and 31.48Mbps upload(speedtest.net).  Pretty good selection of restuarants.  As far as airports go this one is highly recommended.Problem: What would be an example of an negative (OPTIONS:- negative- positive) review?Answer: This place is right around the corner from Gangplank, where I work. A few of us will go there for a quick and cheap bite to eat every now and again, but I usually regret it.  The food is extremely salty, beyond being \\"over seasoned\\". The employees aren't especially friendly, although there is definitely a family owned atmosphere.   I get the impression that this is the kind of place that people in the area have been going to for a while and after so many years they are able to explain away its flaws.  From other reviews and talking to co-workers it sounds like they've got good breakfast burrito options, but I've never been for breakfast so I can't comment.  The one redeeming dish is the shredded beef taco combo, however it's not too consistent so you have to get lucky.Input: OPTIONS:- negative- positive.Generate a negative review for a placeOutput: what a dump this was the worst room we have ever had on the strip the shower in our room would not drain properly there was a hole in the ceiling with mold in it all around a very dirty Hotel they should put this hotel on Hotel rescue TV show we planned on staying there several days but instead we went across the street and checked into the Tropicana big difference Tropicana is much nicer cleaner all around better place to stayinput: Write a negative yelp review (OPTIONS:- negative- positive).output: My husband and I were trying to have a little romantic staycation with a comp night. Checked in at 3pm to make sure we could get a room close to elevator and non smoking since I'm30 weeks pregnant and when I called the lady kept trying to give me a smoking room. Having the room key we went about having an evening out, gambling and listening to the lounge entertainment. Around 10ish this pregnant woman couldn't take anymore and wanted to go to bed, where we found the room cold so my husband attempts to turn on heat. Not working. Called front desk and after being put on hold for 10 mins they tell me they will put in a work order. Facilities guy comes up and realized that the whole system has to be replaced because it keeps popping the fuses. Apparently this room has had problems and they knew cuz we heard \\"yeah its 1041\\" on the radio when he was calling for another unit. My husband calls front desk to tell them it's cold and I'm tired only to be told by some girl that its too bad and she can't do anything. Never offered to change our room. So needless to say at midnight they were changing out system in our cold room. Topping our stay off with in the morning my husband was using the bathroom and they just came in to clean the room. Hello, bathroom has no locks and it wasn't check out yet.  So much for a romantic staycation, I didn't get rest and it made for a bad Saturday night.

The food here is cooked and made to order so it's fresh.  My biggest \\"like\\" about the place is the interior.  Super chic, trendy and candy for my eyes!  It's got a very large interior that affords larger groups the ability to sit together easily.  Also they have lounge areas where you can really kick back and stay a while with a cold beer and thin pizza.  I'll always prefer eating and drinking in a comfy chair/couch.

ExampleOptical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidlycapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.The infomation from the camera is analyzed by aDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detectimperfections in the underlying surface anddetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfacesinterfere with the ability of the DSP toaccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, themouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections inthe underlying surface to determine motion.Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since theyconstantly reflect back the same image, causingthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When thesystem is unable to see surface changes associatedwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.Answer: why doesn't an optical mouse work on a glasstable?Explanation: The passage talks about the glass and mirror surfaces beneath the optical mice and how the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. The last line of the passage explains why the mouse will not work properly on these surfaces. Thus it is a positive example.Part 3.

Passage:The ship was ordered on 4 March 1929 from Hawthorn Leslie, under the 1928 Naval Programme. She was laid down at Hebburn-on-Tyne on 11 July 1929, and launched on 23 September 1930, as the fifth RN ship to carry this name. Boadicea was completed on 9 April 1931 at a cost of £225,325, excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns, ammunition and communications equipment. After her commissioning, she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1936. She was damaged whilst refuelling at sea with the battleship on 15 March 1935; her repairs lasted until 18 April. Later that year she was deployed to Famagusta, Cyprus, and Haifa, Palestine to assist British forces in putting down riots from December 1935 – January 1936. Boadicea had to return to Haifa in June to help put down the beginnings of the Arab Revolt. Afterwards the ship was deployed to Cartagena and Valencia to evacuate civilians at the start of the Spanish Civil War before beginning a refit at Portsmouth that lasted until 26 September. She remained with the 4th Flotilla until January 1939 and made multiple deployments off the coast of Spain enforcing the embargo until April 1938 when she was again refitted. After leaving the 4th Flotilla, Boadicea served as the plane guard for the aircraft carriers of the Mediterranean Fleet for a few months until she became the emergency destroyer at the Nore. She was attached to the Reserve Fleet at Portland for the Fleet Review in August 1939.Output:","answer":"a"},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.You are given a science question (easy-level) and four answer options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.Input: Context: The basic building blocks of the human body are cells. Human cells are organized into tissues, tissues are organized into organs, and organs are organized into organ systems. The average human adult consists of an incredible 100 trillion cells! Cells are the basic units of structure and function in the human body, as they are in all living things. Each cell must carry out basic life processes in order to survive and help keep the body alive. Most human cells also have characteristics for carrying out other, special functions. For example, muscle cells have extra mitochondria to provide the energy needed to move the body. You can see examples of these and some other specialized human cells in Figure 16.1. To learn more about specialized human cells and what they do, watch this video: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Specialized cells are organized into tissues. A tissue is a group of specialized cells of the same kind that perform the same function. There are four basic types of human tissues: connective, epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissues. The four types are shown in Figure 16.2. Connective tissue consists of cells that form the bodys structure. Examples include bone and cartilage, which protect and support the body. Blood is also a connective tissue. It circulates and connects cells throughout the body. Epithelial tissue consists of cells that cover inner and outer body surfaces. Examples include skin and the linings of internal organs. Epithelial tissue protects the body and its internal organs. It also secretes substances such as hormones and absorbs substances such as nutrients. Muscle tissue consists of cells that can contract, or shorten. Examples include skeletal muscle, which is attached to bones and makes them move. Other types of muscle include cardiac muscle, which makes the heart beat, and smooth muscle, which is found in other internal organs. Nervous tissue consists of nerve cells, or neurons, which can send and receive electrical messages. Nervous tissue makes up the brain, spinal cord, and other nerves that run throughout the body. The four types of tissues make up all the organs of the human body. An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissues that work together to perform the same function. Examples of human organs include the skin, brain, lungs, kidneys, and heart. Consider the heart as an example. Figure 16.3 shows how all four tissue types work together to make the heart pump blood. Human organs are organized into organ systems. An organ system is a group of organs that work together to carry out a complex function. Each organ of the system does part of the overall job. For example, the heart is an organ in the circulatory system. The circulatory system also includes the blood vessels and blood. There are many different human organ systems. Figure 16.4 shows six of them and gives their functions. The organ systems of the body work together to carry out life processes and maintain homeostasis. The body is in homeostasis when its internal environment is kept more-or-less constant. For example, levels of sugar, carbon dioxide, and water in the blood must be kept within narrow ranges. This requires continuous adjustments. For example: After you eat and digest a sugary snack, the level of sugar in your blood quickly rises. In response, the endocrine system secretes the hormone insulin. Insulin helps cells absorb sugar from the blood. This causes the level of sugar in the blood to fall back to its normal level. When you work out on a hot day, you lose a lot of water through your skin in sweat. The level of water in the blood may fall too low. In response, the excretory system excretes less water in urine. Instead, the water is returned to the blood to keep water levels from falling lower. What happens if homeostasis is not maintained? Cells may not get everything they need, or toxic wastes may build up in the body. If homeostasis is not restored, it may cause illness or even death.

Based on his commission, he sold 175 / 25 = 7 systems. In all, he sold S + 2S + 0 + 1 = 3S + 1 = 7 systems. On the first and second streets, he sold 3S = 7 - 1 = 6 systems. Thus, on the first street he sold S = 6 / 3 = 2 systems. On the second street, Rodney sold 2 * 2 = 4 security systems. The answer is 4.Question: Andy is mixing blue, green and white paint in a 1 : 2 : 5 ratio. If he uses 6 gallons of green paint, how many gallons of paint does he use total?Answer: First find the number of gallons of blue paint by multiplying the gallons of green paint by the ratio between the blue and green paint: 1 blue gallon / 2 green gallons * 6 gallons = 3 gallons. Then find the number of gallons of white paint by multiplying the gallons of green paint by the ratio between the white and green paint: 5 white gallons / 2 green gallons * 6 gallons = 15 gallons. Then add the number of gallons of each color to find the total number of gallons of paint: 6 gallons + 3 gallons + 15 gallons = 24 gallons. The answer is 24.[Question]Ms. Estrella is an entrepreneur with a startup company having 10 employees. The company makes a revenue of 400000 a month, paying 10% in taxes, 5% of the remaining amount on marketing and ads, 20% of the remaining amount on operational costs, and 15% of the remaining amount on employee wages. Assuming each employee receives the same wage, calculate the amount of money each employee is paid monthly.[Answer]The company pays a total of 10 / 100 * 400000 = 40000 on taxes. After taxes, the company revenue is 400000 - 40000 = 360,000. The costs of marketing and ads campaign are 5 / 100 * 360000 = 18000. After deducting the costs of marketing and adds campaign, the company remains with = 342,000 in revenue. Operational costs for the company are 20 / 100 * 342000 = 68400. After taking out the operational costs, the company remains with 342000 - 68400 = 273600. The company also pays employee wages of 15 / 100 * 273600 = 41040. If the total number of employees is 10, each employee is paid a salary of 41040 / 10 = 4104 per month. The answer is 4104.Q: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?A: There are 4 * 7 = 28 days in those 4 weeks. That means he takes 28 / 2 = 14 showers. So he takes a total of 14 * 10 = 140 minutes of showers. So he uses 2 * 140 = 280 gallons of water. The answer is 280.Question: For a project, a builder purchased 7 boxes of bolts with each box containing 11 bolts. He purchased 3 boxes of nuts with each box containing 15 nuts. He ended up finishing the project 6 days early and with 3 bolts and 6 nuts left over. How many bolts and nuts did he use for the project?Answer:","answer":"The builder purchased 7 boxes * 11 bolts = 77 bolts. He used 77 bolts - 3 left over = 74 bolts for the project. The builder purchased 3 boxes * 15 nuts = 45 nuts. He used 45 nuts - 6 left over = 39 nuts for the project. Total for the project he used 74 bolts + 39 nuts = 113 nuts and bolts. The answer is 113."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example.

It is really disturbing (and depressing) for me to come to know that Rabbi Steinsaltz, an outstanding kabbalistic and talmudic scholar, also very close to Chabad's chassidic philosophy, appears in a video along with a man like Masaru Emoto, a Japanese photographer who pretends to change water's chemical structure simply by whispering kind words to it.

A question decomposition is a numbered list of operations that must be performed to answer the original question. Imagine explaining your question to a friendly droid by listing each action it should take in order for the question to be answered. Each step in our decomposition should refer to either an entity (known or unknown), a propery of an entity or a query operation (count, group, union, etc.) Here are the list of step templates and their description: Select: A select step is used to return a set of objects. There are no references to previous steps in a select step. template: Return [attributes] Filter: A filter step is used to return results from a previous step to which a certain condition applies. template: Return [#step] [condition] Project: A project step should return certain attributes of the results of a previous step. template: Return [attributes] of [#step] Aggregate: An aggregate step returns an aggregator function applied on a step's result. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step].

If one gallon of gas costs 2, how much money does she spend on gas for her trip?Answer: First she drives 2 hours * 60 mph = 120 miles. Then she drives 3 hours * 50 mph = 150 miles. The total miles driven is 120 + 150 = 270 miles. Jenna uses 270 / 30 = 9 gallons of gas. The cost of gas is 9 * 2 = 18.

If Cheryl spends 400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, which costs 800, calculate the total amount she pays upon signing up for the golf tournament.[Answer]If the electricity bill costs 800, and Cheryl spends 400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, she pays 800 + 400 = 1200 on cell phone expenses. Since the cost to enter the tournament is 20% more than Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses, to enter the tournament, Cheryl has to pay 20 / 100 * 1200 = 240 more than her monthly cell phone expenses. The total cost of joining the golf tournament is 1200 + 240 = 1440. The answer is 1440.Q: Sophie buys five cupcakes at 2 each, six doughnuts at 1 each, four slices of apple pie at 2 per slice, and fifteen cookies at 0.60 each.

In total, there are 120 + 600 = 720 redwoods in the national park. Altogether, there are 720 + 600 = 1320 pines and redwoods in the national park.

The total cost of the dinner is 80 + 10 = 90. The tip is 90 * 0.20 = 18. The total cost with tip is 90 + 18 = 108.

In the Western media, these events have been dubbed the Jasmine Revolution or Jasmine Spring after Tunisia's national flower and in keeping with the geopolitical nomenclature of \\"color revolutions\\".

The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.A: When was the French and Indian War?Rationale: This question is based on the following sentence in the passage- The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Your task is to summarize them.Example: A photo series on the popular Humans of New York Facebook page may have went viral and captured the nation’s attention last Tuesday, but for Daniel Kang, the post really hit home.    When Kang, a junior studying computer science at the University of Michigan, heard that the refugee pictured and his family were relocating to his hometown of Troy, Mich., he said he knew he had to help.    “I was really inspired by how intelligent he was and I knew a lot of people wanted to welcome him, so I thought, why not it be me?” he said.    On the Humans of New York Facebook page with over 16 million likes — including comments from President Obama — the seven-part picture series’ captions detail one Syrian scientist and his family’s tale of loss after a missile strike destroyed their home, forcing them to to flee to Turkey, now with plans of coming to the United States.    “Everything ended for us that day. That was our destiny. That was our share in life,” the scientist said. Battling stomach cancer, the loss of a home, career and seven family members, the man, whose name remains confidential to protect his identity as a refugee, expressed his hope for a new life in the United States.    “I learned today that I’m going to Troy, Michigan,” he said. “I know nothing about it. I just hope that it’s safe and that it’s a place where they respect science. I just want to get back to work. I want to be a person again. I don’t want the world to think I’m over. I’m still here.”    Knowing that refugees come to the United States with little more than they can carry, Kang quickly organized a crowdfunding campaign to help establish the man in his new home.    In four days, the GoFundMe page has raised over 16K in donations from over 700 people. On Saturday afternoon, actor Edward Norton also began a fundraiser for the scientist, raising even more for the refugee who says he “just wants to be a person again.”    “The response has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Kang. “A lot of people thanked me for doing a nice thing but I really feel like I was doing what anyone else would have done.”    Kang said he’s received many messages from people expressing their gratitude, those who want to reach out to the man personally, as well local companies interested in working with the scientist. This includes invitations to lecture at local colleges, research job opportunities and potential help from local medical facilities in treating the man’s stomach cancer.    “There’s definitely a lot of interest in helping him out,” he said.    The biggest concern, said Kang, are those skeptical of how the money will reach the man.    Kang, who has successfully crowdfunded in the past, is working closely with GoFundMe, the local refugee relocation agency Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, and is in communication with the Humans of New York staff to make sure all funding goes to the scientist.    In the end, Kang said he just hopes the scientist receives the welcome he deserves.    “If I could talk to him right now, I’d just tell him how sorry I am for everything he’s been through and that he’s coming to a great place. One of the things he said that resonated with me the most is that ‘I hope Troy is a place that appreciates science.’    I’d say out of all the cities in Michigan, Troy is the best place to raise a family, be a scientist and we can’t wait to have him.”    Oona Goodin-Smith is a student at Oakland University and a member of the USA TODAY College contributor network. ||||| I saw this story on one of my favorite sites, Humans of New York, and it moved me to tears. This man has suffered profound loss that would crush the spirit of many people and yet he still passionately wants a chance to contribute positively to the world. If we don’t welcome people like this into our communities and empower his dream of making an impact with his life, then we’re not the country we tell ourselves we are. Let’s reject the 'anti-human’ voices that tell us to fear refugees and show this man and his family what Americans are really made of. Let’s show that a country built by the energy and dreams of immigrants still believes in brave people who come here with hope for better life.    Everything we raise here will go to help this family so that the father can get the medical treatment he needs to live and pursue his work, and his family can build a new stable life after their tragedy, and…as the Scientist beautifully expresses…to support his dream of contributing to the world.    Thanks to Humans of New York for sharing these stories. Thanks to the team at CrowdRise for putting this together and figuring out how to get even the credit card transaction fees covered so we can get the maximum to the family.    Thanks to everyone who rallies together to create the power of the crowd. If enough of us kick in the price of two frappucinos, we can probably transform the experience of this family and show them that life can deliver healing and kindness, not just heartbreak.    Thanks to Benevolent, all donations are tax-deductible. We will work with Benevolent to use all donated funds to help this family and will seek to use any excess or unused funds to help the other 11 profiled in the HONY ‘Syrian American’ series.    Edward Norton ||||| DETROIT, MI -- Moved to tears by a Humans of New York feature on a Syrian refugee fleeing to Metro Detroit, Hollywood actor Edward Norton launched an online fundraiser that had raised nearly 450,000 for the widower and his four children as of Thursday afternoon.    \\"I didn't hear about it, but I want to thank him very much from the humanity perspective,\\" the man told NBC News after hearing about the fundraiser's success. \\"There are people outside who need that money much more than me.\\"    The man asked NBC to refer to him as \\"Abu Ammar,\\" a fake named used to protect his relatives who remain in Syria. He's known to many on the Internet simply as \\"The Scientist,\\" which is also his profession.    The refugee's family was scheduled to arrive in Troy, a Detroit suburb, Thursday. He and four surviving children spent the last two years in Instanbul, Turkey. They fled civil-war-torn Syria after the man's wife and one of his daughters were killed in a missile attack on April 6, 2013.    His is one of 12 families featured by Humans of New York and cleared to resettle in the U.S.    \\"I learned today that I'm going to Troy, Michigan,\\" the man told Humans of New York. \\"I know nothing about it. I just hope that it's safe and that it's a place where they respect science. I just want to get back to work. I want to be a person again. I don't want the world to think I'm over. I'm still here.\\"    The story made rounds throughout the Internet and even garnered a response from President Barack Obama's official Facebook page:    As a husband and a father, I cannot even begin to imagine the loss you've endured. You and your family are an inspiration. I know that the great people of Michigan will embrace you with the compassion and support you deserve. Yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we're proud that you'll pursue your dreams here. Welcome to your new home. You're part of what makes America great.    ,Norton, known for his roles in movies like \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"Birdman,\\" wrote in the description of his online fundraiser:    If we don't welcome people like this into our communities and empower his dream of making an impact with his life, then we're not the country we tell ourselves we are.

Posted by Humans of New York on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 ||||| ISTANBUL — The grieving refugee who touched hearts as \\"The Scientist\\" on the Humans of New York blog only mustered a brief smile when told that a Hollywood star had helped raise 450,000 for him.    Hours before flying to Michigan to start a new life in the U.S. on Thursday, the cancer-stricken Syrian civil engineer glanced down.    \\"I didn't hear about it, but I want to thank him very much from the humanity perspective,\\" he said after NBC News revealed the crowdfunding appeal. Oscar-nominated actor Edward Norton was moved to tears after reading the refugee's biography on the photography site last week and launched the fundraiser.    \\"There are people outside who need that money much more than me,\\" The Scientist said, displaying the sort of compassion and humility that helped his story go viral.    The Scientist, who asked NBC News to refer to him as \\"Abu Ammar\\" to protect family in Syria, said his life was shattered by a bomb that killed his wife and daughter just under three years ago.    He was later diagnosed with stomach cancer, and has had to care for five remaining children.    They include a teenage son, who is still reeling after watching his mother die, and a daughter who carries inside of her shrapnel from the attack on April 6, 2013.    \\"When a bomb drops you don't know where it comes from,\\" he said. \\"There is no question our lives changed after that ... 180 degrees. I am mentally tired, in overwhelming sadness.\\"    “ As long as there are good people in the world … then we can stop this bloodshed”    On Thursday, Abu Ammar and four of his children flew to Troy, Michigan, as part of a United Nations refugee resettlement program.    For about two years, the family had been living close to destitution in Turkey. But the drive to succeed still lingers, Abu Ammar said.    \\"I've had ambitions since I was a child, and right now I'm still that same child with the same ambitions,\\" he said. \\"But I still have a message — sometimes when I'm talking to myself I say, 'No, I'm not supposed to die. I need to live long enough to realize my message to humanity.'\\"    Abu Ammar's story on Humans of New York, a popular blog started in 2010 that spawned a bestselling book, prompted an outpouring of compassion. Even President Barack Obama contributed, calling Abu Ammar and his family an \\"inspirations\\" on HONY's Facebook page.    \\"Yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we're proud that you'll pursue your dreams here.\\" Obama wrote. \\"Welcome to your new home. You're part of what makes America great.\\"    Last night President @BarackObama wrote a very sweet welcome note to the scientist in Tuesday's story. pic.twitter.com/ZGrn3gOdR7 — Brandon Stanton (@humansofny) December 10, 2015    Norton, who starred in \\"Birdman,\\" \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"American History X,\\" set out to help pay The Scientist's medical expenses.    \\"This man has suffered profound loss that would crush the spirit of many people and yet he still passionately wants a chance to contribute positively to the world,\\" Norton wrote.    The resettlement of Syrian and Muslim refugees in the United States is controversial, especially in the aftermath of attacks by Islamic extremists in Paris and San Bernardino. Some politicians — notably GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump — have called for a ban on Muslims entering the country.    Abu Ammar told NBC News he didn't know anything about the debate over Muslims and immigration raging in the U.S. He also didn't have a solution to the war raging in his home country.    \\"I don't like to get into politics because I am a man of science, and I can separate science and politics completely,\\" he said. \\"But as long as there are good people in the world, and everyone looks into his or her conscience, then we can stop this bloodshed.\\"    Abu Ammar added: \\"No one benefits from people dying, and wars overall never benefit anybody — so let's hope God can help everyone and put out this fire.\\" |||||Output: A Syrian refugee whose moving story went viral earlier this month starts his new life in Troy, Michigan, on Thursday, NBC News reports. The refugee—who wants to keep his real name out of the media to protect family members still in Syria—is known as \\"The Scientist\\" on the blog Humans of New York, where he was first profiled. \\"I learned today that I’m going to Troy, Michigan,\\" The Scientist told HONY. \\"I know nothing about it. I just hope that it’s safe and that it’s a place where they respect science.\\" According to MLive, The Scientist left Syria in 2013 after a bomb killed his wife and one of his daughters. Since then, he's been diagnosed with stomach cancer and was barely scraping by in Turkey. Despite being \\"in overwhelming sadness,\\" he and his surviving children are hoping for a new start in the US, he tells NBC. Thanks to his story—which even got the attention of President Obama—The Scientist will have some help to get that new start. NBC reports actor Edward Norton was moved to tears after reading The Scientist's story and started a crowdfunding page that has raised nearly 450,000. \\"I didn't hear about it, but I want to thank him very much from the humanity perspective,\\" The Scientist says. \\"There are people outside who need that money much more than me.\\" A Michigan college student was also inspired to help after hearing The Scientist would be moving to his hometown, according to USA Today. His fundraising page has raised more than 16,000. \\"I’d say out of all the cities in Michigan, Troy is the best place to raise a family, be a scientist, and we can’t wait to have him,\\" Daniel Kang says.This is a good example. The output correctly summarizes the articles.New input case for you: Remember the gray whale that was recently spotted off Israel? Its sighting was huge news because gray whales haven't been seen in the eastern hemisphere since at least the eighteenth century; the only gray whale populations remaining in the world are in the Pacific Ocean. The likeliest explanation for the whale's appearance in the Mediterranean was that, during a summer feeding season north of Alaska, it somehow made its way through either the Northeast or Northwest Passage before turning south into the Atlantic.    Well, the whale has been spotted again.    On May 30, at about 4.30 p.m. local time, researchers saw the whale off the coast of Spain, near Barcelona. Comparative photographs confirm it was the same one that was seen off Israel (then again, it would be an even more remarkable story if it were not, and there were more than one gray whale swimming around the Mediterranean). The whale, having somehow found its way through the Strait of Gibraltar and traveled east as far as it could, has now made it back to the western side of the sea.    Speculation alert: Right about now, its brethren in the Pacific population it has left behind are swimming north toward the Arctic; it is possible, perhaps even likely, that instinct is urging our wayward whale to do the same, and that it is looking for a way around the Iberian Peninsula in an attempt to do so.    TreeHugger: Gray Whale, Extinct for Centuries, Sighted in Mediterranean    In an email to Discovery News, Manel Gazo of Spanish cetacean research and conservation organization SUBMON said that coordinated efforts are underway to relocate the whale in order to track it, advise ship traffic to exercise caution in its vicinity, and secure a biopsy or a sample of sloughed skin to confirm the population whence the whale came.    In the meantime, thousands of miles from home, the whale swims on ...        Images courtesy Dr. Manel Gazo ||||| By Matt Walker    Editor, Earth News        The whale is seen again off Barcelona    A mysterious gray whale sighted off the coast of Israel in the Mediterranean Sea has been seen again off the north east coast of Spain.    The second sighting, made 23 days and 3000km after the first, has continued to perplex whale experts.    Gray whales were thought to be extinct across the Atlantic Ocean, so the appearance of an individual within the Mediterranean Sea was a major surprise.    Now it is not clear where the whale is heading or why.    Once, three major populations of gray (also spelt grey) whale existed: in the western and eastern North Pacific Ocean, and in the North Atlantic.    However, the North Atlantic population of gray whale became extinct sometime in the 17th or 18th Century, for reasons that are not clear.    No sightings of the species had been made in the Atlantic Ocean since.    That was until a single individual gray whale was sighted off the coast of Herzliya Marina, Israel on 9 May this year.    That sighting excited and bemused experts: it could either mean that the gray whale had recolonised the Atlantic Ocean, or that a single gray whale had shattered the record for the longest known migration by the species, which usually make a round trip of 15-20,000km each year.    Previous sighting off Israel    On 30th May 2010, members of SUBMON, a non-governmental organisation dedicated to the conservation and assessment of marine habitats, sighted a gray whale in front of Barcelona's harbour.    Whale expert Manuel Castellote at the US National Marine Mammal Lab compared photos of this whale with those taken earlier in May in Israeli waters.    These comparisons confirmed the match, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) have announced.    \\"It's wonderful news to hear of a resighting of this animal, where it's heading is the burning question,\\" says Nicola Hodgins of the WDCS, which has its headquarters in Wiltshire, UK.    SOURCES    Visit the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society    The whale appeared to be consistently heading south at a slow pace.    It is the first time a gray whale has been seen in the western Mediterranean Sea.    \\"Its likely route would be to leave the Mediterranean, and then head north along the coasts of Portugal and France, possibly coming as far north as the UK and North Atlantic waters\\" says Ms Hodgins. |||||Output:","answer":"Gray whales became extinct in the Atlantic centuries ago, so experts believe the one that was spotted off Spain's Mediterranean coast recently is either incredible evidence of a recolonization, or incredibly lost. The whale is likely the same one seen off the coast of Israel last month, but experts have no idea where it's headed, the BBC reports. The most likely scenario is that the whale took a wrong turn during summer feeding season north of Alaska and headed south through the Northwest Passage. Its Pacific brethren will be swimming back to the Arctic around now, Discovery notes, so the whale may now be following its instinct to head north, but hasn't yet found a way around the Iberian peninsula."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: no","answer":"The question is: Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact?\\"Snow White possesses the superpower of flying.\\"Step-by-step reasoning process: Snow White does not fly in the story or movie."},{"question":"q: After someone lives a life what happens?Options:- tobem- death- growing older- experience things- breathea: Death is the end of life. living life ends with death.The answer is deathq: Where might I find information on current events in print form?Options:- internet- car- television- book- newspapera: Newspaper is a printed publication consisting of folded unstapled sheets and containing news, articles, advertisements and correspondence.

The first time i saw this i think i was like 11 maybe at a slumber party, i was so scared. Watching it again recently and i didnt find it as scary, but i thought it was very clever and a really decent film. Helen Lyle is a writer working on a story about the Candyman, an urban legend in which if you say the name Candyman into the mirror five times, the Candyman comes to get you. So Helen goes about to prove that the urban legend isnt true and says Candyman five times in the mirror. Soon she is being stalked by the Candyman and she will live to regret her actions. Both Helen (played by Virgina Madsen I think?) and the Candyman (Tony Todd) are portrayed superbly. I also absolutley love the score by Phillip Glass, the music is so perfect for the movie and its also very creepy, yet cool. Anyway check this out all you horror fans.

Review: Trini's review was laughable at best,especially when exagerating comments like \\"edison force are superheroes\\" sounds like a review to gather one's attention especially the comic-to-movie enthusiasts. The only saving grace in this film would be Freeman and Spacey (Whom both starred in recent superhero film respectivly;Batman begins and superman returns.) I guess they need a little extra cash to pay for their boats,cars etc.Justin Timberlake was always a hack performer,ergo his acting credibility is no surprise. LL is another reason why rappers,pop stars should not become actors..it's not branching out..more like selling out. the movie is too slow paced for my tastes and the title Edison Force, is a marketing ploy to attract action movie buffs. (It was originally titled Edison)I would recommend The Star chamber and even vigilante force over this turd. Thank You.

The apples weigh four ounces each and the oranges weight 3 ounces. Each plastic bag in the grocery store can hold 49 ounces of fruit before it splits. If Martha wants to put an equal number of apples and oranges in each bag, and she wants to buy 3 full bags of fruit, how many ounces of apples should she buy?[Answer]First figure out how many ounces of fruit fit in three bags by multiplying the number of bags by the number of ounces per bag: 49 oz / bag * 3 bags = 147 oz. Since Marta wants the same number of apples and oranges in each bag, we know the fruits always come in pairs. Find the weight of each pair of fruit by adding the weight of one apple to the weight of one orange: 3 oz + 4 oz = 7oz. Now figure out how many pairs of fruit Marta needs to fill the bags by dividing the total weight in the bags by the weight of each pair of fruit: 147 oz / 7 oz = 21. Now multiply the number of apples Marta needs to buy (21) by the weight per apple (4 oz) to find how many ounces she should buy: 21 * 4 oz = 84 oz. The answer is 84.Q: Jo-Bob hopped into the hot air balloon, released the anchor rope, and pulled on the lift chain, which ignited the flame and provided the warm air that caused the balloon to rise. When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of 50 feet per minute. But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of 10 feet per minute. During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for 15 minutes, then released the rope for 10 minutes, then pulled the chain for another 15 minutes, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth. During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?A: The first 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Releasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10 * 10 = 100 feet. The second 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Thus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750 - 100 + 750 = 1400 feet above the earth's surface. The answer is 1400.Question: Mr. Desmond bought three times as many toys for his younger son as he bought for his elder son. If the elder son received 60 toys, how many toys did Mr Desmond buy?Answer: The younger son received three times as many toys as the elder son, which is 3 * 60 = 180 toys. Since he bought the toys together, he purchased 180 + 60 = 240 toys. The answer is 240.[Question]A plane takes off at 6:00 a.m. and flies for 4 hours from New York City to Chicago. The plane stays at the port in Chicago for 1 hour and then departs for Miami. If the aircraft took three times as many hours to fly to Miami than it took to fly from New York to Chicago, calculate the total time to travel from New York to Miami.[Answer]Before departing for Miami from Chicago, the total time the plane had taken for the journey is 4 + 1 = 5 hours. It took 3 * 4 = 12 hours to fly to Miami. . The total flying time from New York to Miami is 12 + 5 = 17 hours. The answer is 17.Q: Perry made a recipe that serves four people.

And that's the beauty of Connelly and Bosch. Keep 'em coming, Michael. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?PositiveQ: Title: My best purchase ever! Review: My 11-week old daughter absolutely loves this gym! At first, she wasn't too excited about it - it only held her attention for a few minutes. But over the last 6 weeks she has fallen in love with the musical star (she smiles and coos) and has started to bat at & hold on to the toys. I like the fact that you can raise or lower the toys with the extra links, and I have also purchased different toys by other manufacturers that are easily slipped into the loops on the toy bar for variety. She loves the motion setting (she kicks & starts the toy herself) and the music & lights are actually very entertaining. Overall, this is the best purchase I have made for her to date.

In other words, their site is broken, and I can't send messages to support.So they get 1 star because Amazon doesn't allow me to set 0 stars :) Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?AnswerNegative(Question)Title: Its works but not well.

To emphasize both hospital and nonhospital settings, it is sometimes instead called a health care -- associated infection (HAI or HCAI). Such an infection can be acquired in hospital, nursing home, rehabilitation facility, outpatient clinic, or other clinical settings. Infection is spread to the susceptible patient in the clinical setting by various means. Health care staff can spread infection, in addition to contaminated equipment, bed linens, or air droplets. The infection can originate from the outside environment, another infected patient, staff that may be infected, or in some cases, the source of the infection can not be determined. In some cases the microorganism originates from the patient's own skin microbiota, becoming opportunistic after surgery or other procedures that compromise the protective skin barrier.

Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah was defeated by the British forces of Sir Robert Clive in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Thereafter the Nawab of Bengal became a \\"puppet ruler\\" depending on military support from British East India company to secure their throne. Siraj-ud-Daulah was replaced by Mir Jaffer. He was personally led to the throne by Robert Clive, after triumph of the British in the battle. He briefly tried to re-assert his power by allying with the Dutch, but this plan was ended by the Battle of Chinsurah. After the defeat at Battle of Buxar and grant of the Diwani (revenue collection) of Bengal by the then Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, to the British East India Company in August 1765 and the appointment of Warren Hastings by the East India Company as their first Governor General of Bengal in 1773, the Nawabs authority became restricted. By 1773, British East India company asserted much authority and formed the Bengal Presidency over areas ruled by the Nawabs i.e. the Bengal subah, along with some other regions and abolished the system of Dual Government. In 1793 (during Nawab Mubarak ud-Daulah's reign), the Nizamat (military power, civil and criminal justice) was abolished, British East India company thus annexed this former Mughal province as part of their empire and took complete control of the region, and the Nawabs of Bengal became mere pensioners of the British East India Company. All the Diwan offices except the Diwan Ton were also abolished.Answer this question: who abolished the dual government system in bengal?CoT: To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: By 1773, British East India company asserted much authority and formed the Bengal Presidency over areas ruled by the Nawabs i.e. the Bengal subah, along with some other regions and abolished the system of Dual Government.Answer: Aberystwyth , Wales.

Most questions can have only one correct answer.[Q]: Passage: Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971, Drake's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends. He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.Island Records urged Drake to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as \\"unbelievable amounts\\" of cannabis and exhibiting \\"the first signs of psychosis\\", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: \\"This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong.\\". Question: What is the last name of the person who agreed to include bass and drum tracks?[A]: Northern Sky.[Q]: Passage: Four lifelong friends from the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown, Douglas \\"Doug\\" MacRay, James \\"Jem\\" Coughlin, Albert \\"Gloansy\\" MacGloan, and Desmond \\"Dez\\" Elden, rob a bank. They take the manager, Claire Keesey, hostage, but release her unharmed. When they find out Claire lives in their neighborhood, Doug begins to follow her to find out how much she has told the police, and to make sure that Jem does not eliminate her as a witness. Soon a romance grows between them, which Doug hides from the gang. As they grow closer, Doug tells Claire of his search for his long-lost mother, who he believes went to live with his aunt in Tangerine, Florida. He also recounts his chance to be a professional hockey player which he threw away for a life of crime, following in his father's footsteps. She in turn tells Doug that she saw a tattoo on one of the robbers, and he realizes that she can identify Jem and send them all to prison. He knows that Jem will kill her if he discovers the truth, so he persuades her that the authorities cannot protect her, and she decides not to tell the police.After Claire tells Doug about being harassed and her car vandalized by Alex, a local Dominican thug, Doug enlists Jem for a favor, which they can never talk about. Doug and Jem don hockey masks and violently assault the offenders without Jem knowing the true reason for the favor is to protect Claire.

Product review: Our kids received the Jumbo Music Block as a gift for Christmas of 2001. Since that time, it has surprised me how little our kids have played with this item. Amazon.com rates this toy for 24 months and older, but I submit that the interest for this toy probably ends at 24 months (Neurosmith rates the age range as 12 months and older). The effective age range for interest in this toy should be considered between 12 and 24 months. The Jumbo Music Block would seem to hold the interest of a child who does not move around a great bit, but as soon as our youngest child could easily move around on her own, the interest in this toy disappeared. It is hard for a toy to be educational if your children don't play with it.....The durability rating is a reflection on the fact that we have had no problems with the toy, but this should be judged keeping in mind how little the toy has been used.(A).decreaseQues:You are considering whether to buy a product.

If a keyboard costs 20, how much does a printer cost?A: 15 keyboards at 20 per keyboard cost a total of 15 * 20 = 300. The total cost of printers and keyboards is 2050 so 25 printers cost 2050 - 300 = 1750. 1 printer cost 1750 / 25 = 70. The answer is 70.Q: Colton had 72 dolphin stickers. He gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends. He also gave his friend Mandy 2 more than he gave his three friends total.  And he gave Justin 10 less than Mandy.

In total, Colton gave away 12 + 14 + 4 stickers = 30 stickers. Colton's number of total stickers at the end is 72 - 30 = 42 stickers.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Why did the girl step in front of the van?  A. She wanted to stop the van.  B. not enough information  C. She was trying to cross the road.  D. She dropped something on the asphalt.Ans:B-----Ques:The pews were packed at First Baptist Church, Coreyville. As part-time music minister of the church, Greg Tenorly sat in his usual place on the podium, behind and slightly to the left of the pastor. He wondered why attendance was up. It was a perfect day--seventy degrees, sunny. That had to be part of the reason. And the sermon title was 'Forgiveness Fighters.' People would much rather hear a sermon about forgiveness than one about Hell. Everybody wanted to be forgiven. But when it came to forgiving others--many people fight it. The pastor said these folks were the Forgiveness Fighters. He read a scripture passage. Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. When Greg heard these verses, which he knew by memory, it was like a slap in the face. How many times had he already forgiven his father? But he knew that 'seventy times seven' did not mean literally 490 times. The number 'seven' in the Bible symbolized completeness. It meant forgiving an unlimited number of times. But how could Greg ever forgive his father for killing his mother? Maybe if Greg had been there it wouldn't have happened. But he had moved out of the house during his first semester at Lamar University--even though it was only forty minutes away, in Beaumont. A fellow music major had been more than happy to let Greg share the little rent house and the expenses. Ralph Tenorly had sent his wife to the grocery store for more chips and dip. The big game was already starting, and there were no snacks in the house. But on her way back home, a pickup truck blew through a stop sign, crashing into the driver's side of the car. Barbara was killed instantly. Why did greg go to church that day?  A. Obligation  B. To socialize  C. not enough information  D. Nothing better to do.Ans:C-----Ques:Randy Poskin, a soybean farmer in rural Illinois, voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response. \\"I'm not sure,\\" Poskin said. Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday. Some U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \\"hair on fire\\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy. \\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\\" he said in a statement to VOA. Zarit pointed to a recent survey suggesting members of his organization wanted the White House to \\"advocate more strongly for a level playing field and for reciprocal treatment to... how long has the ban lasted?

It takes for ever to finish and sounds like its factory inside. The paper feed does not come out very far and the picture paper holder sits right on top and can not move. I have never used the photo paper tray and yet it tells me sometimes that I have to put it down, when it's never been up and won't clear until I give it a good whack or reboot which takes about an hour.

Review: Jeff Bates is so much more than I can write on this small space. The CD, \\"Rainbow Man\\", is a must have for any TRUE country music fan. I don't mean those of you who like country to sound like rock and roll, or rap or pop or ANYTHING besides REAL COUNTRY. Jeff's voice does resemble the great Conway Twitty in an amazing way, but for those of us who love him, we will definately say he has a style all his own. I've been fortunate enough to see Jeff and hear him sing 4 times in the last year and had our picture with him in Country Weekly magazine. He has an amazing personality, a strong, sure, masculine voice, and a great career in country music. There's not a bad song on this CD!! My favorite is \\"My Mississippi\\" and \\"Wings of Mama's Prayers\\", but \\"The Love Song\\" will always be special b/c it's the first song I ever heard Jeff sing. Do yourself a favor, if you don't have this CD in your collection, BUY IT NOW!!! Answer:Answer:","answer":"Yes"},{"question":"Teacher: In this task, you are given two statements.
