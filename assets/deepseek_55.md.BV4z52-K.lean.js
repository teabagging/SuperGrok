Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4, also known as CD152) has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of T cell activation. Its membrane expression is highly regulated by endocytosis and trafficking through the secretory lysosome pathway. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, LYST. It results in defective membrane targeting of the proteins present in secretory lysosomes, and it is associated with a variety of features, including a lymphoproliferative syndrome with hemophagocytosis. The murine equivalent of CHS, beige mice, present similar characteristics but do not develop the lymphoproliferative syndrome. We show herein that CTLA-4 is present in enlarged, abnormal vesicles in CHS T cells and is not properly expressed at the cell surface after T cell activation, whereas its surface expression is not impaired. It is therefore proposed that the defective surface expression of CTLA-4 by CHS T cells is involved in the generation of lymphoproliferative disease. This observation may provide insight into the role of CTLA-4 in humans..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"inherited disorder\\", \\"Chediak-Higashi syndrome\\", \\"lymphoproliferative syndrome\\", \\"CHS\\", \\"hemophagocytosis\\", \\"lymphoproliferative disease\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

Sixty patients with mild senile organic brain syndrome were divided into two groups of 30; one group was treated for 90 days with 300 mg daily of naftidrofuryl (Praxilene), and the other group received placebo. The patients were tested before treatment and at 30, 60 and 90 days after the beginning of treatment. The data indicated that the SPT indirectly assesses short-term memory, is resistant to practice effects, and is drug-sensitive. It is suggested that the SPT might become the test of choice in the indirect assessment of short-term memory in the elderly.Title 2:[Efficacy and tolerance of long-term naftidrofuryl treatment of patients with senile dementia.

The diagnostic criteria for dementia are primarily clinical and are based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. The Hachinski score and computed tomography of the brain help distinguish between degenerative and vascular dementias.                This study examined the efficacy of naftidrofuryl in patients with vascular or mixed dementia.                This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study compared naftidrofuryl 600 mg/d with placebo for 1 year in patients with vascular or mixed dementia. A preliminary 2-month washout period allowed selection of patients who were compliant with treatment. The end point was change in the scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale and the Mini-Mental State Examination.                Eighty-four patients were assessable on an intent-to-treat basis, and 74 were assessable for the per-protocol analysis (on-treatment). Statistically significant improvements in cognitive and global function were observed in patients receiving naftidrofuryl. Naftidrofuryl was well tolerated, and produced no clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results.                The results of this study suggest that naftidrofuryl is effective and well tolerated in treating the symptoms of vascular and mixed dementia.Title 4:Naftidrofuryl in the treatment of vascular dementia.Abstract 4:The design of this study was based on the European guidelines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. After a placebo run-in period of 4 weeks, patients with a diagnosis of vascular dementia (VaD) were randomised to receive either 400 mg naftidrofuryl/day, 600 mg naftidrofuryl/day or placebo for 6 months. The patients were assessed using the ADAS-cog, the SCAG, the NOSGER and the CGI item 2 scale. The primary analysis was undertaken on the ITT population. At the end of the study, significantly more patients in the treatment groups showed no deterioration on both ADAS-cog and SCAG scales compared with placebo (400 mg p = 0.005, 600mg p = 0.015). There were also significant differences between the active and placebo groups for the individual scales. This study has demonstrated that treatment with naftidrofuryl can slow the rate of deterioration of patients with vascular dementia.Title 5:Efficacy of naftidrofuryl in patients with moderate senile dementia.Abstract 5:In a controlled double-blind study, 78 patients with moderate senile dementia were randomly assigned to 3-months' treatment with 200 mg naftidrofuryl twice daily in slow-release form or with placebo. The patients were selected on the basis of the EACG (Echelle d'Appréciation Clinique en Gériatrie), which was also used as main criterion for confirmatory analysis of the efficacy of naftidrofuryl. A further main criterion was the SGRS (Stockton Geriatric Rating Scale). Secondary criteria examined were visual memory as tested in the Benton test, verbal memory as tested in the Rey test and numerical memory as tested in the digit-span test. The patients' concentration was tested in the Zazzo test. The tests were performed before the patients were admitted to the study and after 1 and 3-months' treatment. Confirmatory analysis of the primary criteria showed a significant treatment difference in favour of naftidrofuryl in the form of improvement in the global symptoms of senile dementia both in the EACG and in the SGRS, the scores in the naftidrofuryl group improving by 15% compared with only 5% in the placebo group. This was paralleled by a significant improvement in visual and verbal memory in the naftidrofuryl group in comparison with placebo. The naftidrofuryl patients also showed a greater improvement in concentration than the placebo group. One patient in the naftidrofuryl group suffered briefly from gastro-intestinal symptoms.

Ectopic Atoh1 expression in non-sensory supporting cells( SCs) in mouse cochleae induces their partial conversion to hair cells( HCs) at low efficiency. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole mouse sensory epithelia harvested at multiple time points after conditional overexpression of Atoh1. Pseudotemporal ordering revealed that converted HCs( cHCs) are present along a conversion continuum that correlates with both endogenous and exogenous Atoh1 expression. Bulk sequencing of isolated cell populations and single-cell qPCR confirmed 51 transcription factors, including Isl1, are differentially expressed among cHCs, SCs and HCs. In transgenic mice, co-overexpression of Atoh1 and Isl1 enhanced the HC conversion efficiency. Together, our study shows how high-resolution transcriptional profiling of direct cell conversion can identify co-reprogramming factors required for efficient conversion.Introduction:During development, pluripotent stem cells follow lineage-specific pathways to differentiate into mature cells that can be converted back to pluripotent cells by defined transcription factors( TFs)[1]. In addition, direct lineage conversion( also termed transdifferentiation) between differentiated cells has been demonstrated in heart, pancreas, brain, and other tissues through the use of defined TFs[2–5] or pharmacologic agents[6]. Such conversions have provided a deeper mechanistic understanding of development and hold promise for regenerative medicine. Several studies have used single-cell RNA-seq to identify distinct intermediate conversion states, providing valuable insights into how to improve the efficiency and complete the direct conversions[4, 7, 8]. The cells of the mouse inner-ear cochlear sensory epithelium( organ of Corti) are post-mitotic after birth and exhibit limited spontaneous regeneration that is only present during the first week after birth[9–11]. Atoh1, a lineage-specific TF for sensory hair cells( HCs), directly converts non-sensory supporting cells( SCs) to HCs in cochlear explant culture, as well as in vivo[12–15]. The current model is that ectopic Atoh1 induces the expression of endogenous Atoh1 in SCs to initiate the conversion. This Atoh1-mediated HC conversion is analogous to the natural HC regeneration in chicken inner ears or mammalian vestibular organs[16, 17]. However, the Atoh1-converted HCs( cHCs) in mouse cochleae exhibit immature morphology and do not express several terminal differentiation markers( e. g., Slc26a5 encoding prestin and Ocm encoding oncomodulin). In addition, the process is inefficient, with conversion rates of 6%–20%[13, 14]. Consequently, a more precise understanding of the molecular events underlying Atoh1-induced HC conversion is needed to identify additional factors required for improving the efficiency and completion of the conversion. In this study, we performed unbiased transcriptional profiling of all cells present in the organ of Corti during Atoh1-mediated SC-to-HC conversion at multiple time points in vivo. This high-resolution transcriptomic analysis revealed new mechanisms of HC conversion in vivo and identified co-reprogramming factors.Discussion:Based on our multi-faceted transcriptome profiling, our cHCs start with donor SCs( P12) when Atoh1-HA is ectopically expressed, gradually decrease expression of many SC-enriched genes, concomitantly gain HC signatures, and eventually reach the cHC3 state that closely resembles neonatal HCs( i. e., P7 OHCs). These results are consistent with our previous reports using morphological and immunostaining criteria[14, 21]. In >125 individual cHCs and >161 SCs/OHCs at three independent time points( P12, P26 and P33), the cHC conversion is a continuum, a conclusion also supported by our bulk RNA-seq and single-cell qPCR analyses. The pseudotemporal separation of the conversion enabled the logical identification of TFs that are required at different stages of conversion. Interestingly, we discover two clusters of early transition states( cHC1/2) that transiently express different sets of TF genes that can potentially contribute to the initial conversion from SCs at P12. By identifying differentially expressed TF genes between cHC3 and mature OHCs, we also list TFs that can presumably promote the completion of conversion. By gene network analysis, we discover the key TFs for conversion, including Atoh1, Pou4f3 and their closely correlated TFs, several of which have been previously demonstrated to contribute to SC-to-HC conversion[13, 14, 21, 39]. For example, Pou4f3 functionally promotes Atoh1-mediated conversion in vitro( together with Gfi1)[39] and in vivo[21], while GATA3 plays a key role in the Atoh1-mediated conversion in adult cochleae in vivo[21]. Future analyses of our high-resolution profiling can provide further insight into Atoh1-mediated conversion. For example, conversion paths are dependent on the starting donor cell’s genetic and epigenetic states, driving factors, and environment[2, 5, 40]. It is possible that distinct subpopulations of SCs provide the appropriate cellular context where Atoh1 has access to the required target loci to induce further conversion. Further work is needed to determine how closely early cHCs( i. e., cHC1/2) resemble otic progenitors, bypassing potentially harmful( i. e., tumorigenic) aspects of the progenitor phenotype. Along with the revealed continuous process of conversion( from SC1 to cHC3), we also found that the expression of endogenous Atoh1 is progressively upregulated, with the lowest expression in the SC1 state and the highest expression in the cHC3 state. Such upregulation of endogenous Atoh1 is attributed to the ectopic expression of Atoh1-HA and the transcriptional autoregulation of the endogenous Atoh1[31]. Interestingly, Atoh1-HA is also progressively upregulated during conversion from SC1 to cHC3. In fact, endogenous Atoh1 and transgenic Atoh1-HA were highly correlated in >125 cHCs analyzed. It is commonly assumed that the CAG promoter drives constant high levels of gene expression in all cells at all times; however, this may not be true in the organ of Corti. In support of this, tdTomato reporter expression driven by the CAG promoter at the ROSA locus also exhibits strikingly different intensities between IHCs and OHCs at P76( S3B Fig). It is possible that both the CAG promoter for Atoh1-HA and the endogenous Atoh1 promoter are subject to transcriptional regulation by some common transcriptional or epigenetic factors[41]. It is also possible that Atoh1 and Atoh1-HA mRNAs are stabilized by common but unknown RNA binding proteins or miRNAs. Interestingly, Dicer mutant mice exhibited immature hair bundle morphology strikingly similar to that in Atoh1-HA-driven converted HCs[21, 42], linking miRNAs to Atoh1 mRNA stability. For most direct reprogramming, multiple TFs function together, simultaneously or consecutively, either in the initiation stage or the later stage, to determine the cell fate and to induce efficient and complete conversion[2–5]. Thus, it is critical to identify TFs that improve Atoh1-mediated conversion. Here we have identified and validated 52 TF genes, including Atoh1, that are differentially expressed in SCs, cHCs, and OHCs. Notably, of these 52 TFs, Pou4f3 functionally promotes Atoh1-mediated conversion in vitro( together with Gfi1)[39] and in vivo[21] or by itself promotes conversion in vivo[21]. Interestingly, several TFs among the 52 are involved in development and cell fate reprogramming. For example, Isl1 is critical for pacemaker cell differentiation in the heart[43], and for motor neuron differentiation[44]. Several TFs( Isl1, Tub, Zbtb38, Zfp827, Aff3, Mixip and Zfp532) have been shown to be involved in pacemaker cell conversion in the heart[43]. Moreover, overexpression of Lhx3 in cochlear nonsensory cells is suggested to lead to Isl1 suppression[45]. Isl1 is also co-expressed with Atoh1 during early cochlear development[46]. Here we provided ex vivo and in vivo evidence that Isl1 indeed synergistically enhances Atoh1-mediated conversion in the cochlea. However, it remains unknown how Isl1 promotes Atoh1-mediated conversion. Notably, by forming complexes with different TFs( Lhx3 vs Phox2a), Isl1 can program ESCs to distinct cell identities( spinal vs. cranial motor neurons)[44, 47] by turning on variable groups of target genes determined by its binding partners. Thus, it will be important to identify the specific Isl1 binding complex in Atoh1-induced conversion. Moreover, future studies( e. g. single-cell RNA-seq and electrophysiology) on the Atoh1 and Isl1-converted HCs are also needed to molecularly and biologically characterize these cells to examine whether Isl1 also promotes HC maturation in vivo. Nonetheless, these results for Isl1 ex vivo and in vivo undoubtedly validate our single-cell transcriptomic analyses and identify 51 TFs that can promote Atoh1-mediated conversion in vivo. SC-to-HC direct conversion is initially predominant in chicken HC regeneration that also starts with upregulation of Atoh1 in SCs[48] where the initial nuclear migration and other morphological cellular transformation are also similar to what we have characterized in our Atoh1-HA ectopic expression cochlear models[14, 21]. These parallels strengthen the notion that Atoh1-mediated HC conversion in the mature cochlea recapitulates the initial phases of naturally occurring HC conversion in non-mammalian species[48] and mammalian utricles[16]. Of note, our Atoh1-mediated SC-to-HC conversion path is remarkably similar to those reprogramming paths described in other regenerative systems. Ascl1-driven reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblast( MEF) cells to induced neurons( iN) in vitro exhibited a continuous conversion path nearly identical to the Atoh1-mediated conversion path[8]. Both Atoh1 and Ascl1 appear to act in a similar manner where donor cells overcome threshold barriers to initiate simultaneous upregulation of target cell fate genes and downregulation of donor cell fate genes. Moreover, in the MEF-to-iN conversion in vitro, additional reprogramming factors( Brn2 and Mytl1) further prevented competing myogenic programs and/or reversal to the initial donor state. While in our Atoh1-mediated SC-to-HC conversion, additional factors may play similar roles as Brn2 and Mytl1; the 51 TFs identified here may also benefit other regenerative systems by improving their efficiency and completion. Together, our studies represent a major step towards understanding cochlear HC regeneration in vivo, with the potential to further improve the ongoing ATOH1 gene therapy in the clinic for patients with hearing loss. More importantly, our approach provides a valued strategy for better studying cochlea and other regenerative systems where conversion efficiency and completion are also central challenges.","answer":"The ongoing ATOH1 gene therapy clinical trial offers promise for hearing restoration in humans .

The aim of this study was to design thiolated surface stabilized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (TSS-SPIONs) for efficient internalization with high MRI sensitivity. TSS-SPIONs were developed by chelation between thiolated chitosan-thioglycolic acid (chitosan-TGA) hydrogel and iron ions (Fe (2+) /Fe (3 +)). Likely, unmodified chitosan hydrogel SPIONs (UC-SPIONs) and uncoated SPIONs were used as control. Moreover, TSS-SPIONs were investigated regarding to their iron core size, hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, iron contents, molar relaxivities (r1 and r2), and cellular internalization. TSS-SPIONs demonstrated an iron oxide core diameter (crystallite size by XRD) of 3.1±0.02 nm, a hydrodynamic diameter of 94±20 nm, a zeta potential of + 21±5mV, and an iron content of 3.6±0.9mg/mL. In addition, internalization of TSS-SPIONs into human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) from umbilical cord blood was more than threefold and 17-fold higher in contrast to UC-SPIONs and SPIONs, respectively. With twofold lower incubation iron concentration of TSS-SPIONs, more than threefold higher internalization was achieved as compared to Resovist ®. Also, cell viability of more than 90% was observed in the presence of TSS-SPIONs after 24h. The molar MR relaxivities (r2) value at 1.5 T was threefold higher than that of Resovist ® and demonstrated that TSS-SPIONs have the potential as very effective T2 contrast-enhancement agent. According to these findings, TSS-SPIONs with efficient internalization, lower cytotoxicity, and high MRI sensitivity seem to be promising for cell tracking.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Therefore, changes in EGFR localization and signaling are implicated in various human diseases, including different types of cancer. We have performed the first in vivo EGFR localization screen in an animal model by observing the expression of the EGFR ortholog LET-23 in the vulval epithelium of live C. elegans larvae. After systematically testing all genes known to produce an aberrant vulval phenotype, we have identified 81 genes regulating various aspects of EGFR localization and expression. In particular, we have found that ERM-1, the sole C. elegans Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin homolog, regulates EGFR localization and signaling in the vulval cells. ERM-1 interacts with the EGFR at the basolateral plasma membrane in a complex distinct from the previously identified LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10 receptor localization complex. We propose that ERM-1 binds to and sequesters basolateral LET-23 EGFR in an actin-rich inactive membrane compartment to restrict receptor mobility and signaling. In this manner, ERM-1 prevents the immediate activation of the entire pool of LET-23 EGFR and permits the generation of a long-lasting inductive signal. The regulation of receptor localization thus serves to fine-tune the temporal activation of intracellular signaling pathways.Introduction:The formation of epithelial tissues involves the polarized distribution of growth factor receptors that determine cell proliferation and differentiation. Notably, changes in EGFR localization have a major impact on signaling and organogenesis[1]–[3]. In C. elegans, the let-23 gene encodes the sole member of the EGFR/ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. let-23 is involved in a variety of developmental processes including the induction of the hermaphrodite vulva[4]. In early second stage( L2) larvae, LET-23 is expressed at equal levels in the six equivalent vulval precursor cells( VPCs)( P3. p through P8. p)( Figure 1A)[5],[6]. Beginning in the L2 stage, the gonadal anchor cell( AC) secretes the EGF ortholog LIN-3, which binds to LET-23 on the basolateral plasma membrane of the VPCs to activate the LET-60 RAS/MPK-1 MAPK signaling pathway[4]( Figure 1B). In order to reach high levels of receptor activity, LET-23 must be retained on the basolateral membrane of the VPCs by a ternary protein complex consisting of the PDZ-domain proteins LIN-2 CASK, LIN-10 MINT and LIN-7 VELIS. LIN-7 directly binds to the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of LET-23[5]. The VPC that is nearest to the AC, P6. p, receives most of the inductive LIN-3 signal and hence adopts the primary( 1°) cell fate. P6. p then produces several DELTA ligands, which induce via the NOTCH pathway the secondary( 2°) cell fate in the neighboring VPCs P5. p and P7. p[7],[8]( Figure 1B). NOTCH signaling blocks RAS/MAPK signaling and results in the endocytosis and degradation of LET-23 in the 2° VPCs[9]–[11]. The distal VPCs P3. p, P4. p and P8. p, which receive only little inductive signal, down-regulate LET-23 expression and adopt the tertiary( 3°), uninduced cell fate. As the pathway components are conserved, the study of vulval induction of the worm can be used to find new core components or those required for fine-tune the signaling output. For this purpose, we performed the first systematic in vivo screen for regulators of LET-23 EGFR localization and expression in live C. elegans larvae. Through this approach, we have identified 81 genes causing a variety of LET-23::GFP mislocalization phenotypes upon RNAi knock-down. A subset of these genes also controls the strength of the LET-23 EGFR signal produced in the VPCs. We have identified ERM-1, the homologue of mammalian Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin proteins, as a temporal regulator of LET-23 EGFR signaling. Based on our genetic and biochemical data, we propose that ERM-1 binds to and sequesters the LET-23 EGFR in an inactive compartment at or close to the basolateral membrane of the VPCs. In this manner, ERM-1 competes with the activating LET-23/LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10 complex[5]. ERM-1 may act as a buffer that prevents the immediate activation of the entire pool of basolateral LET-23 EGFR at vulval induction and thus allows the generation of a prolonged signal.Discussion:In order to systematically search for regulators of LET-23 EGFR trafficking and signaling, we performed an in vivo receptor localization screen in C. elegans larvae. There do exist certain limitations of this system, such as the inability to isolate individual cell for biochemical studies. However, an important advantage of our approach over previous studies performed with cultured epithelial cells[1] is the ability to observe the dynamics of receptor trafficking under normal conditions, in epithelial cells embedded in their natural environment and receiving physiological concentrations of various extracellular signals. The different regulators of LET-23 EGFR localization and signaling identified in our screen point at a complex network controlling LET-23 EGFR trafficking and signaling in different sub-cellular compartments. In a system, such as the VPCs, where ligand availability is limiting[8],[30], these additional control mechanisms at the level of the receptor are necessary to prevent too many cells from engaging in signaling at the same time and to focus the inductive signal on a single cell( P6. p). A perturbation of LET-23 EGFR trafficking can lead to a multivulva phenotype because decreased ligand sequestering by the 1° VPC P6. p results in increased LET-23 EGFR activation in the distal VPCs[30]. The down regulation of the LET-23 EGFR in all but the 1° VPC is therefore an important mechanism to break the symmetry of the initially equivalent VPCs and select a single cell for the 1° fate. The most frequent phenotype we observed in our screen( 31 genes) was persisting LET-23 EGFR expression in 2° VPCs, and for those genes that had a significant effect on signaling we found increased rather than decreased vulval induction in the let-60 background. This suggests that a relatively large number of negative regulators of EGFR signaling is required to generate the invariant pattern of vulval cell fates with a single 1° cell flanked by two 2° cells. A recent study has indicated that around 38% of all predicted protein coding genes in C. elegans possess at least one human homolog[31]. However, we found for 91% of the genes identified in our screen( 74 of 81) at least one human homolog in the OrthoList, suggesting that the mechanisms regulating EGFR trafficking are strongly conserved. Further studies of these mammalian homologs may provide new means of interfering with deregulated EGFR signaling in human cells. We describe a new function of the C. elegans Ezrin homolog ERM-1 in regulating EGFR signaling on the basolateral membrane of the vulval cells. Based on the subcellular localization and dynamics and on genetic and biochemical data, we propose that ERM-1 forms a complex with the LET-23 EGFR at the basolateral plasma membrane to recruit the receptor into an actin-rich inactive membrane compartment and limit receptor activation( Figure 5H, I). A similar function has been proposed for mammalian NF2 Merlin, which shares similarity to Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin proteins. In confluent cultured epithelial cells, Merlin coordinates adherens junction stabilization with EGFR signaling by recruiting the EGFR into an apical membrane compartment, where the receptor cannot be activated[32]. In analogy, ERM-1 may link a fraction of the LET-23 EGFR pool at the basolateral membrane to cortical F-actin and restrict the access of the receptor to the activating LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10 complex[5]. In the absence of the tripartite LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10 complex, most of the residual basolateral LET-23 EGFR is probably bound and inactivated by ERM-1. The inhibitory ERM-1 complex thus antagonizes the activating LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10 complex to prevent the instant activation and subsequent degradation of the entire basolateral pool of LET-23 EGFR once the AC begins to secrete LIN-3 in the mid-L2 stage. This mechanism allows the vulval cells to maintain high LET-23 EGFR activity at later time points after vulval induction. LET-23 EGFR may be released from the ERM-1 complex when the vulval lumen is formed and ERM-1 relocalizes to the apical plasma membrane of the toroids. Such a buffering mechanism may be important, as sustained RAS/MAPK signaling is required during the subsequent phase of vulval morphogenesis when RAS/MAPK activity induces the expression of genes required for the execution of the vulval fates[4],[33]. Thus, the strength and duration of EGFR activation during development must be precisely controlled to achieve the correct levels of RAS/MAPK activity required for organogenesis.","answer":"Abnormal signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) contributes to the development of various human diseases , including different cancer types . One important mechanism that controls intracellular signal transduction is by regulation of the subcellular receptor localization in the signal-receiving cell . We are investigating the regulation of the EGFR homolog LET-23 in the Nematode C . elegans by observing the localization of the EGFR in the epithelial cells of live animals . This approach has allowed us to study the dynamics of receptor trafficking in cells embedded in their natural environment and receiving physiological concentrations of various extracellular signals . In a systematic RNA interference screen , we have identified 81 genes controlling EGFR localization and signaling in different subcellular compartments . One new regulator of EGFR signaling identified in this screen encodes the Ezrin Homolog ERM-1 . We show genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that ERM-1 is part of a buffering mechanism to maintain a pool of immobile EGFR in the basolateral membrane compartment of the epithelial cells . This mechanism permits the generation of a long-lasting EGFR signal during multiple rounds of cell divisions . The control of receptor localization is thus necessary for the precise temporal regulation of signal transduction during animal development ."},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

These infections include tinea capitis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea manuum and tinea barbae. Tinea versicolor, caused by Malassezia furfur,Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the skin and the hair with involvement of the hair shaft and the pilosebaceous unit.The genus Trichophyton gives rise to most of the tinea dermatophytoses, including tinea capitis, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (onychomycosis).For the men, onychomycosis (nail fungus, 31.5%), tinea pedis (foot fungus, 27.8%), and acne (24.1 %) were the most commonly diagnosed skin diseases, with contact dermatitis diagnosed in 5.6% of the sampleA statistical 30-year study of dermatomycosis in Sendai National Hospital (1968-1997) revealed many changes in the prevalent diseases: Tinea pedis and tinea unguium constantly increased during this period, and the ratio of the former associated with nail infection finally reached 30% of all tinea pedis patientsEighty percent of the examined boys were with unless one skin disease. Tinea capitis (42.66%), scabiosis (13.33%), pyoderma (15.33%), plantar keratodermia (100%) were the skin diseases.Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection that occurs mainly in childhood;Tinea pedis is a chronic fungal infection of the feet, very often observed in patients who are immuno-suppressed or have diabetes mellitus.Tinea infections are caused by dermatophytes and are classified by the involved site. The most common infections in prepubertal children are tinea corporis and tinea capitis, whereas adolescents and adults are more likely to develop tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (onychomycosis).The most frequent diseases observed at arrival were dermatological conditions. Of the adoptees, 70% presented at least one skin disease, of which 57.5% were infectious; Tinea capitis being the most frequent (n = 42).

benefit in the scope of public health should be in place in order to operate the national immunization program .the aefi can be classified as follows : by frequency ( rare or common aefi ) ; by locality ( local or systemic aefi ) ; by disease severity ( mild or severe aefi ) ; and by pathophysiology .the stabilizers , immune potentiators , or antibiotics which are included in the vaccines may cause adverse reaction to susceptible vaccinees .generally , these hyperreactive responses are postulated to occur because of egg - related antigen ( measles , mumps , and rubella [ mmr ] and influenza vaccine ) , mercury ( hepatitis b vaccine , diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis vaccine [ dtap ] , japanese encephalitis vaccine , and influenza vaccine ) , vaccine stabilizer ( mmr ) , or antibiotics included in the live - attenuated virus vaccine ( mmr ) ; however , these mechanisms are not clearly explained , often [ 1 - 4 ] .most vaccines result in local reactions following vaccination such as pain , swelling and redness in some population ; this frequency slightly increases following dtap or tetanus - containing vaccines .after 2 - 3 weeks of receiving bacillus calmette - gurin ( bcg ) vaccine , localized inflammation and ulceration forms , then heal within few months .systemic reactions such as fever and malaise may occur in some population ; the frequency is higher in dtap , which may also result in irritability and decreased oral intake in infants .following mmr vaccination , systemic reactions such as measles - like illness due to vaccine - strain virus may occur on more than 5 - 10% of vaccinees .this vaccine - related measles is generally mild in immune - competent persons ; however , may result in severe disease in immune - compromised hosts , therefore mmr and other live - attenuated vaccines are contraindicated in such population .the attenuated mumps virus included in mmr may result arthralgia and lymphadenitis on less than 1% of those who are vaccinated .the advances in vaccines and immunization practices have led to decline in the incidence of vaccine - preventable diseases worldwide .however , the increase in reported cases of aefi has been noted recently , probably following increased utilization of vaccines ; increased vaccinees who are susceptible to such complications ; and increased awareness and notification . in the united states with long - standing history of aefi surveillance system, the number of reported aefi cases has exceeded the number of reported vaccine - preventable diseases ; therefore the increase in public awareness on aefi may occur , consequently . in order to maintain the public confidence and to ensure political support on national immunization program , the public health sector must ensure the safety of vaccines and immunization practices . before the introduction of aefi surveillance system in the 1980s , neurologic adverse event such as seizure was reported following whole - cell pertussis vaccination in multiple countries . in response to the media coverage ,immunization coverage decreased and then consequent resurgence of pertussis was observed in many countries such as japan , sweden , and uk . in the us , lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers has resulted in renunciation of vaccine production , and therefore led to inadequate procurement of essential vaccines . in order to minimize the unnecessary conflicts and arguments , and to achieve adequate level of immunization coverage in the population , the need for aefi management system was raised .the national aefi management system was meant to distinguish between the true vaccine reactions and the coincidental events following immunization in timely manner , therefore to ensure safety of the vaccinees and to improve the confidence in national immunization program .most of other medications are intended to use for treatment purposes , however , vaccines are given to healthy people , especially children , to prevent the future or potential occurrence of infectious diseases .the unhealthy patients who are receiving the medications such as chemotherapeutic agents or antibiotics may tolerate the occurrence of adverse event .however , the vaccinees , who are mostly healthy without having any diseases , may not tolerate on reactions after they receive the vaccines .furthermore , vaccines are forcibly given in some instances , therefore high level of safety should be guaranteed .in addition , most vaccines utilized by national immunization program are given to general populations in a large amount ; therefore safety should be heavily reviewed .in the republic of korea , aefi management system began since 1994 , after the two deaths following japanese encephalitis vaccine immunization was reported . in 2000 , the system that included report of aefi through electronic document interchange was introduced , and all systems were computerized before 2001 . in 2001 , the communicable disease control act has mandated healthcare professionals to report all noticed aefi to the public health centers , and in 2005 , the system has introduced an internet - based reporting system , which made the reporting more handy .currently , vaccine safety management system in korea is composed of four parts : rapid response system , aefi surveillance system , aefi investigation system , and vaccine injury compensation program ( vicp ) ( fig .the division of vaccine preventable disease control and national immunization program at korea centers for disease control and prevention ( kcdc ) operates routine and ad - hoc surveillance measures on aefi in korea ; performs epidemiological investigation on certain aefis such as serious adverse reactions or clustered aefis ; and operates vicp .since 1994 , when 11 aefis were reported , the reported numbers for aefi has increased to 741 in 2010 ( table 1 ) .there were two surges in 2001 ( n=141 ) and 2009 ( n=2,380 ) , when there were nationwide immunization campaign for measles and h1n1 influenza took place , respectively . among 5,339reported aefis between 1994 and 2010 , 97 deaths and 10 disabled cases were notified . when classified according to vaccine types ( table 2 ) , bcg was the vaccine with most aefi cases reported in 2008 with 38.59 cases per 1,000,000 vaccinees . however , this rate decreased down to 10.38 in 2009 and 8.1 in 2010 , when the government changed the vaccine - strain from pasteur - strain to danish - strain , because of the reactogenicity . in 2010 ,mmr and tetanus diphtheria vaccine ( td ) were recognized as the second and third common vaccine to be reported as cause of aefi . when an aefi has occurred , the vaccinees or their guardians may report the suspected aefi through telephone to the local public health center ; or by accessing website at http://nip.cdc.go.kr ; and the healthcare professionals may report through telephone to the local public health center ; or by accessing website at http://is.cdc.go.kr .when the local public health center receives the notification of suspected aefi , then they report to the kcdc through website or by telephone .kcdc then compile the nationally - collected aefi data , analyze the unexpected pattern of aefi , and conducts overall management of vaccine safety in korea .however , the quality of data collected by the routine surveillance system is limited because data collected do not include detailed epidemiological or clinical information regarding aefi . in 2011 , kcdc initiated to retrospectively investigate the vaccination - related serious aefi of seasonal trivalent influenza in korea from 2003 to 2010 . during the period ,nine guillain - barr syndrome ( gbs ) , eighteen other neurologic events , eight local events , and seven miscellaneous events were included ( table 3 ) .when classified according to causality assessment made by korea advisory committee on vaccine injury compensation for gbs , three were considered to be potentially associated to vaccination , whereas five were assessed as unlikely related .all of the three cellulitis cases had their injury sites that are not within 20 cm apart from the injection site , and two of the three cases had their symptoms onset after more than 2 weeks after vaccination .approximately two third of localized events were assessed to have potential association with vaccination ( 62.5% , 5/8 ) , whereas more than half of neurologic events ( 14/18 ) were considered to have no association with vaccination ( unlikely ) . in addition, ascertainment of each investigated cases is also important . in 2009 - 2010 season , mass vaccination for h1n1 pandemic influenza raised concern in a particular aefi : the gbs . in 2011 , kcdc investigated the data of reported cases of gbs following receipt of pandemic influenza vaccine in korea .all cases were reviewed under case definition developed by brighton collaboration working group , in order to ascertain a clear and precise case definition for aefi data analysis .of 29 reported cases during 2009 -

Transmission in Asia occurs in an urban cycle whereby the mosquito spreads the disease from an infected human to an uninfected human, following an epidemiological pattern similar to dengue fever [12] . The 2005-2006 epidemic of CHIKV in La Reunion islands in the Indian Ocean, spurred the discovery of a new vector species,   [5] . Wrecking over one-third of the island's population, this epidemic peaked its devastation between January and February 2006, when over 46,000 cases came into light every week, including 284 deaths [5, 13] . is common in urban areas of the United States and is already flourishing in 36 states, raising grave concerns to the immunologically naive populace of the United States [14] . Accordingly, this review elaborately details the epidemiology and global expansion of CHIKV, describes its clinical features and pathogenesis and its symptoms and complications, and finally nominates a possible vaccine approach against CHIKV infection. CHIKV has been isolated into three genotypes based on phylogenetic studies. These genotypes, based on the gene sequences of an Envelope protein (E1), are Asian, East/Central/ South African, and West African [4, 11, 15] . Using phylogenetic models, Cherian et al. estimate that the Asian genotype of CHIKV emerged between 50 and 310 y ago, and the West and East African genotypes diverged between 100 and 840 y ago [15] . Since then, CHIKV has come a long way, with several mutations incorporated, and has continued to wreak epidemics in several regions. Recent activities of CHIKV include the Indian epidemic in 2005-2006, which was followed by a sudden explosion of cases in 2007. An estimated 1.3 million people across 13 states were reported to be infected in India [12, 16] , and CHIKV was also widespread in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia [17] . In July-August of 2007, CHIKV was reported in Italy, probably brought in by travelers from CHIKV-prone regions of India, Africa, and Indian Ocean islands such as Mauritius, Madagascar, and Seychelles. Few of the Italian isolates were found to have evolved from the Kerala isolate, which was associated with a A226V shift in E1 gene that represents a successful evolutionary adaptation in the mosquito vector similar to the ones observed in Reunion Island [2, 18, 19] . In recent times, with an increase in global travel, the risk for spreading CHIKV to non-endemic regions has heightened [1] . Several travelers have brought CHIKV home with them after visiting areas with actively infected populations [12, 20] . Such cases have been documented in European countries, Australia, Asia, and the United States [8, 21] . The United States has already reported at least twelve cases of travel-associated CHIKV, while France has reported 850 cases, and the United Kingdom 93 [8, 14] . Beyond this, CHIKV-infected travelers have also been diagnosed in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, French Guiana, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Martinique, Norway, Switzerland, and Sri Lanka [21] . Some travelers were viremic, worrying public health officials about the spread of CHIKV to new areas [1, 8] . The incubation time for CHIKV is relatively short, requiring only 2-6 d with symptoms usually appearing 4-7 d post-infection [22] . Vazeille et al. detected CHIKV in the salivary glands of   only 2 d after infection [5] . Upon infection, CHIKF tends to present itself in two phases. The first stage is acute, while the second stage, experienced by most but not all, is persistent, causing disabling polyarthritis. Characteristics of the acute phase include an abrupt onset of fever, arthralgia, and in some cases, maculopapular rash [6, 23] . The acute phase causes such intense joint and muscular pain that makes movement very difficult and prostrates its victims [6, 20] . Ninety-five percent of infected adults are symptomatic after infection, and of these, most become disabled for weeks to months as a result of decreased dexterity, loss of mobility, and delayed reaction. Eighteen months after disease onset, 40% of patients are found to still have anti-CHIKV IgM [6, 18, 23, 24] . The chronic stage of CHIKF is characterized by polyarthralgia that can last from weeks to years beyond the acute stage [6] . CHIKV has been shown to attack fibroblasts, explaining the involvement of muscles, joints, and skin connective tissues. The high number of nociceptive nerve endings found within the joints and muscle connective tissues can explain pain associated with CHIKF [25, 26] . More than 50% of patients who suffer from severe CHIKF are over 65 y old, and more than 33% of them die. Most adults who suffer from severe CHIKF have underlying medical conditions [6, 24, 27] . The other group that is disproportionately affected by severe CHIKV is children. Other complications associated with CHIKV, from most common to least common, include respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure [6, 18, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27] . CHIKV undertakes a complex replication cycle upon host infection (Figure 2 ), which makes its genome susceptible to mutations [28, 29] . For instance, Ae. aegypti, responsible for epidemics in Kenya, Comoros, and Seychelles, carried CHIKV with an alanine in the 226 position of the E1 gene (E1-A226) [4, 18] . However, when the virus struck La Reunion Islands, a decline in population of Ae. aegypti, due to massive dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane usage and dearth of   species' www.plosntds.org population, resulted in an ecological pressure, favoring replacement of alanine at position 226 with valine (E1-A226V) [5] . This mutation allowed CHIKV's secondary vector species,  , to supplement Ae. aegypti as its primary vector [5] . Within a year, the E1-A226V mutation was present in La Reunion Island, and   apparently vectored the large epidemic infecting 34% of La Reunion Island's population [5] . All of the CHIKV strains isolated from Mayotte carried the E1-A226V mutation, and the mutation was also found in Madagascar in 2007 [5] . The E1-A226V mutation was not present at the beginning of the Indian Ocean Islands outbreak (before September 2005). However, more than 90% of later viral strains found there had incorporated the mutation (December-March 2006), indicating a genotype switch during the winter season [5, 18, 20] . The E1-A226V mutation also enabled an increase in infectivity of   when compared to its infectivity of Ae. aegypti [4, 11, 18, 30] , and with several factors taken together,   has become the new preferred and more lethal vector for CHIKV [4, 5, 11] . In fact, Tsetsarkin et al. found that a Green Fluorescent Protein tagged E1-A226V virus was 100 times more infective to   than it was to Ae. aegypti [4] . In all the Indian Ocean Islands,   became the main vector for CHIKV within 1-2 y after CHIKV was introduced to the region [31] . Of note is that Ae. aegypti has most likely been established in North America for over 300 y, while   has been in many areas of the US, since 1985, primarily in Florida [32] and since then has expanded its range in the country. Reiskind et al. set out to determine if Ae. aegypti and   mosquitoes captured in Florida were susceptible to CHIKV infection by a La Reunion isolate [32] . Each mosquito tested was highly susceptible to infection by a full-length infectious clone of the La Réunion Island isolate, CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 strain. Even though the   strains were more susceptible to infection, overall ecology and differences in human biting patterns need to be studied further Characteristically, there are two rounds of translation: (+) sense genomic RNA (49S9 = 11.7 kb) acts directly as mRNA and is partially translated (59 end) to produce non-structural proteins (nsp's). These proteins are responsible for replication and formation of a complementary (2) strand, the template for further (+) strand synthesis. Subgenomic mRNA (26 S = 4.1 kb) replication occurs through the synthesis of full-length (2) intermediate RNA, which is regulated by nsp4 and p123 precursor in early infection and later by mature nsp's. Translation of the newly synthesized sub-genomic RNA results in production of structural proteins such as Capsid and protein E2-6k-E1 (from 39 end of genome). Assembly occurs at the cell surface, and the envelope is acquired as the virus buds from the cell and release and maturation almost simultaneous occurred. Replication occurs in the cytoplasm and is very rapid (,4 h) [28, 29] . doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000623.g002 www.plosntds.org to gain a more accurate understanding of a potential CHIKV epidemic in the US [32] . During the 7 d preceding birth, no human mother has been reported to transmit the disease vertically. However, about 50% of newborns delivered while the mother was infected with CHIKV contracted the disease from their mother, despite the method of delivery. Furthermore, there have been instances of CHIKV transmission from mother to fetus causing congenital illness and fetal death [33] . During the 2005-2006 La Reunion Island outbreaks, Ramful et al. discovered that mothers could transmit CHIKV to their progeny during the perinatal period (Day 24 to Day +1) [33, 34] , and it is associated with a high degree of morbidity. By mean Day 4 of life, all of the neonates were symptomatic for CHIKV, exhibiting common CHIKF symptoms. Six neonates were confirmed to have contracted CHIKV and developed mengoencephalitis. Of those mothers who, during the La Reunion Island epidemic, were infected long before delivery, only three fetal deaths were reported [12, 33] . Ramful et al. theorized that motherto-child transmission most likely happens transplacentally shortly before delivery [33] . A similar study by Gerardin et al. reported nineteen cases of neonatal infection associated with intrapartum maternal viremia that progressed to develop encephalitis owing to vertical transmission from infected mothers [34] . Clinical and epidemiological similarities with dengue fever make CHIKV diagnosis difficult, which may lead physicians to misdiagnose CHIKV as dengue fever; therefore, the incidence of CHIKV may actually be higher than currently believed (Table 1 ) [6, 12, 35] . The amount of time elapsed since disease onset is the most critical parameter when choosing a diagnostic test. CHIKV can be detected and isolated by culturing with mosquito cells (C6/36), Vero cells (mammalian), or in mice [26] . However, this method can take at least a week and only achieves a high sensitivity during the viremic phase, which usually only lasts up to 48 h after the bite. Five days post-infection, the viral isolation approach has a low sensitivity but is still the preferred method for detecting the CHIKV strain [12, 26, 31, 35] . RT-PCR on the other hand is a faster and more sensitive method that can be used within the first week of disease onset [26] , and it is currently the most sensitive method for detecting and quantifying viral mRNA [4, 36] . Classic serological detection, by assays such as ELISA [37] , immunofluorescence [5, 38] , complement binding, and haemagglutination inhibition [39] , constitutes the second diagnostic tool used for biological diagnosis of CHIKV infection. These proven techniques are useful for detection of Antigen in mosquitoes during epidemiological studies. These assays detect virus-specific IgM and IgG, however the sensitivity and specificity of these assays has been poorly characterized. Viral competence, or the potential of viral infection and transmission, is an important parameter that can be quantified by ELISA, viral culture, and PCR. A study by Ng et al. showed biomarkers indicative of severe CHIKV infection [40] . They found decreased levels of RANTES and increased levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-1b (IL-1b) that could be sued for CHIKV detection in patients as indicators of CHIKV-driven cytokine storm. Couderc et al. demonstrate another cytokine, type-I IFN, as a key player in the progression to CHIKV infection [26] . Using an IFN-a/b null mouse model, they demonstrated evidence of muscles, joints, and skin as privileged CHIKV targets, which is consistent with human pathology. Although Ng et al. concluded that RANTES levels were significantly suppressed in severe CHIKF patients [40] , interestingly, an increase in levels of RANTES has been observed in dengue infection [41] . Since the symptoms of CHIKF mimic those of dengue fever, results obtained from this study strongly suggest that RANTES could be a potential distinctive biomarker that differentiates between these two clinically similar diseases. There are no approved antiviral treatments currently available for CHIKV [1, 3, 12, 42] . Currently, CHIKF is treated symptomatically, usually with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids, bed rest, and fluids. Movement and mild exercise are thought to decrease stiffness and morning arthralgia, but heavy exercise may exacerbate rheumatic symptoms. Corticosteroids may be used in cases of debilitating chronic CHIKV infection. There is a debate about the appropriateness of chloroquine as treatment for unresolved, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugresistant arthritis [43] .Question: What became the main vector in the Indian Ocean within 1-2 y after CHIKV was introduced?","answer":"Ae. albopictus"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVES to determine the effectiveness of a health information package in terms of empowering the pregnant women to modify their health-care behaviour and take appropriate action to combat anaemia in pregnancy . DESIGN the study was conceptualized based on Rosenstock and Becker 's health belief model . A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design was used . The sample consists of 225 anaemic pregnant women randomly allocated in experimental ( n=75 ) , control group A ( n=75 ) and control group B ( n=75 ) . The health seeking behaviour outcome measure included knowledge regarding anaemia , food selection ability , increase in haemoglobin level and compliance to iron supplementation . Intervention was a validated planned educational programme with visual aids and iron supplementation . FINDINGS the results show the mean gain of knowledge scores of experimental group was comparatively higher and control groups A and B showed that F ratio was ( F ( 2,190 ) =11.910 , p < 0.01 ) indicating that the pregnant women learned more about anaemia prevention than others . With regard to food selection ability scores of experimental , control groups A and B the F ratio was also significant ( F ( 2,190 ) =20.92 , p < 0.01 ) . Nearly 61.2 % of the subjects in experimental group became non-anaemic after the intervention when compared to control group A . This indicated that inspite of iron supplementation received by the three groups health education contributed significantly in modifying their health seeking behaviour and their perception about significance of anaemia has a problem . CONCLUSION developing countries still face the critical problem of anaemia in pregnancy . These are the socio-cultural priority problems that demand immediate attention by the policy makers and health professionals . The national anaemia control programme focuses on iron supplementation , but nutritional education and supervision of iron supplementation has failed in different regions .

Influenza viruses had caused a pandemic globally during 1918 and 1919, and that influenza pandemic had taken away more than 20 million people's lives in the world. However, in my opinion, it is unlikely that influenza viruses will again cause a pandemic on a level (both of the morbidity rate and the mortality rate) comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. Influenza viruses very easily reassort, recombine, and point mutate in nature due to their segmented RNA genome structures, however, unlike highly pathogenic (virulent) viruses like rabies virus, Lassa fever virus, smallpox virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1); most influenza viruses (wild types and mutants) are moderately pathogenic. The case fatality rates of some highly virulent viruses and related references are listed in Table 1 . On November 11, 1918 , the fighting of World War I was stopped, and World War I was officially ended on June 28, 1919 with the signing of the Versailles Treaty. It is estimated that around 8.5-10 million soldiers lost their lives in World War I due to battle. The war also directly caused more than 6 million civilian deaths. Millions of people suffered from hunger and malnutrition during the war. Malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time. For example, about 700,000 Germans died from malnutrition-related diseases in the years of 1914-1918. During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide. Those people were killed both directly and indirectly by influenza virus infections. Many families were too poor to buy food and coal, and to afford health care expenses when their family members were ill. Influenza virus could infect all members of a family, and this could result in no one left to feed the fires, and to prepare food for the whole family, even if they had firewood, coal, and food left in their homes. Sadly, a large number of people died of influenza virus infections along with starvation, cold, and poor living conditions (8) . In recent years, while hunger and malnutrition are not major and serious problems in some developed countries anymore, they are still very difficult to overcome in many developing countries. In these less-developed countries, there were approximately 925 million people who suffered from hunger; 125 million children were underweight; and 195 million children were stunted each year (9) . Nevertheless, in comparison to 1918 and 1919, currently, we have much better social and economic conditions and public health systems globally; and generally speaking, the majority of people in the world have better nutritional and educational statuses; better living and working conditions; therefore, better general health and immunity. Furthermore, in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. Today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like Tylenol or Advil. We do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time.  Actually, in the United States of America, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons (10) . Because of the above reasons, we can optimistically assume that even the same strain of influenza virus, which caused pandemic in 1918 and 1919, would not be able to kill millions of people and cause a pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 pandemic again in the future. Additionally, a significant number of viruses can cause influenza-like syndromes, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackie B virus, echovirus, and metapneumovirus (11, 12) . Some of the above-mentioned viruses like adenovirus and mutated coronavirus could cause problems that are comparable to influenza viruses (13, 14) . The World Health Organization (WHO) mistakenly raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to the highest phase 6 on June 11, 2009 (15) . However, the truth was that most cases of H1N1 influenza A virus infections were mild, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in New Zealand (16) ; and in New York City, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons ≥65 years old, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012% (17) . Some researchers argued that it should not have been called an influenza pandemic in the first place if the clinical severity was considered (15, (18) (19) (20) . I believe it was unwise that we had paid too much www.frontiersin.org 23) . Not surprisingly, every year there would be some influenza patients and a few of them would die from the infections, as it is almost impossible to eliminate influenza viruses from the natural environment in many years. The severity of a viral infection is determined by both of the viral virulence (pathogenicity) and the host immunity. Some researchers' opinions on H7N9 avian influenza virus were incorrect and/or inadequate. They mainly focused on influenza viruses and worried about viral mutations, viral pathogenicity, viral adaptation, and transmission. They overestimated the negative part of socio-economic factors of the present east China: overcrowded population in the epidemic region; very busy national and international transportation and travel; a large number of live poultry markets . . . but they underestimated the currently changed, developed, and improved positive part of socio-economic factors in China. The following factors might be used to explain why that H7N9 influenza A virus epidemic was limited and controlled in China, and only a few immunocompromised patients were killed by H7N9 influenza A virus. First, China has a relatively organized and effective public health system, there are four levels of (national, provincial, prefectural-level city, and county) centers for disease control and prevention all over China (24) . Second, physicians and nurses in China were prepared and knowledgeable of influenza virus infections. Third, samples from patients with suspected influenza virus infections were collected and sent to the local and national centers for disease control and prevention promptly. H7N9 influenza A viruses were isolated and identified very quickly. Thereby, they were able to diagnose, confirm, and report three cases of H7N9 influenza patients in the early stage of the epidemic (24, 25) . Fourth, health care and public health workers were protected properly. Consequently, none of the health professionals was infected by H7N9 influenza A virus in 2013. However, a surgeon died of H7N9 influenza in Shanghai, China in January of 2014 (26) . Fifth, they detected H7N9 influenza A viruses from the samples of chickens, pigeons, and the environment of live poultry markets in Shanghai (27) ; and closed the live poultry markets of the involved epidemic region quickly. Sixth, patients were isolated and treated timely in hospitals, 74% (1251/1689) of those close contacts of H7N9 influenza patients were monitored and observed. Thus, H7N9 influenza A virus could not spread to a bigger population (24) . Last but not least, we are connected to the Internet now, and it seems that our planet is much smaller today than the earlier days when we did not have the Internet, because communication and information exchange have become so fast, easy, and convenient presently. During that avian influenza epidemic, some influenza experts in the world shared/exchanged H7N9 influenza A virus information and provided professional consultations and suggestions efficiently and rapidly. All these public health routine practices and measures resulted in that H7N9 influenza epidemic being controlled and stopped in China (24) . I have to point out that the cases of diagnosed H7N9 avian influenza A virus infection might only be the tip of the iceberg. Aside from one laboratory confirmed asymptotic case of H7N9 influenza A virus infection in Beijing (22), there were probably many undetected mild or asymptotic cases of influenza A H7N9 infection. The reason is that most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from Taiwan, and one case from Hong Kong) (22, 23). Nowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other RNA viruses. However, we are now living in a technologically, economically, and socially much better and advanced society. I believe influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. Now, I first predict that influenza viruses will unlikely again cause a pandemic on a level comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. Hopefully, one day we could consider a strategy to produce a universal vaccine that can prevent people from infections of all influenza virus strains, or we could produce some very effective anti-influenza virus drugs; then influenza would not be a problem anymore. We should learn lessons from the mistakes we made in the past. It is reasonable and necessary to be cautious about influenza viruses, but overreactions or catastrophic reactions should be avoided in the future. My opinion is anti-traditional; the purpose of this article is to influence public health policy, and to save some of the limited resources and money for more important diseases like heart diseases, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, hepatitises, and tuberculosis (15) .

Please write a few sentences synthesizing the findings of these reports, which could serve as a conclusion section for a systematic review article. Your response should not include any other text. The RCT reports are below.Title 1:Efficacy and acceptability of different modes of oxygen administration in children: implications for a community hospital.Abstract 1:Eighty under-five children admitted in the pediatric ward with acute respiratory distress requiring oxygen inhalation were prospectively studied. Oxygen was administered to all the children by head box, face mask, nasopharyngeal catheter, and twin-holed prenasal catheter in a predetermined sequence. Oxygen was delivered at a flow rate of 4 l/min in the head box and by face mask and at a rate of 1 l/min for nasopharyngeal catheter and twin-holed prenasal catheter. There was a significant rise in paO2 and SaO2 values with all the oxygen delivery methods. The number of children who achieved paO2 of > 90 mmHg with oxygen delivered by head box was 53 (69 per cent), with face mask 37 (57 per cent), with nasopharyngeal catheter 13 (26 per cent), and with twin-holed prenasal catheter 18 (25 per cent). In view of high acceptability of twin-holed prenasal catheter, a further pilot study involving 10 children was carried out to compare the efficacy of head box and twin-holed prenasal catheter at an identical oxygen flow rate of 4 l/min. The number of children achieving paO2 of > 90 mmHg were comparable, i.e. seven (70 per cent) and eight (80 per cent) when the oxygen was delivered by head box and twin-holed prenasal catheter, respectively. It is concluded that both head box and twin-holed prenasal catheter are equally effective, acceptable and safe methods for administration of oxygen to children with acute respiratory disorders. In view of the cost-effectiveness, and easy availability and affordability of twin-holed prenasal catheter, it should be popularized in the small hospitals in the community, while head box should be reserved for use in the referral hospitals.Title 2:Oxygen administration to hypoxic children in Ethiopia: a randomized controlled study comparing complications in the use of nasal prongs with nasopharyngeal catheters.Abstract 2:Oxygen administration is one of the most important therapeutic interventions for a child with severe acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI). Inexpensive and efficient methods of oxygen administration are highly desirable in hospitals in developing countries. The objectives of this study were to compare the frequency and nature of complications when nasopharyngeal catheters or nasal prongs are used to deliver oxygen. One hundred and twenty-one children between the ages of 2 weeks and 5 years with hypoxia due to ALRI were randomized to receive oxygen via a catheter (61 children) or via nasal prongs (60 children). The two groups were similar in terms of diagnoses, clinical severity, oxygen saturation on admission and case fatality rates. There was no difference in the incidence of hypoxaemic episodes between the two groups. The oxygen flow rates required on the day of admission for adequate oxygenation (SaO2 > 90%) ranged from 0.8 litres per minute to 1.2 litres per minute. The required oxygen flow rate decreased during the course of treatment. Mucus production was more of a problem in the catheter group, and nasal blockage, intolerance of the method of oxygen administration and nursing effort were generally higher amongst the catheter group, but none of these differences was significant. Ulceration or bleeding of the nose was significantly more common in the catheter group (19.7% vs 6.7%, p < 0.05). Abdominal distension and nasal perforation were not seen in either group. This study suggests that nasal prongs are safer, more comfortable and require less nursing expertise than nasopharyngeal catheters for administration of oxygen to children.Title 3:Comparison of nasal prongs with nasal catheters in the delivery of oxygen to children with hypoxia.Abstract 3:Efficient, inexpensive, and safe methods of oxygen delivery are needed for children with severe pneumonia in developing countries. The objective of this study was to estimate the frequency of complications when nasal catheters or nasal prongs are used to delivery oxygen. Ninety-nine children between 2 weeks and 5 years of age with hypoxia were randomized to receive oxygen via nasal catheter (49 children) or nasal prongs (50 children). There was no difference in the incidence of hypoxaemic episodes or in the oxygen flow rates between the two groups. Mucus production was more of a problem in the catheter group. Nasal blockage, intolerance to the method of administration, and nursing effort were generally higher amongst the catheter group, but these differences were not significant, except for nursing effort, when all age groups were analysed together.Title 4:Comparison of nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheter for the delivery of oxygen in children with hypoxemia because of a lower respiratory tract infection.Abstract 4:To determine the best method of oxygen delivery for children in developing countries who have hypoxemia caused by acute lower respiratory tract infection.                One hundred eighteen children between 7 days and 5 years of age with a lower respiratory tract infection and arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Sao2) less than 90% were randomly selected to receive oxygen by nasopharyngeal (NP) catheter (n = 56) or nasal prongs (n = 62). A crossover study to determine the flow rate necessary to achieve an Sao2 of 95% was performed in 60 children.                One hundred twelve children could be oxygenated by the allocated method; in six oxygenation was poor with either method. The mean duration of therapy was 87.5 hours for the prongs and 94.9 hours for the NP catheter (not significant). The median oxygen consumption was 2142 L for prongs and 1692 L for the NP catheter (not significant). In the crossover study the prongs needed, on average, 26% higher oxygen flow rates than the NP catheter to obtain an Sao2 of 95% (p = 0.003). Complete nasal obstruction was observed in 24 of the children (44%) in the NP catheter group and in 8 (13%) in the prongs group (p < 0.001). Eighteen children died, 11 with NP catheter and 7 with prongs (not significant).                Because nasal prongs are less prone to complications, and oxygenation in children is equally effective, they are a more appropriate method than the NP catheter for oxygen delivery to children in developing countries with acute lower respiratory tract infections.","answer":"NP and NPC seem to be similar in effectiveness and safety when used in patients with LRTI. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hypoxaemia. Studies identifying the most effective and safe oxygen delivery method are needed."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

known method to analyze the rv curve is that of lehmann - filhs ( cf .smart , 1990 ) . in the present paperwe use the method introduced by karami @xmath0 mohebi ( 2007a ) ( = km2007a ) and karami @xmath0 teimoorinia ( 2007 ) ( = kt2007 ) , to obtain orbital parameters of the nine double - lined spectroscopic binary systems : nsv 223 , ab and , v2082 cyg , hs her , v918 her , bv dra , bw dra , v2357 oph , and yz cas .our aim is to show the validity of our new method to a wide range of different types of binary .the nsv 223 is a contact system of the a type and the mass ratio is believed to be small ( rucinski et al .2003a , b ) .the large semiamplitudes , @xmath1 , suggest that the orbital inclination is close to @xmath2 .the spectral type is @xmath3 and the period is @xmath4 days ( rucinski et al .2003a , b ) .the ab and is a contact binary .the spectral type is @xmath5 .the period is @xmath6 days .it is suggested that observed period variability may be a result of the orbital motion in a wide triple system .the third body should then have to be a white dwarf ( pych et al .2003,2004 ) .v2082 cyg is most probably an a - type contact binary with a period of @xmath7 days .the spectral type is @xmath8 ( pych et al .2003,2004 ) . in hsher , the effective temperatures were found to be @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the primary and secondary stars , respectively ( cakirli et al . 2007 ) .the secondary component appears to rotate more slowly .the presence of a third body physically bound to the eclipsing pair has been suggested by many investigators .the two component are located near the zero -

linear regression of eq .( [ pz : ] ) , which their good coincidence with the measured data yields to derive the optimized parameters @xmath30 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the apparent closeness of these curves to ellipses is due to the low , or zero , eccentricities of the corresponding orbits . for a well -

Altered calcium handling in these diseases is evidenced by changes in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction. Mutations in the Ca(2+) sensor, troponin C (TnC), were generated to increase/decrease the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac skinned fibers to create the characteristic effects of DCM, HCM, and RCM. We also used a reconstituted assay to determine the mutation effects on ATPase activation and inhibition. One mutant (A23Q) was found with HCM-like properties (increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and normal levels of ATPase inhibition). Three mutants (S37G, V44Q, and L48Q) were identified with RCM-like properties (a large increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity, partial loss of ATPase inhibition, and increased basal force). Two mutations were identified (E40A and I61Q) with DCM properties (decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force recovery, and activation of the ATPase at high [Ca(2+)]). Steady-state fluorescence was utilized to assess Ca(2+) affinity in isolated cardiac (c)TnCs containing F27W and did not necessarily mirror the fiber Ca(2+) sensitivity. Circular dichroism of mutant cTnCs revealed a trend where increased alpha-helical content correlated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers and vice versa. The main findings from this study were as follows: 1) cTnC mutants demonstrated distinct functional phenotypes reminiscent of bona fide HCM, RCM, and DCM mutations; 2) a region in cTnC associated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers was identified; and 3) the F27W reporter mutation affected Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force, and ATPase activation of some mutants.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Ca(2+)\\", \\"Ca2+\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"TnC\\", \\"V44Q\\", \\"I61Q\\", \\"cTnC\\", \\"ATPase\\", \\"cardiac (c)TnCs\\", \\"cardiac troponin C\\", \\"L48Q\\", \\"troponin C\\", \\"troponin\\", \\"S37G\\", \\"A23Q\\", \\"E40A\\", \\"F27W\\", \\"cTnCs\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

OBJECTIVE: Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that shows a higher affinity for serotonin 5-HT (2) receptors compared with dopamine D (2) receptors in vitro. The affinity of ziprasidone for these receptors in vivo in patients was examined in a positron emission tomography (PET) study. METHOD: The authors conducted a PET study to evaluate D (2) occupancy (using [ (11) C]raclopride) and 5-HT (2) occupancy (using [ (18) F]setoperone) in brain regions of interest in 16 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomly assigned to receive 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/day of ziprasidone, which reflected the recommended dose range. PET scanning was done after 3 weeks of administration and at trough plasma levels, i.e., 12-16 hours after the last dose. RESULTS: The mean 5-HT (2) receptor occupancy was significantly higher than the mean D (2) receptor occupancy (mean=76%, SD=15%, and mean=56%, SD=18%, respectively). The estimated plasma ziprasidone concentration associated with 50% maximal 5-HT (2) receptor occupancy was almost four times lower than that for D (2) receptor occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data affirm that ziprasidone is similar to other novel antipsychotics in having greater 5-HT (2) than D (2) receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses and suggest that the optimal effective dose of ziprasidone is closer to 120 mg/day than to the lower doses suggested by previous PET studies. The relatively high D (2) receptor occupancy, even at trough plasma levels, suggests that ziprasidone is more similar to risperidone and olanzapine in receptor occupancy profile than to clozapine and quetiapine. Since ziprasidone plasma levels show significant (more than twofold) variation within a single dose cycle, studies that are aimed at peak plasma levels (6 hours after the last dose) and that examine extrastriatal regions are required to fully characterize the in vivo occupancy profile of ziprasidone.","answer":"[[\\"ziprasidone\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"D (2) receptor\\"], [\\"Ziprasidone\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"dopamine D (2) receptors\\"], [\\"[ (18) F]setoperone\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"5-HT (2\\"], [\\"Ziprasidone\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"5-HT (2) receptors\\"], [\\"ziprasidone\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"5-HT (2\\"], [\\"risperidone\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"D (2) receptor\\"], [\\"quetiapine\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"D (2) receptor\\"], [\\"[ (11) C]raclopride\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"D (2\\"], [\\"clozapine\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"D (2) receptor\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy , tolerability and first-dose blood-pressure response of once-daily quinapril and twice-daily captopril when added to diuretic therapy in elderly patients with heart failure . The study was performed at a single centre as an open randomised parallel-group study , patients being selected for inclusion from the outpatient population . Following a starting dose of either 2.5 mg once-daily quinapril , or 6.25 mg twice-daily captopril , patients were reviewed at two-weekly intervals , and following clinical assessment a decision was made either to titrate up to the next medication stage or to enter the patient into the 16-week maintenance phase . Efficacy was assessed using a six-minute walking test , the New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class , a functional lifescale ( FLS ) questionnaire and the cardiothoracic ratio ( CTR ) -at study entry and at the end of the maintenance phase . Blood pressure was measured for 5 h post-first-dose of medication . Sixty-one patients were randomised to treatment : 30 to quinapril and 31 to captopril .

Moreover, boron is a chemically versatile element and its presence in oxime products would open the door to many applications in chemical biology. For example boron compounds have found uses in medicinal chemistry, 15,16 cross-coupling reactions 17,18 carbohydrate detection, 19,20 promoting endocytosis, 21 and reactivity-based peroxide sensing. 22,23 Boron's rich coordination chemistry is pivotal for many of its applications. For example the N / B dative interaction has been proposed to stabilize otherwise labile Schiff bases, and these iminoboronates have been used in supramolecular chemistry, 24,25 enantiomer analysis by NMR, 26,27 and protein labelling. 28,29 We selected the 2-formylphenylboronic acid (2-FPBA, 1) scaffold as a model system to explore boron's inuence on Fig. 1 (A) The unique abilities of boron led to the hypothesis that proximal boron substituents would have an impact on oxime condensations; (B) preliminary observations confirming the potential of boron to accelerate oxime formation.</p><p>oxime condensations (Fig. 1). 2-FPBA has previously been shown to modify lysine residues or N-termini in proteins in a process controlled by rapid equilibria. 29 Little is known, however, about the analogous condensation with a-effect nucleophiles. We have found two cases of alkoxyiminoboronates (AIBs), 27,30 two cases of O-alkylAIBs 31,32 and two cases of the related hydrazinoiminoboronates; 30,33 but in each of those studies the coupling itself was not of central importance and therefore not examined in detail. Herein we describe that O-alkylAIBs form with remarkable speed and selectivity in neutral aqueous buffer. The reaction is unaffected by proteins, carbohydrates, biothiols, and human serum, and has an equilibrium constant of >10 8 M À1 .</p>Results and discussion<p>As shown in panel b of Fig. 1, when 2-FPBA was reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine in a 1 : 1 ratio at neutral pH at 10 mM the reaction was nearly complete aer the rst proton NMR measurement (>90% conversion at 3.5 minutes), or HPLC injection (1 minute, see entry 3, Table 1). These observations imply a rate upwards of 10 3 M À1 s À1several orders of magnitude faster than normal oxime condensations at neutral pH, 34 prompting us to explore the importance of boronic acid positioning on reaction efficacy. Comparing entries 1-6 in Table 1 makes it clear that the 2-FPBA motif is crucial for an efficient reaction: the corresponding meta-and para-substituted FPBAs behaved similar to benzaldehyde, delivering nearly undetectable levels of oxime aer 90 minutes (cf. entry 1 with 5 and 6). More complex hydroxylamines, such as the pentapeptide shown in entry 4, were also excellent substrates, delivering complete conversion aer the rst injection. Condensations with ketones were slower than with 2-FPBA (entry 7), but still faster than normal ketoxime condensations. Pinacol boronate esters also gave complete conversion aer one minute (compares entries 2 & 8) but the hydrolysed boronic acid 2a was the main product with only 10% of pinacol ester oxime 2f observed; aer ninety minutes only 2a was present. The ketoximine pinacol product (entry 9), on the other hand, was more stable and comprised 97% of the product aer the rst injection (the remainder being 2e); aer thirty minutes 2g had also completely hydrolysed to 2e. The ability to use pinacol esters is valuable since these are readily obtained from Pd-catalysed routes to boronic esters, and their deprotections in organic solvents are oen tricky.</p><p>The reaction is fast and displays second order kinetics. We established the rate in three independent ways: HPLC, NMR, and uorescence quenching. While the time resolution and sensitivity of HPLC and NMR could provide only a lower bound for the rate constant, uorescence quenching gave a more quantitative assessment. A hydroxylamine bearing a lissamine uorophore and a 2-FPBA connected to a quencher were prepared (see Fig. 2 for the structures and the ESI pages S10-11 ‡ for synthetic details). Scouting experiments suggested that monitoring at 100 nM would be required to obtain sufficient data at early reaction conversion (runs at 500 nM show second order behavior only in the rst 100 seconds, see page S26 in the ESI ‡ for details). Triplicate rate measurements at 100 nM showed excellent linearity in inverse concentration plots (see Fig. 2) and gave a rate constant of z11 000 M À1 s À1several orders of magnitude faster than the fastest neutral pH oxime condensations. 34 Although uorescence quenching is an indirect measurement technique, HPLC injections of aliquots from the assay mixture showed only product and starting materials (indicating a clean reaction) and gave conversions qualitatively in agreement with the uorescence measurements. In addition, the fact that 10 and 1 mM reactions monitored by 1 H NMR showed >90% conversion at the earliest possible measurements (see Fig. 1, and the ESI Scheme S1 ‡ for 1 mM case) provides independent verication of a rate constant >10 4 M À1 s À1 since the rst half-life would have to be less than 90 seconds. The general pH dependence, with a maximum in the range of 4.5-5, is consistent with normal oxime formation 35 except there is a distortion in the sigmoidal shape at higher pH (i.e. 7.2 & 8). The asymmetry in the pH dependence curve is inverted in comparison to a typical oxime condensation (acetone with hydroxylamine), 35 which shows a more pronounced drop-off in rate at higher pH than at lower pH.</p><p>Based on the build-up of a tetrahedral intermediate at higher pH, Jencks attributed this pH dependence to the need for a proton in the dehydration step. 35 Although we have thus far not been able to detect intermediates, we speculate that the nearneutral pK a of amine-substituted aqueous boronates 14,36 provides the ideal environment for acceleration of the normally rate-limiting dehydration.</p><p>The products are stable and undergo slow equilibration at neutral pH. Proton NMR analysis of compound 2a (from entry 2 in Table 1) in pH 7.2 phosphate buffer led to little change in concentration (<5%) over the course of three days (see panel a in Fig. 3). We also tested whether 2a was in equilibrium with the starting materials by adding to the NMR sample a ve-fold excess of O-methylhydroxylamine. As shown in panel b of Fig. 3, O-methylhydroxylamine leads to a new oxime product, with equilibrium being established aer 10-15 hours at 100 mM in pH 7.2 phosphate buffer. Although the equilibrium constant is too large to allow a static equilibrium measurement, k À1 can be calculated directly from the exchange rate between oximes (4.2 AE 0.4 Â 10 À5 s À1 ). From this value and the k 1 value obtained from uorescence quenching (Fig. 2) an equilibrium constant of 2.6 AE 0.3 Â 10 8 M À1 can be estimated. The reversibility assay shown in Fig. 3 would not be able to distinguish between hydrolysis and direct O-methylhydroxylamine attack; therefore we also ran the experiment by adding a different boronic acid to 2a instead of O-methylhydroxylamine: the exchange kinetics are the same within experimental error, corroborating the hydrolysis-based mechanism (see the ESI pages S36 and S37 ‡ for details).</p><p>For practical applications it is important for a bioconjugation to proceed in complex environments. We therefore explored the efficacy of the boron-assisted oxime ligation in the presence of common interfering additives (sugars, biothiols, proteins, human serum). The additives led to no detectable reduction in reaction efficiency (see Table 2) with the exception of human serum. Interestingly in human serum the boronic acid in 2a partially oxidized to a phenol, leading to an apparent loss of material: aer the rst injection 80% of 2a was present while aer 18 h only 20% remained (see the ESI Fig. S13 ‡ for details). Even in the oxidized product, however, the oxime was still intact and if both components are added together the mass balance is nearly complete. Furthermore, lysozyme, which has previously been shown to react with 2-FPBA, 29 showed no modication according to LC-MS, indicating that the hydroxylamine entirely outcompetes nucleophilic amino acid functionalities for 2-FPBA (see Fig. S12 in the ESI ‡).</p>Conclusions<p>A great advantage of the present method over many coupling reactions is the simplicity and ready availability of the starting materials. There are commercial libraries of phenylboronic acid and boronic ester compounds, many of which contain an aldehyde or can be trivially elaborated to incorporate one. Furthermore, the widespread use of oxime conjugations for connective processes at high concentration means that a variety of O-alkylhydroxylamines are also available. A shortcoming of the present method in comparison to the classical oxime condensation is the size of required 2-FBPA motif. Although for most applications this should present no difficulties, examples where the compactness of the oxime is critical (such as, for example, as a functional isostere of peptide bonds) 37 would not be possible. The ability to run conjugations at 1 1 ratios of partners at biological pH means that either or both components can be complex, precious materials. Although we have focused on oxime condensation for proof-of-concept the coordinating properties of boron in aqueous media could potentially be exploited to accelerate other important reactions whose rates are limited by the kinetics of Schiff base formation. 11</p>","answer":"We report here the discovery and development of boron-assisted oxime formation as a powerful connective reaction for chemical biology. Oximes proximal to boronic acids form in neutral aqueous buffer with rate constants of more than 10 4 M À1 s À1 , the largest to date for any oxime condensation.Boron's dynamic coordination chemistry confers an adaptability that seems to aid a number of elementary steps in the oxime condensation. In addition to applications in bioconjugation, the emerging importance of boronic acids in chemical biology as carbohydrate receptors or peroxide probes, and the growing list of drugs and drug candidates containing boronic acids suggest many potential applications."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy offers great potential for studying enzyme kinetics. A number of fluorescence reporter systems allow for monitoring the sequence of individual reaction events with a confocal microscope. When using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) detection scheme, additional information about the fluorescence lifetimes of the fluorophores can be obtained. We have applied a TCSPC detection scheme for studying the kinetics of α-chymotrypsin hydrolyzing a double-substituted rhodamine 110-based fluorogenic substrate in a two-step reaction. On the basis of the lifetime information, it was possible to discriminate the intermediate and the final product. At the high substrate concentration used, only the formation of the intermediate was observed. No rebinding of the intermediate followed by rhodamine 110 formation occurred at these high concentrations. We have further found no alterations in the fluorescence lifetime of this intermediate that would indicate changes in the local environment of the fluorophore originating from strong interactions with the enzyme. Our results clearly show the power of using lifetime-resolved measurements for investigating enzymatic reactions at the single molecule level.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Classic (complete) lecithin  cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency and Fish-eye disease (partial LCAT deficiency) are genetic syndromes associated with markedly decreased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol but not with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We investigated the metabolism of the HDL apolipoproteins (apo) apoA-I and apoA-II in a total of five patients with LCAT deficiency, one with classic LCAT deficiency and four with Fish-eye disease. Plasma levels of apoA-II were decreased to a proportionately greater extent (23% of normal) than apoA-I (30% of normal). In addition, plasma concentrations of HDL particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (LpA-I  A-II) were much lower (18% of normal) than those of particles containing only apoA-I (LpA-I) (51% of normal). The metabolic basis for the low levels of apoA-II and LpA-I  A-II was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques. The mean plasma residence time of apoA-I was decreased at 2. 08 +/- 0. 27 d (controls 4. 74 +/- 0. 65 days); however, the residence time of apoA-II was even shorter at 1. 66 +/- 0. 24 d (controls 5. 25 +/- 0. 61 d). In addition, the catabolism of apoA-I in LpA-I  A-II was substantially faster than that of apoA-I in LpA-I. In summary, genetic syndromes of either complete or partial LCAT deficiency result in low levels of HDL through preferential hypercatabolism of apoA-II and HDL particles containing apoA-II. Because LpA-I has been proposed to be more protective than LpA-I  A-II against atherosclerosis, this selective effect on the metabolism of LpA-I  A-II may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic LCAT deficiency and Fish-eye disease are not at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"classic LCAT deficiency\\", \\"fish-eye disease\\", \\"LCAT deficiency\\", \\"atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\\", \\"Classic (complete) lecithin  cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency\\", \\"partial LCAT deficiency\\", \\"Fish-eye disease\\", \\"cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency\\", \\"atherosclerosis\\", \\"complete or partial LCAT deficiency\\"]}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Possible founder mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients were identified.Germline Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Korean Ovarian Cancer Patients: Finding Founder Mutations.The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies.Maximising survival: the main concern of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer who undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2.Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16), p = 2.7 × 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1.12 95%CI: 1.03-1.21, p = 4.8 × 10(-3)).Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.Large BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic rearrangements in Polish high-risk breast and ovarian cancer families.BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major genes associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.Until 2006, she supervised a diagnostic unit for BRCA gene testing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Hereditary Breast Cancer (Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany).Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases.Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation face a risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer at an earlier age than women without such a mutation.In 2006, participants were recruited from Web sites for women with breast cancer or BRCA gene mutations.About 20 % of hereditary breast cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions.Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c.7806-2A>G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged.The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.OBJECTIVE: Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases.She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies.BACKGROUND: Women who are diagnosed with a deleterious mutation in either breast cancer (BRCA) gene have a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers at young ages.We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2.Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.[Detection and occurrence of BRCA 1 gene mutation in patients with carcinoma of the breast and ovary].We investigated the relationship between BRCA mutations and the distribution of familial cancers other than breast or ovary in high-risk breast cancer patients.PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE ENROLLED: reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer;

n = 79) or with a history of unilateral BC (at risk of CBC; n = 37) were selectedStatistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generationsThe USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery.This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer.The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2)If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease.About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2)A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46%) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12%) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5%) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37%) without cancerThis study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.METHODS: A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term.This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.Women with a harmful mutation in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene are at significantly increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) during their lifetime, compared to those without.Genetic testing for BRCA genes, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer risk, is an accepted cancer control strategy.Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested.Mutations in BRCA genes elevate risk for breast and ovarian cancer.Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers.No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete.A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population.We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model. We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer).Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. One asymptomatic person--carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation--was identified in this study. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies.Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer.Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.CONCLUSIONS: Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations.Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer.However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population.BRCA Mutations Increase Fertility in Families at Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Risk.Because infertility is associated with breast and ovarian cancer risks, we hypothesized that the mutations in the BRCA gene may be associated with low response to fertility treatments.Moreover, in families of breast cancer patients without BRCA mutations, breast cancer risk depends on the patient's age at diagnosis.Among the 554 women who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutation, 78 were found to have a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene, and 54 had a mutation in the BRCA 2 gene.Frequent recurrent mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Hispanics, including a large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 exon 9-12 deletion [ex9-12del]), suggest that an ancestry-informed BRCA-testing strategy could reduce disparities and promote cancer prevention by enabling economic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Mexico.Individuals who carry a BRCA gene mutation have increased lifetime risks of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome-related cancers.BRCA gene mutations have been well described to carry an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.Ovarian cancer among 8,005 women from a breast cancer family history clinic: no increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer in families testing negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2.Women who were BRCA carriers, women who had a history of breast cancer, DCIS, or breast biopsy, or had a family history of ovarian cancer were more likely to have undergone surgery for cancer risk reduction.Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility became a reality after two cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified.Germline mutations in BRCA genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.We used person-years at risk to assess ovarian cancer rates in the study population, subdivided by genetic status (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA negative, BRCA untested) compared with the general population.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Molecular mechanisms remain unknown for most type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study identified loci. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose levels reside in introns of ADCY5, a gene that encodes adenylate cyclase 5. Adenylate cyclase 5 catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP, which is a second messenger molecule involved in cell signaling and pancreatic β-cell insulin secretion. We demonstrated that type 2 diabetes risk alleles are associated with decreased ADCY5 expression in human islets and examined candidate variants for regulatory function. rs11708067 overlaps a predicted enhancer region in pancreatic islets. The type 2 diabetes risk rs11708067-A allele showed fewer H3K27ac ChIP-seq reads in human islets, lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays in rodent β-cells (rat 832/13 and mouse MIN6), and increased nuclear protein binding compared with the rs11708067-G allele. Homozygous deletion of the orthologous enhancer region in 832/13 cells resulted in a 64% reduction in expression level of Adcy5, but not adjacent gene Sec22a, and a 39% reduction in insulin secretion. Together, these data suggest that rs11708067-A risk allele contributes to type 2 diabetes by disrupting an islet enhancer, which results in reduced ADCY5 expression and impaired insulin secretion.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"H3\\", \\"Adcy5\\", \\"Sec22a\\", \\"adenylate cyclase 5\\", \\"Adenylate cyclase 5\\", \\"insulin\\", \\"ADCY5\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

However, its performance drops considerably in the presence of morphologically rich languages (MRLs). Neural engines usually fail to tackle the large vocabulary and high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word rate of MRLs. Therefore, it is not suitable to exploit existing word-based models to translate this set of languages. In this paper, we propose an extension to the state-of-the-art model of Chung et al. (2016), which works at the character level and boosts the decoder with target-side morphological information. In our architecture, an additional morphology table is plugged into the model. Each time the decoder samples from a target vocabulary, the table sends auxiliary signals from the most relevant affixes in order to enrich the decoder's current state and constrain it to provide better predictions. We evaluated our model to translate English into German, Russian, and Turkish as three MRLs and observed significant improvements.IntroductionMorphologically complex words (MCWs) are multi-layer structures which consist of different subunits, each of which carries semantic information and has a specific syntactic role. Table 1 gives a Turkish example to show this type of complexity. This example is a clear indication that word-based models are not suitable to process such complex languages. Accordingly, when translating MRLs, it might not be a good idea to treat words as atomic units as it demands a large vocabulary that imposes extra overhead. Since MCWs can appear in various forms we require a very large vocabulary to i ) cover as many morphological forms and words as we can, and ii ) reduce the number of OOVs. Neural models by their nature are complex, and we do not want to make them more complicated by working with large vocabularies. Furthermore, even if we have quite a large vocabulary set, clearly some words would remain uncovered by that. This means that a large vocabulary not only complicates the entire process, but also does not necessarily mitigate the OOV problem. For these reasons we propose an NMT engine which works at the character level.In this paper, we focus on translating into MRLs and issues associated with word formation on the target side. To provide a better translation we do not necessarily need a large target lexicon, as an MCW can be gradually formed during decoding by means of its subunits, similar to the solution proposed in character-based decoding models BIBREF0 . Generating a complex word character-by-character is a better approach compared to word-level sampling, but it has other disadvantages.One character can co-occur with another with almost no constraint, but a particular word or morpheme can only collocate with a very limited number of other constituents. Unlike words, characters are not meaning-bearing units and do not preserve syntactic information, so (in the extreme case) the chance of sampling each character by the decoder is almost equal to the others, but this situation is less likely for words. The only constraint that prioritize which character should be sampled is information stored in the decoder, which we believe is insufficient to cope with all ambiguities. Furthermore, when everything is segmented into characters the target sentence with a limited number of words is changed to a very long sequence of characters, which clearly makes it harder for the decoder to remember such a long history. Accordingly, character-based information flows in the decoder may not be as informative as word- or morpheme-based information.In the character-based NMT model everything is almost the same as its word-based counterpart except the target vocabulary whose size is considerably reduced from thousands of words to just hundreds of characters. If we consider the decoder as a classifier, it should in principle be able to perform much better over hundreds of classes (characters) rather than thousands (words), but the performance of character-based models is almost the same as or slightly better than their word-based versions. This underlines the fact that the character-based decoder is perhaps not fed with sufficient information to provide improved performance compared to word-based models.Character-level decoding limits the search space by dramatically reducing the size of the target vocabulary, but at the same time widens the search space by working with characters whose sampling seems to be harder than words. The freedom in selection and sampling of characters can mislead the decoder, which prevents us from taking the maximum advantages of character-level decoding. If we can control the selection process with other constraints, we may obtain further benefit from restricting the vocabulary set, which is the main goal followed in this paper.In order to address the aforementioned problems we redesign the neural decoder in three different scenarios. In the first scenario we equip the decoder with an additional morphology table including target-side affixes. We place an attention module on top of the table which is controlled by the decoder. At each step, as the decoder samples a character, it searches the table to find the most relevant information which can enrich its state. Signals sent from the table can be interpreted as additional constraints. In the second scenario we share the decoder between two output channels. The first one samples the target character and the other one predicts the morphological annotation of the character. This multi-tasking approach forces the decoder to send morphology-aware information to the final layer which results in better predictions. In the third scenario we combine these two models. Section \\"Proposed Architecture\\" provides more details on our models.Together with different findings that will be discussed in the next sections, there are two main contributions in this paper. We redesigned and tuned the NMT framework for translating into MRLs. It is quite challenging to show the impact of external knowledge such as morphological information in neural models especially in the presence of large parallel corpora. However, our models are able to incorporate morphological information into decoding and boost its quality. We inject the decoder with morphological properties of the target language. Furthermore, the novel architecture proposed here is not limited to morphological information alone and is flexible enough to provide other types of information for the decoder.Proposed ArchitectureWe propose a compatible neural architecture for translating into MRLs. The model benefits from subword- and character-level information and improves upon the state-of-the-art model of chung-cho-bengio. We manipulated the model to incorporate morphological information and developed three new extensions, which are discussed in Sections \\"The Embedded Morphology Table\\" , \\"The Auxiliary Output Channel\\" , and \\"Combining the Extended Output Layer and the Embedded Morphology Table\\" .Combining the Extended Output Layer and the Embedded Morphology TableIn the first scenario, we aim to provide the decoder with useful information about morphological properties of the target language, but we are not sure whether signals sent from the table are what we really need. They might be helpful or even harmful, so there should be a mechanism to control their quality. In the second scenario we also have a similar problem as the last layer requires some information to predict the correct morphological class through the second channel, but there is no guarantee to ensure that information in the decoder is sufficient for this sort of prediction. In order to address these problems, in the third extension we combine both scenarios as they are complementary and can potentially help each other.The morphology table acts as an additional useful source of knowledge as it already consists of affixes, but its content should be adapted according to the decoder and its actual needs. Accordingly, we need a trainer to update the table properly. The extra prediction channel plays this role for us as it forces the network to predict the target language's affixes at the output layer. The error computed in the second channel is back-propagated to the network including the morphology table and updates its affix information into what the decoder actually needs for its prediction. Therefore, the second output channel helps us train better affix embeddings.The morphology table also helps the second predictor. Without considering the table, the last layer only includes information about the input sequence and previously predicted outputs, which is not directly related to morphological information. The second attention module retrieves useful affixes from the morphology table and concatenates to the last layer, which means the decoder is explicitly fed with morphological information. Therefore, these two modules mutually help each other. The external channel helps update the morphology table with high-quality affixes (backward pass) and the table sends its high-quality signals to the prediction layer (forward pass). The relation between these modules and the NMT architecture is illustrated in Figure 2 .Question: What type of morphological information is contained in the \\"morphology table\\"?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"target-side affixes\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"In order to address the aforementioned problems we redesign the neural decoder in three different scenarios.

The implementation of bio-orthogonal click chemistries is a topic of growing importance in the field of biomaterials, as it is enabling the development of increasingly complex hydrogel materials capable of providing dynamic, cell-instructive microenvironments. Here, we introduce the tetrazine-norbornene inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction as a new cross-linking chemistry for the formation of cell laden hydrogels. The fast reaction rate and irreversible nature of this click reaction allowed for hydrogel formation within minutes when a multifunctional PEG-tetrazine macromer was reacted with a dinorbornene peptide. In addition, the cytocompatibility of the polymerization led to high postencapsulation viability of human mesenchymal stem cells, and the specificity of the tetrazine-norbornene reaction was exploited for sequential modification of the network via thiol-ene photochemistry. These advantages, combined with the synthetic accessibility of the tetrazine molecule compared to other bio-orthogonal click reagents, make this cross-linking chemistry an interesting and powerful new tool for the development of cell-instructive hydrogels for tissue engineering applications.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"ene\\", \\"tetrazine\\", \\"dinorbornene\\", \\"thiol\\", \\"PEG\\", \\"norbornene\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

To obtain a realistic image of person wearing the desired model clothes, we aim to solve the following challenges: 1) non-rigid nature of clothes - we need to align poses between the model and the user; 2) richness in textures of fashion items - preserving the fine details and characteristics of the clothes is critical for photo-realistic transfer; 3) variation of identity appearances - it is required to fit the desired model clothes to the person identity seamlessly. To tackle these challenges, we introduce three key components, including the pose alignment network (PAN), the texture refinement network (TRN) and the fitting network (FTN). Since it is unlikely to gather image pairs of input person image and desired output image (i.e. person wearing the desired clothes), our framework is trained in a self-supervised manner to gradually transfer the poses and textures of the model's clothes to the desired appearance. In the experiments, we verify on the Deep Fashion dataset and MVC dataset that our method can generate photo-realistic images for the person to try-on the model clothes. Furthermore, we explore the model capability for different fashion items, including both upper and lower garments.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We present a novel and effective approach for generating new clothing on a wearer through generative adversarial learning. Given an input image of a person and a sentence describing a different outfit, our model “redresses” the person as desired, while at the same time keeping the wearer and her his pose unchanged. Generating new outfits with precise regions conforming to a language description while retaining wearer’s body structure is a new challenging task. Existing generative adversarial networks are not ideal in ensuring global coherence of structure given both the input photograph and language description as conditions. We address this challenge by decomposing the complex generative process into two conditional stages. In the first stage, we generate a plausible semantic segmentation map that obeys the wearer’s pose as a latent spatial arrangement. An effective spatial constraint is formulated to guide the generation of this semantic segmentation map. In the second stage, a generative model with a newly proposed compositional mapping layer is used to render the final image with precise regions and textures conditioned on this map. We extended the DeepFashion dataset [8] by collecting sentence descriptions for 79K images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. A user study is also conducted.[2]: We present a novel method to solve image analogy problems [3]: it allows to learn the relation between paired images present in training data, and then generalize and generate images that correspond to the relation, but were never seen in the training set. Therefore, we call the method Conditional Analogy Generative Adversarial Network (CAGAN), as it is based on adversarial training and employs deep convolutional neural networks. An especially interesting application of that technique is automatic swapping of clothing on fashion model photos. Our work has the following contributions. First, the definition of the end-to-end trainable CAGAN architecture, which implicitly learns segmentation masks without expensive supervised labeling data. Second, experimental results show plausible segmentation masks and often convincing swapped images, given the target article. Finally, we discuss the next steps for that technique: neural network architecture improvements and more advanced applications.[3]: We present an image-based VIirtual Try-On Network (VITON) without using 3D information in any form, which seamlessly transfers a desired clothing item onto the corresponding region of a person using a coarse-to-fine strategy. Conditioned upon a new clothing-agnostic yet descriptive person representation, our framework first generates a coarse synthesized image with the target clothing item overlaid on that same person in the same pose. We further enhance the initial blurry clothing area with a refinement network. The network is trained to learn how much detail to utilize from the target clothing item, and where to apply to the person in order to synthesize a photo-realistic image in which the target item deforms naturally with clear visual patterns. Experiments on our newly collected Zalando dataset demonstrate its promise in the image-based virtual try-on task over state-of-the-art generative models.1[4]: Image-based virtual try-on systems for fitting a new in-shop clothes into a person image have attracted increasing research attention, yet is still challenging. A desirable pipeline should not only transform the target clothes into the most fitting shape seamlessly but also preserve well the clothes identity in the generated image, that is, the key characteristics (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) that depict the original clothes. However, previous image-conditioned generation works fail to meet these critical requirements towards the plausible virtual try-on performance since they fail to handle large spatial misalignment between the input image and target clothes. Prior work explicitly tackled spatial deformation using shape context matching, but failed to preserve clothing details due to its coarse-to-fine strategy. In this work, we propose a new fully-learnable Characteristic-Preserving Virtual Try-On Network (CP-VTON) for addressing all real-world challenges in this task. First, CP-VTON learns a thin-plate spline transformation for transforming the in-shop clothes into fitting the body shape of the target person via a new Geometric Matching Module (GMM) rather than computing correspondences of interest points as prior works did. Second, to alleviate boundary artifacts of warped clothes and make the results more realistic, we employ a Try-On Module that learns a composition mask to integrate the warped clothes and the rendered image to ensure smoothness. Extensive experiments on a fashion dataset demonstrate our CP-VTON achieves the state-of-the-art virtual try-on performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.[5]: Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X → Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y → X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push F(G(X)) ≈ X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.[6]: [7]: We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to ½ everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.","answer":"Generative adversarial network (GAN) [7] has been used for image-based generation. Recently, GAN has been used for person image generation [6] to generate the human image from pose representation. [1] proposed a generative network to generate fashion images from textual inputs. For fashion image generation, a more intuitive way is to generate images from a person image and the desired clothes image, i.e. a virtual try-on system. This virtual try-on task has been studied in the past a few years [5] [2] [3] [4] . Inspired by cycle image translation [5] , [2] proposed to translate person clothes using product clothes as the condition. To preserve a detailed texture information, [3] proposed to generate a synthesized image from clothes image and clothing-agnostic person representation. [4] proposed to refine the clothes detail information by adding a warped product image by applying Geometric Matching Module (GMM). However, these methods rely on product images as the input. Instead, our method focuses on transferring the dressed clothes on an arbitrary model image without the need for clean product images."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed English and US-based tweets containing \\"coronavirus\\" between January 23-March 24, 2020 using the Twitter API. Tweets containing keywords were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions. RESULTS: A total of 259,529 unique tweets were included in the analyses. Social distancing tweets became more prevalent from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. Early facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle: the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the \\"implementation\\" and \\"negative emotions\\" facets largely dominated in combination with topics of \\"social disruption\\" and \\"adaptation\\", albeit to lesser degree. Social disruptiveness tweets were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. DISCUSSION: Social distancing can be defined by facets that respond to and represent certain events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising case counts. For example, Miami had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March corresponding with the rise of COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: The evolution of social distancing facets on Twitter reflects actual events and may signal potential disease hotspots. Our facets can also be used to understand public discourse on social distancing which may inform future public health measures.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

ATR and ATM kinases are central to the checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage and replication stress. However, the nature of the signal, which initially activates these kinases in response to UV damage, is unclear. Here, we have shown that DDB2 and XPC, two early UV damage recognition factors, are required for the damage-specific ATR and ATM recruitment and phosphorylation. ATR and ATM physically interacted with XPC and promptly localized to the UV damage sites. ATR and ATM recruitment and their phosphorylation were negatively affected in cells defective in DDB2 or XPC functions. Consequently, the phosphorylation of ATR and ATM substrates, Chk1, Chk2, H2AX, and BRCA1 was significantly reduced or abrogated in mutant cells. Furthermore, UV exposure of cells defective in DDB2 or XPC resulted in a marked decrease in BRCA1 and Rad51 recruitment to the damage site. Conversely, ATR- and ATM-deficiency failed to affect the recruitment of DDB2 and XPC to the damage site, and therefore did not influence the NER efficiency. These findings demonstrate a novel function of DDB2 and XPC in maintaining a vital cross-talk with checkpoint proteins, and thereby coordinating subsequent repair and checkpoint activation.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Cross-domain Generative Adversarial Networks were reported to achieve exciting results in image processing applications.However, in the domain of materials science, there is a need to synthesize data with higher order complexity compared to observed samples, and the state-of-the-art cross-domain GANs can not be adapted directly. In this contribution, we propose a novel GAN called CrystalGAN which generates new chemically stable crystallographic structures with increased domain complexity.We introduce an original architecture, we provide the corresponding loss functions, and we show that the CrystalGAN generates very reasonable data.We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a real original problem of novel hydrides discovery that can be further used in development of hydrogen storage materials.In modern society, a big variety of inorganic compositions are used for hydrogen storage owing to its favorable cost BID4 .A vast number of organic molecules are applied in solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, conductors, and sensors BID25 .Synthesis of new organic and inorganic compounds is a challenge in physics, chemistry and in materials science.Design of new structures aims to find the best solution in a big chemical space, and it is in fact a combinatorial optimization problem.In this work, we focus on applications of hydrogen storage, and in particular, we challenge the problem to investigate novel chemical compositions with stable crystals.Traditionally, density functional theory (DFT) plays a central role in prediction of chemically relevant compositions with stable crystals BID22 .However, the DFT calculations are computationally expensive, and it is not acceptable to apply it to test all possible randomly generated structures.A number of machine learning approaches were proposed to facilitate the search for novel stable compositions BID3 .There was an attempt to find new compositions using an inorganic crystal structure database, and to estimate the probabilities of new candidates based on compositional similarities.These methods to generate relevant chemical compositions are based on recommender systems BID10 .The output of the recommender systems applied in the crystallographic field is a rating or preference for a structure.A recent approach based on a combination of machine learning methods and the high-throughput DFT calculations allowed to explore ternary chemical compounds BID21 , and it was shown that statistical methods can be of a big help to identify stable structures, and that they do it much faster than standard methods.Recently, support vector machines were tested to predict crystal structures BID16 showing that the method can reliably predict the crystal structure given its composition.It is worth mentioning that data representation of observations to be passed to a learner, is critical, and data representations which are the most suitable for learning algorithms, are not necessarily scientifically intuitive BID23 .Deeplearning methods were reported to learn rich hierarchical models over all kind of data, and the GANs BID8 ) is a state-of-the-art model to synthesize data. Moreover, deep networks were reported to learn transferable representations BID18 . The GANswere already exploited with success in cross-domain learning applications for image processing BID13 BID12 .Our goalis to develop a competitive approach to identify stable ternary chemical compounds, i.e., compounds containing three different elements, from observations of binary compounds. Nowadays, there does not exist any approach that can be applied directly to such an important task of materials science. The state-of-the-artGANs are limited in the sense that they do not generate samples in domains with increased complexity, e.g., the application where we aim to construct crystals with three elements from observations containing two chemical elements only. An attempt to learnmany-to-many mappings was recently introduced by BID0 , however, this promising approach does not allow to generate data of a higher-order dimension.Our contribution is multi-fold:• To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a GAN to solve the scientific problem of discovery of novel crystal structures, and we introduce an original methodology to generate new stable chemical compositions; • The proposed method is called CrystalGAN, and it consists of two cross-domain GAN blocks with constraints integrating prior knowledge including a feature transfer step; • The proposed model generates data with increased complexity with respect to observed samples; • We demonstrate by numerical experiments on a real challenge of chemistry and materials science that our approach is competitive compared to existing methods; • The proposed algorithm is efficiently implemented in Python, and it will be publicly available shortly, as soon as the contribution is de-anonymized.This paper is organized as follows. We discuss the relatedwork in Section 2. In Section 3, we providethe formalisation of the problem, and introduce the CrystalGAN. The results of our numericalexperiments are discussed in Section 4. Concluding remarks and perspectivesclose the paper.In our numerical experiments, we compare the proposed CrystalGAN with a classical GAN, the DiscoGAN BID13 , and the CrystalGAN but without the geometric constraints.All these GANs generate POSCAR files, and we evaluate the performance of the models by the number of generated ternary structures which satisfy the geometric crystallographic environment.Table 2 shows the number of successes for the considered methods.The classical GAN which takes Gaussian noise as an input, does not generate acceptable chemical structures.The DiscoGAN approach performs quite well if we use it to generate novel pseudo-binary structures, however, it is not adapted to synthesize ternary compositions.We observed that the CrystalGAN (with the geometric constraints) outperforms all tested methods.From multiple discussions with experts in materials science and chemistry, first, we know that the number of novel stable compounds can not be very high, and it is already considered as a success if we synthesize several stable structures which satisfy the constraints.Hence, we can not really reason in terms of accuracy or error rate which are widely used metrics in machine learning and data mining.Second, evaluation of a stable structure is not straightforward.Given a new composition, only the result of density functional theory (DFT) calculations can provide a conclusion whether this composition is stable enough, and whether it can be used in practice.However, the DFT calculations are computationally too expensive, and it is out of question to run them on all data we generated using the CrystalGAN.It is planned to run the DFT calculations on some pre-selected generated ternary compositions to take a final decision on practical utility of the chemical compounds.Our goal was to develop a principled approach to generate new ternary stable crystallographic structures from observed binary, i.e. containing two chemical elements only.We propose a learning method called CrystalGAN to discover cross-domain relations in real data, and to generate novel structures.The proposed approach can efficiently integrate, in form of constraints, prior knowledge provided by human experts.CrystalGAN is the first GAN developed to generate scientific data in the field of materials science.To our knowledge, it is also the first approach which generates data of a higher-order complexity, i.e., ternary structures where the domains are well-separated from observed binary compounds.The CrystalGAN was, in particular, successfully tested to tackle the challenge to discover new materials for hydrogen storage.Currently, we investigate different GANs architectures, also including elements of reinforcement learning, to produce data even of a higher complexity, e.g., compounds containing four or five chemical elements.Note that although the CrystalGAN was developed and tested for applications in materials science, it is a general method where the constraints can be easily adapted to any scientific problem.","answer":"\\"Generating new chemical materials using novel cross-domain GANs.\\""},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Unfortunately, these labels are rather large, which can influence the molecule's structural features. Furthermore, these tags bind specifically to a particular amino acid sequence. That's why the target system must be known precisely in advance 17,18 . Besides this enzymatic approach, non-canonical amino acids that contain different functional groups (ethynyl- 19 , azido- 20 , halogen- 21 ), can be incorporated into the peptide's sequence and further utilized 12,15,[22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] . However, this process is exceptionally labor-intensive and proceeds with only low yields 34 .</p><p>To overcome these issues, the post modification of peptides with PHIP-relevant fragments by small and selective labels is the most promising approach. Among the numerous possibilities that are already described in literature [35][36][37][38][39] , we decided to adopt the bifunctional cross-link strategy based on acylated allylic sulfones, which was first described by Liberatore and Brocchini 40,41 . They selectively modified disulfide bridges that are frequently present in therapeutically relevant proteins as binding sites, e.g. antibodies 41 or somatostatin 16 . Those disulfide bonds are reduced and expanded by three carbon atoms, which can carry additional functional elements. The decisive advantage of this method is that the integrity of the protein structure isn't compromised 42 . Weil et al. took advantage of this concept and presented a toolbox of allylsulfone intercalators presenting various functional groups such as boronic acid, azide or rhodamine as imaging probe 43 . Moreover, they prepared the ethynyl-containing intercalator 2, which we utilized for our PHIP experiments (Scheme 1).</p><p>As a model system we chose the cyclic heptapeptide eptifibatide (Integrilin, 1), which is derived from a disintegrin protein 44 found in the venom of rattlesnake (sistrurus miliarius barbouri), which is used as an antiplatelet aggregation inhibitor. The high potential of this drug is based on its cyclic structure and the \\"K\\"GD amino acid sequence (Lys-Gly-Asp) [45][46][47] .</p><p>Herein, we demonstrate by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) that the intercalator 2 can be incorporated into the disulfide bridge of the peptide. Recently it has been shown that eptifibatide can be efficiently spin-labeled for hyperpolarization applications employing Dynamic Nuclear Polarization 50 . In the present paper we demonstrate that it is also feasible to employ derivatives of eptifibatide as efficient hyperpolarization sources in PHIP-NMR spectroscopy. In particular, we point out the high value of the label for PHIP-NMR spectroscopy by hydrogenation of the ethynyl fragment (Scheme 1).</p>Methods<p>All synthetic procedures, reagents, methods as well as spectroscopic parameters and spectra of the PHIP-measurements are reported in the Supporting Information.</p>Results and discussion<p>Synthesis and intercalation of label 2. According to Scheme 2, we started our research by synthesizing the bissulfone label 2 following a published procedure to a similar compound 51 with slight modifications. In the first step p-acetyl benzoic acid 5 was subjected to a double Mannich-type reaction. The crude reaction product was directly used in the following substitution reaction with p-thiocresol as a nucleophile yielding the bisulfide 6 which, after recrystallization was isolated in 63% yield. After oxidation of the sulfides by peracetic acid the corresponding bissulfone 7 was obtained in 76% yield. The implementation of the PHIP-relevant ethynyl-fragment was achieved by EDC-mediated (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide) amide-coupling with propargylamine. After purification by column chromatography the intercalator was separated from all hazardous impurities as observed by analytical HPLC and HPLC-MS (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 7) and was obtained as a mixture of bissulfone 2 and allylsulfone 8 with a yield of 43% and an overall yield of the 3-step synthesis  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of 21%. Considering the fact that the bissulfone 2 will be converted into the allylsulfone 8 in the intercalation reaction anyway, no further purification is needed. (For more information see Ref. 43 and Supplementary Information).</p><p>With the label mixture (2/8) in hand, the intercalation reaction proceeded in a two-step sequence. First, the mixture of 2 and 8 is converted completely to the reactive species 8 by dissolving the mixture in a slightly alkaline aqueous solution (pH = 7.8). At this point the reduced eptifibatide (after purification) was added and the resulting mixture stirred at room temperature until full consumption of the starting materials (Scheme 3).</p><p>The insertion process of the unsaturated fragment into the disulfide bridge can be followed by HPLC (Fig. 1). The DTT-mediated (Dithiothreitol) reduction of eptifibatide results in a prolonged retention time of the resulting dithiol 9 compared to eptifibatide 1 with a closed disulfide bridge. Similarly, the insertion of the label 8 causes a delayed elution time for the modified peptide 3 relative to the dithiol 9. The HPLC-trace of the intercalator mixture 2 and 8 is shown to verify its complete consumption.</p><p>In parallel to the HPLC traces, the successful incorporation of the label can also be confirmed by ESI-MS. Analogous to the chromatograms shown above, the molecular ion peaks are shown, which indicate the increase in mass of the peptide due to the binding of the label. The measured mass spectra agree with the theoretically determined values (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information).</p>Enhancement factor determination.<p>To show the suitability of the label 2 for PHIP-NMR spectroscopy, the triple bond is hydrogenated with para-H 2 using [Rh(dppb)COD)]BF 4 as catalyst (Scheme 4).</p><p>For the determination of the enhancement factor several 1 H-NMR spectra are acquired. In addition to the spectrum after complete hydrogenation (in thermal equilibrium structure 4), a spectrum showing the shortlived first hydrogenation step to the parahydrogen added N-allyl amide 10 was recorded (Fig. 3B). Based on this hydrogenation the PHIP activity of the ethynyl labeled eptifibatide 3 was proven and an enhancement factor determined was estimated (see Supplementary Information for calculation).  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 3 shows the spectra of 3 in deuterated methanol under enhancement conditions (during hydrogenation with para-H 2 ; Fig. 3B) and in thermal equilibrium after complete hydrogenation (Fig. 3A). The PHIP signals of the vinyl group are located at 5.95 and 5.17 ppm (terminal protons). The PHIP-signals with the low chemical shift and the complex multiplicity in the range from 4.38 to 1.54 ppm can be assigned to the 3 mg of the catalytically active complex Rh(dppb)(COD)BF 4 contained in the sample (see Supplementary Information), the \\"pseudo\\" PHIP signal at 4.58 ppm is due to the PNL-Effect (partial negative line shape). This arises when molecular hydrogen enriched with para-H 2 is solubilized in e.g., methanol interacting with an organometallic hydrogenation catalyst 52 .</p><p>The PHIP spectrum (Fig. 3B) is measured in a single scan. For the thermally relaxed spectrum (Fig. 3A), 4096 scans were required to observe a visible and evaluable signal of the hydrogenated label (the terminal methyl group of the fully hydrogenated product). The required high number of scans in the thermally relaxed spectrum is due to the low concentration of 0.2 mM of 3 in MeOH-d 4 .</p><p>Owing to the transient nature of the vinyl-intermediate, which is not visible in the thermally relaxed spectrum, the enhancement factor can be estimated only indirectly by comparing the integral ratios of the PHIP-spectrum (vinyl signal at 5.17 ppm) and the thermally relaxed spectrum (alkyl signal at 0.86 ppm), marked as insets in Fig. 3 and assigned in Scheme 4. Comparing these integrals, a factor of 1000 can be estimated as lower limit for the enhancement factor (details of the calculation can be found in Supplementary Information).</p><p>These results clearly prove that the insertion of label 2 was successful leading to a very efficient PHIP labelling. It has been demonstrated that PHIP-active, site selective labeled biomolecules can be synthesized using the approach described above. This PHIP labeling creates a very strong signal enhancement of the protons of the allyl-group. Such a signal enhancement can be employed for example for selective binding studies of the eptifibatide or similar molecules to a target protein 15 . Moreover this opens up the way to ULTRAFAST 2D-NMR of such complexes 31 .</p>Conclusion<p>A bis-sulfone-based label was synthesized and its suitability for the site-selective insertion into the disulfide bridge of a bioactive peptide was demonstrated. The ethynyl-modified intercalator was obtained as a two-component mixture of the bissulfone 2 and its elimination product 8, where both components can participate in the labeling reaction because the active MICHAEL acceptor 8 is formed by elimination under the reaction conditions. As an example for the feasibility of the obtained unsaturated system as a substrate for PHIP labeling studies, the disulfide bridge of eptifibatide 1, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide derived from a disintegrin protein from the venom of the rattlesnake Sistrurus miliarius barbourin, was chosen. After label insertion, it was possible to A factor of 1000 was estimated as a lower limit for the signal enhancement of the hyperpolarized protons of the newly formed vinyl group in comparison with the final formed alkyl group. This result paves the way for future applications of ethynyl-substituted systems like 2/8 to be successfully used for future PHIP-applications, utilizing the site selective opening of disulfide bridges in biologically active compounds. Comparison of the 1 H-NMR spectra of (A) the thermally relaxed spectrum after full hydrogenation (4096 scans) and (B) the PHIP spectrum (single scan) after addition of para-H 2 (enrichment of > 95%) (500 MHz, MeOH-d4, 298 K). The PHIP spectrum reveals hyperpolarized lines of the catalyst system (see Supplementary Fig. 10) and the strongly PHIP enhanced signal of the labeled eptifibatide, which is visible in the single scan spectrum with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The obtained enhancement factor, estimated from the insets for the signal at 5.17 ppm is above 1000 (see Supplementary Information for calculation).</p>","answer":"A specific labeling strategy for bioactive molecules is presented for eptifibatide (integrilin) an antiplatelet aggregation inhibitor, which derives from the disintegrin protein barbourin in the venom of certain rattlesnakes. By specifically labeling the disulfide bridge this molecule becomes accessible for the nuclear spin hyperpolarization method of parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP). The PHIP-label was synthesized and inserted into the disulfide bridge of eptifibatide via reduction of the peptide and insertion by a double Michael addition under physiological conditions. This procedure is universally applicable for disulfide-containing biomolecules and preserves their tertiary structure with a minimum of change. HPLC and MS spectra prove the successful insertion of the label. 1 H-PHIP-NMR experiments yield a factor of over 1000 as lower limit for the enhancement factor. These results demonstrate the high potential of the labeling strategy for the introduction of site selective PHIPlabels into biomolecules' disulfide bonds. AbbreviationsNMR Nuclear magnetic resonance SEOP Spin exchange optical pumping DNP Dynamic nuclear polarization PHIP ParaHydrogen induced polarization SABRE Signal amplification by reversible exchange SE Signal enhancementBesides analytical methods such as circular dichromatic spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography (XRD) or smallangle neutron scattering (SANS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the method of choice for most scientists, when structural questions on biomolecules, signaling pathways or biological networks arise 1,2 . Unfortunately, the inherent limitation of NMR analysis is the low sensitivity and a distinct signal broadening in case of macromolecular systems 3 . Therefore, hyperpolarization techniques such as spin exchange optical pumping (SEOP) 4 , dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) 5 , (parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) 6,7 or SABRE (signal amplification by reversible exchange) 8,9 gain increased interest in overcoming the low sensitivity of NMR. These methods differ in the source of polarization, which provides the signal enhancement on the investigated nuclei [10][11][12][13] . In case of biological structure analysis PHIP-measurements seem to be the most promising method, due to its inexpensive technical set up and easy measurement conditions 14 . Besides a multiple bond, on which a hydrogenation catalyst can hydrogenate, PHIP does not impose any special conditions on the substrate. There is no need of high or low temperature, no additional radical matrix, no microwave, laser radiation or the necessity of expensive hardware, etc. One prerequisite for the structural investigation of biological entities, e.g. peptides via PHIP is the implementation of unsaturated moieties, which can be hydrogenated by para-H 2 15 . To chemically functionalize natural proteins, the binding method and also the label itself must satisfy a number of requirements. In addition to biocompatibility, they must be stable and biologically safe. This implies that the label must have a high selectivity and reactivity towards a certain binding site, while preserving the tertiary structure 16 ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

This prospect i ve study assessed whether cognitive functioning is impaired during 12 months of AD therapy . Longitudinal testing of 25 patients treated with AD and curative radiotherapy  was undertaken at baseline , and at 6 and 12 months . CogniSpeed © software was used for measuring attentional performances . Other cognitive performances were evaluated using verbal , visuomotor and memory tests . The Beck depression inventory was employed to evaluate depressive mood and EORTC QLQ-C30 for quality of life ( QoL ) . During longitudinal testing of the AD group , no impairment in cognitive performances was found . Instead , improvement was observed in object recall ( immediate , P=0.035 ; delayed , P<0.001 ) , and in semantic memory ( P=0.037 ) . In QoL , impairment in physical function was observed . And rogen deprivation of 12 months appears to be associated with preserved cognitive functioning , although physical impairment occurs . These results have implication s for counseling and psychosocial support of patients in the context of treatment options in PCTitle 2:Does neoadjuvant hormone therapy for early prostate cancer affect cognition? Results from a pilot study.Abstract 2:OBJECTIVE To examine , in a prospect i ve study , the influence that temporary reversible medical castration for localized prostate cancer has on cognition , by assessing whether temporary 3 - 5 month treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist before radical radiotherapy had a short- or long-term affect on cognitive function . PATIENTS , SUBJECTS AND METHODS Thirty-two patients with localized prostate cancer had  cognitive assessment  s at baseline ( T1 ) before the start of drug treatment , at 3 months ( T2 ) or on completing drug treatment but before radiotherapy , and 9 months later ( T3 ) . Eighteen men with no prostate cancer ( controls subjects ) completed the  cognitive tests  at the same times . In addition , psychological functioning and quality of life were assessed at the same times , together with serum free and bound testosterone , beta-oestradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin levels . RESULTS There was a significant cognitive decline ( on at least one cognitive task ) at T2 in 15 ( 47 % ) patients vs three ( 17 % ) of controls ( odds ratio 4.412 , P = 0.033 ) . Most patients ( nine of 15 ) who had a change in performance declined on tasks of spatial memory and ability . At T3 there was significant cognitive decline in 11 ( 34 % ) patients and five ( 28 % ) control subjects ( odds ratio 1.37 , P = 0.631 ) . CONCLUSION This pilot study suggests that short-term LHRH therapy for early-stage prostate cancer has modest short-term consequences on men 's cognitive functioning ; a larger prospect i ve study is warrantedTitle 3:The effects of combined androgen blockade on cognitive function during the first cycle of intermittent androgen suppression in patients with prostate cancer.Abstract 3:PURPOSE Men with prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) only relapse of prostate cancer after primary therapy are generally fully functional and asymptomatic with a life expectancy of up to 10 or more years . These patients are often treated with and rogen suppression . We evaluate the effects of and rogen suppression on cognitive function . MATERIAL S AND METHODS Hormone naïve patients without evidence of metastases with an increasing PSA were treated with intermittent and rogen suppression consisting of 9 months of leuprolide and flutamide followed by an off treatment period determined by the increase in PSA .  Cognitive function tests were administered at baseline , after 9 months of and rogen suppression and after 3 months off treatment . Cognitive tests measured spatial abilities , spatial memory , verbal fluency , verbal memory and selective attention .  A total of 19 patients 52 to 76 years old completed the intermittent and rogen suppression study along with 15 healthy community dwelling control participants . RESULTS Combined and rogen blockade reduced PSA and testosterone in all patients compared to baseline . Patients did not significantly change on measures of verbal and spatial memory , executive functions or language . Patients declined on a measure of spatial rotation and improved on a measure of verbal memory during treatment which continued during the off treatment period . CONCLUSIONS Although preliminary , these findings demonstrate that 9 months of combined and rogen blockade result ed in a beneficial effect on verbal memory but adversely affected a measure of spatial ability .  Intermittent and rogen suppression for a period of 9 months in otherwise healthy men with prostate cancer may have beneficial and adverse effects on cognition that are selectiveTitle 4:Altered cognitive function in men treated for prostate cancer with luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone analogues and cyproterone acetate: a randomized controlled trialAbstract 4:Objective To report the first systematic investigation of the cognitive effects of luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogues in male patients , as LHRH analogues have been associated with memory impairments in women using these drugs for gynaecological conditionsTitle 5:Estradiol and cognition during androgen deprivation in men with prostate carcinomaAbstract 5:The adverse effects of hormonal manipulation in prostate carcinoma need to be established in view of its increasing use as an adjuvant treatment .

METHODS AND RESULTS Thirty-two patients ( median age of 71 years , range 51 - 87 ) were administrated an extensive neuropsychological testing battery prior to ADT initiation , with 21 ( 65 % ) completing post-treatment evaluations 6 months later . At baseline , 45 % scored > 1.5 st and ard deviations below the mean on > or = 2 neuropsychological measures . Using st and ardized inferential statistics , no change in cognition was documented following treatment . The Reliable Change Index revealed that , on a case-by-case basis , 38 % demonstrated a decline in measures of executive functioning and 48 % showed improvement on measures of visuospatial abilities . Within exploratory analyses , patients who scored below expectation at baseline displayed no change in cognition , while patients with average or better scores at baseline displayed improvements in visuospatial planning and timed tests of phonemic fluency . CONCLUSIONS We found a high prevalence of lower than expected cognitive performance among a sample of patients just starting ADT for prostate cancer . Assessment of baseline cognitive function should be taken into account for future research and to inform clinical managementTitle 7:One year follow-up study of the association between chemical castration, sex hormones, beta-amyloid, memory and depression in menAbstract 7:The results of several recent studies suggest that estrogen and testosterone play an important role in the modulation of mood and cognitive function in women , and preliminary evidence indicates that these hormones may also modulate the levels of beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) , a 4 Kilo Dalton peptide that is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease . However , the physiological and clinical effects of reversible castration remain unclear and no systematic data is currently available for men . We design ed the present study to investigate the effects of reversible chemical castration on the mood and cognitive performance of men treated for prostate cancer , as well as its impact on the levels of plasma Abeta .  Forty men with prostate cancer were clinical ly treated with  and rogen blockade therapy ( flutamide and leuprolide ) for 36 weeks and subsequently followed up for another 18 weeks after treatment was discontinued . All subjects received a comprehensive clinical , neuropsychological and biochemical evaluation that included the use of the Beck Depression ( BDI ) and Anxiety Inventories ( BAI ) , several subtests of the Wechsler Memory and Intelligence Scales ( Word Lists-WL , Verbal Paired Associates-VPA , Visual Reproduction-VR and Block Design -BD ) , and biochemical monitoring of changes in estrogen , testosterone and Abeta levels . Chemical castration was associated with a rapid and marked decline in the levels of testosterone and estradiol , and significant increase in plasma Abeta levels . Treatment was associated with increased BDI ( p = 0.004 ) and BAI scores ( p < 0.001 ) , although such changes were of question able clinical significance ( i.e. , few subjects had scores > or = 13 ) . CAMCOG ( p = 0.046 ) and WL recall total scores ( p < 0.001 ) improved significantly after and rogen blockade treatment was discontinued , but visuospatial abilities , as assessed by BD , was not influenced by the introduction or discontinuation of treatment . There was a significant negative correlation between changes in Abeta levels and subjects ' WL total score change between weeks 36 and 54 ( r = -0.452 , p = 0.012 ) . The results of this naturalistic study indicate that chemical castration is associated with a significant rise in the plasma levels of Abeta and , clinical ly , with increased depression and anxiety scores . The discontinuation of treatment is associated with better cognitive performance , most noticeably of verbal memory . The performance of subjects on the WL test was negatively correlated with plasma levels of Abeta , but the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determinedTitle 8:Prevalence and predictive factors for the development of de novo psychiatric illness in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.Abstract 8:OBJECTIVE And rogen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) remains a widely utilized modality for treatment of localized and advanced prostate cancer . While ADT-induced alterations in testosterone have demonstrated impacts on quality of life , the effects on mental health remain ill-defined . We investigated the prevalence of de novo psychiatric illness and predictive factors following ADT induction for prostate cancer . MATERIAL S AND METHODS We retrospectively review ed patients receiving ADT for prostate cancer at our institution between 1/1989 - 7/2005 , excluding men receiving only neoadjuvant ADT .  Variables included age , race , body mass index , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , Gleason sum , clinical stage , ADT type ( medical/surgical ) and schedule ( continuous/intermittent ) , and presence of pre-ADT and newly diagnosed psychiatric illness . The cohort was divided into three groups for analysis : pre-ADT psychiatric illness , de novo psychiatric illness , and no psychiatric illness . Data analysis utilized statistical software with p < 0.05 considered significant . RESULTS Three-hundred and ninety-five patients with a mean age of 71.7 years at ADT initiation were analyzed . Thirty-four men ( 8.6 % ) were diagnosed with pre-ADT psychiatric illness .  At mean follow-up of 87.4 months , 101 ( 27.9 % ) men were diagnosed with de novo psychiatric illness , most commonly including : depression ( n = 57 ; 56.4 % ) , dementia ( n = 14 ; 13.9 % ) , and anxiety ( n = 9 ; 8.9 % ) . On multivariate analysis , increasing pre-ADT PSA was predictive of post-ADT anxiety ( p = 0.01 ) . Overall and disease-specific survival outcomes were similar between groups . CONCLUSIONS De novo psychiatric illness was identified in 27.9 % of men . While no predictive factors were identified for de novo psychiatric illness , increasing PSA was associated with de novo anxiety . Prospect i ve investigation using vali date d instruments is requisite to further delineate the relationship between ADT and psychiatric health","answer":"Cognitive domains impaired by ADT included : verbal memory , visuospatial ability and executive functions .A variety of measures and methods were used to assess cognitive function including neuropsychological tests , self‐report measures and clinical assessment s. The finding that , often , one measure was used to assess more than one aspect of cognition is likely to have contributed to imprecise estimates ."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

However, the existing pre-trained language representation models rarely consider explicitly incorporating commonsense knowledge or other knowledge. In this paper, we develop a pre-training approach for incorporating commonsense knowledge into language representation models. We construct a commonsense-related multi-choice question answering dataset for pre-training a neural language representation model. The dataset is created automatically by our proposed\\"align, mask, and select\\"(AMS) method. We also investigate different pre-training tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that pre-training models using the proposed approach followed by fine-tuning achieves significant improvements on various commonsense-related tasks, such as CommonsenseQA and Winograd Schema Challenge, while maintaining comparable performance on other NLP tasks, such as sentence classification and natural language inference (NLI) tasks, compared to the original BERT models.Distant SupervisionThe distant supervision approach was originally proposed for generating training data for the relation classification task. The distant supervision approach BIBREF12 assumes that if two entities/concepts participate in a relation, all sentences that mention these two entities/concepts express that relation. Note that it is inevitable that there exists noise in the data labeled by distant supervision BIBREF20 . In this paper, instead of employing the relation labels labeled by distant supervision, we focus on the aligned entities/concepts. We propose the AMS method to construct a multi-choice QA dataset that align sentences with commonsense knowledge triples, mask the aligned words (entities/concepts) in sentences and treat the masked sentences as questions, and select several entities/concepts from knowledge graphs as candidate choices.Constructing Pre-training DatasetIn this section, we describe the details of constructing the commonsense-related multi-choice question answering dataset. Firstly, we filter the triples in ConceptNet with the following steps: (1) Filter triples in which one of the concepts is not English words. (2) Filter triples with the general relations “RelatedTo\\" and “IsA\\", which hold a large proportion in ConceptNet. (3) Filter triples in which one of the concepts has more than four words or the edit distance between the two concepts is less than four. After filtering, we obtain 606,564 triples.Each training sample is generated by three steps: align, mask and select, which we call as AMS method. Each sample in the dataset consists of a question and several candidate answers, which has the same form as the CommonsenseQA dataset. An example of constructing one training sample by masking concept _2 is shown in Table 2 .Firstly, we align each triple (concept _1 , relation, concept _2 ) from ConceptNet to the English Wikipedia dataset to extract the sentences with their concepts labeled. Secondly, we mask the concept _1 /concept _2 in one sentence with a special token [QW] and treat this sentence as a question, where QW is a replacement word of the question words “what\\", “where\\", etc. And the masked concept _1 /concept _2 is the correct answer for this question. Thirdly, for generating the distractors, BIBREF18 proposed a method to form distractors by randomly picking words or phrases in ConceptNet. In this paper, in order to generate more confusing distractors than the random selection approach, we request those distractors and the correct answer share the same concept _2 or concept _1 and the relation. That is to say, we search ( ast  , relation, concept _2 ) and (concept _20 , relation, _21 ) in ConceptNet to select the distractors instead of random selection, where _22 is a wildcard character that can match any word or phrase. For each question, we reserve four distractors and one correct answer. If there are less than four matched distractors, we discard this question instead of complementing it with random selection. If there are more than four distractors, we randomly select four distractors from them. After applying the AMS method, we create 16,324,846 multi-choice question answering samples.CommonsenseQAIn this subsection, we conduct experiments on a commonsense-related multi-choice question answering benchmark, the CommonsenseQA dataset BIBREF10 . The CommonsenseQA dataset consists of 12,247 questions with one correct answer and four distractor answers. This dataset consists of two splits – the question token split and the random split. Our experiments are conducted on the more challenging random split, which is the main evaluation split according to BIBREF10 . The statistics of the CommonsenseQA dataset are shown in Table 3 .Same as the pre-training stage, the input data for fine-tuning the BERT_CS models is formed by concatenating each question-answer pair as a sequence. The hidden representations over the [CLS] token are run through a softmax layer to create the predictions. The objective function is the same as Equations 10 and 11 . We fine-tune the BERT_CS models on CommonsenseQA for 2 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of 16.Table 4 shows the accuracies on the CommonsenseQA test set from the baseline BERT models released by Google, the previous state-of-the-art model CoS-E BIBREF19 , and our BERT_CS models. Note that CoS-E model requires a large amount of human effort to collect the Common Sense Explanations (CoS-E) dataset. In comparison, we construct our multi-choice question-answering dataset automatically. The BERT_CS models significantly outperform the baseline BERT model counterparts. BERT_CS _{large} achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement on the CommonsenseQA test set over the baseline BERT _{large} model and a 4% absolute improvement over the previous SOTA CoS-E model.GLUEThe General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark BIBREF6 is a collection of diverse natural language understanding tasks, including MNLI, QQP, QNLI, SST-2, CoLA, STS-B, MRPC, of which CoLA and SST-2 are single-sentence tasks, MRPC, STS-B and QQP are similarity and paraphrase tasks, and MNLI, QNLI, RTE and WNLI are natural language inference tasks. To investigate whether our multi-choice QA based pre-training approach degenerates the performance on common sentence classification tasks, we evaluate the BERT_CS _{base} and BERT_CS _{large} models on 8 GLUE datasets and compare the performances with those from the baseline BERT models.Following BIBREF4 , we use the batch size 32 and fine-tune for 3 epochs for all GLUE tasks, and select the fine-tuning learning rate (among 1e-5, 2e-5, and 3e-5) based on the performance on the development set. Results are presented in Table 6 . We observe that the BERT_CS _{large} model achieves comparable performance with the BERT _{large} model and the BERT_CS _{base} model achieves slightly better performance than the BERT _{base} model. We hypothesize that the commonsense knowledge may not be required for GLUE tasks. On the other hand, these results demonstrate that our proposed multi-choice QA pre-training task does not degrade the sentence representation capabilities of BERT models.Pre-training StrategyIn this subsection, we conduct several comparison experiments using different data and different pre-training tasks on the BERT _{base} model. For simplicity, we discard the subscript base in this subsection.The first set of experiments is to compare the efficacy of our data creation approach versus the data creation approach in BIBREF18 . First, same as BIBREF18 , we collect 606,564 triples from ConceptNet, and construct 1,213,128 questions, each with a correct answer and four distractors. This dataset is denoted the TRIPLES dataset. We pre-train BERT models on the TRIPLES dataset with the same hyper-parameters as the BERT_CS models and the resulting model is denoted BERT_triple. We also create several model counterparts based on our constructed dataset:Distractors are formed by randomly picking concept _1 /concept _2 in ConceptNet instead of those sharing the same concept _2 /concept _1 and the relation with the correct answers. We denote the resulting model from this dataset BERT_CS_random.Instead of pre-training BERT with a multi-choice QA task that chooses the correct answer from several candidate answers, we mask concept _1 and concept _2 and pre-train BERT with a masked language model (MLM) task. We denote the resulting model from this pre-training task BERT_MLM.We randomly mask 15% WordPiece tokens BIBREF27 of the question as in BIBREF4 and then conduct both multi-choice QA task and MLM task simultaneously. The resulting model is denoted BERT_CS_MLM.All these BERT models are fine-tuned on the CommonsenseQA dataset with the same hyper-parameters as described in Section \\"CommonsenseQA\\" and the results are shown in Table 7 . We observe the following from Table 7 .Comparing model 1 and model 2, we find that pre-training on ConceptNet benefits the CommonsenseQA task even with the triples as input instead of sentences. Further comparing model 2 and model 6, we find that constructing sentences as input for pre-training BERT performs better on the CommonsenseQA task than using triples for pre-training BERT. We also conduct more detailed comparisons between fine-tuning model 1 and model 2 on GLUE tasks. The results are shown in Table 6 . BERT_triple _{base} yields much worse results than BERT _{base} and BERT_CS _{base} , which demonstrates that pre-training directly on triples may hurt the sentence representation capabilities of BERT.Comparing model 3 and model 6, we find that pre-training BERT benefits from a more difficult dataset. In our selection method, all candidate answers share the same (concept _1 , relation) or (relation, concept _2 ), that is, these candidates have close meanings. These more confusing candidates force BERT_CS to distinguish synonym meanings, resulting in a more powerful BERT_CS model.Comparing model 5 and model 6, we find that the multi-choice QA task works better than the masked LM task as the pre-training task for the target multi-choice QA task. We argue that, for the masked LM task, BERT_CS is required to predict each masked wordpieces (in concepts) independently and for the multi-choice QA task, BERT is required to model the whole candidate phrases. In this way, BERT is able to model the whole concepts instead of paying much attention to the single wordpieces in the sentences. Comparing model 4 and model 6, we observe that adding the masked LM task may hurt the performance of BERT_CS. This is probably because the masked words in questions may have a negative influence on the multi-choice QA task. Finally, our proposed model BERT_CS achieves the best performance on the CommonsenseQA development set among these model counterparts.Performance CurveIn this subsection, we plot the performance curve on CommonsenseQA development set from BERT_CS over the pre-training steps. For every 10,000 training steps, we save the model as the initial model for fine-tuning. For every of these models, we run experiments for 10 times repeatedly with random restarts, that is, we use the same pre-trained checkpoint but perform different fine-tuning data shuffling. Due to the unstability of fine-tuning BERT BIBREF4 , we remove the results that are significantly lower than the mean. In our experiments, we remove the accuracy lower than 0.57 for BERT_CS _{base} and 0.60 for BERT_CS _{large} . We plot the mean and standard deviation values in Figure 1 . We observe that the performance of BERT_CS _{base} converges around 50,000 training steps and BERT_CS _{large} converges around the end of the pre-training stage or may not have converged, which demonstrates that the BERT_CS _{large} is more powerful at incorporating commonsense knowledge. We also compare with pre-training BERT_CS models for 2 epochs. However, our model produces worse performance probably due to over-fitting. Pre-training on a larger corpus (with more QA samples) may benefit the BERT_CS models and we leave this to the future work.Error AnalysisTable 8 shows several cases from the Winograd Schema Challenge dataset. Questions 1 and 2 only differ in the words “compassionate\\" and “cruel\\". Our model BERT_CS _{large} chooses correct answers for both questions while BERT _{large} chooses the same choice “Bill\\" for both questions. We speculate that BERT _{large} tends to choosing the closer candidates. We split WSC test set into two parts CLOSE and FAR according as the correct candidate is closer or farther to the pronoun word in the sentence than another candidate. As shown in Table 9 , our model BERT_CS _{large} achieves the same performance on CLOSE set and better performance on FAR set than BERT _{large} . That's to say, BERT_CS _{large} is more robust to the position of the words and focuses more on the semantic of the sentence.Questions 3 and 4 only differ in the words “large\\" and “small\\". However, neither BERT_CS _{large} nor BERT _{large} chooses the correct answers. We hypothesize that since “suitcase is large\\" and “trophy is small\\" are probably quite frequent for language models, both BERT _{large} and BERT_CS _{large} models make mistakes. In future work, we will investigate other approaches for overcoming the sensitivity of language models and improving commonsense reasoning.Table 2: The detailed procedures of constructing one multichoice question answering sample.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  A science of positive subjective experience, positive individual traits, and positive institutions promises to improve quality of life and prevent the pathologies that arise when life is barren and meaningless, The exclusive focus on pathology that has dominated so much of our discipline results in a model of the human being lacking the positive features that make life worth living. Hope, wisdom, creativity, future mindedness, courage, spirituality, responsibility, and perseverance are ignored or explained as transformations of more authentic negative impulses. The 15 articles in this millennial issue of the American Psychologist discuss such issues as what enables happiness, the effects of autonomy and self-regulation, how optimism and hope affect health, what constitutes wisdom, and how talent and creativity come to fruition. The authors outline a framework for a science of positive psychology, point to gaps in our knowledge, and predict that the next century will see a science and profession that will come to understand and build the factors that allow individuals, communities, and societies to flourish. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Abstract Students increasingly demand more constructive online courses that not only provide information but also facilitate studying experiences. Educational games offer a viable strategy to this end. In this paper, the experiences of university students ( n = 18) playing an educational game, IT-Emperor, which was designed to facilitate flow experience, are studied through questionnaires and interviews. The main purpose of this paper is to study the usefulness of content creation challenges included in IT-Emperor and factors that have an influence on flow experience. Results indicate that half of the participants experienced flow while playing IT-Emperor. This finding is significant because flow tends to have a positive impact on learning. Content creation was reported as the main activity causing flow; bad usability and low gamefulness were cited as obstacles of flow experience. However, because of the small sample size of this study, more research on the topic is recommended. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Abstract Objectives This study aimed to provide an up-to-date summary of the literature on flow in elite sport, specifically relating to: (i) how flow is experienced; (ii) how these states occur; and (iii) the potential controllability of flow. Design Systematic review. Methods A comprehensive literature search of SPORTdiscus, PsycINFO, SAGE journals online, INGENTA connect, and Web of Knowledge was completed in August, 2011, and yielded 17 empirical studies published between 1992 and 2011. The primarily qualitative findings were analysed thematically and synthesised using a narrative approach. Results Findings indicated that: (i) some flow dimensions appear to be experienced more consistently than others; (ii) key factors were consistently reported to induce or inhibit flow occurrence; and (iii) the perception that flow experiences could be controllable to some extent, and are not merely ‘coincidental’. Additionally, it is appears that physiology is also relevant in flow, and these experiences may be psychophysiological. Conclusions Based on these findings, recommendations are made including the need for researchers to move from description to explanation of flow, the use of new methodologies, greater focus on the role of personality factors, and possible refinements of existing flow theory to be more specific to sport. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  One element of growing interest in the video gaming literature is the flow state, which is a pleasing and engaging experience commonly reported by players of games. As such, there are many different measures and methods that seek to quantify the flow experience. The present work examined whether a common measure of flow, the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (DFS-2), was valid to use in the gamer population. We initially collected data from 762 undergraduate students. Of these, 314 qualified as ''gamers'' and were included in our analysis. Participants completed the DFS-2 based on their personal gaming experiences and the data was subjected to factor analysis. We did not find the DFS-2 to be an adequate measure of flow for the game experience and that continued examination of the construct and measure refinement is necessary. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  Abstract Educational games have to be well designed to incorporate learner engagement, an integral component of educational effectiveness. One foundation of designing educational engagement is flow theory. This article presents a flow framework that describes the building blocks of flow experience that can be used to design appealing and effective educational games for formal and informal learning contexts. The framework provides the principles for good educational game design, based upon associative, cognitive and situative learning theories, including engagement and pedagogic elements with a focus upon feedback and flow principles. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the relation between the flow experience and immersion. We tested the flow framework in the RealGame case study, which revealed that the RealGame business simulation game was well designed and effective at engaging students. We found that the university students’ flow experience in the game was high and the findings indicated that sense of control, clear goals and challenge-skill dimensions of flow scored the highest, but a rewarding experience and feedback dimensions also scored highly by the students. Overall, the results indicate that flow framework is a useful tool in studying game-based learning experiences. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  This chapter addresses the question of what builds the basis for flow experiences to emerge. We focus our discussion on the situational antecedents of flow and emphasize the fact that the emergence of flow is basically dependent on a perceived fit of skills and task demands. We also refer to additional factors relevant regarding specific components of flow. In addition, we critically discuss the “above average” perspective and the related quadrant and octant models of flow highlighting the fact that the “above average” notion is based on problematic assumptions. Finally, we discuss determinants of flow intensity and propose a revised flow model which builds on the original notion of perceived fit of skills and task demands and includes the value attributed to the relevant activity as additional crucial factor. 7.

It emphasizes the positive qualities of life like happiness, fulfillment and optimal experience BIB002 . Such qualities are important for all activities of human kind, including game playing. The enjoyment level that a serious game offers is a key factor in determining whether the player will be engaged in the gameplay, enjoy the playing and achieve the objectives of the game. Thus, the ability to quantify the playing experience and ability to identify what game elements engage players is important goal for both industry and academia. In general, game developers need a reliable way to measure the overall engagement level of their games to pinpoint specific areas of the experience that need improvement BIB005 . Several constructs have been proposed to describe playing experience, but definitional agreement has not been achieved  . Common concepts that have been linked to playing experience are engagement, involvement, immersion, presence, motivation and flow. The concept of flow is one of the most popular constructs used to describe the playing experience BIB005 and positive qualities of life. In fact, Kiili BIB003 has argued that games are most successful and engaging if they can produce flow experiences. Csikszentmihalyi  introduced the flow state through the study of people involved in activities such as rock climbing, chess and dance. Subsequently flow theory has been applied in several different domains including, for example sports, art, work, human-computer interaction, games and education BIB006 . Flow describes a state of complete absorption or engagement in a specific activity in which a person excludes all irrelevant emotions and thoughts BIB001 . During the optimal experience, a person is in a positive psychological state where he or she is so involved with the goal-driven activity that nothing else seems to matter. An activity that produces such experiences is so pleasant that the person may be willing to do something without being concerned what he will get out of his action. This kind of intrinsic motivation is very important especially in serious games that usually require different cognitive or physical investments compared to entertainment games. Csikszentmihalyi BIB008 has distinguished nine flow dimensions that constitute flow experience. These dimensions can be divided into flow conditions and flow characteristics BIB004 . Flow conditions are prerequisites of flow and they are referred also as antecedents of flow. Flow conditions include challenge-skill balance, clear goals, and unambiguous or immediate feedback dimensions. A perceived skill and challenge levels can be identified as the central precondition of flow experience BIB007 (figure 1). Flow characteristics describe the feelings of an individual when experiencing flow. Flow characteristics include sense of control, action awareness merging, loss of self-consciousness, concentration, time distortion and autotelic experience dimensions. On the other hand, it has been argued that the combination of the first eight dimensions of flow leads to flow that is characterised as an autotelic experience (9 th dimension). Autotelic experience refers to enjoyable and intrinsically rewarding experiences. The literature shows that flow researches have not achieved a definitional agreement about the deviation of the dimensions into conditions and characteristics. In spite of that Csikszentmihalyi BIB001 has argued that whenever people reflect on their flow experiences, they mention some, and often all the nine flow dimensions."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease without effective treatment. After ICH, the immediate infiltration of leukocytes and activation of microglia are accompanied by a rapid up-regulation of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). TSPO ligands have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of CNS injury. In this study, we determined the impact of a TSPO ligand, etifoxine, on brain injury and inflammation in 2 mouse models of ICH. TSPO was up-regulated in Iba1(+) cells from brains of patients with ICH and in CD11b(+)CD45(int) cells from mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH. Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after ICH induction by injection of either autologous blood or collagenase. In collagenase-induced ICH mice, the protection of etifoxine was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brain and microglial production of IL-6 and TNF-α. Etifoxine improved blood-brain barrier integrity and diminished cell death. Notably, the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor. These results indicate that the TSPO ligand etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH. TSPO may be a viable therapeutic target that requires further investigations in ICH.-Li, M., Ren, H., Sheth, K. N., Shi, F.-D., Liu, Q.

These include increased activity of the GH/IGF-I axis and a low T(3) syndrome3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 levels increase during strenuous exercise, and, at the end of the exercise bout, a decrease of T3 and T4 levels, with an increase in TSH during the following 4-5 days, is seen.the obtained results indicate that in intense exercise, causing the rapid development of fatigue, rapid increases in serum levels of hormones of the pituitary-adrenocortical, pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-thyroid systems occur.Mean levels of fasting plasma estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly lower in AR compared to ER and SE.Reductions in plasma T4, T3 and T3/T4 ratio are probably due to inhibition of T4 secretion and 5'-monodeiodination with possible conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3). These processes may represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous and extended flight.Strenuous endurance training seems to have minor changes on the function of the thyroid gland. Depressed T4 levels in runners may rather be due to lowered TBG levels than due to direct effect of training.brief strenuous swimming or moderate bicycle exercise had minor or no effect on thyroid hormone concentrations when consideration was given to the attendant hemoconcentration.thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following daysTotal thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period.There are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Both of the toxins irreversibly block the activity of wild type alpha(1B) N-type channels.Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively.Binding assay for both N- and P/Q-type calcium channels showed that amino acid residues restricted to the N-terminal half are important for the recognition of N-type channels, whereas essential residues for P/Q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule.Ziconotide is a novel peptide that blocks the entry of calcium into neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, preventing the conduction of nerve signals.Ziconotide is a selective, potent and reversible blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs).The therapeutic benefit of ziconotide derives from its potent and selective blockade of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels.Interactions of intrathecally administered ziconotide, a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, with morphine on nociception in rats.Ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, administered intrathecally for acute postoperative pain.Ziconotide, an intrathecally administered N-type calcium channel antagonist for the treatment of chronic pain.Thus, ziconotide is the first of a new class of agents--N-type calcium channel blockers, or NCCBs.Ziconotide, formerly known also as SNX- 111, represents a new class of agents, the N-type calcium channel blockers.The selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide ameliorates severe chronic pain but has a narrow therapeutic window and requires intrathecal administration.A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain.As the clinically available analgesics, pregabalin (alpha2delta-subunit calcium channel ligand), ziconotide (N-type calcium channel blocker), mexiletine (sodium channel blocker), and duloxetine (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) were evaluated in these neurochemically-induced allodynia models.The present investigation was designed to assess the safety and analgesic efficacy of ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, when administered intrathecally to patients with acute postoperative pain.Inhibition of the N-type calcium channel by intrathecal administration of the channel-specific blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide) is efficacious in the treatment of severe chronic pain.Ziconotide is a powerful analgesic drug that has a unique mechanism of action involving potent and selective block of N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmission at many synapses.In conclusion, present findings provide implication that the spinal anti-nociceptive mechanistic site of pregabalin is different from that of ziconotide, mexiletine, and duloxetine, and pregabalin could have a broader anti-nociceptive mechanism other than N-type calcium channel blockade.Ziconotide (SNX-111), a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, is antinociceptive when it is administered intrathecally.Effects of intrathecal administration of ziconotide, a selective neuronal N-type calcium channel blocker, on mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in a rat model of postoperative pain.A state-dependent Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor may provide an improved therapeutic window over ziconotide, the peptidyl Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor used clinically.There is also human validation data from ziconotide, the CaV2.2-selective peptidyl inhibitor used clinically to treat refractory pain.A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain.The neuroprotective effects of intrathecal administration of the selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide in a rat model of spinal ischemia.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

hierarchy in layers, and concentrates on the hierarchy of neurons.We observe mass redundancy in the weights of both handcrafted and randomly searched architectures.Inspired by the development of human brains, we prune low-sensitivity neurons in the model and add new neurons to the graph, and the relation between individual neurons are emphasized and the existence of layers weakened.We propose a process to discover the best base model by random architecture search, and discover the best locations and connections of the added neurons by evolutionary search.Experiment results show that the NHN achieves higher test accuracy on Cifar-10 than state-of-the-art handcrafted and randomly searched architectures, while requiring much fewer parameters and less searching time.Neural networks can be designed either by human experts or search algorithms, both of which have gained great success in image classification and language modeling BID45 BID33 .Network architectures designed by both means are mostly layer-based or block-based, which means that the fundamental components are either operation layers or blocks that consist of several layers.A clear tendency can be observed that models with more parameters generally have better performances.It is a well-established fact that redundancy of parameters exists widely in handcrafted neural networks BID16 BID41 BID25 .We find that such claim holds for architectures discovered by random search or evolutionary search as well.The pruning of unimportant neurons emphasizes the hierarchical relation between individual neurons.Additionally, the decrease in accuracy after parameter reduction is generally inevitable.Therefore, we propose a heuristic procedure to construct neuron-based network architectures by pruning redundant connections and neurons in layer-based models and adding new neurons to strengthen the neuron hierarchy while achieving competitive performances as layer-hierarchy models.Experiments show that NHN achieves higher test accuracy than DenseNet , SMASH BID4 and hierarchical representation with much fewer parameters.Handcrafted architectures.Successful convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed by human experts can be sketchily categorized by the way data flow through the networks, i.e., plain networks and branching networks.A notable example of plain networks would be VGG nets BID37 , where there are only one input and output path in each hidden layer.However, in a branching network, the computation flow splits somewhere in the network and merges in a latter layer BID0 .The splitting and aggregation may occur multiple times in a single network.Many have discovered numerous branching network architectures whose performances surpass plain ones while requiring fewer parameters.Skip connections BID17 BID18 are increasingly popular in improving the performance of deep neural networks, and it becomes common to observe additional convolutions (or other forms of operations) stacked between large layers BID24 BID40 .In fact, the \\"stacked-between\\" operations can be considered as part of a generalized residual block.Multi-branching computation graphs benefit addressing the gradient vanishing problem during the gradient descent training BID18 .The distinguished techniques mentioned above (plus more listed in Table 1 ) share the same idea of weakening the hierarchy between layers by introducing complex paths to the data flow.The idea is further highlighted by architecture search algorithms.Random and evolutionary architectures.Machine learning algorithms evolve fast.Designing neural networks that perform remarkably on a given task requires ample experience.It has been found that neural networks are not only good at autonomically extracting useful features from raw data, but also capable of finding optimal network architectures to that end.Neural architecture search (NAS) has been attested to its ability to design network architectures for language modeling and image classification.However, candidate models have to be entirely randomly generated and fully trained, therefore NAS is extremely computation intensive, which dims its competitive performances to handcrafted architectures.Many efforts have been devoted to reducing the computational costs of NAS while ensuring sufficient capacity of search space BID47 BID5 .Two major ideas to achieve the purpose are to design individual reusable cells rather than the entire networks or to share trained weights between models.Recently, BID33 proposed to describe each candidate model as a subgraph of a single directed acyclic graph (DAG).By sharing weights between submodels, the searching time of NAS is reduced by 1000X in term of GPU-hours.Genetic algorithms are also applied in searching the optimal architectures of CNNs BID29 BID43 BID34 .BID35 proposed regularized evolution (RE) to remove the oldest models from the population, instead of removing the worst ones as in traditional tournament selection BID14 .The best CNN model discovered by RE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Cifar-10, i.e., 2.13% test accuracy on average.However, the number of parameters it requires is as large as nearly 35 million.Convolutional neural fabrics (CNF) BID36 BID42 and other forms of random search methods BID2 BID4 BID10 have been investigated as well.Layer-wise to neuron-wise hierarchy.Take the best model discovered by macro search in ENAS BID33 for example.The 12-layer CNN model contains over 21 million parameters and achieves 4.23% test accuracy on Cifar-10.If we remove 75% − 90% parameters in all 3 × 3 and 5 × 5 convolutions, the test accuracy is hardly compromised after the same duration of retraining.Even though the architectures in all the search methods are described as directed graphs, each node in these graphs represents either an operation layer (e.g. convolution or pooling layer) or an operation block (e.g. residual block).None of the nodes stands for an actual individual neuron in the network.On one hand, random search and evolutionary search tend to discover architectures that contain complex branching paths.On the other hand, the pruned versions of such architectures work nearly as well as intact ones.These facts bring about the hypothesis that the hierarchy of neurons should work as well as the hierarchy of layers.Please note that we do not simply replace layers with individual neurons, considering layers are composed of abundant neurons.We need the sufficient number of neurons to meet the feature representation requirements.A good hierarchical architecture of neurons may be discovered by either random search or evolutionary search, or combined.The search process must be carefully designed.In this paper, we propose a three-step course to discover the optimal neuron hierarchy for image classification (see FIG1 , i.e., (1) discover the optimal layer hierarchy with ENAS, (2) prune unimportant neurons in the discovered layer-wise model, and (3) randomly add new neurons to the pruned model to enrich the expressive capacity of neuron hierarchy networks.It is worth pointing out that the three-step procedure is also an imitation of the natural development of human brains (Craik and Bialystok, 2006).For example, the creation and searching by ENAS correspond to the mass neurogenesis before birth.The pruning of unimportant neurons corresponds to the apoptosis before puberty BID11 .The addition of new neurons to the pruned model corresponds to the persisting neurogenesis during adulthood BID30 .Although the existence of neurogenesis in mature brains is being debated in the field of neuroscience BID38 BID3 , the software simulation of such process by our work indicates that it is helpful in improving the learning capability of neural networks.We did not choose fixed or handcrafted architectures as the base model because we believe that experiments conducted on a randomly searched model would be more compelling.There are also pruning-related issues with fixed models, for example, performances of ResNets and DenseNet are extremely sensitive to pruning.The training from scratch on the pruned architecture is crucial, because without it, the model only has a test accuracy of 15.7%.The NHN is not built upon the results by ENAS micro search even though it presents higher test accuracy while requiring fewer parameters than macro search.It is mainly due to the mass employment of depthwise separable convolution BID7 in which kernels are pairs of vectors and cannot be directly pruned.If we replace all the depthwise separable convolutions with normal convolutions, the micro model merely gains accuracy advantage of 0.3% over the macro model.However, it instead contains 67.8M parameters, which is more than 4 times of macro (16.3M).Also, it will consume more than 28GB of memory space to perform the layer-hierarchy search.LDS results FIG2 show that add-on neurons at lower layers work better, which indicates that rich representation of low-level features is crucial to the performance of NHN.When comparing the final test accuracy (96.52%) to the network without any add-on neuron (96.20%), we know that add-on neurons are helpful in increasing the performance of NHN.In fact, perturbation on the add-on genes discovered by LDS almost always leads to degradation of performance, and the total ablation of added neurons in the final model causes accuracy drop of 1.08%, which proves that the search results are optimal.The main goal of this paper is neither to comprehensively discuss the properties of neuron fields BID12 , nor to investigate a training method on an entirely randomly generated neuron graph.We'd like to point out that it is quite possible to directly generate a large number of free neurons with somewhat arbitrary connections and train this \\"random neuron field\\" to address the same task presented in this work.However, because modern GPUs, or to be more precise, the computation softwares that run on these GPUs are mainly designed for dense 4-d tensor calculation.It is hard to efficiently train such random neuron field at present.Therefore, as sophisticated as our approach may seem, it's an efficient method to construct network architectures that highlight the significance of individual neurons and perform competitively against other state-of-the-art methods.Neural networks that are designed by human experts and search algorithms perform outstandingly in image classification.However, redundancy in parameters exists widely in layer-based architectures.We propose a heuristic method to construct neuron-based architectures, namely, neuron hierarchical networks (NHN) , that obviate the redundancy in weights and emphasize the relation between individual neurons.Experiments show that the NHN discovered based on ENAS and by locationdirection search (LDS) outperforms the original ENAS architecture and many other handcrafted and randomly searched models in Cifar-10 classification, while requiring much fewer parameters.Also, the search time of NHN is very efficient compared to several state-of-the-art network architecture search methods, while achieving competitive performance.","answer":"By breaking the layer hierarchy, we propose a 3-step approach to the construction of

The identification and application of druggable pockets of targets play a key role in in silico drug design, which is a fundamental step in structure-based drug design. Herein, some recent progresses and developments of the computational analysis of pockets have been covered. Also, the pockets at the protein-protein interfaces (PPI) have been considered to further explore the pocket space for drug discovery. We have presented two case studies targeting the kinetic pockets generated by normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics method, respectively, in which we focus upon incorporating the pocket flexibility into the two-dimensional virtual screening with both affinity and specificity. We applied the specificity and affinity (SPA) score to quantitatively estimate affinity and evaluate specificity using the intrinsic specificity ratio (ISR) as a quantitative criterion. In one of two cases, we also included some applications of pockets located at the dimer interfaces to emphasize the role of PPI in drug discovery. This review will attempt to summarize the current status of this pocket issue and will present some prospective avenues of further inquiry.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

BACKGROUND: The critical role of the androgen receptor (AR) in the development of prostate cancer is well recognized. The transcriptional activity of AR is partly regulated by coregulatory proteins. It has been suggested that these coregulators could also be important in the progression of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to identify coregulators whose expression is regulated by either the androgens and/or by the expression level of AR. METHODS: We used empty vector and AR cDNA-transfected LNCaP cells (LNCaP-pcDNA3.1, and LNCaP-ARhi, respectively), and grew them for 4 and 24 hours in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at various concentrations. The expression of 25 AR coregulators (SRC1, TIF2, PIAS1, PIASx, ARIP4, BRCA1, beta-catenin, AIB3, AIB1, CBP, STAT1, NCoR1, AES, cyclin D1, p300, ARA24, LSD1, BAG1L, gelsolin, prohibitin, JMJD2C, JMJD1A, MAK, PAK6 and MAGE11) was then measured by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR). RESULTS: Five of the coregulators (AIB1, CBP, MAK, BRCA1 and beta-catenin) showed more than 2-fold induction and 5 others (cyclin D1, gelsolin, prohibitin, JMJD1A, and JMJD2C) less than 2-fold induction. Overexpression of AR did not affect the expression of the coregulators alone. However, overexpression of AR enhanced the DHT-stimulated expression of MAK, BRCA1, AIB1 and CBP and reduced the level of expression of beta-catenin, cyclinD1 and gelsolin. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we identified 5 coactivators whose expression was induced by androgens suggesting that they could potentiate AR signaling. Overexpression of AR seems to sensitize cells for low levels of androgens.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"BRCA1\\", \\"MAGE11\\", \\"CBP\\", \\"androgen receptor\\", \\"beta-catenin\\", \\"gelsolin\\", \\"AR\\", \\"NCoR1\\", \\"JMJD2C\\", \\"SRC1\\", \\"MAK\\", \\"prohibitin\\", \\"ARA24\\", \\"PAK6\\", \\"AIB3\\", \\"cyclin D1\\", \\"TIF2\\", \\"AES\\", \\"JMJD1A\\", \\"STAT1\\", \\"AIB1\\", \\"cyclinD1\\", \\"PIAS1\\", \\"LSD1\\", \\"p300\\", \\"BAG1L\\", \\"PIASx\\", \\"ARIP4\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

(Euphorpiaceae), isolate and identify the active compounds that could be responsible for the activity, in addition to determination of the possible mechanism of action. Six compounds were isolated and identified from this plant: three phenolic compounds (kampferol, kampferol-3-glucoside and kampferol-3-galactoside) in addition to three steroidal compounds (1-ethoxypentacosane, heptacosan-1-ol and β-sitosterol). Three compounds (heptacosan-1-ol, β-sitosterol and kampferol-3-galactoside) were found to be responsible for the anti-UC activity of E. granuleta extract. The anti-UC activity of these compounds may be explained by reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), in addition to reduction of colonic malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. No side effects were reported on liver and kidney functions. The active compounds reduced both serum TNF-α and mucosal MDA levels.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a heterogeneous disorder of genetic or acquired etiologies. In some cases congenital PAP is associated with hereditary surfactant protein (SP)-B deficiency. To date, the molecular defect in the majority of patients with PAP has not been identified. In mice, PAP has been generated by targeted deletion of the genes for either the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain (beta c) or GM-CSF. Here, we describe an expression defect of beta c in three of seven pediatric patients with PAP and in one patient with severe lung disease suspected to be PAP. The patients failed to express normal levels of beta c as shown by flow cytometry. Strikingly reduced or absent function of beta c was demonstrated by ligand binding studies and progenitor clonogenic assays. Analysis of beta c DNA revealed a point mutation from proline to threonine at codon 602 in one patient. Our findings provide evidence that a defect in the expression of a hematopoietic cytokine receptor is associated with human PAP.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"beta c\\", \\"GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain\\", \\"surfactant protein (SP)-B\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

There is a continuous demand for preclinical modeling of the interaction of dendritic cells with the immune system and cancer cells. Recent progress in gene expression profiling with nucleic acid microarrays, in silico modeling and in vivo cell and animal approaches for non-clinical proof of safety and efficacy of these immunotherapies is summarized. Immunoinformatic approaches look promising to unfold this potential, although still unstable and difficult to interpret. Animal models have progressed a great deal in recent years, finally narrowing the gap from bench to bedside. However, translation to the clinic should be done with precaution. The most significant results concerning clinical benefit might come from detailed immunologic investigations made during well designed clinical trials of dendritic-cell-based therapies, which in general prove safe.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

Tan et al., 2017; Blaschke et al., 2018) .Deep models, especially generative adversarial networks (GANs), have significantly improved the state of the art at modeling these complex distributions, thus encouraging further research (Goodfellow et al., 2014) .Whether implicitly or explicitly, works that use GANs make a crucial modeling decision known as the manifold assumption (Zhu et al., 2016; Schlegl et al., 2017; Reed et al., 2016) .This is the assumption that high-dimensional data lies on a single low-dimensional manifold which smoothly varies and where local Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional space correspond to complex transformations in the high-dimensional space.While generally true in many applications, this assumption does not always hold (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018) .For example, recent work has emphasized situations where the data lies not on one single manifold, but on multiple, disconnected manifolds (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018; Gurumurthy et al., 2017; Hoang et al., 2018) .In this case, GANs must attempt to learn a continuous cover of the multiple manifolds, which inevitably leads to the generation of off-manifold points which lie in between (Kelley, 2017) .The generator tries to minimize the number of these off-manifold points, and thus they are generally just a small fraction of the total generated distribution.As such, they barely affect the typical GAN evaluation measures (like Inception and FID scores for images), which measure the quality of the generated distribution as a whole.Thus, this problem is usually ignored, as other aspects are prioritized.However, in some applications, the presence of these bad outliers is more catastrophic than slight imperfections in modeling the most dense regions of the space.For example, consider the goal of an artificial agent acting indistinguishably from a human: the famous Turing Test.Incorrectly modeling sentence density by using a given sentence structure 60% of the time instead of 40% of the time is relatively harmless.However, generating a single gibberish sentence will give away the identity of the artificial agent.Moreover, there are serious concerns about the implications this has for proofs of GAN convergence (Mescheder et al., 2018) .These works address the problem of disconnected manifolds by Figure 1 : The Noise-Prior GAN (NPGAN) architecture.Unlike previous work, the NP network learns a prior over the generators conditioned on the noise distribution z.This allows it to both control the sampling frequency of the generators and shape the input appropriate to each one, in an end-to-end differentiable framework.simultaneously training multiple generators and using established regularizations to coax them into dividing up the space and learning separate manifolds.Methods for getting multiple generators to generate disconnected manifolds can be divided into two categories:(i) imposing information theoretic losses to encourage output from different generators to be distinguishable (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018; Hoang et al., 2018)(ii) changing the initial noise distribution to be disconnected (Gurumurthy et al., 2017) .Our approach falls into the second category.Previous efforts to change the noise distribution to handle disconnectedness has exclusively taken the form of sampling from a mixture of Gaussians rather than the typical single Gaussian (with sampling fixed and uniform over the mixture).Our approach differs significantly from those previously.We use multiple generators as before, but instead of dividing up the noise space into factorized Gaussians and sending one to each generator, we let an additional neural network determine how best to divide up the noise space and dispatch it to each generator.This network learns a prior over the generators, conditioned on the noise space.Thus, we call our additional third network a noise-prior (NP) network.Previous methods have modeled the data with noise z and generatorsWe instead propose a framework to incorporate a richer p(G i |z) into the generator.This framework is entirely differentiable, allowing us to optimize the NP network along with the generators during training.We note that with this strategy, we significantly increase the expressivity of each generator over the previous disconnected manifold models.By dividing up the space into four slices s i and sending s 1 , s 3 to the first generator and s 2 , s 4 to the second generator, we can generate four disconnected manifolds with just two generators.Previous work would have to devote precisely four generators to this task, with degradation in performance if fewer or more generators are chosen for the hyperparameter.Here, the prior network learns to divide the noise space appropriately for whatever number of generators is chosen, and is thus more expressive as well as more robust than previous models.Moreover, much existing work has exclusively framed the problem as, and tailored solutions for, the disconnected manifold problem.Our approach is more generalized, addressing any misspecification between noise distribution and the target distribution.This means that our approach does not become redundant or unnecessary in the case of single complex manifolds, for example.Our contributions can be summarized as:1. We introduce the first multi-generator ensemble to learn a prior over the noise space, using a novel soft, differentiable loss formulation.2. We present a multi-generator method that can learn to sample generators in proportion to the relative density of multiple manifolds.3. We show how our model not only improves performance on disconnected manifolds, but also on complex-but-connected manifolds, which are more likely to arise in real situations.We introduced a novel formulation of multiple-generator models with a prior over the generators, conditioned on the noise input.This results in improved expressivity and flexibility by shaping each generator's input specifically to best perform that generator's task.In this section, we elaborate on the CIFAR experiment from the main text.We use a more complicated architecture here with spectral normalization, self-attention, and ResNet connections, per the best achieving models to-date.We experimented using two, three, four, and five generators in the NPGAN architecture.Figure A .1 shows images generated by the NPGAN with each number of generators.With just two generators, each one creates a wide diversity of images.On the other hand, when increasing the number of generators, each one more homogeneous.For example, in the two generator model, one of them creates dogs, cars, and frogs, while in the five-generator model each generator has specialized to just birds in the sky or just cars.Qualitatively, the noise prior is obviously learning a sensible split of the data across generators and each generator is outputting quality images.However, when comparing the two-generator, threegenerator, four-generator, and five-generator versions of NPGAN to the baseline one-generator of the same model, we do not observe any improvement in FID score.This is unsurprising for the reasons mentioned in the main text.The FID scores treat all points equally across a generated dataset, and thus will be most strongly influenced by where the most points are.A relatively small number of outliers barely register by this metric.Even current state-of-the-art image generation on CIFAR10 is no where close to perfectly modeling the data.When GANs are able to perfectly model the dataset except for trailing outliers between modes, we expect the NPGAN's improvements to be visible in FID scores on this dataset.Until then, the detection of a few bad outliers needs to be done with other evaluation techniques on this dataset.With this caveat, we note that we could achieve an FID score of 26.4 with our NPGAN, compared to 25.8 with our code and one generator, which demonstrates that the NPGAN can scale to stateof-the-art architecture without suffering in quality.The NPGAN is robust to a connected dataset while simultaneously being able to automatically solve the problems of a disconnected dataset.Furthermore, this motivated the creation of our new outlier manifold distance metric, designed to be more sensitive to the creation of outliers than the FID score.Using this metric, we see NPGAN outperform all other models.Relation to Machine Teaching In (Zhu, 2013) , an analogous question is posed: if a teacher network knows the function its student network is supposed to learn, what are the optimal training points to teach it as efficiently as possible?For students following a Bayesian learning approach, this is thought of as finding the best data points D to make the desired model θ * , or minimizing with respect to D: −log(p(θ * |D)) .In our framework, the teacher network NP does not know the function its students should learn ahead-of-time, because this target is changing continually as the discriminator improves simultaneously.Nevertheless, the NP network is still learning to form the optimal curriculum for each individual student such that the collection of students best models the target function given the current parameters of the discriminator.Relation to knowledge distillation Our NP network also has links to the field of knowledge distillation (Kim & Rush, 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Furlanello et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) , where a teacher network is trying to compress or distill the knowledge it has about a particular distribution into one or several (Hinton et al., 2015) smaller models.In the case of multiple smaller models, the teacher can be thought of as a generalist whose job it is to find the right specialist for a specific problem.","answer":"A multi-generator GAN framework with an additional network to learn a prior over the input noise."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Response to imatinib mainly depends from KIT and PDGFRα mutational status. Nevertheless, some patients with a potentially responsive genotype do not respond, and others develop a pattern of resistance to imatinib which is not associated with secondary mutations. This emphasizes the presence of mechanisms of resistance other than the receptor-related genotype, and the need of biological predictors to select the optimal therapeutic strategy, particularly now that other potent inhibitors are available. We investigated a panel of 31 polymorphisms in 11 genes, potentially associated with the pharmacogenetics of imatinib, in a group of 54 unresectable/metastatic GISTs treated with imatinib 400mg daily as first line therapy. Included in this analysis were polymorphisms in the transporters' family SLC22, SLCO, ABC, and in the metabolizing genes CYP-3A4 and -3A5. Time to progression was significantly improved in presence of the C allele in SLC22A4 (OCTN1 rs1050152), and the two minor alleles (G) in SLC22A5 (OCTN2 rs2631367 and rs2631372). Importantly, multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, KIT/PDGFRα mutational status, and tumour size, revealed that all the three genotypes maintained independent predictive significance. In conclusion, in this study we showed that SLC22A4 and SLC22A5 genotypes may be an important predictor of time to progression in GIST patients receiving imatinib therapy. Further investigations are required in an attempt to further personalize GIST therapy.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"tyrosine\\", \\"imatinib\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"OCTN1\\", \\"CYP-3A4 and -3A5\\", \\"PDGFRu03b1\\", \\"SLC22A4\\", \\"SLC22A5\\", \\"tyrosine kinase\\", \\"SLC22\\", \\"KIT\\", \\"SLCO\\", \\"ABC\\", \\"OCTN2\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Influenza also performs fusion through the stem region of the hemagglutinin protein, and the identification of B cells that target this relatively conserved site has spurred research on the development of a universal influenza vaccine ( 14) (15) (16) . Like RSV, HIV, and influenza, the fusion proteins of EBV and CMV exist in a pre-fusion conformation, and stabilization in their pre-fusion states could greatly accelerate vaccine development against these pathogens (17-19). Rare memory B cells producing antibodies specific for the EBV fusion machinery have been isolated; these can neutralize both B cell and epithelial cell infection (20). A new paradigm in malaria vaccine development is also emerging with the discovery of IgM+ and IgD+ memory B cells targeting the Merozoite Surface Protein 1, that rapidly respond to malaria re-infection (21). Further, highly potent neutralizing antibodies targeting a novel and conserved site on the Circumsporozoite Protein have been isolated from B cells (22). Together, these examples demonstrate the importance of studying antigen-specific humoral responses to infectious diseases. The solutions to the crystal structures of surface proteins for a variety of pathogens, the conformational stabilization of these antigens, and the application of the methods summarized in this review, to probe antigen-specific B cell responses, have created new opportunities for systematic and rational vaccine design for HIV, RSV, EBV, malaria, and many other pathogens. The study of B cell responses has not only informed vaccine design but has also advanced our understanding of antibodymediated autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (23, 24). Up to 20% of mature, naïve B cells have receptors with the capacity to bind self-antigens (25). Although these cells are potentially pathogenic, the deletion of B cells with high affinity to self-antigen through apoptosis, anergy of B cells with low affinity to self-antigen, and the absence of T cell help combine together to protect against autoimmune disease in mice (26). The study of autoantigen-specific B cells and a detailed analysis of B cell subsets with pathogenic potential in humans could lead to a better understanding of how to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases. Although the term antigen-specific B cell is used throughout this mini-review to denote the analysis of B cells based on binding between the B cell receptor (BCR) and a specific antigen used as bait, it is important to keep in mind that BCRs within the polyclonal B cell repertoire exhibit a spectrum of polyreactivity. On one end of the spectrum, a highly polyreactive BCR is able to bind multiple structurally unrelated antigens with physiologically relevant affinities. The frequency of polyreactivity in the normal adult human B cell repertoire has been estimated to be 4% of naïve B cells, 23% of IgG+ memory B cells, and 26% of intestinal IgA+ and IgG+ plasmablasts (27-29). On the other end of the spectrum, a mono reactive BCR is activated only when it encounters a single cognate antigen. Although there are exceptions, the accumulation of somatic hypermutations within the variable regions of the BCR during the process of affinity maturation is generally thought to lead to increased affinity and specificity for the cognate antigen (30, 31). Several general techniques are commonly used to identify antigen-specific B cells ( Table 1 ). The B cell enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) technique relies on the principle of capturing the secreted antibody in the vicinity of each cell. In the B cell ELISPOT, antibody secreting B cells (ASCs) present in a sample or differentiated in vitro are added to plates coated with the antigen of interest. Antigen-specific antibodies will bind in close proximity to the location of the individual B cells producing those antibodies. Enzyme or fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies are then used to visualize spots of antibody secretion and binding to plate-bound antigen at the location of the ASCs. Each spot corresponds to antibody produced from a single antigen-specific B cell and therefore the technique is extremely sensitive. Secondary antibodies conjugated to combinatorial colored beads can also be used to detect the antibodies secreted from individual B cells with the advantage of multiplexing the assay (32). One limitation of the assay is its requirement for antibody secretion by B cells thereby limiting the assay to only a subset of B cells in the repertoire, namely ASCs (33). Memory B cells can be stimulated in vitro to differentiate into ASCs prior to addition to the antigen-coated plate (34) . Further, the antigenspecific B cells identified by ELISPOT are generally not available for downstream analysis. Limiting dilution is another technique that has been used to isolate antigen-specific B cells. In this approach, primary cells can be diluted serially until individual B cells are separated in microwell plates (36) . The B cells can then be cultured and expanded ex vivo and/or immortalized using EBV such that each well contains a monoclonal antibody (3, 37, 38) . Antigen-specific B cells can be selected by screening the culture supernatants for monoclonal antibodies that bind an antigen of interest. Although antibodies can be sequenced and cloned, the requirement for an ex vivo culture prior to selection precludes determination of the transcriptional profile of the original B cell in this approach. This technique can potentially be time-consuming and laborious, but the use of microfluidics and robotics has greatly improved the throughput for selecting antigen-specific B cells (39) . Advances in single cell next generation sequencing technology have allowed high throughput transcriptional profiling and sequencing of paired immunoglobulin heavy and light chains (40) . In this approach, antigen specificity can be tested after monoclonal antibodies are cloned and produced using the sequencing data. This method can be useful in identifying antigen-specific B cells that have undergone clonal expansion after vaccination or acute infection (41) . Flow cytometry is the most common method used for single cell analysis and isolation (39) . Flow cytometry-based analysis of antigen-specific B cells is dependent on labeling antigen with a fluorescent tag to allow detection. Fluorochromes can either be attached covalently via chemical conjugation to the antigen, expressed as a recombinant fusion protein, or attached non-covalently by biotinylating the antigen. After biotinylation, fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin is added to generate a labeled tetramer of the antigen. Biotinylation of the antigen at a ratio ≤1 biotin to 1 antigen is important, since each streptavidin has the potential to bind four biotins. If the ratio of biotin to antigen is >1:1, then clumping and precipitation of the antigen out of solution can occur as soon as streptavidin is added. Alternatively, site directed biotinylation can be accomplished by adding either an AviTag or BioEase tag to the recombinant antigen prior to expression (77, 78) . When site-specific biotinylation is utilized, researchers must keep in mind that the tag may occlude an epitope from recognition by B cells which can be problematic for vaccine antigens. Further, for proteins that oligomerize, multiple tags may be incorporated, possibly resulting in aggregation. Another important consideration is the potential for confounding by B cells in the repertoire that bind to the fluorochrome, streptavidin, or any linkers rather than to the antigen of interest. Binding between fluorochromes, linkers, or streptavidin and BCRs from humans and mice never exposed to these antigens are generally of low affinity, and these BCRs are generally expressed by naïve and potentially polyreactive B cells (62, 79, 80) . Dual labeling, in which the same antigen is separately labeled with two different fluorochromes, can be used to identify double positive B cells and remove confounding by B cells that bind the fluorochrome (12, 42) . However, even when tetramers are utilized for dual labeling, streptavidin-specific B cells will contaminate the double positive population. To fully remove confounding from the fluorochrome, streptavidin, and linkers, a \\"decoy\\" tetramer can be used to identify these contaminating B cells (21, 26). In this approach, the same fluorochrome used to identify antigen-specific B cells is conjugated to a different fluorochrome such that the emission spectrum is altered by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (26). Decoy-binding B cells can therefore be excluded from the true antigen-specific B cells. Notably, it is critical to use the same source of fluorochrome conjugated streptavidin in the tetramer and decoy reagent, because conjugation methods, recombinant streptavidin, and protein fluorochromes like R-phycoerythrin vary enough from company to company to alter some of the epitopes available for B cells to bind. One weakness of the flow cytometric approach is the reliance on antigens that can be readily conjugated to a fluorochrome or biotinylated. In addition to recombinant proteins and synthesized peptides, labeled polysaccharides, lipids, haptens, virus-like particles, and pseudo viruses have also been used to identify antigen-specific cells by flow cytometry (33, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . Further, epitope-specific B cells have been identified by screening bacteriophage-displays or microarray peptide libraries with polyclonal antibodies targeting the native antigen to select conformational epitopes that can be fused to fluorescent proteins for use in flow cytometry (47, 60) . With technologic advancements increasing the number of simultaneously measurable parameters, antigen-specific B cells can be further characterized by cell surface markers and intracellular staining. Additionally, the immunoglobulin capture assay is a flow cytometry-based adaptation of the ELISPOT assay in which a streptavidin-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody carrying four biotinylated anti-IgG antibodies is used to simultaneously bind plasmablasts and capture secreted antibody followed by fluorescent-labeled antigen to detect antigenspecific plasmablasts (61) . The mean fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometry and normalized to the level of BCR expression also provides a measure of the relative amount of antigen binding to a B cell and can be used as a rough surrogate for binding affinity (79, 81, 82) . Preincubation of B cells with increasing concentrations of a monomeric antigen prior to labeling with tetrameric antigen can also be used to further quantify binding affinity. Cells expressing high affinity BCRs will bind monomeric antigen at low concentrations, whereas low affinity BCRs will require higher concentrations of monomeric antigen to compete with and inhibit tetramer binding (26). Individual cells can also be isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for downstream analysis, including BCR sequencing and cloning, BCR affinity measurement, in vitro proliferation, and transcriptional profiling. Methods have recently been developed to further improve the sensitivity for detecting rare antigen-specific B cells. Magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting the fluorochrome on the antigen of interest, allow for the enrichment of antigen-specific B cells prior to flow cytometry (20, 26, 80, 83) . This approach is particularly useful for detecting rare antigenspecific naïve B cells, autoreactive B cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts (21, 26, 47, 50) . The magnetic enrichment strategy allows for the analysis of significantly more cells in a shorter period of time by concentrating the cells of interest prior to flow cytometry (Figure 1) . Notably, as with any method that seeks to identify a population of cells at a very low frequency, the background and noise inherent in the detection system is magnified with respect to the signal of interest, especially when that signal is weak. Therefore, to detect the antigen-specific population of interest, the following considerations are critical: (1) Using decoys to exclude B cells of unwanted specificities;(2) careful design of flow cytometry panels to avoid emission spillover into the channel for the antigen of interest; and (3) choosing the brightest fluorochromes, like R-phycoerythrin or allophycocyanin. In vivo methods to probe antigen-specific B cell responses in the presence of other antigen-presenting cells and T cell helpers, have increased our mechanistic understanding of the humoral immune response during vaccination, infection, and autoimmunity. Adoptively transferred B cells can be distinguished from recipient lymphocytes by taking advantage of mouse strains with allelic variations in CD45 or mice devoid of B cells. The adoptively transferred B cells can come from wildtype mice or from mice expressing transgenic BCRs ( Table 2) , and antigen-specific B cells can be analyzed using the techniques described above. Microscopy is another general technique that has been used to identify antigen-specific cells in vivo and offers the advantage of direct visualization. In the first reported application of this technique to demonstrate the cellular origin of antibodies in 1955, fluorescein-conjugated antibodies against ovalbumin and human immunoglobulin were used to stain tissue sections of the spleen from hyperimmune rabbits (2) . Since then, other groups have fluorescently labeled antigens to localize antigen-specific B cells by microscopy (62, 65) . Advances in laser capture dissection microscopy, already used in the T cell field, also provide an opportunity for isolating individual antigen-specific B cells for downstream analysis, including sequencing and cloning of the BCR or transcriptional profiling (66) . However, antigen staining of BCRs in situ can be challenging depending on the binding of antigens from pathogens to other cellular receptors or an alteration of BCR specificity during tissue fixation or processing. Two-photon or multiphoton microscopy has the ability to resolve images at greater depths and with less photobleaching than confocal microscopy (67, 68) . As a result, this technology has allowed real-time imaging in living, intact lymphoid tissues of mice, permitting the direct in vivo observation of immune cell interactions. The dynamic movements and interactions of antigen-specific B cells can be studied in vivo by combining an adoptive transfer of individual B cells (isolated by limiting dilution or FACS) with two-photon microscopy (63, 69, 70) .Question: How are the studies on B-cells helping the development of a universal influenza vaccine?","answer":"Influenza also performs fusion through the stem region of the hemagglutinin protein, and the identification of B cells that target this relatively conserved site has spurred research on the development of a universal influenza vaccine ("},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

requisites for an ac iol 's implantation are the presence of an anatomically normal anterior chamber and accurate sizing of its horizontal diameter .inspite of this apple et al . postulated that subclinical uveitis secondary to lens -

like pupil and iris chaffing , with uveitis and/or pigment dispersion and secondary complications such as chronic inflammation and secondary glaucoma .iol 's are associated with visually significant complications due to late subluxation , complications related to sutures and secondary iol implantation . in a histologic study , iol stability was the result of intact scleral sutures and not to fibrous encapsulation or correct placement of the haptic in the ciliary sulcus . as a result ,iol dislocation is likely to occur if sutures are inadvertently removed or if suture fatigue occurs .two - point suture fixation carries a higher risk of axial iol tilt , and 3 or 4 point fixation heightens the risk for complications resulting from increased intraocular manipulations .glue assisted intrascleral fixation differs from other sutureless techniques in a way that two partial scleral thickness flaps are made 180 degrees apart and the scleral pockets are made at the edge of the flap base , parallel to the sclerotomy wound .the haptics are tucked in the scleral pockets and the flaps are then adhered to the base with the help of tissue fibrin glue .the glue also helps in sealing the sclerotomy site which would otherwise act as a filtration site and cause hypotony .this technique has an advantage in that it can be performed in the presence of significant structural abnormalities of the anterior chamber and that it mitigates many of the adverse outcomes associated with ac iol 's , iris fixated iol 's and sutured scleral fixated iol 's .the table 1 below helps compare the three techniques , which can be implemented for the iol fixation in the posterior chamber following a posterior capsular rupture .comparison of varied techniques of iol fixation in posterior chamber after pc rupture in this technique , a standard three - piece intraocular lens with a haptic design fitting to the diameter of ciliary sulcus is implanted .the haptic is placed in its normal curved configuration without traction , there is no distortion or change in the shape of the ioloptic .externalization of the greater part of the haptic along its curvature stabilizes the axial positioning of the iol and thereby prevents iol tilt .the use of scleral tunnel fixation of the haptic is less technically demanding because it stabilizes the intraocular lens in the posterior chamber without difficult suturing procedures . placing the iol haptic beneath the flapprevents further movement of the haptic , reducing the pseudophacodonesis that leads to constant motion in the vitreous and , ultimately , to retinal damage .the ends of the haptic are left in the tunnel to prevent foreign body sensation and erosion of the conjunctiva and to reduce the risk of inflammation .post -

Most commonly, these pathogens utilize specialized secretion systems to inject substrates( also called effector proteins) that function as toxins within host cells. Since it would be detrimental for an intracellular pathogen to immediately kill its host cell, it is essential that secreted toxins be inactivated or degraded after they have served their purpose. The pathogen Legionella pneumophila represents an ideal system to study interactions between toxins as it survives within host cells for approximately a day and its Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system( T4SS) injects a vast number of toxins. Previously we reported that the Dot/Icm substrates SidE, SdeA, SdeB, and SdeC( known as the SidE family of effectors) are secreted into host cells, where they localize to the cytoplasmic face of the Legionella containing vacuole( LCV) in the early stages of infection. SidJ, another effector that is unrelated to the SidE family, is also encoded in the sdeC-sdeA locus. Interestingly, while over-expression of SidE family proteins in a wild type Legionella strain has no effect, we found that their over-expression in a ∆sidJ mutant completely inhibits intracellular growth of the strain. In addition, we found expression of SidE proteins is toxic in both yeast and mammalian HEK293 cells, but this toxicity can be suppressed by co-expression of SidJ, suggesting that SidJ may modulate the function of SidE family proteins. Finally, we were able to demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro that SidJ acts on SidE proteins to mediate their disappearance from the LCV, thereby preventing lethal intoxication of host cells. Based on these findings, we propose that SidJ acts as a metaeffector to control the activity of other Legionella effectors.Introduction:Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that can replicate within fresh water amoeba and mammalian alveolar macrophages[1–3]. L. pneumophila survives and replicates within host cells by inhibiting the host endocytic pathway and creating a novel replicative compartment designated as the Legionella containing vacuole( LCV)[4–7]. Alteration of host function is mediated by the injection of a large number of proteins into the host cell by the L. pneumophila Dot/Icm type IV secretion system( T4SS)[8–12]. However, inactivation of individual( or even combinations of) Dot/Icm substrates in genetically engineered mutant strains rarely has a strong effect on the intracellular growth of L. pneumophila, consistent with extensive functional redundancy between effectors[13–15]. One notable exception to this generalization is the L. pneumophila SuperΔP170 mutant, which exhibited a substantial growth defect in the amoebae Acanthamoeba castellanii[16]. The SuperΔP170 was constructed while studying a locus that encodes multiple Dot/Icm substrates[16] and consists of two deletions: the first removes five adjacent genes( sdeC, lpg2154, sidJ, sdeB, and sdeA) and the second deletes the unlinked gene sidE. Four of the encoded proteins, SidE, SdeC, SdeB and SdeA, share extensive homology with each other and are all ∼170 kDa in size, thus they have been referred to as “P170s”[16]. In addition, they are called the “SidE family”, as SidE was the founding member of this related group of proteins[17]. The SidE proteins are Dot/Icm substrates that are translocated into the host cell and reside on the cytoplasmic face of the LCV( Legionella containing vacuole)[16], although their molecular function is not known. As the intracellular growth defect of the SuperΔP170 mutant could be complemented by expression of just one SidE family protein, SdeA, it was proposed that the SidE-like proteins were functionally redundant and the other two genes, lpg2154 and sidJ, must be dispensable for growth within host cells[16]. However, subsequently it was shown that inactivation of sidJ alone conferred an intracellular growth defect on L. pneumophila[18], suggesting the situation is more complicated than initially perceived. Consistent with this observation is the increasingly appreciated paradigm in pathogenesis that secreted effectors are often subjected to spatiotemporal regulation and that there can be a complex interplay between the functions of different effectors. For example, the Salmonella T3SS substrates SopE and SptP, which possess opposing biochemical activities, act at different stage of infection to first induce bacterial uptake and then to down-modulate this effect in order to prevent host cell death[19]. Similarly, the Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm T4SS effectors SidM/DrrA and LepB exhibit opposing functions. SidM/DrrA recruits and activates Rab1 to mediate fusion of ER microsomes with the LCV( Legionella containing vacuole). At later points, LepB inactivates Rab1 resulting in the removal of the GTPase from the LCV[20–22]. A third example is represented by the L. pneumophila effectors SidH and LubX. SidH is a homolog of the effector SdhA, which is required to maintain the integrity of the LCV[23, 24]. LubX is a member of the U-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and functions as a metaeffector to inactivate SidH by promoting its proteolysis[25]. Due to their genetic proximity, the surprising phenotype of the ΔsidJ mutant, and the existing precedents of complex interplay between other L. pneumophila secreted substrates, we hypothesized that there may be a connection between the SidE proteins and SidJ. To test this hypothesis, we examined the phenotypes of a strain lacking just the four SidE proteins( ΔsdeC ΔsdeB ΔsdeA ΔsidE) and of an individual ΔsidJ mutant and discovered that overexpression of an individual SidE family protein in the absence of SidJ is toxic to host cells. This result, and the experiments that followed, have led to a model wherein SidJ functions as a metaeffector to regulate the activity of the SidE family of toxins.Discussion:The pathogen L. pneumophila serves as an excellent model system to study the interactions between secreted effector proteins, as it exports between 200–300 substrates via its Dot/Icm T4SS[32]. In this study, we examined the relationship between the L. pneumophila Dot/Icm substrates SidJ and the SidE family. Six lines of evidence support a functional connection between these proteins. First, SidJ and SdeC, SdeB, and SdeA are all expressed from the same locus( Fig. 1). Second, the SuperΔP170 mutant, the CleanΔP170 mutant, and the ΔsidJ mutant each have a similar growth defect within host cells( Figs. 1 and S2). Third, expression of low levels of SdeA was able to complement/suppress the intracellular growth defect of the SuperΔP170 mutant, which lacks both the sidE family genes and sidJ( Fig. 1). Fourth, overexpression of SdeA was detrimental for the growth of only strains lacking sidJ( Fig. 1). Fifth, SdeA toxicity to yeast and mammalian host cells could be suppressed by co-expression of SidJ( Fig. 2). Sixth, SidJ is able to promote the disappearance of SidE proteins from the LCV at later points of infection( Fig. 3) and this could be reproduced in an in vitro assay using purified SidJ( Fig. 6). Based on these results, we propose that the L. pneumophila SidJ protein functions as a metaeffector to regulate the activity of the SidE protein family. The concept that intracellular pathogens must regulate the activity of their secreted effectors during an infection is not surprising, as unregulated toxin activity would lead to the premature demise of the host cell. One method of regulation might entail the spatiotemporal delivery and/or control of substrates with opposing activities. For example, Salmonella’s SopE and SptP toxins act antagonistically to activate and inactivate Rho-family GTPases CDC42 and Rac1 at different times of infection via a combination of differential activity and temporal stability[19]. Likewise L. pneumophila regulates the activity of Rab1 by using a GEF( SidM/DrrA) and a GAP( LepB)[20–22]. In addition to this general mode of GTPase regulation, L. pneumophila is able to stabilize Rab1 in an active form using ampylation by the effector SidM/DrrA and then reverse the effect via de-ampylation by SidD[33–36]. Legionella also employs two additional effectors with opposing activities, AnkX and Lem3/Lpg0696, to inactivate and then release a separate population of Rab1-GDP via cholination[33–36]. An even more elegant form of effector regulation was recently described, wherein the effector SidH was inactivated by LubX, a L. pneumophila secreted E3 ubiquitin ligase that marks SidH for proteasome-dependent proteolysis by polyubiquitination[25]. The key to effector regulation in this case was the differential translocation of LubX and SidH into host cells, with SidH being rapidly secreted followed by the slower intracellular accumulation of LubX. Based on these results, LubX was described as being a “metaeffector”, which was defined as an effector that regulates another effector protein[25]. Reminiscent of the differential regulation and secretion described for SidH and LubX, the expression of SidE proteins is induced in early stationary phase allowing export to occur immediately upon host cell infection[16]. In contrast, SidJ is expressed constitutively[18] and accumulates within the host cell at later time points of infection( Fig. 4). The gradual accumulation of intracellular SidJ during infection correlates with the decreased level of the SidE proteins on the LCV. These observations prompted us to propose a model whereby SidJ functions as a metaeffector to modulate the activity of the SidE proteins( Fig. 7). In this model, SidE proteins are translocated into the host cells by the L. pneumophila Dot/Icm T4SS at early points of infection and localize on the cytoplasmic face of the immature LCV. Although the precise molecular function of the SidE proteins is not yet known, their early delivery into the host cell suggests they are involved in avoidance of the endocytic pathway and/or maturation of the LCV. As the infection proceeds, the SidJ protein begins to accumulate in the host cell, eventually reaching a critical threshold when it is competent to mediate the removal of the SidE proteins from the LCV( Fig. 7). Based on the inhibition by MG132, the simplest possibility is that SidJ directly targets SidE proteins for degradation by the proteasome( Fig. 7, top row). Alternatively, it is possible that SidJ mediates the degradation of another component that normally retains SidE proteins on the LCV surface. In the absence of this factor, the SidE proteins would no longer associate with the LCV and thus could redistribute and potentially associate with host organelles( Fig. 7, middle row). In the absence of SidJ, SidE proteins appear to localize normally to the LCV at early time points of infection( Fig. 7, bottom row). However, as the infection proceeds, the SidE proteins are no longer removed from the LCV, they accumulate to high levels, eventually inhibiting the growth of L. pneumophila. Overproduction of SdeA in the absence of SidJ was toxic to both yeast cells and HEK293 cells and inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila due to delivery of the LCV to the lysosome. The disruption of the Golgi in mCherry-SdeA transfected cells suggests that the target of SdeA is likely to be a component of the secretory pathway. The failure to eliminate SidE proteins from the LCV in a ΔsidJ mutant does not appear to be due to an indirect effect of the LCV not maturing as we can induce removal of SidE proteins from 4-hour LCVs in vitro by the addition of wild type SidJ. Rather we prefer the idea that SidJ directly mediates removal of SidE proteins from the LCV, perhaps by some form of post-translational modification. Although we have been unable to reproducibly demonstrate a robust interaction between SidJ and SdeA, it is reasonable that the proteins interact based on the SidJ suppression of SdeA-mediated toxicity in yeast and HEK293 cells. It is also possible that SidJ, which is a large protein of ∼90 kDa, possesses multiple biochemical activities, particularly since a partial ER recruitment defect has been reported for a ΔsidJ mutant[18]. In summary, the Dot/Icm substrate SidJ functions as a metaeffector to regulate the activity of the SidE substrates. Similar to the metaeffector LubX, SidJ promotes the removal of Dot/Icm T4SS effectors from the LCV in a proteasome-dependent manner. The presence of dual effectors with opposing activities, and the existence of metaeffectors that modulate the activity of other effectors, may partially explain why L. pneumophila translocates such a vast repertoire of T4SS substrates into host cells. Moreover, the discovery of a second metaeffector in L. pneumophila suggests that the concept of metaeffectors is not unique to LubX and additional pathogens may use similar strategies to highjack host cells.","answer":"A key attribute of many pathogens is their ability to survive and replicate within eukaryotic host cells .

Minor allele frequency( MAF) filtering approach and functional prediction methods are commonly used to identify candidate pathogenic mutations in these studies. Combining multiple functional prediction methods may increase accuracy in prediction. Here, we propose to use a logit model to combine multiple prediction methods and compute an unbiased probability of a rare variant being pathogenic. Also, for the first time we assess the predictive power of seven prediction methods( including SIFT, PolyPhen2, CONDEL, and logit) in predicting pathogenic nsSNVs from other rare variants, which reflects the situation after MAF filtering is done in exome-sequencing studies. We found that a logit model combining all or some original prediction methods outperforms other methods examined, but is unable to discriminate between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive disease mutations. Finally, based on the predictions of the logit model, we estimate that an individual has around 5% of rare nsSNVs that are pathogenic and carries ∼22 pathogenic derived alleles at least, which if made homozygous by consanguineous marriages may lead to recessive diseases.Introduction:Since the first successful application of exome sequencing in finding the causal mutation for a Mendelian disease[1], many such studies have been conducted to identify other Mendelian disease-causing( or pathogenic) variants. Compared to genetic linkage studies of Mendelian diseases, exome sequencing requires a smaller number of affected individuals, who may even be unrelated. With decreasing sequencing costs, exome sequencing is becoming a standard tool for mapping causal genes for human Mendelian diseases. The most common cause of Mendelian disease is a non-synonymous single-nucleotide variant( nsSNV) that results in a single amino acid change in the encoded protein[2]. With the large number( typically around 8, 000–10, 000) of nsSNVs in an individual genome and the small number of( usually affected and unrelated) individuals available, standard methods for genetic linkage and association do not work for exome sequencing studies of Mendelian diseases. In order to narrow down the list of candidate nsSNVs, most exome sequencing studies rely on a hard-filtering approach, in which the causal mutation is assumed to be rare( with minor allele frequency( MAF) ≤1%) and so polymorphisms( with MAF>1%) found in public databases( e. g., dbSNP and 1000 Genomes Project) as well as in-house control datasets are discarded[3]. Moreover, variants are rejected if they are not found in multiple cases or if they conflicts with the known disease inheritance mode. This approach has successfully reduced the number of mutations to look at in numerous studies, and several tools[3]–[5] are therefore developed to automate this process. However, hard-filtering in exome sequencing of Mendelian diseases still leaves a large number( typically ∼100 to 1, 000) of candidate nsSNVs. A method must, therefore, be used to predict which of the remaining ones have serious functional consequences and prioritize them for validation. For a comprehensive review of these methods, see Ng and Henikoff[6]. These different methods have their complementary strengths and combining multiple methods has been suggested to increase prediction accuracy[3],[6]. Recently a combined predictive model( known as CONDEL[7]) has been developed. CONDEL is based on a Weighted Average of the normalized Scores( WAS)[7] for combining scores from different algorithms and is available in Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor. Another combined model( known as CAROL) is based on a weighted Z method of each individual score[8]. As hard filtering is usually done before prediction methods are applied in exome sequencing studies of Mendelian diseases[1],[3], it is important for prediction methods to distinguish pathogenic nsSNVs from other rare variants. However, a number of individual methods( including PolyPhen2[9]) and both CONDEL and CAROL only use common variants as negative controls for assessing their predictive performance and determining their optimal cut-offs for variant classification. Since rare and common variants in the human genome have clearly distinct properties[10], we argue that such benchmarking may not be appropriate to exome sequencing studies. In this paper, we first proposed the use of a logit model to combine prediction scores from multiple methods and tailored it to compute an unbiased estimate of the probability of a rare nsSNV being pathogenic. Then, we assessed the performance of five popular prediction methods( HumVar-trained PolyPhen2, SIFT[11], LRT[12], MutationTaster[13], PhyloP[14]) and two combined models( CONDEL and logit) in distinguishing pathogenic nsSNVs from other rare variants. As a comparison, we also examined the predictive powers of these methods in discriminating between pathogenic and common nsSNVs using HumVar[9] as a benchmark dataset. In addition, we saw if these prediction methods could discriminate between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive disease mutations. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of pathogenic rare variants and total load of pathogenic derived alleles an individual carries using high coverage exome sequencing data from the HapMap project. Finally, we applied the logit prediction model to three in-house exome sequencing subjects to demonstrate its performance in real data. For clarity, throughout this paper, being deleterious means that an nsSNV is under purifying selection; being damaging means that an nsSNV leads to a loss of protein function; and being pathogenic means that an nsSNV has an effect on a Mendelian disease phenotype.Discussion:In this paper, we propose to use a logit model to combine multiple prediction methods to increase the performance in predicting pathogenic nsSNVs and to compute an unbiased( posterior) probability of an nsSNV being pathogenic in exome sequencing after hard-filtering. Also, we examine the predictive power of five popular prediction methods( PolyPhen2, SIFT, LRT, MutationTaster, PhyloP) and two combined models( CONDEL and logit) in discriminating between pathogenic nsSNVs and other rare nsSNVs( which is strictly relevant to exome sequencing studies). Contrary to our intuition, we found that the combined approach CONDEL is not necessarily better than individual methods, as demonstrated by its lower ROC AUC compared to that of MutationTaster. However, the logit model using multiple individual methods consistently outperforms other methods examined and the model combining SIFT and MutationTaster has comparable or even slightly better performance than that combining all of the five individual methods. Unfortunately, no method is able to discriminate between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive disease mutations. Finally, based on the predictions of the logit model, we estimate that an individual has around 5% of rare nsSNVs being pathogenic and carries at least ∼22 pathogenic derived alleles, which if made homozygous by consanguineous marriages may lead to recessive diseases. We found that prediction methods are less powerful in predicting pathogenic variants from other rare variants than from common variants. This is consistent with the fact that most rare alleles( no matter whether they are pathogenic or not) of nsSNVs are subject to strong purifying selection and therefore have similar structural and functional properties, whereas common nsSNVs( in which the minor alleles are also found at high frequency in populations) are subject to weak purifying selection and so have nearly different properties compared to rare nsSNVs. Thus, as expected, it is more difficult to separate pathogenic mutations from other rare nsSNVs than from common nsSNVs using prediction methods. There is a significant difference in PhyloP conservation scores between dominant and recessive disease mutations. This may be because dominant disease genes are more conserved than recessive disease genes which can be “hidden” from purifying selection while heterozygous[21]. However, none of the prediction methods we examined, which mainly use the genomic features at variant level, are able to distinguish autosomal dominant mutations from autosomal recessive disease-causing mutations. Presumably, the genomic features at gene level may help distinguish them. Some studies have analyzed the difference in functional classification of the two classes of disease mutations and found that mutations in genes coding for enzymes and transporters are most likely to cause recessive diseases, whereas mutations in transcription regulators, structural molecules, nucleic acid binding genes and signal transducers have a higher chance to cause dominant diseases[22],[23]. Also, genes involved in recessive diseases have less conserved paralogs than dominant disease genes[21],[23], as recessive diseases are often caused by loss-of-function mutations[22],[24]( which create a defective protein product with little or no biologic activity, and/or interfere with the normal expression of the gene). If a close paralog of a recessive disease gene is present, the paralog is likely to compensate for the loss of function due to a mutated recessive disease gene and so the disease is not observed[25]. On the contrary, dominant diseases are usually caused by gain-of-function mutations( which confer a new activity on the gene product, or lead to its inappropriate spatial and temporal expression) and so the presence of wild-type proteins encoded by functionally similar paralogs may not suppress the new functions acquired by the mutant proteins[23]. We found that the correlations among the scores from several complementary prediction methods are mostly weak to moderate( see Figure S1). This can occur for two possible reasons. First, the set of species used by one method for measuring conservation may be significantly different from those used by another, and thus this may lead to a big difference between the prediction scores calculated by the different methods for the same site. Second, the set of perfectly conserved sites used for training by one method may also be different from the ones used by others due to the variation in sequence alignments adopted by each method. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, MutationTaster uses the largest amount of resources for training and this may explain its excellent predictive performance among the five individual methods examined. But some redundancy among prediction scores from multiple methods also explains why combining a subset of the five individual methods( i. e., PolyPhen2, SIFT, and MutationTaster) has similar predictive performance to combine all five individual methods in a logit model. We note that our estimates of the number of pathogenic alleles per individual from the human genome data are higher than those from the data on consanguineous marriages( which suggest a much smaller number, usually less than 10[26]–[30]). But comparison of our estimates with those from inbreeding studies is difficult since we use totally different method and data. A similar situation has also occurred in quantifying the number of lethal equivalents per individual, in which inbreeding studies suggest that each individual carries 2-6 lethal equivalents[31],[32] whereas Kondrashov[33] found the number could be as high as 100. Anyway, estimation from inbreeding studies typically relies on an implicit assumption that all recessive alleles are completely penetrant and expressive, but examples that violate this assumption have recently been found. For example, the presence of a dominant modifier DFNM1 leads to normal hearing in an individual homozygous for the DFNB26 mutation[34]; high expression of actin-binding protein plastin 3( PLS3) protects individuals carrying homozygous SMN1 deletions from developing spinal muscular atrophy( SMA)[35]; and among the two siblings affected by autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease( ARPCKD), one died at 18 hr but the other still had no symptom when presented at 16[36]. So the numbers from inbreeding studies are likely to be an underestimate. However, mapping errors may also inflate our estimates. For example, it was found that sequencing variants in the inactive gene copy of CDC27 gene( i. e., pseudogene) were wrongly mapped to the active gene copy of CDC27[37] and we observed that the active gene copy of CDC27 had as many as 11 nsSNVs at 2 out of 8 HapMap subjects examined. It is likely that some of these nsSNVs actually came from CDC27 pseudogene( s) and that can therefore inflate our estimates. But missing scores at sequencing variants could, on the other hand, deflate our estimates. Around 13–17% of rare nsSNVs in an individual have missing scores at SIFT and/or MutationTaster and so pathogenic alleles in these variants cannot be counted. We also observed a marked variability in our estimates of the number of pathogenic alleles per individual. The statistical fluctuation of specificity is the major reason for the large variability. As shown in Table 2, a standard error of 1. 3% in specificity can already lead to a standard error of 1. 9% in the estimated proportion of pathogenic rare variants and finally results in a standard error of ∼10–15 in the estimated total load of pathogenic rare variants. We showed that, after MAF filtering, the prior( i. e., the proportion of variants left being pathogenic) is low( which is around 5% and leads to a posterior probability of ∼20% at most) and so it is still difficult for prediction methods to pinpoint the pathogenic mutation( s) in exome sequencing studies of Mendelian diseases. One way to increase the prior is to use additional information, including genomic regions shared by multiple affected family members and known biological pathways, to reduce the number of candidate pathogenic variants and therefore we have implemented these functions in KGGSeq. We also found that even low prediction scores can lead to a posterior that can help exclude non-pathogenic variants. Using the exome sequencing data of three patients with Mendelian diseases, we observed that a logit model could exclude more than 55% of rare nsSNVs. Moreover, these posterior probabilities can be used as weights of the nsSNVs for other analyses.","answer":"Sequencing the coding regions of the human genome is becoming a standard approach in identifying causal genes for human Mendelian diseases .

These helminths are highly adapted to their mammalian host, following a developmental program through successive niches, while effectively down-modulating host immune responsiveness. Larvae of Heligmosomoides polygyrus, for example, encyst in the intestinal submucosa, before emerging as adult worms into the duodenal lumen. Adults release immunomodulatory excretory-secretory( ES) products, but mice immunised with adult H. polygyrus ES become fully immune to challenge infection. ES products of the intestinal wall 4th stage( L4) larvae are similarly important in host-parasite interactions, as they readily generate sterile immunity against infection, while released material from the egg stage is ineffective. Proteomic analyses of L4 ES identifies protective antigen targets as well as potential tissue-phase immunomodulatory molecules, using as comparators the adult ES proteome and a profile of H. polygyrus egg-released material. While 135 proteins are shared between L4 and adult ES, 72 are L4 ES-specific; L4-specific proteins correspond to those whose transcription is restricted to larval stages, while shared proteins are generally transcribed by all life cycle forms. Two protein families are more heavily represented in the L4 secretome, the Sushi domain, associated with complement regulation, and the ShK/SXC domain related to a toxin interfering with T cell signalling. Both adult and L4 ES contain extensive but distinct arrays of Venom allergen/Ancylostoma secreted protein-Like( VAL) members, with acetylcholinesterases( ACEs) and apyrase APY-3 particularly abundant in L4 ES. Serum antibodies from mice vaccinated with L4 and adult ES react strongly to the VAL-1 protein and to ACE-1, indicating that these two antigens represent major vaccine targets for this intestinal nematode. We have thus defined an extensive and novel repertoire of H. polygyrus proteins closely implicated in immune modulation and protective immunity.Introduction:Gastro-intestinal nematode parasites are among the most prevalent pathogens in the world, afflicting over 1 billion people[1] and causing widespread disease in livestock[2]. Control through drug therapy is compromised by rapid reinfection[3], reflecting the lack of protective immunity generated during natural exposure. Helminth infection is also associated with a wide suite of immunological down-modulatory effects[4], which have evolved to promote parasite survival. Although it is possible to vaccinate animals against helminthiases, few protective antigens have been defined and immunity reduces rather than eliminates worm loads[1],[5]. Heligmosomoides polygyrus is an ideal model species to study host-parasite interactions in gastro-intestinal helminth infection[6]–[8]. The parasite follows an entirely intestinal course of infection, entering orally, developing through larval stages before establishing as long-lived adults in the lumen of the small intestine, releasing eggs that are transmitted through feces for onward transmission. Infected mice show multiple immuno-modulatory changes including expansion of regulatory T cells[9]–[12], B cells[13] and dendritic cells[14]–[16]. The immunoregulatory environment engendered by H. polygyrus extends to dampening bystander immune responses to allergens, autoantigens and intestinal antigens[4],[17],[18]. A critical point in infection is during the first 8–10 days, when incoming larvae invade the intestinal tissue and become encysted in the submucosa adjacent to the serosal membrane. Depending on the genetic background of the murine host, a localised immune reaction can envelop the larva, forming a macrophage-rich granuloma. In primary infection however, parasites can escape these inflammatory foci and successfully migrate to the lumen to continue their life cycle[19]. How parasites evade immune attack in the tissues has yet to be determined, but it is known that systemic immune suppression is associated not only with the long-lived adult stage but also the larval stage in the intestinal wall[20]. Moreover, mice given curative anthelminthic treatment prior to adult maturation[21], or heavily irradiated infective larvae[22] develop protective immunity to challenge infection. Hence, as well as being a source of protective antigens, immature tissue-dwelling parasites actively contribute to immunological down-regulation, and we hypothesise that in the non-immune setting they are able to deflect or disable immune mechanisms within the gut tissue. The ability of parasites to modulate immunity is likely to be dependent on the molecular components secreted into their mammalian host, reproduced by the “excretory-secretory”( ES) products collected from parasites maintained in vitro[23]. Global proteomic analyses of the parasite “secretome” are proving to be important and illuminating steps towards defining the host-parasite interaction at the molecular level[24]. Thus, the secretome of adult H. polygyrus has been found to contain more than 300 proteins, including many enzymes and homologues of host immune system genes, as well as novel proteins whose precise function has yet to be defined[25],[26]. Parasite ES products have also proven to be effective vaccines in many settings[1],[5], not least in the case of H. polygyrus in which adult HES immunization elicits sterilizing immunity in mice[27]. An attractive hypothesis for this protective effect is that vaccination generates neutralising antibodies that counter the immunomodulatory molecules secreted from the host. If such vaccines can also be directed against the immature stage of helminths, such as the tissue-phase larvae of H. polygyrus, then parasites may be eliminated before egg production and transmission can be attained. We have therefore studied the released products of H. polygyrus tissue phase larvae, both to identify individual protein components, and to test their ability to induce immunity through vaccination. As detailed below, this investigation identifies a shift in secreted protein composition between the tissue and luminal phases, with expansion and contraction of different gene sets, in particular in the representation of the major multi-gene protein families associated with nematode infection. Most importantly, the larval secretions are fully immunogenic, induce complete sterilising immunity, and have allowed us to identify key candidate protein antigens that may form the basis of a subunit vaccine for protective immunity.Discussion:The larval and adult stages of parasitic nematodes often colonise different physiological niches. Distinct immune pressures exerted in each environment will likely be reflected in the preferential expression of key genes and protein families capable of modulating host immunity. In this regard, the tissue-phase ES material of the intestinal nematode H. polygyrus was characterised by increased expression of proteins associated with the regulation of complement( sushi-like) and T cell activation( SXC-like), as well novel proteins of unknown function( e. g. NSP-3 family). However, other proteins are common to both L4 ES and HES, and it is two of these( VAL-1 and ACE-1) that are major antigenic targets in mice rendered fully immune to challenge infection by vaccination with either of these preparations. We originally hypothesised that protective immunity induced by ES immunisation would function by neutralising parasite immunomodulatory molecules. Although no common mechanistic function has yet been attributed to VAL proteins or the CAP superfamily, it is notable that they are most prominent at interfaces between organisms( virally-infected plants, insect venoms, helminth parasite secretions and the mammalian male gamete) and in some instances are associated with immunological down-modulation[53],[54]. Alternatively, immunisation may inhibit proteins( such as ACE-1) with key but uncharacterised roles in parasite metabolism, migration, and coordination. It is also possible that vaccine-elicited antibodies protect through their Fc domains by recruiting innate immune cells to kill the invading larvae, hypotheses we are currently testing. Potential immunomodulatory roles can also be ascribed to the Sushi and SXC-like proteins. Homologs of sushi proteins from vaccinia viruses are able to inhibit both the classical and alternative pathways of complement[55], whereas a SXC protein homolog from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus was shown to block mammalian potassium channels, and hence was named ShK[56]. ShK proteins and related sequences can inhibit calcium-dependent lymphocyte activation[57], suggesting a direct immunomodulatory role for ShK homologues from nematode parasites. Helminth pathogens regulate their physiological and immunological environment through a spectrum of released products that are being characterised by new high throughput technologies. Our study on the mouse model H. polygyrus directly complements many datasets with major human pathogens such as Brugia malayi[58]–[62] and the hookworm species[63],[64], as well as economically important trichostrongylid nematodes[65]–[67]. Each of these parasites has evolved specialised strategies adapted to particular host species, and niches within those species, that will be mirrored in the repertoire of secreted products, and our study provides many examples of protein families which are differentially expressed, expanded or regulated during the course of a parasite life cycle. Importantly, in view of the lack of anti-helminth vaccines for human use, we have also tested ES products from larval and adult stages for their ability to induce sterilising immunity and in combination with the proteomic database, have now identified potential vaccine antigens for future appraisal. Taken together, these analyses have defined an extensive and novel repertoire of protein candidates from H. polygyrus that can be taken forward for functional and immunological testing in a tractable and naturally adapted host-parasite model system.","answer":"Intestinal helminth parasites are highly prevalent in humans and animals , and survive for long periods by deviating the host immune system .

For the online meta-learning setting, we proposed the FTML algorithm and showed that it enjoys logarithmic regret.We then illustrated how FTML can be adapted to a practical algorithm.Our experimental evaluations demonstrated that the proposed practical variant outperforms prior methods.","answer":"We introduce the online meta learning problem setting to better capture the spirit and practice of continual lifelong learning."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

HIV-positive index cases diagnosed in antenatal care , voluntary counseling and testing , and inpatient facilities were interviewed to collect information on their sexual partners . Partners were contacted via telephone or home visit to notify , test , and enroll those found to be HIV positive in medical care . Results Health advisors interviewed 1462 persons with HIV infection during the evaluation period ; these persons provided information about 1607 sexual partners . Health advisors notified 1347 ( 83.8 % ) of these partners , of whom 900 ( 66.8 % ) were HIV tested . Of partners tested , 451 ( 50.1 % ) were HIV positive , of whom 386 ( 85.6 % ) enrolled into HIV medical care . An average 3.2 index cases needed to be interviewed to identify 1 HIV case . Conclusions HIV PS can be successfully implemented in a developing country and is highly effective in identifying persons with HIV infection  and linking them to careTitle 3:Is care and support associated with preventive behaviour among people with HIV?Abstract 3:Care and support should play a critical role in assisting people who are HIV-positive to underst and the need for prevention and to enable them to protect others . Differences in sexual risk reduction among 154 newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals from semi-urban Tanzania were examined using a r and omized control design , which assigned a control group to regular health services and an experimental group to enhanced care and support . Data were collected at baseline , three months and six months on self-reported sexual risk behaviours , disclosure of serostatus , reproductive health and psychosocial support . Over the six-month period , significant risk reduction occurred among both groups , with most of the behaviour change occurring during the first three months , e.g. 86 respondents ( 56 % ) reported condom use at last intercourse at 3 months compared with 24(16 % ) at baseline ( p = 0.05 ) . Extra care and support did not lead to increased risk reduction among the experimental group . The study population as a whole significantly changed their behaviour , suggesting that in the short term , learning one is HIV-positive has an impact on risk reductionTitle 4:Randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of an interactive group counseling intervention for HIV-positive women on prenatal depression and disclosure of HIV statusAbstract 4:The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of group counseling , using a problem-solving therapy approach , on reducing depressive symptoms and increasing prenatal disclosure rates of HIV status among HIV-positive pregnant women living in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania . A r and omized controlled trial was performed comparing a six-week structured nurse – midwife facilitated psychosocial support group with the st and ard of care . Sixty percent of women in the intervention group were depressed post-intervention , versus 73 % in the control group [ Relative Risk ( RR ) = 0.82 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.67–1.01 , p=0.066 ] . HIV disclosure rates did not differ across the two study arms . However , among those women who disclosed , there was a significantly higher level of overall personal satisfaction with the response to disclosure from family and friends among women in the treatment ( 88 % ) compared to the control group ( 62 % ; p=0.004 ) . The results indicate reductions in the level of depressive symptoms comparable with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) for HIV-positive pregnant women participating in a group counseling intervention . Although the psychosocial group counseling did not significantly increase disclosure rates , an improvement in the level of personal satisfaction result ing from disclosure was associated with the intervention . This suggests that the counseling sessions have likely reduced the burden of depression and helped clients better manage partner reactions to disclosure . Public agencies and non-governmental organizations working in Tanzania and similar setting s should consider offering structured psychosocial support groups to HIV-positive pregnant women to prevent poor mental health outcomes , promote early childhood development , and potentially impact HIV-related disease outcomes in the long termTitle 5:HIV Partner Notification Is Effective and Feasible in Sub-Saharan Africa: Opportunities for HIV Treatment and PreventionAbstract 5:Background : Sexual partners of persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection require HIV counseling , testing and , if necessary , evaluation for therapy . However , many African countries do not have a st and ardized protocol for partner notification , and the effectiveness of partner notification has not been evaluated in developing countries . Methods : Individuals with newly diagnosed HIV infection presenting to sexually transmitted infection clinics in Lilongwe , Malawi , were r and omized to 1 of 3 methods of partner notification : passive referral , contract referral , or provider referral . The passive referral group was responsible for notifying their partners themselves . The contract referral group was given seven days to notify their partners , after which a health care provider contacted partners who had not reported for counseling and testing . In the provider referral group , a health care provider notified partners directly . Results : Two hundred forty-five index patients named 302 sexual partners and provided locator information for 252 . Among locatable partners , 107 returned for HIV counseling and testing ; 20 of 82 [ 24 % ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 15 % to 34 % ] partners returned in the passive referral arm , 45 of 88 ( 51 % ; 95 % CI : 41 % to 62 % ) in the contract referral arm , and 42 of 82 ( 51 % ; 95 % CI : 40 % to 62 % ) in the provider referral arm ( P < 0.001 ) . Among returning partners ( n = 107 ) , 67 ( 64 % ) of were HIV infected with 54 ( 81 % ) newly diagnosed . Discussion : This study provides the first evidence of the effectiveness of partner notification in sub-Saharan Africa . Active partner notification was feasible , acceptable , and effective among sexually transmitted infections clinic patients . Partner notification will increase early referral to care and facilitate risk reduction among high-risk uninfected partnersTitle 6:Reducing the risk of HIV infection during pregnancy among South African women: A randomized controlled trialAbstract 6:Mpumalanga Province , South Africa has one of the highest HIV/AIDS diagnosis rates among pregnant women ( ~29.4 % ) . This study sought to enhance male involvement in pregnancy to increase HIV disclosure , sexual communication , HIV knowledge and reduce unprotected sex .  Participants attending Antenatal Clinics ( ANC ) completed HIV counseling and testing and were enrolled with male partners ( n=239 couples , 478 individuals ) . Twelve ANCs were r and omly assigned to provide a prevention of mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) intervention or the st and ard of care , health education sessions plus PMTCT . Participants were assessed at baseline and post-intervention ( approximately 6–8 weeks post-baseline ) on demographics , sexual behavior , HIV-related knowledge , and conflict resolution strategies . Experimental participants increased HIV knowledge , use of negotiation , and decreased intimate partner violence . Additionally , they were more likely to have increased condom use from baseline to post-intervention ( OR=5.1 , 95 % CI=[2.0 , 13.3 ] ) . Seroconversions in the control condition exceeded experimental ( 6 vs. 0 ) . HIV serostatus disclosure to partner did not increase over time for men or women within the experimental or control condition . Male involvement in pregnancy may be an important strategy to reduce sexual risk behavior and HIV transmission . Results support the utility of group interventions to enhance communication and HIV knowledge among pregnant couples","answer":"Findings on disclosure were mixed , with most effect sizes being relatively small , and some more rigorous studies showing no effect .Partner notification interventions had the strongest evidence of impact .The existing evidence base for interventions to increase disclosure is limited and shows variable results ."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  How does the brain order successive events? Here we studied whether temporal order of two stimuli delivered in rapid succession, one to each hand, is determined before or after the stimuli are localized in space. When their arms were crossed, subjects could accurately report the temporal order, even when the interval between stimuli was as short as 70 ms. In most trials, subjects could also judge temporal order when their arms were crossed, but only if given adequate time (>1 s). At moderately short intervals (<300 ms), crossing the arms caused misreporting (that is, inverting) of the temporal order. Thus, at these intervals, the determining factor of temporal order was the spatial location of the hands. We suggest that it is not until the spatial locations of the hands are taken into account that the cutaneous signals from the respective hands are ordered in time. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Summary The mindless act of swatting a mosquito on the hand poses a remarkable challenge for the brain. Given that the primary somatosensory cortex maps skin location independently of arm posture [1, 2], the brain must realign tactile coordinates in order to locate the origin of the stimuli in extrapersonal space. Previous studies have highlighted the behavioral relevance of such an external mapping of touch, which results from combining somatosensory input with proprioceptive and visual cues about body posture [3–7]. However, despite the widely held assumption about the existence of this remapping process from somatotopic to external space and various findings indirectly suggesting its consequences [8–11], a demonstration of its changing time course and nature was lacking. We examined the temporal course of this multisensory interaction and its implications for tactile awareness in humans using a crossmodal cueing paradigm [12, 13]. What we show is that before tactile events are referred to external locations [12–15], a fleeting, unconscious image of the tactile sensation abiding to a somatotopic frame of reference rules performance. We propose that this early somatotopic \\"glimpse\\" arises from the initial feed-forward sweep of neural activity to the primary somatosensory cortex, whereas the later externally-based, conscious experience reflects the activity of a somatosensory network involving recurrent connections from association areas. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Recent studies have suggested that the location of tactile stimuli is automatically recoded from anatomical into external coordinates, independent of the task requirements. However, research has mainly involved the two hands, which may not be representative for the whole body because they are excessively used for the visually guided manipulation of objects and tools. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants received tactile stimuli to the hands and feet, but attended only one limb. The hands were placed near the feet either in an uncrossed or a crossed posture, thus varying the spatial distance of each hand from each foot. Centro-parietal ERPs 100-140 msec poststimulus were more positive when stimulating the anatomically same-side hand while attending a foot. They were also more positive when the Euclidean distance between the stimulated hand and the attended foot was small rather than large. When a foot was stimulated and a hand attended, a similar modulation of foot ERPs was observed for the right foot. To assess the spatial distance between two limbs in space, the external location of both must be known. The present ERP results therefore suggest that not only the hands but also other body parts are remapped into external coordinates. The use of both anatomical and external coordinates may facilitate the control of actions toward tactile events and the choice of the most suitable effector. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Abstract Remapping tactile events from skin to external space is an essential process for human behaviour. It allows us to refer tactile sensations to their actual externally based location, by combining anatomically based somatosensory information with proprioceptive information about the current body posture. We examined the time course of tactile remapping by recording speeded saccadic responses to somatosensory stimuli delivered to the hands. We conducted two experiments in which arm posture varied (crossed or uncrossed), so that anatomical and external frames of reference were either put in spatial conflict or were aligned. The data showed that saccade onset latencies in the crossed hands conditions were slower than in the uncrossed hands condition, suggesting that, in the crossed hands condition, remapping had to be completed before a correct saccade could be executed. Saccades to tactile stimuli when the hands were crossed were sometimes initiated to the wrong direction and then corrected in-flight, resulting in a turn-around saccade. These turn-around saccades were more likely to occur in short-latency responses, compared to onset latencies of saccades that went straight to target. The latter suggests that participants were postponing their saccade until the time the tactile event was represented according to the current body posture. We propose that the difference between saccade onset latencies of crossed and uncrossed hand postures, and between the onset of a turn-around saccade and a straight saccade in the crossed hand posture, reveal the timing of tactile spatial remapping. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  We investigated the electrophysiological correlates of somatosensory processing under different arm postures by recording eventrelated potentials at frontal, central and centroparietal sites during tactile stimulation of the hands. Short series of 200 ms vibrotactile stimuli were presented to the palms of the participants’ hands, one hand at a time, in either uncrossed- or crossed-hands postures. The manipulation of posture allowed us to investigate the electrophysiological processes underlying the spatial remapping of somatosensory stimuli from anatomical into external frames of reference. To examine somatosensory spatial remapping independently of its effects on attentional processes, the stimuli were presented unpredictably in terms of location, and in temporal onset. We also examined how vision of the limbs affects the process of remapping. When participants had sight of their hands (Experiment 1) the effect of posture was observed over regions contralateral to the stimulated hand from 128 ms, whereas when their limbs were covered (Experiment 2) effects of posture influenced the ipsilateral regions from 150 ms. These findings add to an increasing body of evidence which indicates that sight of the hand modulates the way in which information in other modalities is processed. We argue that in this case, sight of the hand biases spatial encoding of touch towards an anatomical frame of reference.Literature Review:","answer":"The suggestion that remapping into external spatial coordinates is a time-consuming process raises the question of which time course this process may take. In their initial study, BIB002 found performance with crossed hands to be similar to performance with uncrossed hands when stimuli were approximately 300 ms apart. Accordingly, they suggested this duration as an estimate for the duration of the remapping process. Several studies have since been dedicated to this issue. In one study, participants had to judge the elevation of a visual stimulus (up vs. down), which could be presented in the left or the right hemifield BIB003 ,b; see Figure 3 ). A spatially non-predictive tactile cue, delivered to one of the hands, preceded the visual stimulus at different intervals. When the hands were crossed, responses to the visual stimulus were faster when it occurred on the anatomically same side as the tactile cue (that is, in the opposite side of space) when the SOA between the two stimuli was short (<60 ms). In contrast, responses were faster for the external-spatial side of the tactile FIGURE 3 | Cueing effects between touch and vision. An inversion of spatial cueing effects of touch on vision was observed when the hands were crossed. These results suggest that touch is initially remapped on the basis of its anatomical representation before it is referred to an external location. (A) Typical trial with crossed hands. Participants were asked to judge the position of the light (up or down), regardless of the side of presentation and the location of the preceding tactile cue. (B) When the interval between tactile cues and visual targets was less than 60 ms, spatial cueing effects appeared to be determined by somatotropic representations, as responses to the visual targets were faster in opposite cue-target side trials (anatomically congruent but spatially incongruent) than in same-side trials. The pattern reversed after about 200 ms, so that tactile cues produced a facilitation of targets presented at the same external location. No differences were found with uncrossed hands. cue when the SOA between tactile cue and visual stimulus was longer (360 ms). This result suggests that, initially, the brain has access only to the anatomical coordinate of the touch, but that the external coordinate becomes available some time between 60 and 360 ms. A change of reference frames has also been demonstrated for the execution of saccades to single tactile stimuli BIB001 BIB005 . When the tactile stimulus was delivered to crossed hands, saccades regularly started in the direction of the wrong hand and turned around to the correct hand in mid-flight. This turn was evident, on average, 284 ms after initiation of the saccade. Because the time needed for the actual motor preparation was estimated, based on findings in monkeys, to be in the range of 95 ms BIB005 , the authors concluded that remapping must be completed already around 190 ms after stimulation. The estimate given for completion of remapping was even lower in a study that employed stimulation of the hands and feet while measuring somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP; BIB004 . This study factorized anatomical and external distance between attended and stimulated locations by asking participants to attend to one limb while tactually stimulating another limb with a single stimulus. External distance was manipulated by changing hand posture, such that the hands were spatially close either to the respective foot of the same body side (with uncrossed hands) or to the respective opposite foot (with crossed hands). The SEP in the time range between 100 and 140 ms was modulated both by anatomical distance as well as by external distance between attended and stimulated location. This result implies that external coordinates can be available already at this time point, given that attention was partly directed according to external spatial criteria. This time estimate was confirmed in a setting which did not rely on attentional manipulations, but compared SEP to single tactile stimuli when the hands were uncrossed vs. crossed BIB006 . Finally, a significant difference between uncrossed and crossed postures was evident over the left temporal scalp at even earlier stages of tactile processing (70-90 ms post-stimulus) independent of the hand at which the stimulus had occurred  . Moreover, the size of the ERP posture effect was positively correlated with participants' TOJ crossing deficit measured in the same session. Thus, the larger the difference due to posture in somatosensory processing (indexed by the SEP), the larger was the crossed-hands deficit in the TOJ task. There is currently no theoretical account that integrates these different findings regarding the timing of tactile remapping (though see Soto-Faraco and Azañón, 2013 for a consideration of different deflections of the SEP in the context of remapping). Yet, the picture emerging from these studies is consistent, in that tactile information appears to be used in the original, somatotopic reference frame, but becomes available in the external reference frame rather quickly, probably within the first 100 ms, but maximally 190 ms post-stimulus."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

While conscious vision is impaired, patients can still respond to certain images; this is known as ‘blindsight’. Recently, a direct anatomical connection between the lateral geniculate nucleus( LGN) and human motion area hMT+ has been implicated in blindsight. However, a functional connection between these structures has not been demonstrated. We quantified functional MRI responses to motion in 14 patients with unilateral V1 damage( with and without blindsight). Patients with blindsight showed significant activity and a preserved sensitivity to speed in motion area hMT+, which was absent in patients without blindsight. We then compared functional connectivity between motion area hMT+ and a number of structures implicated in blindsight, including the ventral pulvinar. Only patients with blindsight showed an intact functional connection with the LGN but not the other structures, supporting a specific functional role for the LGN in blindsight.Introduction:Damage to the primary visual cortex( V1) that may occur following a stroke causes visual loss in the corresponding part of the visual field( homonymous hemianopia,[1]). However, extensive research has shown that some patients retain an ability to respond to images inside their scotoma, even though they may not consciously see them[2]. This phenomenon is called blindsight, and recent work applied diffusion MRI and tractography in patients with V1 damage to try to uncover which pathways may underlie this residual visual function[3]. A connection between the lateral geniculate nucleus( LGN) and human motion area, hMT+, was found to be intact in patients with blindsight but was absent or impaired in patients without blindsight. The other pathways tested, which included a connection between hMT+ and the superior colliculus( SC), and with hMT+ in the opposite hemisphere, did not show this pattern. Unfortunately, a limitation of diffusion MRI is that it investigates purely structural connections, which may not relate directly to the function under investigation[4]. Furthermore, seed-based tractography is restricted to pathways chosen by investigators( see also[5–7]), which in this case did not include a connection with the thalamic pulvinar nucleus. Neither a specific role for the LGN nor a functional connection to hMT+ has been shown in human blindsight and would significantly advance our understanding of how patients respond to visual images in the absence of V1. The current study investigated behavioural and functional MRI responses to speed of motion in a group of patients with V1 damage in adulthood( n = 14), and healthy age-matched controls( n = 8). Patients were categorised as blindsight positive or negative according to their ability to detect the visual stimulus within their blind visual field. We then compared measures of activity and functional connectivity between the two patient groups and healthy controls. Patients with blindsight demonstrated significant fMRI activity in hMT+ in the damaged hemisphere, with a relatively preserved hMT+ response to speed in the blind hemifield. Critically, patients with blindsight also showed intact functional connectivity between hMT+ and LGN in the damaged hemisphere, which was absent in patients without blindsight. This was specific to the LGN, as both patient groups demonstrated preserved functional connectivity between hMT+ and( i) ventral pulvinar,( ii) SC, and( iii) contralateral hMT+, which was no different than in healthy controls. The pulvinar, in particular, is implicated in human and nonhuman primate studies in which V1 is damaged early in life[8, 9]; however, this region is yet to be evaluated in adult-onset blindsight. Our findings support a critical functional role for the LGN and its specific connection with hMT+ in adult human blindsight, reinforced by recent evidence for an intact anatomical connection between these structures[3].Discussion:In summary, we identified a functional connection between LGN and hMT+ in patients with blindsight that was absent in patients without blindsight, despite a retained functional connection with ventral pulvinar and SC. This supports a critical functional role for the LGN in human blindsight, and in particular its connection with hMT+, reinforced by recent evidence for an intact anatomical connection between these structures[3]. Our results also revealed that hMT+ does not require intact V1 for a normal speed response, although it does require a functional connection with the LGN. This suggests that the LGN may support motion-selective input to hMT+ in the absence of V1. These results focus on behavioural and neural responses to visual motion, which is a critical component of blindsight( see[66] for recent review). In future work, it will be necessary to explore how such pathways interact with other aspects of blindsight function and whether distinct tasks or stimuli might engage separate mechanisms in the absence of V1.","answer":"When the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) is damaged in one hemisphere , we lose the ability to see one half of the world around us .

Standard treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer has been cytoreductive surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. Until recently, platinum-based chemotherapy was considered optimal and patients were treated with regimens built around either cisplatin or carboplatin. Recently, paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has been shown to be a highly active agent in refractory ovarian cancer patients. Subsequently, the Gynecologic Oncology Group performed a prospective randomized trial of paclitaxel plus cisplatin compared with cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide in suboptimal stage III and IV ovarian cancer patients. Based on higher response rates, longer time to progression, and marked improvement in median survival (37.5 months compared with 24.4 months), the Gynecologic Oncology Group currently considers paclitaxel plus cisplatin to be the new standard regimen for patients with advanced disease. More recently , paclitaxel plus carboplatin also has been evaluated in previously untreated patients . Using area under the curve dosing for carboplatin, it was demonstrated that this agent could be combined with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 in a 3-hour infusion) with acceptable toxicity. All current Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols for untreated patients with ovarian cancer use a paclitaxel-based regimen. These clinical trials are evaluating the relative efficacy of carboplatin plus paclitaxel versus cisplatin plus paclitaxel as well as differences in dose and schedule and number of cycles of treatment.

However, the molecular basis for these differences is puzzling because two drugs have similar chemical structures. Reported here is a crystal structure of the fully active and nonmutated PDE5A1 catalytic domain in complex with vardenafil. The structure shows that the conformation of the H-loop in the PDE5A1-vardenafil complex is different from those of any known structures of the unliganded PDE5 and its complexes with the inhibitors. In addition, the molecular configuration of vardenafil differs from that of sildenafil when bound to PDE5. It is noteworthy that the binding of vardenafil causes loss of the divalent metal ions that have been observed in all the previously published PDE structures. The conformational variation of both PDE5 and the inhibitors provides structural insight into the different potencies of the drugs.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"sildenafil\\", \\"vardenafil\\", \\"Vardenafil\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"PDE5A1 catalytic domain\\", \\"PDE5A1\\", \\"phosphodiesterase-5\\", \\"PDE\\", \\"PDE5\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

This paper describes the use of QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) for the extraction, cleanup and detection of 10 paralytic shellfish toxins (PSP) in sea food by HILIC-MS/MS with positive ESI. Matrix matched calibration standards were used to compensate for matrix effects. The toxins were extracted with acetonitrile/water (90:10, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid and cleaned by HLB and GCB sorbents. Qualitative and quantitative detection for the analytes were carried out under the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive ionization mode after chromatography separation on a TSK-gel Amide-80 ® column (150 mm × 2.0 mm × 3 μm). Studies at three fortification levels for the toxins in the range of 8.1-225.5 μg/kg gave mean recoveries from 71.3% to 104.6% with relative standard deviation (RSD) ≤ 15.8%. The limit of detection (LOD) was below the recommended regulatory limit of 170 μgSTX (equ.) /kg and the proposed method fully meets the needs of daily monitoring.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Product definition creation and management are critical aspects of the new product development process. A well-developed product definition reflects understanding of customer and user needs, the competitive environment, technology availability, and regulatory and standards issues. A robust product definition is one that stands up to challenge and guides the product development process, allowing the development team to make tradeoffs and decisions quickly and effectively. This article examines the product definition creation and management processes at six major U.S. electronics companies. Customer and user needs assessment is a particularly critical aspect of product definition; clear, widespread communication of product definition elements throughout a product development team is important; and change to a product definition during product development must be carefully and explicitly managed to obtain the best chances of overall product success. Many of the firms in this study used surprisingly rudimentary procedures to bring together the requisite product definition information and failed to distinguish the creation of product definition as an important phase of the product development process. Further, few of the firms understood that product definitions will change during product development and they did not have mechanisms for managing that change.Literature Review:","answer":"Our approach to developing theory for this paper is inductive BIB002 . We base our theory, or systematic generalizations of product development practice, on both our observations of industrial product development and our review of the literature. The existing literature on product development is vast. To sharpen our understanding of the literature, it is useful to organize this literature into a few competing paradigms. Such a clustering is an attempt on our part to elucidate differences, and may lead in some cases to an exaggeration of these perspectives. Indeed, we argue in this paper for a synthesis of these paradigms into the decision perspective of product development. As shown in Table 1 , there are at least four common perspectives in the design and development research community: marketing, organizations, engineering design, and operations management. In addition to the dimensions highlighted in this table, these perspectives often differ in the level of abstraction at which they study product development. For instance, the organizational perspective is focused at a relatively aggregate level on the determinants of project success. (An excellent review of the large body of papers from the organizational perspective is Brown and Eisenhardt 1995.)

Signaling cascades triggered by different environmental and physiological signals converge to control HilD, an AraC regulator that coordinates the expression of several virulence factors. The expression of hilD is modulated at several steps of the expression process. Here, we report that the invasion of epithelial cells by S. Typhimurium strains lacking the Gre factors, GreA and GreB, is impaired. By interacting with the RNA polymerase secondary channel, the Gre factors prevent backtracking of paused complexes to avoid arrest during transcriptional elongation. Our results indicate that the Gre factors are required for the expression of the bacterial factors needed for epithelial cell invasion by modulating expression of HilD. This regulation does not occur at transcription initiation and depends on the capacity of the Gre factors to prevent backtracking of the RNA polymerase. Remarkably, genetic analyses indicate that the 3’-untranslated region( UTR) of hilD is required for Gre-mediated regulation of hilD expression. Our data provide new insight into the complex regulation of S. Typhimurium virulence and highlight the role of the hilD 3’-UTR as a regulatory motif.Introduction:Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium( S. Typhimurium), an enteric bacterial pathogen that infects both humans and animals, is extensively used as a model organism in pathogenicity studies[1, 2]. S. Typhimurium infection is asymptomatic in poultry, but causes gastroenteritis in humans[3]. Its infectious cycle is complex and requires the expression of a large number of virulence factors that are mostly encoded by chromosomal genes clustered in discrete regions known as Salmonella pathogenicity islands( SPIs). SPIs have been acquired through different evolutionary processes via horizontal gene transfer, with the successive acquisition of different genetic elements playing a determinative role in host adaptation[4]. Comparative genomic studies identify up to 21 SPIs in the S. Typhimurium genome, SPI-1 and SPI-2 being the best characterized[5]. SPI-1 contains genes required during the first steps of epithelial cell infection, while SPI-2 encodes genes needed for S. Typhimurium survival and replication inside host cells[6]. SPI-1 and SPI-2 genes encode their respective type three secretion systems( TTSS), TTSS-1 and TTSS-2, secreted effector proteins and regulators that coordinate the optimal expression of virulence genes[7–9]. In SPI-1, the HilA protein directly regulates the expression of secretion machinery components and various TTSS-1 effectors( S1 Fig)[10]. Moreover, HilA induces the expression of the regulator InvF, a transcriptional activator of sic/sip operons, encoding effector proteins[11, 12]. HilA transcriptional expression is autoregulated and tightly modulated by the combined action of three AraC-like transcriptional activators: HilC, HilD and RtsA[13, 14]. Each of these three regulators are positively autoregulated and can induce the expression of the other two, producing a positive feed-forward loop that controls SPI-1 gene expression[15]. HilD plays a major role in regulating hilA expression. Its expression and activity is targeted by many signaling pathways, with HilD acting as a hub that integrates diverse environmental and physiological cues to trigger S. Typhimurium invasion of epithelial cells[16]. Of note, HilD-mediated regulation is not restricted to the SPI-1 genes, as HilD also modulates the expression of genes located outside this genetic locus such as sopE, which encodes an effector protein secreted via TTSS-1, and ssrAB, which encodes the two-component system that acts as the central positive regulator of the SPI-2 genes[10, 17, 18]. Therefore, HilD plays a key role in S. Typhimurium pathogenicity. Transcription, the first step in gene expression, is tightly regulated. Regulation of transcription initiation is crucial in determining the genomic response to physiological and environmental signals. Likewise, regulation during transcription elongation and termination has a pronounced effect on the steady state expression levels of particular genes and regulons, but is less well understood[19]. Brief transcriptional pauses in RNA polymerase( RNAP) activity that occur during elongation can quickly resolve spontaneously; however, sustained pauses may cause backtracking of the transcription elongation complex. In E. coli, the Gre factors, GreA and GreB, resolve backtracked complexes by interacting with the secondary channel of the RNAP and inducing endoribonuclease activity. These actions restore the proper positioning of the 3’-end of the nascent transcript within the RNAP active center[20, 21]. Transcriptional pauses may act as regulatory events that affect the expression levels of specific genes[22]. In addition to their role in suppressing transcriptional pauses, Gre factors stimulate RNAP promoter escape and enhance transcriptional fidelity[23]. Gre factors occur widely in prokaryotes. The presence of two distinct clades among the Gre family members sharing high structural and functional homology, GreA and GreB, has been detected among proteobacteria. Members of the family outside proteobacteria resemble GreA more closely than GreB[24]. In S. Typhimurium, GreA and GreB share 34% identity and 57% similarity, numbers which are nearly identical to those observed in E. coli( 35% and 56%, respectively). In this report, we explored whether Gre factors are relevant in regulating pathogenicity in S. Typhimurium. We found that the Gre factors are required for the proper expression of the SPI-1 effector proteins and subsequent cell invasion as well as organ colonization in a mouse model of systemic infection. The dissection of the regulatory pathway let us conclude that Gre factors are essential for the expression of HilD, a major regulator of SPI-1 genes. Regulation of hilD does not occur at transcription initiation, but the 3’-untranslated region( UTR) is required for Gre-mediated regulation of hilD expression. This suggests that regulation depends on the ability of Gre factors to prevent backtracking of paused RNA polymerase complexes possibly coupled with downstream events. Our data provide new insights into the complex regulation of S. Typhimurium virulence and the role of the 3’-UTR of hilD as a regulatory motif.Discussion:Gre factors were initially described to prevent backtracking of paused complexes during transcription elongation thereby preventing transcriptional arrest, with further studies assigning additional roles in transcription initiation and fidelity[31]. Genes encoding Gre proteins are found in most bacteria. It has been reported that mutations in genes encoding Gre factors elicit hypersensitivity to ionic detergents, high temperatures and osmotic shock, suggesting that Gre factors are involved in adapting to harsh environments[32–34]. Interestingly, greA is a member of the sigma E regulon in both E. coli and S. Typhimurium, further indicating a potential role of GreA in cell stress response[35–37]. Moreover, greA expression is upregulated during the stress response to hypoxia and acid in Mycobacterium avium and Streptococcus mutans, respectively[38, 39]. However, a direct relationship between the molecular mode of action of Gre factors during transcription and their physiological role in the cell is not clear. Few studies on the in vivo function of the Gre factors exist. In E. coli K12 strains only a discrete effect on the global gene expression pattern was detected when the level of GreA production was altered[23]. In this report, we demonstrate that Gre factors are required for the optimal expression of virulence factors in S. Typhimurium, since the ability to invade epithelial cells and produce SPI-1-encoded effector proteins was fully impaired in strains lacking both GreA and GreB. The absence of either GreA or GreB had partial effects compared to those elicited by the absence of both Gre factors. Moreover, the absence of only GreA had a greater impact on S. Typhimurium virulence than the absence of only GreB. This suggests that Gre factors might be functionally exchangeable up to a certain point, whereby GreA seems to play a more relevant role in S. Typhimurium pathogenesis than GreB. Similar observations on the functional redundancy of the Gre factors have also been described in E. coli[23, 30]. We observed that the major regulator of SPI-1, HilD, was indeed the target of Gre-mediated regulation. As summarized in Fig 8, Gre factors affect hilD expression during transcription elongation, targeting the recently described 3’-UTR regulatory motif of the hilD gene. Although there is currently no physical evidence for an arrested or backtracked complex during hilD transcription on which the Gre factors act, the requirement of the anti-backtracking activity of Gre factors suggest a model where Gre factors contribute to the regulation of hilD expression by rescuing an arrested or backtracked complex that occurs in the hilD 3’-UTR during transcription elongation( Fig 8). Further studies will be needed to address how backtracked RNAP complex potentially in combination with other mechanisms affects hilD expression. HilD expression and activity are very tightly regulated, highlighting its pivotal role in the biology of S. Typhimurium. HilD acts as a regulatory hub for virulence coordinating the expression of several virulence factors encoded inside and outside SPI-1[18, 28, 40–42]. Indeed, in this report we provide further corroboration of the role of HilD in regulating SPI-2 gene expression. Given the significant impact of HilD on gene expression in S. Typhimurium, HilD-mediated activation of gene expression only occurs when several environmental and physiological cues provide permissive conditions. Multiple signaling pathways control hilD transcription initiation[28]. CsrA post-transcriptionally regulates hilD[41]. At the post-translational level, factors such as HilE and the Lon protease affect HilD activity and stability, respectively, while different metabolites, including L-arabinose and fatty acids, have also been shown to modulate HilD activity[43–46]. In this report, we provide evidence that HilD regulation also occurs during transcription elongation in the 3’-UTR. Pauses during transcription elongation can be targeted in gene expression regulation. In eukaryotes, paused complexes with RNAPII are affected by environmental cues. In bacteria, transcriptional pauses are involved in transcription attenuation, transcription termination and coupling transcription and translation[22]. Studies in Streptococcus pneumoniae suggest that transcription elongation is a highly regulated step of gene expression, whereby GreA plays a relevant role by preventing long-living pauses during transcription[47]. Regulatory pausing events are mainly localized in proximal promoter sequences, often in the 5’-UTR, but in hilD, it is the 3’-UTR that putatively contains a transcriptional pause. In bacteria, investigation of the features of 3’-UTRs of genes is a growing field of study, with the 3’-UTR possibly acting as a reservoir for sRNAs[48]. 3’-UTRs are rather abundant as in the Staphylococcus aureus genome, where up to a third of the genes carry long 3’-UTRs[49]. The hilD 3’-UTR is a regulatory sequence that overall affects transcript stability, since its absence increases hilD transcript levels. Furthermore, positive regulation of hilD expression by Hfq has been reported to require the 3’-UTR sequence[29]. As Hfq is a major sRNA chaperone, it probably regulates hilD expression through its 3’-UTR by a mechanism involving sRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation. In the present study, we propose that hilD expression is also regulated during transcription elongation of the 3’-UTR. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether changes in the kinetics of transcription elongation in the 3’-UTR affect hilD expression. Taking into consideration the described role of the hilD 3’-UTR, our results suggest that the anti-backtracking activity of Gre factors beyond hilD ORF transcription elongation may decrease susceptibility to mRNA degradation, possibly by stimulating the generation of certain RNA structures or promoting optimal interactions with sRNAs to protect the hilD transcripts from degradation. Thus, our report provides evidence for an additional mechanism of regulation of hilD expression at the post-transcriptional level.","answer":"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a foodborne pathogen that causes gastroenteritis in humans .

Predicting late phase outcomes from early-phase findings can help inform decisions in drug development. If the measurements in early-phase differ from those in late phase, forecasting is more challenging. In this paper, we present a model-based approach for predicting glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in late phase using glucose and insulin concentrations from an early-phase study, investigating an anti-diabetic treatment. Two previously published models were used; an integrated glucose and insulin (IGI) model for meal tolerance tests and an integrated glucose-red blood cell-HbA1c (IGRH) model predicting the formation of HbA1c from the average glucose concentration (Cg, av). Output from the IGI model was used as input to the IGRH model. Parameters of the IGI model and drug effects were estimated using data from a phase1 study in 59 diabetic patients receiving various doses of a glucokinase activator. Cg, av values were simulated according to a Phase 2 study design and used in the IGRH model for predictions of HbA1c. The performance of the model-based approach was assessed by comparing the predicted to the actual outcome of the Phase 2 study. We have shown that this approach well predicts the longitudinal HbA1c response in a 12-week study using only information from a 1-week study where glucose and insulin concentrations were measured.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Bypassing the collapsed solution.  It is obvious that the loss in Equation (3) admits the collapsed solution with respect to theta and xi, which means both the encoders generate the same representations for all users and items.For this reason, the conventional end-to-end learning strategy, which optimizes both f_{theta} and f_{xi} to minimize the loss (i.e., cross-prediction error), may easily lead to such collapsed solution.In contrast, our proposed framework updates each of the encoders in different ways.From Equation (4), the online encoder is optimized to minimize the loss, while the target encoder is updated to slowly approximate the online encoder.That is, the direction of updating the target encoder (theta-xi) totally differs from that of updating the online encoder (-nabla_{theta}mathcal{L}_{theta,xi}),and this effectively keeps both the encoders from converging to the collapsed solution.Several recent work on bootstrapping-based representation learning (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021) empirically demonstrated that this kind of dynamics (i.e., updating two networks differently) allows to avoid the collapsed solution without any explicit term to prevent it.Question: How does the negative pairs prevent the problem of collapsed solution during optimization in contrastive learning methods?","answer":"To prevent the problem of collapsed sollution, they update target encoder and online encoder differently."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) . With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection. On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway (Guibas et al., 2018) . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections (Vasileiou et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation. Another mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Sajjan et al., 2008; Kast et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018) . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Another recent area of interest is the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome. The development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases is usually linked to specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment (Diver et al., 2019) . In the event of a viral infection such as RV infection, the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present (Molyneaux et al., 2013; Kloepfer et al., 2014; Kloepfer et al., 2017; Jubinville et al., 2018; van Rijn et al., 2019) . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation (Marks et al., 2013; Chao et al., 2014) . Moreover, a viral infection may also alter the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth (Siegel et al., 2014; Mallia et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the destabilization is further compounded by impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a Wang et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2019) . All these may gradually lead to more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles (Teo et al., 2018) . These changes may in turn result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between virus and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Wark et al., 2013; Singanayagam et al., 2018) . To counteract these effects, microbiome-based therapies are in their infancy but have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome (Bakken et al., 2011) . Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection. Viral infections can cause the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier. Ciliary proteins FIGURE 2 | Changes in the upper airway epithelium contributing to viral exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. The upper airway epithelium is the primary contact/infection site of most respiratory viruses. Therefore, its infection by respiratory viruses may have far reaching consequences in augmenting and synergizing current and future acute exacerbations. The destruction of epithelial barrier, mucociliary function and cell death of the epithelial cells serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. The opening of tight junction increasing the leakiness further augments the inflammation and exacerbations. In addition, viral infections are usually accompanied with oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. Finally, the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promotes growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome.  Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection. Viral specific trait contributing to exacerbation mechanism (with literature evidence) Oxidative stress ROS production (RV, RSV, IFV, HSV)As RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation (see text for abbreviations). that aid in the proper function of the motile cilia in the airways are aberrantly expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells which are the major target for RV infection (Griggs et al., 2017) . Such form of secondary cilia dyskinesia appears to be present with chronic inflammations in the airway, but the exact mechanisms are still unknown (Peng et al., , 2019 Qiu et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, it was found that in viral infection such as IFV, there can be a change in the metabolism of the cells as well as alteration in the ciliary gene expression, mostly in the form of down-regulation of the genes such as dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) and multiciliate differentiation And DNA synthesis associated cell cycle protein (MCIDAS) (Tan et al., 2018b . The recently emerged Wuhan CoV was also found to reduce ciliary beating in infected airway epithelial cell model (Zhu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, viral infections such as RSV was shown to directly destroy the cilia of the ciliated cells and almost all respiratory viruses infect the ciliated cells (Jumat et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) . In addition, mucus overproduction may also disrupt the equilibrium of the mucociliary function following viral infection, resulting in symptoms of acute exacerbation (Zhu et al., 2009) . Hence, the disruption of the ciliary movement during viral infection may cause more foreign material and allergen to enter the airway, aggravating the symptoms of acute exacerbation and making it more difficult to manage. The mechanism of the occurrence of secondary cilia dyskinesia can also therefore be explored as a means to limit the effects of viral induced acute exacerbation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional modulation of biological processes, and implicated in a number of diseases (Tan et al., 2014) . miRNAs are found to be induced by viral infections and may play a role in the modulation of antiviral responses and inflammation (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018) . In the case of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, circulating miRNA changes were found to be linked to exacerbation of the diseases (Wardzynska et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is likely that such miRNA changes originated from the infected epithelium and responding immune cells, which may serve to further dysregulate airway inflammation leading to exacerbations. Both IFV and RSV infections has been shown to increase miR-21 and augmented inflammation in experimental murine asthma models, which is reversed with a combination treatment of anti-miR-21 and corticosteroids (Kim et al., 2017) . IFV infection is also shown to increase miR-125a and b, and miR-132 in COPD epithelium which inhibits A20 and MAVS; and p300 and IRF3, respectively, resulting in increased susceptibility to viral infections (Hsu et al., 2016 (Hsu et al., , 2017 . Conversely, miR-22 was shown to be suppressed in asthmatic epithelium in IFV infection which lead to aberrant epithelial response, contributing to exacerbations (Moheimani et al., 2018) . Other than these direct evidence of miRNA changes in contributing to exacerbations, an increased number of miRNAs and other non-coding RNAs responsible for immune modulation are found to be altered following viral infections (Globinska et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2018; Hasegawa et al., 2018) . Hence non-coding RNAs also presents as targets to modulate viral induced airway changes as a means of managing exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Other than miRNA modulation, other epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation may also play a role in exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.Question: What does  the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promote?","answer":"growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Conjugation allows the broadest range and the highest gene transfer input per transfer event. While conjugative plasmids have been studied for decades, the number and diversity of integrative conjugative elements( ICE) in prokaryotes remained unknown. We defined a large set of protein profiles of the conjugation machinery to scan over 1, 000 genomes of prokaryotes. We found 682 putative conjugative systems among all major phylogenetic clades and showed that ICEs are the most abundant conjugative elements in prokaryotes. Nearly half of the genomes contain a type IV secretion system( T4SS), with larger genomes encoding more conjugative systems. Surprisingly, almost half of the chromosomal T4SS lack co-localized relaxases and, consequently, might be devoted to protein transport instead of conjugation. This class of elements is preponderant among small genomes, is less commonly associated with integrases, and is rarer in plasmids. ICEs and conjugative plasmids in proteobacteria have different preferences for each type of T4SS, but all types exist in both chromosomes and plasmids. Mobilizable elements outnumber self-conjugative elements in both ICEs and plasmids, which suggests an extensive use of T4SS in trans. Our evolutionary analysis indicates that switch of plasmids to and from ICEs were frequent and that extant elements began to differentiate only relatively recently. According to the present results, ICEs are the most abundant conjugative elements in practically all prokaryotic clades and might be far more frequently domesticated into non-conjugative protein transport systems than previously thought. While conjugative plasmids and ICEs have different means of genomic stabilization, their mechanisms of mobility by conjugation show strikingly conserved patterns, arguing for a unitary view of conjugation in shaping the genomes of prokaryotes by horizontal gene transfer.Introduction:Prokaryotes, both bacteria and archaea, have remarkably plastic genomes because they can acquire genetic information at high rates by horizontal transfer from other prokaryotes. This allows them to adapt rapidly to specific niches and results in large differences in gene repertoires among closely related strains[1]–[3]. Three major mechanisms allow gene transfer: natural transformation, transduction and conjugation. Natural transformation is controlled by the receptor cell and mostly implicated in DNA transfer within species leading to allelic recombination[4]. Both transduction and conjugation are more invasive, since the recipient has little control over both processes which change gene repertoires dramatically and allow transfer between distant lineages. Conjugation, in particular, can lead to the transfer of very large fractions of genomes and even entire chromosomes in one single event[5],[6]. Several studies suggest that conjugation is the preponderant mechanism of horizontal gene transfer between distant lineages[7],[8]. Such cross-clade transfer might be at the origin of the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance through most major lineages of bacterial pathogens in the last few decades[2],[9],[10]. Conjugative elements are also known for encoding other adaptive traits such as toxins, transporters and many secreted proteins including enzymes of industrial interest[11],[12]. Conjugation involves a relaxase( MOB), which is the key element in a multiprotein DNA-processing complex, a type IV secretion system( T4SS) and a type IV coupling protein( T4CP)( reviewed recently in[13])( Figure 1). The relaxase binds and nicks the DNA at the origin of transfer. The relaxase-DNA nucleoprotein complex is then coupled to the T4SS by the T4CP. The T4SS translocates the relaxase-DNA complex through the membrane of the donor cell delivering it to the cytoplasm of the recipient cell. The T4SS is a large complex of proteins spanning from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space, including an ubiquitous ATPase( VirB4 or TraU), a set of mating-pair formation( MPF) proteins( from a minimum of 12 to more than 20) that elaborate the transport channel, as well as a pilus that allows the attachment to the recipient cell and thereby the translocation of the relaxase-DNA complex. Protein homology of MPF genes allowed the clustering of all known proteobacterial T4SS into four groups[14], named after one model of each group, the vir system of the Ti plasmid( MPFT)[15], the F plasmid( MPFF)[16], the R64 IncI plasmid( MPFI)[17] and the integrative conjugative element( ICE) ICEHIN1056( MPFG)[18]. For other taxonomic clades, the genes associated with the T4SS, apart from VirB4, the T4CP and the relaxase, are poorly characterized. Once the relaxase-DNA complex is in the recipient cell, the T4CP translocates the full DNA and the relaxase ligates the two ends of the DNA into a single circular molecule. At the final stage of the conjugation process, the element exists in ssDNA state in both cells and the hosts' replication machineries are recruited to replicate them to reconstitute the original dsDNA molecules[13]. A self-transmissible conjugative element must thus comprise three components: the relaxase, the T4CP, and the T4SS. While most described conjugative systems are located in plasmids, the last decade has seen a growing interest in conjugative systems integrated in chromosomes( ICEs), which include the so-called “conjugative transposons” or “integrated conjugative plasmids”[19],[20]. The conjugation of ICEs is poorly documented but is generally assumed to resemble that of plasmids, with a preliminary step of excision with circularization and an additional final step of re-integration in the genome( Figure 1). For these steps, some ICEs encode supplementary genes resembling those of temperate phages, e. g. integrases of the lambda tyrosine-recombinase family[21],[22], which have led to their classification as “phage-like elements”. Other ICEs integrate in the chromosome, or excise from it, by using other tyrosine-recombinases[23],[24], DDE-transposases[25], serine-recombinases[26] or by homologous recombination with chromosomal copies of transposable elements[27],[28]. Contrary to plasmids, there is little evidence of ICEs replication in cells( but see, for instance,[29]) so it is often assumed that they cannot be stably maintained in an extra-chromosomal state[20]. While ICEs, by definition, are conjugative elements, many other mobile elements populate prokaryotic genomes. Integrative mobilizable elements( IMEs) do not code for a T4SS but can use one coded by other elements just like mobilizable plasmids[30],[31]. Genomic islands are integrative elements that can be mobilized by conjugation when they have compatible origins of transfer[32] or by integrating in conjugative elements[33]. Yet, like for non-mobilizable plasmids, the exact mechanism of mobility of most of these elements remains obscure[34]. Finally, some chromosomes encode T4SS that are not involved in conjugation but in other processes such as protein secretion and natural transformation[35],[36]. It has been suggested that these T4SS probably derived from ancestral conjugative systems[37]. The presence of an ICE can in principle be assessed by the observation of a conjugative T4SS within a chromosome. Since it is presently known how to class transmissible plasmids[14], it should be possible to do the same for ICEs. There are however important difficulties in this process. First, it is not known if all ICEs conjugate like plasmids. The family of conjugative elements of ICEHin1056 was proposed to exist exclusively as ICEs[18]. Even though a few rare conjugative plasmids of this family were subsequently identified[14], there might be other families exclusive to ICEs. Second, the presence in chromosomes of T4SS not used for conjugation may obscure the identification of conjugation systems if no relaxase is present at the locus. Third, the most conserved proteins involved in conjugation are ATPases. Finding them in genomes and distinguishing them from other ATPases is challenging. Fourth, ICEs that are non-functional because of pseudogenization might be difficult to distinguish from functional elements. In this work we present the results of a scan of prokaryotic genomes for conjugative systems in plasmids and chromosomes and the subsequent analysis to understand their functional and evolutionary relations. Previous studies provided precious insights of ICE evolution by analyzing closely related ICEs[38],[39]. Here we take the complementary approach and aim at the bigger picture. By searching for conjugative elements in all sequenced chromosomes and plasmids, we quantify the number of ICEs, characterize their diversity in terms of mechanism and phylogenetic representation, and study their evolution at the light of that of conjugative plasmids.Discussion:In this work we present the results of a semi-automatic method to detect conjugation-associated mobility systems not only in plasmids but also in chromosomes. This analysis paves the way for a systematic quantification of conjugation systems in prokaryotic genomes and in metagenomic data. When coupled with the detection of integration junctions( work in progress) it will also allow to analyze the gene repertoires of ICEs, and evaluate the evolutionary interplay between ICEs, conjugative plasmids and phages. Therefore, our present results only concern the C part of ICEs and conjugative plasmids. In the case of ICEs, this only gives an indication of their position in genomes, but not of their limits. ICEs can be very large( more than 500 kb for ICEMlSymR71 of Mesorhizobium loti[56]). Since the size of the C part is more or less constant, the variations in ICEs size will reveal the cargo genes they contain, much like for plasmids. The next step of this work will thus be to delimit ICEs within genomes in order to study the genes they carry. Our quantitative analysis shows that conjugative systems are more likely to be found in larger genomes. This fits the current assumption that larger genomes engage more frequently in horizontal gene transfer. The study of the cargo genes will help to quantify and qualify the role of ICEs in the functional diversification of prokaryotes. Our analysis of MOBless T4SS in proteobacteria strongly suggests that many of these are involved in protein transport and not in conjugation. First, besides the archaeal clade, the relative frequency of these elements is similar in well-studied and poorly studied clades, suggesting this is not a methodological bias. Second, small genomes show abundant MOBless T4SS but practically no conjugative systems. This is in agreement with the utilization of MOBless T4SS in small genomes of pathogenic bacteria and in disagreement with the hypothesis that MOBless T4SSs are ICEs with unknown relaxases. Third, ICEs contain a significantly larger fraction of neighbouring integrases than MOBless T4SSs, both in proteobacteria and in the other clades. Fourth, a large fraction of the MOBless T4SSs in proteobacteria indeed corresponds to experimentally verified protein secretion systems or to orthologous systems in closely related genomes. If most MOBless T4SSs are indeed protein secretion systems, our results suggest that these systems are more frequent than previously suspected. Unexpectedly, many environmental bacteria have MOBless T4SSs, e. g. Caulobacter, Thermoanaerobacter or cyanobacteria. Protein secretion systems in these bacteria might be involved in antagonistic interactions with grazing protozoa, as was proposed for T3SS[68]. They could also be involved in protein transport, not associated with conjugation, or signaling interactions with other bacteria. To the best of our knowledge these functions have not yet been proposed for MOBless T4SSs. However, since conjugation is a form of protein secretion between prokaryotic cells, the evolution of a T4SS towards protein secretion between prokaryotes seems simpler than the evolution required to some of its other known functions, such as evolution into protein secretion into eukaryotic cells, or DNA uptake in H. pylori. Interestingly, Agrobacterium tumefaciens vir system exports both proteins and DNA at the time of conjugation of T-DNA into plants[69]. Protein secretion by MOBless T4SS might therefore be simple to evolve from a conjugative system. We find that ICEs and conjugative plasmids use similar T4SS, but at different frequencies, especially concerning MPFF, which are more abundant in plasmids, and MPFG, which are present almost exclusively under the form of ICEs. The reasons for these preferences are puzzling and might be clarified by a better understanding of the conjugation mechanisms of Conjugation of ICEs is often assumed to take the same path as that of plasmids, once the element is excised and circularized. Differences in the two processes at the initial or final stages of conjugation might explain why one finds an enormous over-representation of ICEs in some clades whereas in cyanobacteria we find more conjugative plasmids. Looking at the evolutionary relationships between ICEs and conjugative plasmids, we observed a close interplay between them in that the deepest clades in the VirB4 tree contain both types of elements. This strongly suggests that plasmids often become ICEs, and/or vice-versa. A plasmid might become an ICE upon acquisition of an integrase, e. g. from a phage, a genomic island or another ICE, although this is not strictly necessary, as documented in the Introduction. In fact, many plasmids contain some type of recombinase that could mediate site-specific integration or some type of DNA repeats that might allow integration by homologous recombination. Conversely, an ICE might become a plasmid upon acquisition of a REP system. Interestingly, some ICEs do contain REP systems( e. g. ICEBs1[29]). In conclusion, our results suggest that plasmids and ICEs might be just the two faces shown by a very similar type of element. One can speculate that plasmids disseminate to bacterial species in which they can replicate and to others in which they cannot. If the selection pressure for the presence of the element is high enough, the preservation of the element might be favored by its integration in the chromosome. This process can occur forwards and backwards so that we do not observe a terminal specialization between both types of element for some time. But certainly some ICEs end up stabilizing as chromosomal structures that remain as such for evolutionary long periods of time. What are the circumstances that drive them one way or another is a relevant question that remains to be answered.","answer":"Some mobile genetic elements spread genetic information horizontally between prokaryotes by conjugation , a mechanism by which DNA is transferred directly from one cell to the other .

The authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin. Despite the underlying diseases, the prognosis for drug-induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs. The gamma-aminobutyric acid-transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy. Because drug-induced de novo absence seizure is rare, pro-absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor. The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure. The possibility of drug-induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in seizure frequency and/or new seizure types appear following a change in drug treatment. By understanding the underlying mechanism of absence epilepsy, we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with epilepsy and prevent drug-induced absence seizures.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"carbamazepine\\", \\"vigabatrin\\", \\"gamma-aminobutyric acid\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"epileptic\\", \\"absence seizures\\", \\"epilepsy\\", \\"absence epilepsy\\", \\"seizure\\", \\"absence seizure\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

All participants were asked to perform a golf-putting task . Results indicated that participants who implemented several ( PET 's ) increased their putting accuracy across overall difference score evaluations F ( 8 , 141 ) = 4.01 , p < 0.05 when compared to a no instruction control condition . Follow-up analyses indicated that participants who reportedly engaged in ten hours or less of athletic activities per week preferred self-talk strategies F ( 2 , 119 ) = 4.38 , p < 0.05 whereas participants who endorsed ten hours or more of athletic activity per week preferred imagery strategies F ( 2 , 25 ) = 5.27 , p < 0.05 . Key PointsMental imagery and self-talk strategies are implemented by athletes in order to regulate arousal , reduce maladaptive behaviors , reconstruct negative thoughts , and to increase one 's concentration and focus . Results of the current study suggest that participants who engaged in several performance enhancement techniques exhibited enhanced performance on a golf putting task when compared to participants in a control condition . Participants who endorsed limited athletic familiarity and activity ( e.g. , ten hours or less ) preferred self-talk practice whereas participants who endorsed higher ratings scores of athletic familiarity and activity ( e.g. , ten hours or more ) preferred imagery strategies .

BACKGROUND/AIMS Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases . An increasing number of people undergo different treatment options . Unfortunately , H. pylori therapy may be troublesome for drug side effects and inefficacious for resistance to antibiotics . METHODOLOGY One hundred and ninety-three ( 193 ) H. pylori-positive patients were randomly assigned to one of the following 7-day treatments : Group A ( N = 64 ) : amoxicillin , clarithromycin and rabeprazole ; Group B ( N = 64 ) : tinidazole , clarithromycin and ranitidine bismuth citrate ; Group C ( N = 65 ) : tinidazole , clarithromycin and rabeprazole Eradication was assessed by 13C-Urea Breath Test 6-8 weeks after the end of the therapy . Not-eradicated patients underwent a second cycle with tinidazole , tetracycline , bismuth and rabeprazole . All patients were asked to complete a validated questionnaire regarding presence and intensity of drug side effects . RESULTS One hundred and eighty-eight out of the 193 H. pylori-positive patients ( 96 % ) completed therapy . No significant difference in eradication rates was observed among the three groups both in intention to treat analysis and in per protocol analysis . No significant difference in incidence of side effects occurred among groups after the first-line regimens : 48 % in group A , 44 % in group B and 46 % in group C. Twenty-two out of the 193 enrolled subjects ( 11 % ) were not eradicated after the first-line therapy . Among them , 86 % were successfully eradicated by the tinidazole , tetracycline , bismuth and rabeprazole therapy . Moreover , during quadruple therapy , a higher prevalence and intensity of side effects than in each one of the groups submitted to the first-line triple therapy was observed . CONCLUSIONS This study shows that triple rabeprazole-based eradicating regimens are effective and safe . Incidence of side effects seems low and similar in different three-drug regimens used . Quadruple therapy , which appear highly efficacious as a second line therapy , is associated with a significantly higher incidence of side effects when compared to first-line treatment .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"antibiotics\\", \\"tinidazole , clarithromycin and ranitidine bismuth citrate\\", \\"tinidazole , tetracycline , bismuth\\", \\"amoxicillin , clarithromycin and rabeprazole\\", \\"triple rabeprazole-based eradicating regimens\\", \\"tinidazole , clarithromycin and rabeprazole\\", \\"Quadruple therapy\\", \\"tinidazole , tetracycline , bismuth and rabeprazole\\", \\"rabeprazole\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"eradication rates\\", \\"effective and safe .\\", \\"Efficacy and tolerability\\", \\"prevalence and intensity of side effects\\", \\"eradicated\\", \\"side effects\\", \\"incidence of side effects\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"64 )\\", \\"H. pylori-positive patients\\", \\"Group B\\", \\"Group A\\", \\"64\\", \\"Group C\\", \\"65\\", \\"One hundred and ninety-three ( 193 )\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

The mechanisms underlying mesenchymal stem cells' (MSC) suppressive potency are largely unknown. We here show that highly suppressive human adipose tissue-derived MSC (AdMSC) display and induce a differential immunologic profile, upon ongoing AdMSC suppressive activity, promoting: (i) early correlated inhibition of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production, along IL-10 increase, (ii) CD73+Foxp3+Treg subset expansion, and (iii) specific correlations between gene expression increases, such as: MMP9 correlated with CCL22, TNF, FASL, RUNX3, and SEMAD4 in AdMSC and, in T cells, MMP9 upregulation correlated with CCR4, IL4 and TBX21, among others, whereas MMP2 correlated with BCL2 and LRRC31. MMP9 emerged as an integrating molecule for both AdMSC and T cells in molecular networks built with our gene expression data, and we confirmed upregulation of MMP9 and MMP2 at the protein level, in AdMSC and T cells, respectively. MMP2/9 inhibition significantly decreased AdMSC suppressive effect, confirming their important role in suppressive acitivity. We conclude that MMP9 and 2 are robust new players involved in human MSC immunoregulatory mechanisms, and the higher suppressive activity correlates to their capacity to trigger a coordinated action of multiple specific molecules, mobilizing various immunoregulatory mechanisms.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"MMP2\\", \\"Foxp3\\", \\"IL4\\", \\"CCR4\\", \\"RUNX3\\", \\"IFN-gamma\\", \\"TNF-alpha\\", \\"MMP2/9\\", \\"BCL2\\", \\"SEMAD4\\", \\"CCL22\\", \\"TBX21\\", \\"MMP9\\", \\"FASL\\", \\"MMP9 and 2\\", \\"TNF\\", \\"LRRC31\\", \\"IL-10\\", \\"CD73\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

In cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Thus, in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. While postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"alpha,beta-meATP\\", \\"isoprenaline\\", \\"carbachol\\", \\"alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5u0027-triphosphate\\", \\"ATP\\", \\"atropine\\", \\"4-DAMP\\", \\"potassium\\", \\"pirenzepine\\", \\"cyclophosphamide\\", \\"methoctramine\\", \\"4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"cystitis\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Mutations resulting in defective splicing constitute a significant proportion (30/62 [48%]) of a new series of mutations in the ATM gene in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) that were detected by the protein-truncation assay followed by sequence analysis of genomic DNA. Fewer than half of the splicing mutations involved the canonical AG splice-acceptor site or GT splice-donor site. A higher percentage of mutations occurred at less stringently conserved sites, including silent mutations of the last nucleotide of exons, mutations in nucleotides other than the conserved AG and GT in the consensus splice sites, and creation of splice-acceptor or splice-donor sites in either introns or exons. These splicing mutations led to a variety of consequences, including exon skipping and, to a lesser degree, intron retention, activation of cryptic splice sites, or creation of new splice sites. In addition, 5 of 12 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation were associated with deletion in the cDNA of the exons in which the mutations occurred. No ATM protein was detected by western blotting in any AT cell line in which splicing mutations were identified. Several cases of exon skipping in both normal controls and patients for whom no underlying defect could be found in genomic DNA were also observed, suggesting caution in the interpretation of exon deletions observed in ATM cDNA when there is no accompanying identification of genomic mutations..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"ataxia-telangiectasia\\", \\"AT\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

It is composed of a cytoplasmic structure resembling the tail of contractile bacteriophages anchored to the cell envelope through a membrane complex composed of the TssL and TssM inner membrane proteins and of the TssJ outer membrane lipoprotein. The C-terminal domain of TssM is required for its interaction with TssJ, and for the function of the T6SS. In Citrobacter rodentium, the tssM1 gene does not encode the C-terminal domain. However, the stop codon is preceded by a run of 11 consecutive adenosines. In this study, we demonstrate that this poly-A tract is a transcriptional slippery site that induces the incorporation of additional adenosines, leading to frameshifting, and hence the production of two TssM1 variants, including a full-length canonical protein. We show that both forms of TssM1, and the ratio between these two forms, are required for the function of the T6SS in C. rodentium. Finally, we demonstrate that the tssM gene associated with the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis T6SS-3 gene cluster is also subjected to transcriptional frameshifting.Introduction:The Type VI secretion system( T6SS) is a macromolecular machine widespread in proteobacteria that delivers protein toxins into either eukaryotic or bacterial cells[1]–[5]. The Vibrio cholerae T6SS has been shown to inject an effector domain carrying actin cross-linking activity into eukaryotic cells, preventing cytoskeleton rearrangements and allowing the bacteria to escape phagocytosis[6]–[8]. More recently, a number of T6SSs including those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, V. cholerae, Serratia marcescens, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium have been shown to play antagonistic roles in interbacterial competition including competition occuring during host colonization[5],[9]–[13]. Bacterial preys are killed through the actions of toxins that bear peptidoglycan hydrolase, phospholipase or DNase activities[13]–[15]. For toxin delivery, the T6SS is thought to use a dynamic mechanism resembling that of contractile tailed bacteriophages[3],[4],[16]–[18]. Recent cryo-electron microscopy experiments demonstrated that the T6SS is composed of a cytoplasmic tubular structure anchored to the cell envelope by a membrane complex[18]. The tubular structure is structurally and mechanistically similar to the tail of bacteriophages: the Hcp protein forms hexameric rings that stack on each other to assemble a tube resembling the internal tube of phages and tipped by a trimer of VgrG, which shares a fold similar to the trimeric bacteriophage gp27-gp5 hub – or cell-puncturing – complex[16],[19]–[21]. This internal tube is wrapped into a structure composed of the TssB and TssC subunits[18],[22]. This structure has been shown to be dynamic, as TssB proteins fused to the super-folder Green Fluorescent Protein( sfGFP) form long filaments that cycle between extended and contracted conformations, a mechanism reminiscent of bacteriophage sheaths[18],[23]–[25]. The current model proposes that the mode of action of the T6SS is comparable to that of a crossbow[2]–[4]: the sheath assembles around the Hcp internal tube into an extended conformation. Upon contraction, the internal tube will be propelled towards the target cell allowing the VgrG protein to puncture the host cell and effector delivery. Indeed, recent studies have shown that contraction of the T6SS sheath-like structure coincides with killing of the target bacterial prey[23]–[25]. This “phage-related” complex is anchored to the cell envelope through interactions with membrane components. This membrane complex is composed of the TssL and TssM inner membrane proteins and the TssJ outer membrane lipoprotein[3],[4],[26],[27]. TssM is constituted of three trans-membrane helices with a large C-terminal domain of ∼750 residues protruding into the periplasm[28],[29]. TssM is a central component as it interacts with both TssL and TssJ[28],[29]. The interaction with TssJ has been characterized and involves contacts between a specific loop of the lipoprotein and the 150 last residues of TssM[29]. This interaction is critical for T6SS function as disruption of the TssM-TssJ interaction abolishes Hcp release in the culture supernatant[29]. Although this C-terminal region of TssM is an essential determinant of T6SS function, the TssM protein encoded within the CTS1 T6SS gene cluster of C. rodentium, TssM1, is lacking this domain. However, this T6SS is functional as shown by its ability to release the Hcp1 protein in the culture supernatant and to mediate interbacterial killing[30]. Sequence analysis of the tssM1 gene showed that the stop codon is preceded by a poly-adenosine sequence constituted of eleven consecutive adenosine residues[30],[31]. Poly-A runs have been previously shown to be slippery sites for the RNA polymerase that cause frameshifting by the incorporation of additional adenosine bases into the mRNA during transcription[32]–[35]. Here, using a combination of Western-blot, GFP fluorescence and mass spectrometry analyses, we demonstrate that transcriptional frameshifting occurs at the tssM1 poly-A run, yielding two TssM1 size variants. We further demonstrate using Hcp secretion and antibacterial competition assays that both forms of TssM1 are required for efficient Type VI secretion in C. rodentium. The frequency of frameshifting is ∼20–25% and therefore yields a molecular ratio of 3–4∶1 between the truncated and the full-length variants. This ratio between the two forms is critical as inverting this ratio leads to a non-functional T6SS apparatus. Finally, we show that a similar frameshiting mechanism occurs in the tssM gene associated with the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis T6SS-3 gene cluster.Discussion:In this work, we showed that the sequence of one essential gene of the C. rodentium CTS1 T6SS is disrupted by an early stop codon yielding a 88-kDa truncated protein, TssM1[1–807], that lacks a large part of the C-terminal domain required for interaction with other components of the secretion machine; however, we demonstrated that the full-length 125-kDa TssM1 protein is produced during growth. We further demonstrated that transcriptional frameshifting occurs at a slippery site constituted of 11 consecutive adenosine residues, located a few bases upstream the premature stop codon, that induces RNA polymerase infidelity and realignment. This mechanism, although unusual, is not unprecedented. Several examples of RNA editing have been described in viruses, eukaryotes and prokaryotes[33]–[35],[38]–[41]. Frameshifting is particularly frequent in bacteriophages and bacterial insertion sequence( IS) elements[33]–[35]. Well-studied cases are the phage G gene which encodes two tail proteins, gpG and gpGT, gpGT arising from translational frameshifting[42],[43] and the dnaX gene, which encodes the τ and γ subunits of DNA polymerase III[37],[44]. One striking example is the fusion between pgk and tim, two different genes that can be fused by transcriptional frameshifting at the 3′ end of pgk, yielding a bifunctional chimera protein[38]. The overrepresentation of slippery sites in viruses and bacterial endosymbiots of insects, which have the smallest genomes, suggests that this mechanism helps to condense protein coding in compact genomes[35],[40]. Interestingly, examples of transcriptional frameshifting have been identified in other bacterial secretion systems such as the Shigella flexneri Type III secretion system( T3SS), a machinery that mediates entry of the bacterium into epithelial cells. Slippery sites that induce RNA polymerase infidelity have been identified and characterized in the mxiE gene that encodes a transcriptional activator of this system as well as in three genes encoding structural components of the T3SS, mxiA, spa13 and spa33[45],[46]. The efficiency of the tssM1 frameshifting was shown to be ∼20-25% leading to a molecular ratio of 3–4∶1 of TssM1[1–807] to TssM1-FL. A similar frequency was measured for Y. pseudotuberculosis tssM3. These frequencies are comparable to those measured for transcriptional slippage of the Shigella flexneri mxiA( 15%), mxiE( 20–30%), and spa33( 15%) genes and lower than those measured in the case of spa13( 55%)[45],[46]. In this study, we have measured the slipppage efficiencies during growth in rich medium( LB). It would be interesting to test whether the slippage frequency is impacted by the growth conditions or by regulatory elements, such as bacteriophage λ N protein, recently shown to influence transcriptional realignment by stabilizing the RNA/DNA hybrid in the RNA polymerase[47]. Using complementation assays, we further showed that both forms of TssM1 are required for T6SS function. Although further experiments are required to better understand what is the specific function of each of these two variants, this situation is reminiscent to that of the phage lambda G gene, in which both gpG and gpGT variants are required for efficient assembly of functional tails[48]. In this later case, it was shown that the ratio between gpG and gpGT is also important for formation of phage tails[48]. Similarly, we observed that the ratio between the two TssM1 variants is critical for maintaining a functional CTS1 T6SS. In the natural situation, the shorter variant( TssM1[1–807]) is 3-4 times more abundant than the full-length variant. Inversion of the ratio between the two forms abolishes the function of the CTS1 T6SS. One additional intriguing result is the observation that a third TssM1 variant of ∼40 kDa, truncated of the N-terminal region, is immunodetected by the C-terminal 6×His epitope( see * in Fig. 2B). This variant therefore corresponds to the C-terminal portion of the TssM1 80-kDa periplasmic domain that is likely retained into the cytoplasm. This variant might be produced from an internal start codon( although sequence analyses did not identify a potential ribosome binding site or an internal start codon) or might result from a proteolytic processing. Experiments are currently carried out to determine how this third variant is produced and to define whether it is necessary for proper assembly or function of the CTS1 T6SS. Bioinformatic analyses of the T6SS-associated tssM genes showed that transcriptional slippery sites are not common as we only identified the tssM3 gene from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis with a poly-A run. Western-blot and fluorescence studies further demonstrated that this site is active as two TssM3 length variants are produced. Slippage occurs with a frequency comparable to that of the C. rodentium tssM1 situation. Although we have not tested whether these two variants are required for function of the apparatus, it is worthy to note that transcriptional frameshifting in Y. pseudotuberculosis tssM3 leads to synthesis of a shorter protein whereas C. rodentium tssM1 slippage leads to synthesis of the full-length protein. As a consequence, and in contrast to C. rodentium tssM1, the ratio is in favor of the full-length variant. This is particularly intriguing as our data showed that the ratio between the two variants in C. rodentium is critical for the function of the apparatus, and it further suggests that the ratio between the two variants is tailored to fit specific needs during assembly and/or function of the T6SS in different bacteria. In the vast majority of T6SS-associated tssM genes, no slippery site can be identified, suggesting that only the full-length protein is produced. However, stable TssM degradation products of ∼85-kDa have been observed by Western-blot analyses of total extracts of WT cells producing TssM in Agrobacterium tumefaciens[28] and in enteroaggregative E. coli. In these cases, two forms of TssM are therefore produced, the shorter being the result of a degradation mechanism. This observation is particularly fascinating and further experiments are required to understand whether this degradation is a controlled process, whether it is conserved in all TssM proteins, and whether the degradation product is important for the function of the T6SS machines in these bacteria.","answer":"Nonstandard decoding mechanisms lead to the synthesis of different protein variants from a single DNA sequence .

A list of paragraphs is provided as context to help you answer the question.Question: Is Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?Context: In the Matrigel invasion assay, knockdown of CCR1 and inhibition of the ERK and Rac signaling pathways significantly decreased the number of invading cells.These results demonstrated for the first time that the interaction of CCR1 with CCL5 caused by increased expression of CCR1 promotes invasion of PC3PR cells by increasing secretion of MMPs 2 and 9 and by activating ERK and Rac signaling.These data suggest that P-Rex1 has an influence on physiological migratory processes, such as invasion of cancer cells, both through effects upon classical Rac1-driven motility and a novel association with RTK signalling complexes.Activated PAR1 induced RhoA and Rac1 phosphorylation, and subsequent overexpression of myosin IIA and filamin B which are stress fiber components that were identified by PMF analysis of peptide mass data obtained by MALDI-TOF/MS measurement.These results demonstrate that PAR1 activation induces cell morphological change associated with cell motility via Rho family activation and cytoskeletal protein overexpression, and has a critical role in gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis.Rac1 was found to be required for actopaxin-induced matrix degradation whereas inhibition of myosin contractility promoted degradation in the phosphomutant-expressing Quint cells, indicating that a balance of Rho GTPase signaling and regulation of cellular tension are important for the process.Taken together, this study demonstrates a new role for actopaxin phosphorylation in matrix degradation and cell invasion via regulation of Rho GTPase signaling.BART inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion by Rac1 inactivation through direct binding to active Rac1We report that Binder of Arl Two (BART) plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells.BART interacts with active forms of Rac1, and the BART-Rac1 complex localizes at the leading edges of migrating cancer cells. Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in which BART is stably knocked down with a Rac1 inhibitor decreases invasiveness. Thus, BART-dependent inhibition of cell invasion is likely associated with decreased active Rac1.The Rac1 inhibitor inhibits the lamellipodia formation that is stimulated by suppression of BART.Our results imply that BART regulates actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements at membrane ruffles through modulation of the activity of Rac1, which, in turn, inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion.It has been reported as an important inducer of cancer cell migration and invasion, with underlying molecular mechanisms involving the signalling mediated by its juxtamembrane domain, the secretion of matrix metalloproteases to the extracellular media, and the cleavage of a P-cadherin soluble form with pro-invasive activity. Intracellularly, this protein interferes with the endogenous cadherin/catenin complex, inducing p120-catenin delocalization to the cytoplasm, and the consequent activation of Rac1/Cdc42 and associated alterations in the actin cytoskeleton.Targeted down-regulation of RhoC led to sustained activation of Rac1 GTPase and morphological, molecular and phenotypic changes reminiscent of epithelial to mesenchymal transition.We also find that Rac1 GTPase mediates tight binding of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells and promotes retraction of endothelial cells required for tumor cell diapedesis.Finally, Rac1 leads to β1 integrin activation, suggesting a mechanism that Rac1 can mediate tight binding with endothelial cells.Together, our data suggest that Rac1 GTPase is key mediator of prostate cancer cell-bone marrow endothelial cell interactions.Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Rac1 (T17N) could largely block EGF-induced PI3K/Akt-PAK1 activation and cell migration.Our study demonstrated that EGF-induced cell migration involves a cascade of signalling events, including activation of Rac1, generation of ROS and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and PAK1.Small GTPase proteins, including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, and cdc42, are important molecules for linking cell shape and cell-cycle progression because of their role in both cytoskeletal arrangements and mitogenic signaling.The suppression of MMP-2 expression by CTXG led to an inhibition of SW620 cells invasion and migration by inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA GTPase.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CTXG exerted anti-invasion action in SW620 cells by targeting MMP-2 though regulating the activities of Rac1, Cdc42 and their downstream transcriptional factor AP-1.ctivation of H-Ras and Rac1 correlates with epidermal growth factor-induced invasion in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cellsWe have previously shown that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces an invasive phenotype mediated by small GTPase Rac1 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells.Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells.Our data demonstrate that the activation of H-Ras and the downstream molecule Rac1 correlates with EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion, providing important information on the regulation of malignant progression in mammary carcinoma cells.At 50% growth-inhibiting concentration, icariin significantly suppressed tumor cells migration and invasion, which were traceable to down-regulation of Rac1 and VASP.These results indicate that icariin exerts negative effects on tumor cell invasion and migration via the Rac1-dependent VASP pathway and may be a potential anti-cancer drug.RhoGDI2 modulates the invasiveness and metastatic ability of cancer cells through regulation of Rac1 activity.We also showed that GBM cells secrete Sema3A endogenously, and RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Sema3A inhibits migration and alters cell morphology that is dependent on Rac1 activity.LMO1 and Dock180, a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promote human glioma cell invasionHere, we report for the first time that engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) and dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180), a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), are evidently linked to the invasive phenotype of glioma cells.Inhibition of endogenous ELMO1 and Dock180 expression significantly impeded glioma cell invasion in vitro and in brain tissue slices with a concomitant reduction in Rac1 activation.Members of the Rac family of small GTPases are known to act as regulators of actin cytoskeletal structures and strongly influence the cellular processes of integrin-mediated adhesion and migration. Even though hyperactivated Rac proteins have been shown to influence metastatic processes, these proteins have never been directly linked to metastatic progression.We show that increased activation of Rac proteins directly correlates with increasing metastatic potential in a panel of cell variants derived from a single metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435).Expression of a dominant active Rac1 or a dominant active Rac3 resulted in a more invasive and motile phenotype.Moreover, expression of either dominant negative Rac1 or dominant negative Rac3 into the most metastatic cell variant resulted in decreased invasive and motile properties.This study correlates endogenous Rac activity with high metastatic potential and implicates Rac in the regulation of cell migration and invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest a role for both the Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases in human breast cancer progression.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine worldwide trends of four emotions-fear, anger, sadness, and joy-and the narratives underlying those emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Over 20 million social media twitter posts made during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak from January 28 to April 9, 2020, were collected using \\"wuhan,\\" \\"corona,\\" \\"nCov,\\" and \\"covid\\" as search keywords. RESULTS: Public emotions shifted strongly from fear to anger over the course of the pandemic, while sadness and joy also surfaced. Findings from word clouds suggest that fears around shortages of COVID-19 tests and medical supplies became increasingly widespread discussion points. Anger shifted from xenophobia at the beginning of the pandemic to discourse around the stay-at-home notices. Sadness was highlighted by the topics of losing friends and family members, while topics related to joy included words of gratitude and good health. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, global COVID-19 sentiments have shown rapid evolutions within just the span of a few weeks. Findings suggest that emotion-driven collective issues around shared public distress experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic are developing and include large-scale social isolation and the loss of human lives. The steady rise of societal concerns indicated by negative emotions needs to be monitored and controlled by complementing regular crisis communication with strategic public health communication that aims to balance public psychological wellbeing.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

In 2007, an outbreak in the Federated States of Micronesia sparked public health concern. In 2013, the virus began to spread across other parts of Oceania and in 2015, a large outbreak in Latin America began in Brazil. Possible associations with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome observed in this outbreak have raised concerns about continued global spread of Zika virus, prompting its declaration as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. We conducted species distribution modelling to map environmental suitability for Zika. We show a large portion of tropical and sub-tropical regions globally have suitable environmental conditions with over 2. 17 billion people inhabiting these areas.Introduction:Zika virus( ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus carried by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes( Musso et al., 2014). Although discovered in Uganda in 1947( Dick et al., 1952; Dick, 1953) ZIKV was only known to cause sporadic infections in humans in Africa and Asia until 2007( Lanciotti et al., 2008), when it caused a large outbreak of symptomatic cases on Yap island in the Federated States of Micronesia( FSM), followed by another in French Polynesia in 2013–14 and subsequent spread across Oceania( Musso et al., 2015a). In the 2007 Yap island outbreak, it was estimated that approximately 20% of ZIKV cases were symptomatic. While indigenous transmission of ZIKV to humans was reported for the first time in Latin America in 2015( Zanluca et al., 2015; World Health Organisation, 2015), recent phylogeographic research estimates that the virus was introduced into the region between May and December 2013( Faria et al., 2016). This recent rapid spread has led to concern that the virus is following a similar pattern of global expansion to that of dengue and chikungunya( Musso et al., 2015a). ZIKV has been isolated from 19 different Aedes species( Haddow et al., 2012; Grard et al., 2014), but virus has been most frequently found in Ae. aegypti( Monlun et al., 1992; Marchette et al., 1969; Smithburn, 1954; Pond, 1963; Faye et al., 2008; Foy et al., 2011b; WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Arboviruses and Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses: Annual Report, 1999). These studies were based upon ancestral African strains of ZIKV, but the current rapid spread of ZIKV in Latin America is indicative of this highly efficient arbovirus vector( Marcondes and Ximenes, 2015). The relatively recent global spread of Ae. albopictus( Benedict et al., 2007; Kraemer et al., 2015c) and the rarity of ZIKV isolations from wild mosquitoes may also partially explain the lower frequency of isolations from Ae. albopictus populations. Whilst virus transmission by Ae. albopictus and other minor vector species has normally resulted in only a small number of cases( Kutsuna et al., 2015; Roiz et al., 2015), these vectors do pose the threat of limited transmission( Grard et al., 2014). The wide geographic distribution of Ae. albopictus combined with the frequent virus introduction via viraemic travellers( McCarthy 2016; Bogoch et al., 2016; Morrison et al., 2008; Scott and Takken, 2012), means the risk for ZIKV infection via this vector must therefore also be considered in ZIKV mapping. The fact that ZIKV reporting was limited to a few small areas in Africa and Asia until 2007 means that global risk mapping has not, until recently, been a priority( Pigott et al., 2015b). Recent associations with Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and microcephaly in infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers( World Health Organisation, 2015; Martines et al., 2016) have revealed that ZIKV could lead to more severe complications than the mild rash and flu-like symptoms that characterize the majority of symptomatic cases( Gatherer and Kohl, 2016). Considering these potentially severe complications and the rapid expansion of ZIKV into previously unaffected areas, the global public health community needs information about those areas that are environmentally suitable for transmission of ZIKV to humans. Being a closely related flavivirus to DENV, there is furthermore the potential for antigen-based diagnostic tests to exhibit cross-reactivity when IgM ELISA is used for rapid diagnosis. Although ZIKV-specific serologic assays are being developed by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control, currently the only method of confirming ZIKV infection is by using PCR on acute specimens( Lanciotti et al., 2008, Faye et al., 2008). Awareness of suitability for transmission is essential if proper detection methods are to be employed. In this paper, we use species distribution modelling techniques that have been useful for mapping other vector-borne diseases such as dengue( Bhatt et al., 2013), Leishmaniasis( Pigott et al., 2014b), and Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever( Messina et al., 2015b) to map environmental suitability for ZIKV. The environmental niche of a disease can be identified according to a combination of environmental conditions supporting its presence in a particular location, with statistical modelling then allowing this niche to be described quantitatively( Kraemer et al., 2016). Niche modelling uses records of known disease occurrence alongside hypothesized environmental covariates to predict suitability for disease transmission in regions where it has yet to be reported( Elith and Leathwick, 2009). Contemporary high spatial-resolution global data representing a variety of environmental conditions allows for these predictions to be made at a global scale( Hay et al., 2006).Discussion:In this study, we produced the first global high spatial-resolution map of environmental suitability for ZIKV transmission to humans using an assembly of known records of ZIKV occurrence and environmental covariates in a species distribution modelling framework. While it is clear that much remains to be understood about ZIKV, this first map serves as a baseline for understanding the change in the geographical distribution of this globally emerging arboviral disease. Knowledge of the potential distribution can encourage more vigilant surveillance in both humans and Aedes mosquito populations, as well as help in the allocation of limited resources for disease prevention. Public health awareness campaigns and advice for mitigation of individual risk can also be focused in the areas we have predicted to be highly suitable for ZIKV transmission, particularly during the first wave of infection in a population. The maps we have presented may also inform existing travel advisories for pregnant women and other travellers. The maps and underlying data are freely available online via figshare( http://www. figshare. com).","answer":"Zika virus is transmitted between humans by mosquitoes .

Promoter sequences responsive to cyclic AMP (cAMP) are found in a number of cellular genes, and bind transcription factors of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) / activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1) family. We have used a human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) model of cAMP response element (CRE) transcription to investigate the influence of lymphocyte activation on transcription from homologous regions in the viral promoter. We previously demonstrated increased HTLV-1 transcription following CD2 but not CD3 receptor cross-linking. We hypothesized that this increased viral transcription was mediated, in part, through the phosphorylation of CREB. Therefore, we investigated CD2 and CD3 receptor-mediated signalling in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CD2, but not CD3, cross-linking increased cAMP detected by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approximately fourfold. CD2 cross-linking concurrently increased phosphorylation of CREB detected by immunoblot assay eightfold. Consistent with post-translational regulation, no change in total level of CREB protein was observed. Phosphorylation of CREB occurred through a herbimycin A and Rp-cAMP-sensitive pathway, suggesting phosphorylation required antecedent activation of both protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and protein kinase A (PKA). Both CD2 and CD3 cross-linking increased binding of nuclear proteins to a radiolabelled CRE oligonucleotide probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggesting that lymphocyte activation enhances binding independently of phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133. These data indicate specific modulation of the CREB / ATF-1 family of transcription factors by the CD2 signalling pathway and suggest CD2 receptor modulation of CRE-mediated transcription following ligand engagement (e. g. cell-to-cell contact).","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"PBMC\\", \\"primary lymphocytes\\", \\"primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"CRE\\", \\"viral promoter\\", \\"cellular genes\\", \\"cAMP response element\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"CREB / ATF - 1 family\\", \\"PKA\\", \\"CD2\\", \\"transcription factors\\", \\"protein kinase A\\", \\"nuclear proteins\\", \\"CREB\\", \\"protein tyrosine kinases\\", \\"cAMP response element binding protein\\", \\"CD3\\", \\"CD3 receptor\\", \\"PTK\\", \\"CREB) / activating transcription factor - 1 (ATF - 1) family\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Radiation modulates both tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to exert its anti-tumor activity; however, the molecular connection between tumor cells and immune cells that mediates radiation-exerted tumor suppression activity in the tumor microenvironment is largely unknown. We report here that radiation induces rapid activation of the p65/p50 and p50/p50 NF-κB complexes in human soft tissue sarcoma (STS) cells. Radiation-activated p65/p50 and p50/p50 bind to the TNFα promoter to activate its transcription in STS cells. Radiation-induced TNFα induces tumor cell death in an autocrine manner. A sublethal dose of Smac mimetic BV6 induces cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation to increase tumor cell sensitivity to radiation-induced cell death in vitro and to enhance radiation-mediated suppression of STS xenografts in vivo. Inhibition of caspases, RIP1, or RIP3 blocks radiation/TNFα-induced cell death, whereas inhibition of RIP1 blocks TNFα-induced caspase activation, suggesting that caspases and RIP1 act sequentially to mediate the non-compensatory cell death pathways. Furthermore, we determined in a syngeneic sarcoma mouse model that radiation up-regulates IRF3, IFNβ, and the T cell chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 in the tumor microenvironment, which are associated with activation and increased infiltration of Th1/Tc1 T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, tumor-infiltrating T cells are in their active form since both the perforin and FasL pathways are activated in irradiated tumor tissues. Consequently, combined BV6 and radiation completely suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, radiation-induced NF-κB functions as a molecular link between tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment for radiation-mediated tumor suppression.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"CCL5\\", \\"p50\\", \\"cIAP1\\", \\"RIP3\\", \\"cIAP2\\", \\"FasL\\", \\"CCL2\\", \\"IFNu03b2\\", \\"NF-u03baB\\", \\"p65\\", \\"TNFu03b1\\", \\"caspase\\", \\"IRF3\\", \\"caspases\\", \\"RIP1\\", \\"perforin\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

In the Middle East, the first confirmed case in both Iran and UAE originated from China. A series of infections since those confirmed cases started in the Middle East originated from Qom, Iran, and other Shi'ite holy places. Thereafter, CoVID-19 has been transmitted to other countries in the Middle East. This report aims to trace all of the confirmed cases in the Middle East until March 6, 2020 and their further spread. This report proves that further transmission of CoVID-19 to the Middle East was because of human mobility, besides engaging in different Jewish and Shi'ite religious rites.

PFOS and PFOA were dissolved in methanol (carrier vehicle) whose concentration never exceeded 0.01% of total tank volume. Samples were collected at day 21, 28, 35, 52, 49 and 56 after the start of the exposure. Note that days 49 and 56 represent end of exposure and 1 week after a recovery period, respectively. Tissue bioaccumulations were determined by HPLC/MS/MS, steroid hormones, fatty acids (FAs) and lipids were determined by GC-MS, while mRNA expression levels of genes were determined by qPCR in whole body homogenate. We observed that PFOS and PFOA showed a steady increase in whole body burden during the exposure period, with a slight decrease after the recovery period. Calculated somatic indexes showed that PFOA produced increases in heart-, thymus-, liver- and kidney somatic indexes (HSI, TSI, LSI and KSI). PFOA and PFOS exposure produced significant decreases in whole body dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), estrone and testosterone at sampling day 21 and a strong increase of cortisol and cholesterol at the end of recovery period (day 56). PFOA and PFOS effects differed with DHEA and estrone. While PFOS decreased DHEA levels, PFOA produced an increase at day 49, and while PFOS decreased estrone, PFOA produced a slight increase at day 56. We observed changes in FA composition that predominantly involved increases in FA methyl esters (FAMEs), mono- and poly-unsaturated FA (MUFA and PUFA) and a decrease in n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio by both PFOA and PFOS. Particularly, an increase in - pentadecenoic MUFA (15:1), two n-3 PUFAs α-linolenic acid [ALA: 18:3 n3] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA: 20:5 n-3] and n-6 PUFA: arachidonic acid [ARA: 20:4 n6], docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) by PFOA and PFOS were observed. These effects were associated with changes in mRNA expression of FA elongase (FAE), Δ5-desaturase (FAD5) and Δ6-desaturase (FAD6) genes. In summary, the changes in hormonal and FA profiles may represent cellular and/or physiological adaptation to continuous PFOS and PFOA exposure by increasing membrane fluidity, and/or overt developmental effects. The present findings provide some potential insights and basis for a better understanding on the possible mechanisms of PFCs toxicity in fish.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"cortisol\\", \\"dehydroepiandrosterone\\", \\"arachidonic acid\\", \\"methanol\\", \\"MUFA\\", \\"EPA\\", \\"FA methyl esters\\", \\"PFOA\\", \\"DPA\\", \\"fatty acids\\", \\"pentadecenoic MUFA\\", \\"steroid\\", \\"perfluorooctane sulfonic or perfluorooctane carboxylic acids\\", \\"DHEA\\", \\"FAs\\", \\"estrone\\", \\"eicosapentaenoic acid\\", \\"FAMEs\\", \\"docosapentaenoic acid\\", \\"cholesterol\\", \\"mono- and poly-unsaturated FA\\", \\"u03b1-linolenic acid\\", \\"ARA\\", \\"ALA\\", \\"PUFAs\\", \\"PFOS\\", \\"testosterone\\", \\"PUFA\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"u03945-desaturase\\", \\"u03946-desaturase\\", \\"FAE\\", \\"FA elongase\\", \\"FAD5\\", \\"FAD6\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

The aim of this phase II study was to determine the activity and toxicity of paclitaxel (administered by 1-h infusion) and carboplatin in advanced non-small cell lung cancer when used in a multicentre, community-based treatment setting. 100 chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer were treated between March 1995 and February 1996. All patients had Karnofsky performance status 70-100, measurable disease and adequate bone marrow, kidney and liver function. All patients received intravenous (i.v.) paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 by 1-h infusion followed immediately by carboplatin at a targeted area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of 6.0 using the Calvert formula. Courses were repeated every 21 days. Colony stimulating factors were not used routinely. 38 of 94 evaluable patients (40%) had objective responses to treatment (3 complete responses, 35 partial responses). An additional 32 patients had stable disease at initial re-evaluation. Weight gain during treatment was experienced by 47% of patients with objective response or stable disease. The median survival in this group of 100 patients was 8 months, with an actuarial 1-year survival of 42%. Leucopenia was common, but hospitalisation for treatment of neutropenia and fever occurred in only 3% of courses. Cumulative peripheral neuropathy was common, but usually appeared after the third or fourth course and was severe (grade 3) in only 15% of patients. Other grade 3 and 4 toxicity was uncommon. There was one treatment-related death due to sepsis. This large multicentre community-based phase II trial demonstrated the efficacy of paclitaxel and carboplatin combination chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. When paclitaxel is given by 1-h infusion, this regimen is easily administered in the outpatient setting.sentence: One-hour paclitaxel plus carboplatin in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer : results of a multicentre , phase II trial .","answer":"[[\\"paclitaxel\\", \\"carboplatin\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Signaling by a wide variety of cytokines, including interferons, interleukins, and growth factors, involves activation of JAK kinases and Stat (Signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins. At present, not much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which interleukin-5 (IL-5) exerts its diverse biologic effects. Human eosinophils are one of the most important target cells for IL-5 and were used here to study IL-5 signaling in a primary human cell. IL-5 induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. Moreover, IL-5 induced at least two DNA-binding complexes, using nuclear extracts from normal human eosinophils and the IL-6 / interferon-gamma response element of the ICAM-1 promoter (ICAM-1 pIRE) in an electromobility shift assay. From supershift experiments it was concluded that one DNA-binding complex contained Stat1 alpha, probably as a homodimer. Both DNA-binding complexes were inhibited by a phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for complex formation. IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induced, similar to IL-5, two DNA-binding complexes in human eosinophils, including Stat1 alpha. These data show for the first time that molecular mechanisms of IL-5 signaling in human eosinophils involve members of the JAK kinase family as well as members of the Stat family.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human eosinophils\\", \\"primary human cell\\", \\"target cells\\", \\"Human eosinophils\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"ICAM - 1 promoter\\", \\"ICAM - 1 pIRE\\", \\"IL - 6 / interferon - gamma response element\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"phosphotyrosine antibody\\", \\"JAK kinases\\", \\"cytokines\\", \\"IL - 3\\", \\"4G10\\", \\"IL - 5\\", \\"interferons\\", \\"Stat\\", \\"Stat (Signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins\\", \\"DNA - binding complex\\", \\"Stat1 alpha\\", \\"Stat family\\", \\"JAK2 tyrosine kinase\\", \\"JAK2\\", \\"DNA - binding complexes\\", \\"interleukin - 5\\", \\"Interleukin - 5\\", \\"JAK kinase family\\", \\"Signal transducers and activators of transcription\\", \\"growth factors\\", \\"granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor\\", \\"interleukins\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

The objective of this study was to describe the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in the Sami-speaking municipalities and a control group.(STUDY DESIGN) A retrospective registry-based study.(METHODS) The 8 municipalities included in the administration area of the Sami language law (Sami) were matched with a control group of 11 municipalities (non-Sami). Population data were accessed from Statistics Norway. Data regarding invitations and outcome in the NBCSP during the period 2001-2010 was derived from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). The NBCSP targets women aged 50-69 years. Rates and percentages were compared using chi-square test with a p-value<0.05 as statistical significant.(RESULTS) The attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the Sami and 75% in the non-Sami population (p<0.01). The recall rates were 2.4 and 3.3% in the Sami and non-Sami population, respectively (p<0.01). The rate of invasive screen detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group (p=0.14). The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the Sami (67%) was lower compared with the non-Sami population (86%, p=0.06).Question:Mammographic screening in Sami speaking municipalities and a control group.

@xmath2 and @xmath3 are often considered either as stable sets or as cliques of a graph , and @xmath9 describes the edges between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .first , when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are stable sets , @xmath9 defines a _ bipartite graph _@xmath10 with edges between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .the maximal bicliques of this bipartite graph can be organized by inclusion into a lattice , called a _concept lattice _@xcite ( or _ galois lattice _second , when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are cliques , the corresponding graph is _ co - bipartite_. third , when without loss of generality , @xmath2 is a clique and @xmath3 is a stable set , the corresponding graph is a _split graph_. finally , @xmath9 defines a _ hypergraph _where , without loss of generality , @xmath2 is the vertex set and @xmath3 describes the hyperedges .naturally , there are strong relationships between different realizations of @xmath9 .one example of this correspondence , which is central to this paper , is the one between chordal bipartite graphs and strongly chordal graphs ( see @xcite and lemma [ lemma : cbgstrchsplit ] of section [ sect : preliminaries ] ) : a bipartite graph @xmath1 is chordal bipartite if and only if the graph obtained from @xmath4 by completing @xmath2 to a clique is strongly chordal .    in this paper , we will also use the complement relation @xmath12 , which we called the _ mirror relation _ @xcite .the _ mirror _ ( or _ bipartite complement _ ) @xmath0 of a bipartite graph @xmath1 has the same color classes @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath4 , and two vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are adjacent in @xmath0 if and only if @xmath7 .several papers use this mirror notion , with various names and notations .most of them in fact investigate _auto - mirror_ relations ( _ i.e. _ , both the relation and its mirror relation are in the same class ) .such relations were used e.g. by @xcite to describe bipartite graphs whose vertex set can be partitioned into a stable set and a maximal biclique ; by @xcite to decompose a bipartite graph in a manner similar to modular decomposition ; by @xcite to investigate the chain dimension of a bipartite graph , remarking the ( obvious ) fact that a bipartite graph is a chain graph ( i.e. , is @xmath13-free ) if and only if its mirror is also a chain graph ; by @xcite and @xcite to characterize split graphs of dilworth number 2 ( the _ dilworth number _ of a graph is the maximum number of its vertices such that the neighborhood of one vertex is not contained in the closed neighborhood of another @xcite ; see section [ sect : dilworth ] ) ; by @xcite to characterize split graphs of dilworth number 3 ; by @xcite to characterize lattices with an articulation point .recently , @xcite characterized concept lattices which are planar and whose mirror lattice is also planar : this is the case if and only if the corresponding bipartite graph as well as its mirror is chordal bipartite .we call these graphs _ auto - chordal - bipartite graphs _ ( _ acb graphs _ for short ) ; these are the main topic of this paper . though chordal bipartite graphs have given rise to a wealth of publications , to the best of our knowledge acb graphshave not been studied .    by lemma [ lemma : cbgstrchsplit ], acb graphs correspond to split graphs which are strongly chordal and whose mirror is strongly chordal as well ( _ auto - strongly - chordal _ graphs ) .one special class of auto - strongly - chordal graphs which is well - known is that of interval graphs whose complement is an interval graph as well ( _ auto - interval graphs _ ) ; this special class of split graphs was characterized by @xcite using results from @xcite as those having dilworth number at most 2 .this paper is organized as follows : in sections [ sect : preliminaries ] and [ sect : dilworth ] , we give some necessary notations , definitions and previous results . in section [ sect : dilwacb - xy ] , we show that the dilworth number of acb graphs is unbounded .we address the question of determining both the dilworth number with respect to @xmath2 and to @xmath3 , and show that both numbers can be arbitrarily large and that the gap between the two numbers can also be arbitrarily large .in section [ sect : dilwacbbounded ] , the main result of this paper is a characterization of acb graphs with dilworth number at most @xmath8 in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs .finally , in section [ sect : algo ] , we discuss some algorithmic aspects of acb graphs .throughout this paper , all graphs are finite , simple ( i.e. , without loops and multiple edges ) and undirected . for a graph @xmath14 ,let @xmath15 denote the complement graph with @xmath16 .isomorphism of graphs @xmath17 , @xmath18 will be denoted by @xmath19 . as usual, @xmath20 is the _ open neighborhood _ of @xmath21 , and @xmath22=n(x ) cup {x} ] is the _ closed neighborhood _ of @xmath21    for @xmath23 , @xmath24  ] denotes the subgraph induced by @xmath2 . for a set @xmath25 of graphs, @xmath26 is _ @xmath25-free _ if none of the induced subgraphs of @xmath26 is in @xmath25 .clique _ is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices .a _ stable set _ or _independent set _ is a set of pairwise non - adjacent vertices .@xmath31 , @xmath32 , denotes the chordless cycle on @xmath8 vertices .a graph is _ chordal _ if it is @xmath31-free for every @xmath33 .@xmath34 , @xmath32 , denotes the chordless path on @xmath8 vertices . for @xmath35 , a ( complete ) _ @xmath8-sun _, denoted @xmath36 , consists of a clique with @xmath8 vertices , say @xmath37 , and another @xmath8 vertices , say @xmath38 , such that @xmath38 form a stable set and every @xmath39 is adjacent to exactly @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( index arithmetic modulo @xmath8 ) .later on , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( also called _ net _ ) play a special role .a chordal graph is _ strongly chordal _@xcite if it is @xmath36-free for every @xmath35 .    a _ bipartite graph _@xmath4 is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into two stable sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which we refer to as its _color classes_. we use the notation @xmath1 . a _ biclique _ in @xmath1 is a subgraph induced by sets @xmath45 and @xmath46 having all possible edges between elements of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in a bipartite graph @xmath1 , vertices of a path @xmath34 alternate between @xmath2 and @xmath3; a @xmath49 with its end - vertices in @xmath2 ( with its end - vertices in @xmath3 , respectively ) is called an _ @xmath2-@xmath49 _ ( a _ @xmath3-@xmath49 _ , respectively ) .a bipartite graph @xmath4 is a _chordal bipartite graph _ if @xmath4 is @xmath50-free for all @xmath35 @xcite .a _ chain graph _ is a @xmath13-free bipartite graph ; obviously , every chain graph is chordal bipartite .co - bipartite _ graph is the complement of a bipartite graph , i.e. , a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into two cliques @xmath2 and @xmath3 .a graph @xmath26 is a _ split graph _ if its vertex set can be partitioned into a clique @xmath51 and a stable set @xmath52 , also denoted as @xmath53 .the following is well - known :        for a given bipartite graph @xmath1 , let @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , respectively ) denote the split graph resulting from @xmath4 by completing @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , respectively ) to a clique .for example , if @xmath58 then @xmath59 and if @xmath60 then @xmath61 , @xmath35 .                1 .let @xmath66 be a relation between sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 .the _ mirror relation _ of @xmath9 , denoted @xmath67 , is the complement relation @xmath68 such that @xmath69 if and only if @xmath70 .2 .   let @xmath71 be a hypergraph .the _ mirror _ of @xmath72 is the complement hypergraph @xmath73 .3 .   let @xmath1 be a bipartite graph .the _ mirror _ ( or _ bipartite complement _ ) of @xmath4 is the bipartite graph @xmath74 such that for all @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath75 if and only if @xmath76 .thus , for example , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .4 .   let @xmath53 be a split graph with split partition into a clique @xmath51 and stable set @xmath52 .the _ mirror of @xmath26 _ is the split graph @xmath80 where for all @xmath81 and for all @xmath82 , @xmath75 if and only if @xmath76 .another open question is the complexity of computing the dilworth number of an acb graph : given a @xmath86-free matrix for a ( chordal ) bipartite graph , the neighborhood order can be computed in linear time @xcite .this order in turn yields the dilworth number .thus as discussed above , if the @xmath2- or @xmath3- dilworth number is 2 , the dilworth number can be determined in linear time ;

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  A new Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been developed at Multimedia University, in collaboration with Agency of Remote Sensing Malaysia. The SAR operates at C-band, single V V -polarization, with 5m £ 5m spatial resolution. Its unique features include compact in size, light weight, low power and capable of performing real-time imaging. A series of fleld measurements and ∞ight tests has been conducted and good quality SAR images have been obtained. The system will be used for monitoring and management of earth resources such as paddy flelds, oil palm plantation and soil surface. This paper reports the system design and development, as well as some preliminary results of the UAVSAR.Literature Review:","answer":"In the future plantation management where operating costs are minimized and profit is maximized, precision agriculture will play an important role. This involves the use of remote sensing BIB001 . Each palm tree will be precisely monitored. The anomalous palm that has a poor yield can be individually dealt with. For this to be realized, there is a need for very high-resolution imagery and GPS data to distinguish palms at individual level to identify the problem and to enable a specific treatment. UAV is an option for this application as they provide highest spatial resolution and flexible data acquisitions BIB002 . A recently launched commercial satellite, i.e. Worldview-4, is capable of providing very high spatial resolution (30 cm) images, and is a potential candidate for contributing information to precision agriculture. Its data could be equally applied in the detection of pest and disease, especially the notorious Ganoderma disease that require early detection and quarantine."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

shift of the emission peak in light - emitting devices @xcite .a solution to avoid the deleterious polarization - induced electric field effects is to use group - iii nitride layers in crystal orientations which have no polarization field in the growth direction , and hence across the device active region @xcite .therefore , there is extensive ongoing research towards the growth of  non - polar \\" @xmath5 @xmath1-plane and @xmath6 @xmath2-plane ( @xmath7-axis ) group iii - nitrides .these non - polar @xmath1- or @xmath2-plane epilayers are generally grown on @xmath8- or @xmath2-plane sapphire substrates respectively . the lattice mismatch and thermal expansion coefficients of these nitride epilayers with respect to the substrateare different along @xmath9 and @xmath7-directions .this gives rise to an _ anisotropic _ in - plane strain which distorts the basal - plane of the hexagonal unit cell .similar anisotropic differences in lattice mismatch and expansion coefficients also exist within the different members of the iii - nitride family , hence there is an anisotropic in - plane strain even when growing for example an @xmath1-plane algan epilayer on a @xmath1-plane gan buffer layer .the distortion of the basal plane has also been observed for similar reason in case of @xmath0-plane gan grown on @xmath1-plane sapphire substrate @xcite .    in @xmath0-plane oriented films ,epilayers are under uniform in - plane strain , which deforms the unit cell but preserves the hexagonal symmetry of the basal plane . in that casethe determination of lattice parameter and estimation of group iii molar fraction in the ternary alloy ( for example al content of algan films ) is relatively straightforward @xcite .however , for the non - polar orientations , the anisotropic in - plane strain results a distortion of the wurtzite unit cell which breaks the hexagonal symmetry .further , the orientation of the @xmath1-plane nitride epilayer on @xmath8-plane sapphire substrate results in a reduced number of available lattice points in the reciprocal space within the limiting - sphere that are accessible for diffraction measurements .this makes determination of lattice parameters for non - polar nitrides and consequently the estimation of group iii composition of non - polar nitrides very difficult @xcite .a few different procedures for lattice parameter determination of such structures have been discussed in the literature .darakchieva et al .@xcite detail a procedure that requires measuring several symmetric and skew - symmetric planes at multiple azimuth positions in an edge - symmetric geometry .another approach by roder et al.@xcite uses measurements of interplanar spacings derived from a combination of 9 symmetric , asymmetric , and skew - symmetric reflections , which are weighted by their corresponding fwhm values and used in a fitting routine to match to an orthorhombic structure via an error minimization routine . in this paperwe suggest a slightly different procedure for measuring the lattice parameters for such distorted systems using high resolution x - ray diffraction ( hrxrd ) .we first show that the anisotropic strain results in an orthorhombic distortion of the unit cell , and derive a general expression for the interplanar distance @xmath10 in such structures . using the interplanar distances determined from multiple symmetric and skew - symmetric reflections , we obtain the lattice parameters via a standard least - square error minimization routine that is easily implemented in standard mathematical software packages using a matrix formulation .we also derive an approximate expression for the ternary alloy composition of al@xmath11ga@xmath12n epilayers , where the al content @xmath3 is obtained solving the stress -

Moreover, we show that a poor choice of STE leads to instability of the training algorithm near certain local minima, which is verified with CIFAR-10 experiments.Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved the remarkable success in many machine learning applications such as computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2015) , natural language processing (Collobert & Weston, 2008) and reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2016) .However, the deployment of DNN typically require hundreds of megabytes of memory storage for the trainable full-precision floating-point parameters, and billions of floating-point operations to make a single inference.To achieve substantial memory savings and energy efficiency at inference time, many recent efforts have been made to the training of coarsely quantized DNN, meanwhile maintaining the performance of their float counterparts (Courbariaux et al., 2015; Rastegari et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2017; Hubara et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2018b) .Trainingfully quantized DNN amounts to solving a very challenging optimization problem. It callsfor minimizing a piecewise constant and highly nonconvex empirical risk function f (w) subject to a discrete set-constraint w ∈ Q that characterizes the quantized weights. In particular, weight quantization of DNN have been extensively studied in the literature; see for examples (Li et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2016; 2018a; Hou & Kwok, 2018; He et al., 2018; Li & Hao, 2018) . On the otherhand, the gradient ∇f (w) in training activation quantized DNN is almost everywhere (a.e.) zero, which makes the standard back-propagation inapplicable. The arguablymost effective way around this issue is nothing but to construct a non-trivial search direction by properly modifying the chain rule. Specifically, one can replace the a.e. zero derivative of quantized activation function composited in the chain rule with a related surrogate. This proxyderivative used in the backward pass only is referred as the straight-through estimator (STE) (Bengio et al., 2013) . In the samepaper, Bengio et al. (2013) proposed an alternative approach based on stochastic neurons. In addition, Friesen & Domingos (2017) proposed the feasible target propagation algorithm for learning hard-threshold (or binary activated) networks (Lee et al., 2015) via convex combinatorial optimization.","answer":"We make theoretical justification for the concept of straight-through estimator."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Most state-of-the-art algorithms, however, still cannot perform perfectly in challenging cases, especially in large blur setting. In this paper, we focus on how to estimate a good blur kernel from a single blurred image based on the image structure. We found that image details caused by blur could adversely affect the kernel estimation, especially when the blur kernel is large. One effective way to remove these details is to apply image denoising model based on the total variation (TV). First, we developed a novel method for computing image structures based on the TV model, such that the structures undermining the kernel estimation will be removed. Second, we applied a gradient selection method to mitigate the possible adverse effect of salient edges and improve the robustness of kernel estimation. Third, we proposed a novel kernel estimation method, which is capable of removing noise and preserving the continuity in the kernel. Finally, we developed an adaptive weighted spatial prior to preserve sharp edges in latent image restoration. Extensive experiments testify to the effectiveness of our method on various kinds of challenging examples.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We present a new algorithm for removing motion blur from a single image. Our method computes a deblurred image using a unified probabilistic model of both blur kernel estimation and unblurred image restoration. We present an analysis of the causes of common artifacts found in current deblurring methods, and then introduce several novel terms within this probabilistic model that are inspired by our analysis. These terms include a model of the spatial randomness of noise in the blurred image, as well a new local smoothness prior that reduces ringing artifacts by constraining contrast in the unblurred image wherever the blurred image exhibits low contrast. Finally, we describe an effficient optimization scheme that alternates between blur kernel estimation and unblurred image restoration until convergence. As a result of these steps, we are able to produce high quality deblurred results in low computation time. We are even able to produce results of comparable quality to techniques that require additional input images beyond a single blurry photograph, and to methods that require additional hardware.[2]: Blind deconvolution is the recovery of a sharp version of a blurred image when the blur kernel is unknown. Recent algorithms have afforded dramatic progress, yet many aspects of the problem remain challenging and hard to understand. The goal of this paper is to analyze and evaluate recent blind deconvolution algorithms both theoretically and experimentally. We explain the previously reported failure of the naive MAP approach by demonstrating that it mostly favors no-blur explanations. On the other hand we show that since the kernel size is often smaller than the image size a MAP estimation of the kernel alone can be well constrained and accurately recover the true blur. The plethora of recent deconvolution techniques makes an experimental evaluation on ground-truth data important. We have collected blur data with ground truth and compared recent algorithms under equal settings. Additionally, our data demonstrates that the shift-invariant blur assumption made by most algorithms is often violated.[3]: We present a blind deconvolution algorithm based on the total variational (TV) minimization method proposed by Acar and Vogel (1994). The motivation for regularizing with the TV norm is that it is extremely effective for recovering edges of images as well as some blurring functions, e.g., motion blur and out-of-focus blur. An alternating minimization (AM) implicit iterative scheme is devised to recover the image and simultaneously identify the point spread function (PSF). Numerical results indicate that the iterative scheme is quite robust, converges very fast (especially for discontinuous blur), and both the image and the PSF can be recovered under the presence of high noise level. Finally, we remark that PSFs without sharp edges, e.g., Gaussian blur, can also be identified through the TV approach.[4]: We describe a new method for recovering the blur kernel in motion-blurred images based on statistical irregularities their power spectrum exhibits. This is achieved by a power-law that refines the one traditionally used for describing natural images. The new model better accounts for biases arising from the presence of large and strong edges in the image. We use this model together with an accurate spectral whitening formula to estimate the power spectrum of the blur. The blur kernel is then recovered using a phase retrieval algorithm with improved convergence and disambiguation capabilities. Unlike many existing methods, the new approach does not perform a maximum a posteriori estimation, which involves repeated reconstructions of the latent image, and hence offers attractive running times. We compare the new method with state-of-the-art methods and report various advantages, both in terms of efficiency and accuracy.[5]: Motion smear is an important visual cue for motion perception by the human vision system (HVS). However, in image analysis research, exploiting motion smear has been largely ignored. Rather, motion smear is usually considered as a degradation of images that needs to be removed. In this paper, the authors establish a computational model that estimates image motion from motion smear information-\\"motion from smear\\". In many real situations, the shutter of the sensing camera must be kept open long enough to produce images of adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resulting in significant motion smear in images. The authors present a new motion blur model and an algorithm that enables unique estimation of image motion. A prototype sensor system that exploits the new motion blur model has been built to acquire data for \\"motion-from-smear\\". Experimental results on images with both simulated smear and real smear, using the authors' \\"motion-from-smear\\" algorithm as well as a conventional motion estimation technique, are provided. The authors also show that temporal aliasing does not affect \\"motion-from-smear\\" to the same degree as it does algorithms that use displacement as a cue. \\"Motion-from-smear\\" provides an additional tool for motion estimation and effectively complements the existing techniques when apparent motion smear is present.[6]: Blind image deconvolution is an ill-posed problem that requires regularization to solve. However, many common forms of image prior used in this setting have a major drawback in that the minimum of the resulting cost function does not correspond to the true sharp solution. Accordingly, a range of additional methods are needed to yield good results (Bayesian methods, adaptive cost functions, alpha-matte extraction and edge localization). In this paper we introduce a new type of image regularization which gives lowest cost for the true sharp image. This allows a very simple cost formulation to be used for the blind deconvolution model, obviating the need for additional methods. Due to its simplicity the algorithm is fast and very robust. We demonstrate our method on real images with both spatially invariant and spatially varying blur.[7]: Restoring a clear image from a single motion-blurred image due to camera shake has long been a challenging problem in digital imaging. Existing blind deblurring techniques either only remove simple motion blurring, or need user interactions to work on more complex cases. In this paper, we present an approach to remove motion blurring from a single image by formulating the blind blurring as a new joint optimization problem, which simultaneously maximizes the sparsity of the blur kernel and the sparsity of the clear image under certain suitable redundant tight frame systems (curvelet system for kernels and framelet system for images). Without requiring any prior information of the blur kernel as the input, our proposed approach is able to recover high-quality images from given blurred images. Furthermore, the new sparsity constraints under tight frame systems enable the application of a fast algorithm called linearized Bregman iteration to efficiently solve the proposed minimization problem. The experiments on both simulated images and real images showed that our algorithm can effectively removing complex motion blurring from nature images.[8]: In blind deconvolution one aims to estimate from an input blurred image y a sharp image x and an unknown blur kernel k. Recent research shows that a key to success is to consider the overall shape of the posterior distribution p(x, k ) and not only its mode. This leads to a distinction between MAP x, k strategies which estimate the mode pair x, k and often lead to undesired results, and MAP k strategies which select the best k while marginalizing over all possible x images. The MAP k principle is significantly more robust than the MAP x, k one, yet, it involves a challenging marginalization over latent images. As a result, MAP k techniques are considered complicated, and have not been widely exploited. This paper derives a simple approximated MAP k algorithm which involves only a modest modification of common MAP x, k algorithms. We show that MAP k can, in fact, be optimized easily, with no additional computational complexity.[9]: Camera shake during exposure leads to objectionable image blur and ruins many photographs. Conventional blind deconvolution methods typically assume frequency-domain constraints on images, or overly simplified parametric forms for the motion path during camera shake. Real camera motions can follow convoluted paths, and a spatial domain prior can better maintain visually salient image characteristics. We introduce a method to remove the effects of camera shake from seriously blurred images. The method assumes a uniform camera blur over the image and negligible in-plane camera rotation. In order to estimate the blur from the camera shake, the user must specify an image region without saturation effects. We show results for a variety of digital photographs taken from personal photo collections.","answer":"Image deblurring is a hot topic in image processing and computer vision communities. In single image blind deblurring, early approaches usually imposed constraints on motion blur kernel and used parameterized forms for the kernels [5] [3] . Recently, Fergus [9] adopted a zero-mean Mixture of Gaussian to fit for natural image gradients. A variational Bayesian method was employed to deblur an image. Shan [1] used a certain parametric model to approximate the heavy-tailed natural image prior. Cai [7] assumed that the latent images and kernels can be sparsely represented by an over-complete dictionary and introduced a framelet and curvelet system to obtain the sparse representation for images and kernels. Levin [2] illustrated the limitation of the simple maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, and proposed an efficient marginal likelihood approximation in [8] . Krishnan [6] introduced a new normalized sparsity prior to estimate blur kernels. Goldstein and Fattal [4] estimated blur kernels by spectral irregularities. However, the kernel estimates of the aforementioned works usually contain some noise. The hard thresholding to the kernel elements method will destroy the inherent structure of kernels."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

The COVID-19 pandemic has perturbed the functioning of healthcare systems around the world and led to changes in elective surgical care, with bariatric procedures being postponed until the end of pandemic. There is no data in the literature about the effect of a new epidemiological situation on bariatric patients. METHODS: The study was designed as an online survey containing multiple open questions about bariatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was conducted among pre- and postoperative bariatric patients. RESULTS: Out of 800 respondents, 74.53% felt anxiety about their health in regard to the present epidemiologic state. Some (72.25%) were aware of the fact that obesity was an important risk factor that could impair the course of the COVID-19 disease. Almost 30% of respondents admitted having put on weight, significantly more in the group of preoperative patients (43.8% vs 22.69%; p < 0.001). Only 20.92% of patients had a possibility of continuing direct bariatric care; 67.3% of patients had an opportunity of remote contact with a bariatric specialist, including online consultations, teleconsultations and social media meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Limited access to medical care and quarantine lockdown may result in a deterioration of long-time operation outcomes and lower weight losses. Patients should be encouraged to profit from online consultations with specialists and telemedicine to reduce the negative effects of the pandemic on their health.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

MMR starts when a MutS homolog recognizes a mismatch and undergoes an ATP-dependent transformation to an elusive sliding clamp state. How this transient state promotes MutL homolog recruitment and activation of repair is unclear. Here we present a crystal structure of the MutS/MutL complex using a site-specifically crosslinked complex and examine how large conformational changes lead to activation of MutL. The structure captures MutS in the sliding clamp conformation, where tilting of the MutS subunits across each other pushes DNA into a new channel, and reorientation of the connector domain creates an interface for MutL with both MutS subunits. Our work explains how the sliding clamp promotes loading of MutL onto DNA, to activate downstream effectors. We thus elucidate a crucial mechanism that ensures that MMR is initiated only after detection of a DNA mismatch.Introduction:To enable the correct and complete transfer of genetic information during cell division, DNA polymerases efficiently replicate the genome by pairing nucleotide bases opposite their complementary template base. However, despite the polymerase proofreading ability, incorrect nucleotides are occasionally incorporated into the new DNA strand, resulting in mutations when left uncorrected. To reduce the number of such mismatches and maintain genomic stability, replication is followed by DNA mismatch repair( MMR) in almost all cellular organisms( Kunkel and Erie, 2005; Jiricny, 2013). The initiation of this MMR system is evolutionarily conserved, although in eukaryotes heterodimeric homologs replace the bacterial homodimeric components. Defects in MMR result in a mutator phenotype and in humans in predisposition for cancer, known as Lynch syndrome or HNPCC( Lynch and de la Chapelle, 1999). MMR is initiated when a MutS homolog binds to a mismatch. In this mismatch recognition step, the MutS dimer kinks the DNA at the site of the mismatch and stacks a phenylalanine onto the mispaired base( Lamers et al., 2000; Obmolova et al., 2000; Warren et al., 2007). Upon ATP binding MutS releases the mismatch( Allen et al., 1997; Gradia et al., 1997) and travels as a ‘sliding clamp’ along the DNA helix( Gradia et al., 1999; Acharya et al, 2003; Jeong et al., 2011), and this specific state of MutS is recognized by MutL or its homologs( Grilley et al., 1989; Prolla et al., 1994; Drotschmann et al., 1998; Acharya et al., 2003). MutL proteins are constitutive dimers through their C-terminal domains, while the N-terminal ATPase domains reorganize and dimerize upon ATP binding( Grilley et al., 1989; Ban and Yang, 1998; Ban et al., 1999; Guarné et al., 2004). Once recruited by the MutS sliding clamp, the MutL homologs activate downstream repair. This includes the nicking of the newly replicated strand by a nuclease, which is either part of the MutL C-terminal domain( Kadyrov et al., 2006), or a separate protein such as MutH in Escherichia coli( Hall and Matson, 1999). MutL also activates UvrD in bacteria to unwind the DNA( Yamaguchi et al., 1998), after which the new DNA strand can be removed and re-replicated( Kunkel and Erie, 2005). As loss of MutS homologs( MSH2, MSH3 and MSH6 in humans) or MutL homologs( MLH1 and PMS2 in humans) leads to mutator and/or cancer phenotypes, these proteins evidently have critical roles in mismatch repair and it is therefore important to understand their exact mechanism. Despite extensive studies( Gradia et al., 1999; Mendillo et al., 2005; Cho et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2012), it is unclear how MutS achieves the sliding-clamp state, how this promotes MutL recognition and why this results in activation of the MutL protein. Here, we trap the transient complex between MutS and MutL to resolve a crystal structure of the MutS sliding clamp bound to MutL. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that not only this MutS conformation but also the complex between MutS and MutL could be observed. We show how rearrangements in MutS promote interactions from both MutS subunits with a single MutL N-terminal domain, and how this domain is then positioned to load onto DNA running through a novel channel in the MutS dimer. We use biophysical methods to analyze the transient states and mechanistically understand the specificity and effect of MutL binding to MutS, and functional assays to address how this affects MMR initiation.Discussion:Taken together, our data reveal how the large conformational changes within MutS after mismatch recognition promote MMR activation. In the mismatch and ATP activated state MutS pushes DNA into a new channel, which allows sliding of the protein over DNA. The new state with the clamps crossed over the DNA explains the stability of the MutS sliding clamp on DNA( Schofield et al., 2001; Lebbink et al., 2010; Jeong et al., 2011), as electrostatic interactions between DNA and the positive charges lining the new channel may stabilize the new clamp conformation. The conformational change pushes the connector domain away from the center and on top of the ATPase domains, to provide a second interface for the MutL protein that binds to the opposing MutS subunit, while DNA in the new MutS channel can also contribute to MutL binding. This loads the N-terminal domains of MutL onto the DNA and the MutL binding delays the sliding of MutS( Figure 5E, Video 2). The loading step of MutL onto DNA is required for MutH activation and nicking( Figure 5C)( Junop et al., 2003; Robertson et al., 2006), while UvrD loading and activation at this nick( Yamaguchi et al., 1998) would follow similar validation. In this way, the requirement of the MutS conformational change for full MutL interaction is a sophisticated validation mechanism, which presumably is conserved in the eukaryotic homologs. It ensures that repair is only initiated when necessary, and due to the MMR system DNA replication can be completed with few errors incorporated in the genome. 10. 7554/eLife. 06744. 018Video 2. Model for initiation of DNA mismatch repair. After MutS( cyan/blue) has recognized a mismatch in DNA( in orange; mismatch shown as pink spheres), it will bind ATP which triggers a conformational change in which the subunits tilt across each other and the connector domains move outward. This pushes the DNA to a new channel, where MutS fits as a loose ring around the DNA duplex and can behave as a sliding clamp. The N-terminal domain of MutL( green) can specifically recognize this state by binding two interfaces simultaneously. This loads MutL onto the DNA, where the N-terminal domains could dimerize and downstream effectors can be activated. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 06744. 018 The complete transition from mismatch binding to sliding clamp state is likely to take multiple steps( Qiu et al., 2012). First a single ATP will bind, leading to a stabilized asymmetric nucleotide state of MutS on the mismatch( Antony and Hingorani, 2004; Antony et al., 2006; Monti et al., 2011), followed by binding of the second ATP( Mazur et al., 2006; Hargreaves et al., 2010). Meanwhile MutS will undergo two separate ATP-induced events, the tilting of the subunits that push DNA into a new channel and the rearrangement of the connector domain( and the associated mismatch binding domain) that together generate a new MutL interface. These two movements could potentially be uncoupled. MutS binding to a non-hydrolysable ATP analog can already cause a closed clamp-like state,( i. e. perform the tilting movement) as supported by SAXS analysis( Hura et al., 2013b), but may possibly not change the conformation of the mismatched binding domain( Qiu et al., 2012), as consequence of the connector domain movement. This would explain how MutS with ATPγS( or with ATP for a mutant that cannot hydrolyse nucleotides[E694A][Jacobs-Palmer and Hingorani, 2007]) could form a closed clamp state that can no longer be loaded onto DNA( Gradia et al., 1999; Jacobs-Palmer and Hingorani, 2007; Cristóvão et al., 2012), but nevertheless is not sufficient to bind MutL. Our data do not address the order of the two events, tilting and connector movement, or how they relate to the two ATP binding events. Observed conformational changes resulting in ternary complex and sliding clamp formation have previously been suggested to be independent( Mendillo et al., 2010). Indeed our structure does suggest that rearrangement of a single connector domain( in the subunit equivalent to the ‘MSH2’ subunit;( Mendillo et al., 2009) is sufficient for the complex formation with MutLα( Hess et al., 2006; Hargreaves et al., 2010, 2012). This might allow MSH6 to initially remain bound to the mismatch, consistent with models that consider transient asymmetric nucleotide states involved in mismatch verification and possibly ternary complex formation( Antony and Hingorani, 2004; Hess et al., 2006; Lebbink et al., 2006; Mazur et al., 2006; Hargreaves et al., 2010; Monti et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2012). Another question that is unclear is where the loading of MutL onto DNA takes place. It could occur on or close to the mismatch itself, but it is also possible that MutS first slides before loading MutL on DNA. Once the sliding clamp conformation is reached, the complex no longer interacts with the mismatch( Gorman et al., 2012). The clamp state loads MutL onto DNA, stabilizes a straight form of the DNA( Figure 5B)( Hura et al., 2013a) and triggers the conformational changes of MutL. These involve movements in the C-terminal domains( Guarné et al., 2004) to form a ring around the DNA and ATP binding by the N-terminal domains of MutL to generate the state that activates MutH and UvrD( Prolla et al., 1994; Drotschmann et al., 1998; Ban et al., 1999; Acharya et al., 2003). In conclusion, we have used single-cysteine mutants and chemical crosslinking to trap and analyze a relevant MMR intermediate state that has long been elusive. This sliding clamp state of MutS bound to a MutL domain is highly informative. It corresponds to a reaction intermediate that occurs during a series of conformational changes triggered by mismatch recognition, and explains why specifically this conformation of MutS is able to recruit MutL. The presented combination of structural and biophysical methods provides a powerful approach to resolve conformational changes within large and transient protein complexes that form and act during biologically relevant processes.","answer":"The genetic code of DNA is written using four letters: “A” , “C” , “T” , and “G” . Molecules of DNA form a double helix in which the letters in the two opposing strands pair up in a specific manner—“A” pairs with “T” , and “C” pairs with “G” . A cell must replicate its DNA before it divides , and sometimes the wrong DNA letter can get added into the new DNA strand . If left uncorrected , these mistakes accumulate over time and can eventually harm the cell . As a result , cells have evolved several ways to identify these mistakes and correct them , including one known as “mismatch repair” . Mismatch repair occurs via several stages . The process starts when a protein called MutS comes across a site in the DNA where the letters are mismatched ( for example , where an “A” is paired with a “C” , instead of a “T” ) . MutS can recognize such a mismatch , bind it , and then bind to another molecule called ATP . MutS then changes shape and encircles the DNA like a clamp that can slide along the DNA . Only when it forms this “sliding clamp” state can MutS recruit another protein called MutL . This activity in turn triggers a series of further events that ultimately correct the mismatch . However , it remains poorly understood how MutS forms a clamp around DNA and how and why this state recruits MutL in order to start the repair . To visualize this short-lived intermediate , Groothuizen et al . trapped the relevant complex in the presence of DNA containing a mismatch and then used a technique called X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of MutS bound to MutL . The structure reveals that two copies of MutS tilt across each other and open up a channel , which is large enough to accommodate the DNA . In this manner , MutS is able to form a loose ring around the DNA . The changes in the structure and the movement of the DNA to the new channel were confirmed using another technique , commonly referred to as FRET . Groothuizen et al . observed that the movements in the MutS protein also serve to make the interfaces available that can recognize MutL . If these interfaces were disturbed , MutS and MutL were unable to associate with each other , which resulted in a failure to trigger mismatch repair . Further analysis revealed that that MutL binds to DNA only after MutS has recognised the mismatch and formed a clamp around it . This is the first time that the MutS clamp and the MutS/MutL complex have been visualized , and further work is now needed to understand how MutL triggers other events that ultimately repair the mismatched DNA ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In such superconcentrated electrolytes the increased stability window is due to several effects: 7 Firstly, water molecules display a specific speciation, since most of them belong to the lithium ion solvation shells, thus leading to low fractions of free water molecules. This reduces the concentration of water at the positive interface, which mainly contains TFSI − anions. 6,8 However, the main reason for the extended voltage window is the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer that mainly consists of LiF as a result of the electrochemical decomposition of the TFSI anion. [9][10][11] Although most of the studies of WiS electrolytes were performed using the LiTFSI salt, [12][13][14][15][16] the WiS concept was extended to other metallic ions such as potassium, 17 sodium [18][19][20] and zinc-based 21 electrolytes.</p><p>In parallel, the chemistry of Li-ion based WiS electrolyte family was also explored further. For example, since the concentration of LiTFSI in the WiS electrolyte is limited by the solubility limit, it was proposed to mix them with other salts to increase further the electrochemical stability window. 22,23 On the contrary, the WiS electrolytes form biphasic systems when they are mixed with simpler solutions such as highly concentrated aqueous LiCl, 24 which was exploited to develop a dual battery involving lithium ions together with halogen conversion-intercalation. 25 A mixture of lithium and potassium acetate-based WiS was also recently proposed as a greener and lower-cost alternative to TFSI-based systems, 26 showing further the versatility of this family of electrolytes.</p><p>In practice, it could be possible to develop WiS electrolytes with a large number of all the ions 27 in order to ensure systematic comparisons of their properties. We first study the structure at a large molality of 15 mol kg −1 . One of the systems shows a tendency to phase separation, so that we discard it from the other analysis. We then compare the conductivity, the viscosity of the liquids as well as the individual diffusion coefficients of all the species. Comparing these transport properties allows to rank the various anionic species for applications. Finally, we determine the amount of \\"free\\" water in the various systems since this quantity is known to influence the reactivity at the electrochemical interface. Among all the mixtures considered in this article, the only one for which there is available experimental data concerning the solubility limit is LiTFSI-H 2 O, whose value was reported to be a molality of 31.3 m at 303.15 K. 15 Accurately computing solubilities is very challenging in molecular dynamics, 28 so that we decided to analyze the medium/long range structure as a proxy to determine the relative miscibility of the systems. To do this, partial structure factors were computed using the formalism proposed by Faber and Ziman, 29 in which the structure factor is represented by the correlations between the different chemical species α and β:</p><p>where g αβ (r) are the partial radial distribution functions and ρ is the number density of the system. domains. That is, we can conclude that LiNF solubility in water is not high enough to satisfy the WiS condition and it will not be included in our analysis hereinafter. All the other simulated WiS show similar structures, i.e. the formation of nano-heterogeneities 12 at medium range as can be seen from the presence of intense peaks at q values ranging from 0.95 to 1.5 Å−1 and from 0.7 to 0.9 Å−1 for the S-S and the O-O partial structure factors, respectively.</p><p>The use of WiS as electrolytes in energy storage devices will then be a compromise between a high concentration to extend the electrochemical stability window and a good ionic conductivity that guarantees acceptable power density. 15,16,30 Thus, the tailored design of superconcentrated aqueous electrolyte systems requires a deep understanding of the ion transport mechanism, and several reports suggested a fast Li ion transport through waterrich domains. 12,13 The two key collective transport quantities are the electrical conductivity and the viscosity. The former can be calculated in molecular dynamics simulations using</p><p>where e is the elementary charge, V is the volume of the simulation cell, T is the temperature, k B is the Boltzmann constant and ∆ i (t) = r i (t)− r i (0) is the displacement of the ion i, which carries a charge q i , over a time interval t (brackets ... indicate an ensemble average). This expression includes the contribution not only of the self-terms of each ion but also the complex effect of cross-correlations due to the correlated motion of ions. The electrical conductivities obtained using Eq.( 2) are included in Figure 3a.</p><p>The shear viscosity of the electrolytes was computed within the Green-Kubo (GK) formalism 31 by integration of the stress-tensor correlation function</p><p>where Π αβ represents any of the five independent components of the stress tensor, Π xy , Π xz , Π yz , Π xx−yy , Π 2zz−xx−yy . The values obtained for the viscosity of each system, that is, the value of the plateau at which the running integral in Eq.(3) converges after a certain time, are shown in Figure 3b.</p><p>The simulations predict a LiTFSI-H 2 O viscosity in good agreement with experimental data (≈ 33 cP instead of 22 cP 32 ), while they underestimate the ionic conductivity by a factor 2, 6,15,32 which corresponds to typical error for the prediction of transport properties in electrolytes by non-polarizable molecular dynamics. 33 Although the use of a different parameterization for the partial charges and Lennard-Jones parameters of the anion could improve the situation, 32 the present parameters were chosen in order to keep consistency between all the different anions studied and to compare them without introducing any bias.</p><p>When comparing the various liquids, we observe that they can be separated between three groups. Firstly, the superconcentrated LiFSI-H 2 O and LiTF-H 2 O mixtures have low viscosities and high ionic conductivities. In particular, the latter (∼ 50 mS/cm in both cases) is greater than the values observed in typical non-aqueous electrolytes used in commercial Li-ion batteries 34 and supercapacitors. 35 Then we observe that the LiBETI-H 2 O mixture shows similar performances as the reference TFSI system. The LiTFSAM-H 2 O has a larger viscosity but a simular conductivity as those two, so it can be put in the same group.</p><p>Finally, the system involving the TSAC anions shows significantly poorer performances than all the others, with a viscosity reaching ∼ 100 cP and a low ionic conductivity. It is worth noting that the variations between anions cannot easily be explained using their relative size/weights since for example TFSAM and FSI have relatively similar sizes, as well as TFSI and TSAC, while BETI has the largest fluorocarbonated chains. Nevertheless, if we split them between the symmetric (FSI, TFSI and BETI by order of increasing size) and asymmetric (TF, TFSAM and TSAC) ones, we observe a trend for the viscosity to increase with the anion size. Based on this observation, the best transport properties seem to arise for small symmetric anions.</p><p>In order to analyze further the individual dynamics of the liquids, the self-diffusion coefficient of the species i can be calculated from the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) using</p><p>Note that a correction due to the use of periodic boundary conditions must be added. 36 Figure 3c shows the values obtained for H 2 O molecules, lithium cations and the various anions. In agreement with previous works, 12,32 it can be seen that water molecules are the most mobile species, followed by lithium cations and anions. This corresponds to an opposite behaviour with respect to the dynamics of the ions in typical ionic liquid electrolytes, where anions generally diffuse faster than cations. 12,30,37 The individual dynamics provide further points of comparison between the various electrolytes. The main difference with respect to the analysis of the collective transport properties is that the diffusivity of water molecules in the TSAC-based system is similar to the cases of TFSI, BETI and TFSAM. This points towards a predominant role of the low diffusivity of the anions in the high viscosity of the system. We also observe that the lithium ion dynamics is enhanced in LiTFSI-H 2 O with respect to BETI and TFSAM-based systems, which points towards a better performance of the former in Li-ion batteries applications despite the similar conductivities of the systems.</p><p>Unlike in ionic liquid/water systems, where the interaction between H 2 O molecules and anions is generally stronger than with the cations, 38 in WiS electrolytes they are strongly attracted by the lithium ions. 6 At infinite dilution the first solvation shell of Li + is made of four water molecules. At the molality studied here, the ratio H 2 O/Li is smaller than four. As a consequence the first solvation shell of lithium cations includes both water and anions. It was previously reported that as the concentration of the mixture increases the coordination environment is expected to change from solvent-separated ion pairs to a majority of contact ion pairs and even ionic aggregates. 12,18,39 In the present work, we employed the trajectory analysis program TRAVIS 40 to analyze the formation of domains in these electrolytes, whose methodology is based on Voronoi tessellation. 41,42 The subsets were defined so as to match the three types of molecules in the mixtures, and two subsets were considered to be neighbours if they share at least a common face. This approach provided us with valuable information on the neighborhood of the reference subset, and the results are included in Figure 4a. We can observe that the choice of the anion does not have a remarkable impact on the number of molecules neighbouring a reference one, so that the WiS studied here have qualitatively similar structures.</p><p>Nevertheless, the small variations observed for the coordination of the Li ions by the water molecules may lead to substantial changes in the concentration of \\"free\\" water molecules at such molalities. A water molecule is considered to be free when it is not coordinated to any lithium ion, but it is worth noting that in WiS they remain partly coordinated to other water molecules through an extended hydrogen-bond network, which will affect their reactivity as well. 43 The amount of free water molecules is shown in Figure 4b. We observe that it is significantly higher in the TF and the TSAC-based systems. This probably affects significantly the electrochemical window because non-coordinated water molecules can adsorb more easily on the positive electrode than the lithium-coordinated ones (due to the Coulombic repulsion of the Li + ions). At the negative electrode it is also expected that the formation of the protective SEI will be more difficult for these salts.</p><p>In conclusion, we have studied through extended molecular dynamics simulations a series of WiS electrolytes where the nature of the anion was systematically changed. The same force field was used for all the simulations and the molality was kept fixed at 15 m in order to allow for representative comparisons. By analyzing the structure factors, we observed that the NF anion has a strong tendency to demix from the aqueous phase due to its highly hydrophobic fluorinated chain. All the other anions have structural features typical of water-in-salts, namely the formation of nanoheterogeneities with two type of domains, the first ones containing mostly the anions and the second ones made of solvated lithium ions linked through the hydrogen-bond network of the water molecules.</p><p>In a second step, by computing the transport properties we have identified that they do not vary in a systematic way with the size or the molecular weight of the anion. For a given ion size, the use of symmetric anions leads to a lower viscosity and increased ionic conductivities and diffusion coefficients. The TF and FSI display higher diffusion coefficients, followed by the TFSI, BETI and TFSAM-based systems. Finally, the TSAC has a poor viscosity and should therefore be avoided in electrochemical systems.</p><p>Finally, we have looked at the speciation of the systems, we have observed that the TF-based system has a relatively high amount of free water molecules, which may affect its electrochemical window. Nevertheless, feature work should adress more specifically the reactivity of the molecules since the mechanisms that have been identified for TFSI may not be adequate for all the other anions. This will require the use of density functional theory-based simulations in order to allow the formation/break of chemical bonds.</p>Simulation details<p>MD simulations of WiS electrolytes were carried out using the LAMMPS package. 44 All cubic simulation boxes contained 473 water molecules and 128 salt ion pairs that were randomly distributed using Packmol. 45 The SPC/E water model was used in these simulations, 46 whereas the parameterization of the anions was made in the framework of the CL&P 47 force field for ionic liquids, for which we employed the set of parameters reported in Ref.</p><p>27. Lithium cations were modelled as a single site whose Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters are = 6.25 kcal/mol and σ = 1.25992 Å. It must be noted that the charges of both ions were uniformly scaled by a factor of 0.8 so as to accelerate the dynamics of the mixtures, which was shown necessary to have good agreement with the experimental results in LiTFSI WiS. 32 In order to reach proper density, each system was firstly equilibrated at 298.15 K and 1 bar for 4 ns in the NpT ensemble by using Nosé-Hoover thermostat and barostat [48][49][50] with relaxation times of 10 and 500 femtoseconds, respectively. Then we performed a second equilibration of 60 ns within an NVT ensemble, followed by a production run of around 90 ns (with a time step dt = 1 fs) that was used to obtain structural and dynamic information about the systems.</p><p>of CINES under the allocation A0080910463 made by GENCI.</p>","answer":"Water-in-salts form a new family of electrolytes with properties distinct from the ones of conventional aqueous systems and ionic liquids. They are currently investigated for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors applications, but to date most of the focus was put on the system based on the LiTFSI salt. Here we study the structure and the dynamics of a series of water-in-salts with different anions. They have a similar parent structure but they vary systematically through their symmetric/asymmetric feature and the length of the fluorocarbonated chains. The simulations allow to determine their tendency to nanosegregate, as well as their transport properties (viscosity, ionic conductivity, diffusion coefficients) and the amount of free water, providing useful data for potential applications in energy storage devices."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A novel human gene, LAF-4, was isolated from a subtracted cDNA library that showed strong sequence similarity to AF-4, a gene that is translocated in t(4;11)(q21;q23) acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In t(4;11) ALL, the AF-4 gene at 4q21 is translocated into the MLL locus at 11q23, resulting in the expression of an MLL/AF-4 fusion protein that is the presumptive oncoprotein. AF-4 and LAF-4 are homologous throughout their coding regions, yet neither protein is related to previously cloned genes. Human LAF-4 readily hybridized with genes in mouse and chicken, thus showing that this gene family has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. In mouse tissues, LAF-4 mRNA was found to be present at highest levels in lymphoid tissues, present at lower levels in brain and lung, and absent from other tissues. In human and mouse lymphoid cell lines, LAF-4 expression was highest in pre-B cells, intermediate in mature B cells, and absent in plasma cells, thus pointing to a potential regulatory role for LAF-4 in lymphoid development. Antibodies to LAF-4 showed it to be a nuclear protein that showed an uneven, granular immunofluorescence pattern. In vitro-translated LAF-4 was able to bind strongly to double-stranded DNA cellulose. Furthermore, both LAF-4 and AF-4 had domains that activated transcription strongly when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, the AF-4 transactivation domain is retained in the MLL/AF-4 fusion protein; thus, it may contribute to the transforming potential of the oncoprotein. Therefore, the cloning of LAF-4 has defined a new family of potential regulatory proteins that may function in lymphoid development and oncogenesis.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"AF-4 transactivation domain\\", \\"MLL\\", \\"GAL4 DNA-binding domain\\", \\"lymphoid nuclear\\", \\"LAF-4\\", \\"AF-4\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

The human Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare neurological and behavioural disorder, affecting only males, which is caused by an inherited deficiency in the level of activity of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). How the resulting alterations in purine metabolism lead to the severe symptoms characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan patients is still not understood. No mutations at the Hprt locus leading to loss of activity have been described in laboratory animals. To derive an animal model for the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, we have used cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, mutagenized by retroviral insertion and selected for loss of HPRT activity, to construct chimaeric mice. Two clonal lines carrying different mutant Hprt alleles have given rise to germ cells in chimaeras, allowing the derivation of strains of mutant mice having the same biochemical defect as Lesch-Nyhan patients. Male mice carrying the mutant alleles are viable and analysis of their cells shows a total lack of HPRT activity..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"inherited deficiency\\", \\"Lesch-Nyhan\\", \\"Lesch-Nyhan syndrome\\", \\"neurological and behavioural disorder\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Postprandial metabolic derangements are one of the risk factors of cardiovascular disease in humans. Insulin resistance and/or impaired early-phase insulin secretion are major determinants of postprandial metabolic derangements. In this study, we investigated the potential utility of combination therapy with vildagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor and nateglinide, a rapid-onset/short-duration insulinotropic agent, for the treatment of postprandial metabolic derangements in Zucker Fatty (ZF) rats, an animal model of obesity with insulin resistance. ZF rats fed twice daily with or without high fat diet (HFD) were given vehicle, 50 mg/kg of nateglinide, 10 mg/kg of vildagliptin, or both for 6 weeks. Combination therapy with nateglinide and vildagliptin for 2 weeks ameliorated postprandial hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevation of free fatty acid in ZF rats fed with HFD. 6-week treatment with nateglinide and vildagliptin not only increased hepatic levels of phosphorylated forkhead box protein 1A (FOXO1A), but also reduced triglyceride contents in the liver. Combination therapy also prevented the loss of pancreatic islet mass in ZF rats fed with HFD. These observations demonstrate that combination therapy with nateglinide and vildagliptin may improve postprandial metabolic derangements probably by ameliorating early phase of insulin secretion and hepatic insulin resistance, respectively, in ZF rats fed with HFD. Since combination therapy with nateglinide and vildagliptin restored the decrease in pancreatic beta cell mass , our present findings suggest that combination therapy could be a promising therapeutic strategy for postprandial dysmetabolism associated with obese and insulin resistance .sentence: Since combination therapy with nateglinide and vildagliptin restored the decrease in pancreatic beta cell mass , our present findings suggest that combination therapy could be a promising therapeutic strategy for postprandial dysmetabolism associated with obese and insulin resistance .","answer":"[[\\"nateglinide\\", \\"vildagliptin\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

[5b, 5c, 6] While this can be rationalized by a purely kinetic effect, there is also evidence that a wavelength-controlled generation of excited species with different oxidation potentials could be responsible for this phenomenon. CN-OA-m has a strong absorption up to ~460 nm and a comparably weaker absorption band up to ~700 nm, which were ascribed as the π-π* and n-π* electron transitions, respectively (Figure 1, A). [7] The selective induction of the n-π* electron transition using long wavelengths (525 nm) should result in electron holes with a lower oxidation potential compared to irradiation using blue light (440 nm). The choice of the wavelength should not affect the reduction potential of the electron that is promoted into the valence band. Although such a behavior was previously suggested, [7] there is, to the best of our knowledge, no report that applies this concept for controlling the selectivity of chemical reactions.</p><p>We hypothesised that such a strategy would allow us to induce a photocatalytic reaction of a substrate with green light selectively in the presence of a second compound that is only photo-oxidized when shorter wavelengths are used. The photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of benzylic sp 3 C-H bonds, which is feasible with other members of the carbon nitride family and blue light irradiation, [8] served as a model reaction for our initial studies. In a series of experiments, we were indeed able to show that only blue light results in the desired carbonyl products and no reaction occurs at longer wavelengths (Figure 1, B). Carbon nitrides are used to catalyse the formation of O 2 and H 2 via water oxidation [9] and the production of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and alcohols, which requires the reduction of O 2 . [10] Hydrogen peroxide can then be used to fuel the enantioselective biocatalytic hydroxylation of ethylbenzene derivatives by the unspecific peroxygenase [11] (UPO) from A. aegerita [12] (AaeUPO). [13] We hypothesized that a chromoselective activation of CN-OA-m with green light enables the selective formation of H 2 O 2 in the presence of ethylbenzene (1) and the AaeUPO, which in turn catalyses the asymmetric hydroxylation of 1 (Figure 2). Performing the reaction in tricine buffer using 528 nm LEDs indeed resulted in a high selectivity towards (R)-1-phenylethanol formation [(R)-2a, up to 3.8 mM, 98% ee] with low amounts (3%) of acetophenone (3a). When the same reaction was carried out using shorter wavelengths, 3a became the main product, thus supporting our hypothesis. Ketone (3a) formation was also the preferred reaction in the presence of blue light in phosphate buffer. . Influence of different wavelengths and buffers on the photoenzymatic hydroxylation of ethylbenzene; reaction conditions: AaeUPO (25 nM), ethylbenzene (10 mM), CN-OA-m (2 mg mL -1 ), MeOH (250 mM), KPi (100 mM, pH 7.5) or tricine (100 mM, pH 7.5), 455 nm (1440 µmol photons m -2 s -1 ) or 528 nm (1330 µmol photons m -2 s -1 ), 30 °C, 8 h.</p><p>It was previously shown that UPOs are deactivated in the presence of blue light, a photocatalyst and O 2 due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that harm the enzyme. [14] Consequently, one might expect that green light might be less harmful to the UPO and lead to higher conversions in comparison to blue light. To investigate this aspect, UPO and CN-OA-m were incubated for one hour in the presence of oxygen and green or blue light, before 1a was added (Figure S46). The mixture incubated at longer wavelengths indeed led to a higher conversion for the asymmetric hydroxylation after addition of 1a.</p><p>The milder conditions subsequently allowed an extension of the substrate scope for AaeUPO (Scheme 2). Nine additional substrates were converted with high stereoselectivity (>98% e.e.) to the corresponding alcohols with concentrations of 1.0-6.0 mM. None of these ethylbenzene derivatives has been transformed with AaeUPO using an in situ H 2 O 2 generation system before.</p><p>Ethylbenzenes bearing a methyl-substituent in the ortho-or meta-position were hydroxylated with 99% regioselectivity at the ethyl group to give the desired chiral alcohols (R)-2b-c. This ability to distinguish between a methyl and an ethyl group has not been reported before. Acetophenone substituted with ethyl in the para-position (1i) allowed to access a bi-functionalised chiral hydroxyketone 2i, which is otherwise difficult to make. The same is true for 2j. Recycling experiments further showed that CN-OA-m can be reused by centrifugation and one washing step with water. CN-OA-m was reused three times after drying at room temperature (Figure S47-49).</p><p>Transferring the photo-chemo-enzymatic hydroxylation from a total volume of 1 mL in 1.5 mL glass vials successfully to a larger scale (7 mL volume, 10 mL tubes) in another photoreactor (provided by GlaxoSmithKline, S5), [15] showed the robustness and reproducibility of the approach. The hydroxylation of 1a worked equally well giving up to 7.5 mM of (R)-2a.</p><p>Finally, we sought to design a photo-chemo-biocatalytic cascade that yields the corresponding (S)enantiomers by taking advantage of the chromoselective activation of CN-OA-m (Scheme 3). The bluelight mediated formation of ketone 3a from 1a proceeds smoothly in KPi buffer and was successfully coupled with a subsequent biocatalytic reduction using an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-A) from Rhodococcus ruber. [16] The optimized two-step one-pot procedure led to 2.5 mM (S)-2a with an e.e. of 93%. The lower e.e. obtained in the photochemo-enzymatic cascade compared to previous reports by ADH-A (e.e. 99%), [17] can be explained by the formation of a small amount of rac-1-phenylethanol during the photocatalytic reaction under blue light irradiation. This cascade represents a stereocomplementary pathway compared to the pathway with AaeUPO using the same photocatalyst. Interestingly, it was noticed that MeOH was not required for the reaction to hydroxylate ethylbenzene with AaeUPO. Without MeOH the same concentration of product was detected. Thus, the reaction is possible without a sacrificial electron donor like MeOH or formate, which is in contrast to some examples reported in literature. [13a, 18] For practical reasons, MeOH was still used since it simplified the preparation of stock solutions of the hydrophobic substrates.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first example in which it was possible to utilize the same photocatalyst to either oxidize an organic substrate or to provide in situ formed H 2 O 2 without photocatalytic oxidation of the substrate, all controlled only by the choice of the wavelength. In summary, we showed that electron holes with different oxidation potentials can be generated using a carbon nitride material by simply changing the photon energy. In the presence of blue light this enables the oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenone in an aqueous solution. Using green light the organic substrate does not react and only H 2 O 2 is formed. This was the key for designing chromoselective photo-chemo-enzymatic cascade reactions. Selective hydrogen peroxide generation enabled the hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to give (R)-1-phenylethanol (R)-2a using an UPO, whereas the photocatalytic oxidation to acetophenone was coupled with an enantioselective reduction to (S)-1-phenylethanol (S)-2a by an ADH. Additionally, low energy photons (green light) increased the stability of UPO compared to blue light, which permitted the expansion of the substrate scope of this enzyme. Controlling the outcome of a photocatalytic reaction merely through the choice of wavelength employed presents exciting new options in reaction design and could be an important new tool for controlling reactivity and stereoselection in organic synthesis.</p>","answer":"Controlling the selectivity of a chemical reaction with external stimuli is common in thermal processes, but rare in visible-light photocatalysis. Here we show that the redox potential of a carbon nitride photocatalyst (CN-OA-m) can be tuned by changing the irradiation wavelength to generate electron holes with different oxidation potentials. This tuning was the key to realizing photo-chemoenzymatic cascades that give either the (S)-or the (R)-enantiomer of phenylethanol. In combination with an unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita, green light irradiation of CN-OA-m led to the enantioselective hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to (R)-1-phenylethanol (99% ee). In contrast, blue light irradiation triggered the photocatalytic oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenone, which in turn was enantioselectively reduced with an alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus ruber to form (S)-1phenylethanol (93% ee).Many parameters influence the selectivity of a chemical reaction. [1] For instance, catalytic reactions can be controlled by varying the catalyst/coordinated ligands, directing groups [2] or by tuning external parameters (Scheme 1, A). [1a, 3] The selectivity of photochemical reactions varies with different wavelengths, [4] but examples that use this for visible-light photocatalysis are rare. [5] In one example, selective control between either a one-or two-fold substitution of 1,3,5tribromobenzene with N-methylpyrrole using Rhodamin 6G (Rh-6G) as photocatalyst was demonstrated (Scheme 1, B) [5a] This selectivity switch is explained by the chromoselective generation of two photocatalytic species that differ in their reduction potential. Green light irradiation results in a common photoredox cycle and the expected mono-substituted product. In case of blue light, the Rh-6G radical anion, which is formed after quenching of Rh-6G* with a sacrificial electron donor, can absorb a second photon, resulting in the highly reducing Rh-6G. -* species that enables the formation of the di-substituted product. [5a] Here we show that electron holes with different oxidation potentials can be generated using a heterogeneous carbon nitride (CN) catalyst by changing the incident photon energy. The combination of this strategy with biocatalysis allowed us to selectively produce the (S)-or (R)-enantiomer of a chiral alcohol in photo-chemo-enzymatic reaction sequences (Scheme 1C).Scheme 1.

We previously identified a negative feedback loop that modulates T cell activation, involving phosphorylation of Ser376 of SLP76 by the hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1). However, the physiological relevance of this regulatory mechanism was still unknown. To address this question, we generated a SLP76-S376A - expressing knock-in mouse strain and investigated the effects of Ser376 mutation on T cell development and function. We report here that SLP76-S376A - expressing mice exhibit normal thymocyte development and no detectable phenotypic alterations in mature T cell subsets or other lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages. Biochemical analyses revealed that mutant T cells were hypersensitive to TCR stimulation. Indeed, phosphorylation of several signaling proteins, including SLP76 itself, phospholipase Cγ1 and the protein kinases AKT and ERK1 / 2, was increased. These modifications correlated with increased Th1-type and decreased Th2-type cytokine production by SLP76-S376A T cells, but did not result in significant changes of proliferative capacity nor activation - induced cell death susceptibility. Hence, our results reveal that SLP76-Ser376 phosphorylation does not mediate all HPK1 -dependent regulatory effects in T cells but it fine-tunes helper T cell responses.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"helper T cell\\", \\"T cell subsets\\", \\"SLP76-S376A\\", \\"lymphoid\\", \\"Th2-type\\", \\"myeloid\\", \\"Th1-type\\", \\"T cells\\", \\"Helper T Cell\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"activation\\", \\"Ser376 mutation\\", \\"cytokine production\\", \\"hypersensitive\\", \\"cell death\\", \\"expressing\\", \\"thymocyte development\\", \\"Phosphorylation\\", \\"function\\", \\"T cell activation\\", \\"phosphorylation\\", \\"stimulation\\", \\"Function\\", \\"signal transduction\\", \\"proliferative capacity\\", \\"mutant\\", \\"T Cell Development\\", \\"T cell development\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"HPK1\\", \\"ERK1\\", \\"T cell receptor\\", \\"phospholipase Cu03b31\\", \\"SLP76\\", \\"2\\", \\"adapter protein\\", \\"SLP76-Ser376\\", \\"Serine\\", \\"Ser376\\", \\"signaling proteins\\", \\"TCR\\", \\"protein kinases AKT\\", \\"hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"detectable\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"mouse strain\\", \\"mice\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"modifications\\", \\"capacity\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"Biochemical analyses\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"knock-in\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

[1][2][3] Apart from the environment (solvent, pressure, temperature, composition, evaporation rate, etc.) also the intrinsic features (intra-and intermolecular interactions of conformers, tautomerism, different solvates forms, etc.) need to be taken into account for designing the robust process aimed at the desired polymorphic form. 2,4,5 Precisely defined technological procedures are applied for obtaining required forms of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, food, plastics, dyes and various other products. Despite a considerable progress in the crystal-structure prediction, [6][7][8][9] in most cases, the experimental screening of polymorphs provides the most reliable information about crystal forms of compounds.</p><p>Generally, the crystal form results from the initial aggregation of molecules, either primary or secondary nucleation, and from the time-dependent crystal growth, either dynamic or kinetic. 1,2,5,10 The dynamic crystallizations proceed slowly, in the nearly equilibrated systems, whereas the kinetic crystallizations take place off the thermodynamic equilibrium, for example in quickly cooled molten or dissolved compounds. The dynamic and kinetic crystallizations often lead to different polymorphs. Some compounds, irrespective of thermodynamic conditions of their nucleation, have been obtained in only one crystalline form, for example naphthalene and CS2. 11,12 The thermodynamic conditions of nucleation can be extended by subjecting the sample to the high-pressure, which increases the range of accessible temperature, high excited states, rota-vibrations, conformations or disorder.</p><p>Presently we report a simple method of high-pressure nucleation, capable of generating new polymorphs, in this case study on bis-3-nitrophenyl disulphide (3-NO2-PhS)2. The family of biphenyl disulphides is important due to their applications as drugs, 13 sensors, 14 lubricants, 15 polymers; [16][17][18][19] in organic reactions bisfenyldisulphides are substrates as a source of PhS substituents; 20,21 and precursors leading to supramolecular systems. 22,23 Recently we showed di-p-tolyl disulphide (4-CH3-PhS)2 is capable compensating the stress and absorbing the energy of compression, which explain at the molecular level the lubricating performance of this class of compounds. 24 We also observed that exchange reaction between bis(4-chlorophenyl)disulphide (4-Cl-PhS)2 with bis(2nitrophenyl)disulphide (2-NO2-PhS)2 yields a low-density polymorph A 4-Cl-PhSSPh-2-NO2 at high-pressure conditions, and also at catalyst-promoted reactions at normal conditions. [25][26][27] The 3-NO2 analogue, of those disulphides is known, and commercially available in the centrosymmetric form of monoclinic space group C2/c, with molecules located on the 2-fold axes (hereafter referred as polymorph α). 28 Our systematic study on (3-NO2-PhS)2 combines the effects of primary nucleation with dynamic and kinetic crystallization, viewed from the perspective of high-pressure conditions. We observed that the high-pressure nucleation yields two new polymorphs, labelled β and γ, both with density lower compared to that of polymorph α obtained at the ambient conditions, sheds new light on empirical Ostwald's rule of stages and Wallach's rule relating the densities of enantiomers and racemates.</p><p>Well known are the structural features usually valid for the polymorphs obtained under kinetic regime: (i) their symmetry is lower; (ii) their Z' number is higher; and (iii) they are less dense, when compared to the dynamic-regime polymorphs. It is also characteristic of conformational polymorphs that (iv) the kinetic polymorphs are built of conformers of higher potential energy (Ep) than those of the dynamic polymorphs.</p><p>Both polymorphs β and γ of (3-NO2-PhS)2 are text-book examples of kinetic polymorphs, with all their characteristic features (i-iv). Both forms crystallize in the chiral space group P21, which is a subgroup of space group C2/c and their density is significantly lower than that of polymorph α (Figure 2, Table 1). The disulphide molecules are conformationally flexible and their 'soft' torsion angles about bonds C-S and S-S can be modified by momentary environment changes in the liquid and by crystal field in the solid state. The Z' number is 0.5 in dynamic polymorph α, while in kinetic polymorphs β and γ the Z' number is 4. In polymorph β four independent conformers (A, B, C and D) are located at general positions, in pseudocentrosymmetric relations between conformers A to C, and B to D. This relation is most prominently visible for torsion angles τ, τ2 and τ3 (Table 2). Similar pseudo-symmetry relations are also apparent in the structure of polymorph γ.</p><p>The (3-NO2-PhS)2 molecule has two favoured conformations; in the lower-Ep (LE) conformer angels τ, τ2 and τ3 are close to 90°, 0° and 0°, whereas in the somewhat higher Ep (HE) conformer these angels are close to 90°, 0° and 165°, respectively. Figure 1c and Table 2 show that polymorph α is built LE conformers, in polymorph β half of conformers is of LE and half of HE, and in polymorphs γ only HE conformers are present. The average conformational energies of polymorph α, β, and γ are 1.18, 1.57 and 3.42 kJmol -1 , as shown in the inset in Figure 1c. In all polymorphs there are equal numbers of rotational enantiomers (Table 2) and in this respect they are true kryptoracemates. 29</p>Table 1. Selected crystal data of (3-NO2-PhS) polymorphs α, β and γ.<p>Apart from the molecular conformation the crystal structure and packing motifs in polymorph α of (3-NO2-PhS)2 strongly differ from those observed in isomers (2-NO2-PhS)2 and (4-NO2-PhS)2. In their crystals, molecules are linked into chains by C-H•••O hydrogen bond, absent α-(3-NO2-PhS)2 where sheets are formed through π-π stacking of aromatic rings. 28,30 On the other hand, in (3-NO2-PhS)2 polymorphs β and γ, the shortest intermolecular distances (Figure S2) mark a combination of various cohesion forces, involving hydrogen bonds C-H•••O, π-π stacking and S•••S contacts.</p><p>It is apparent that the conditions of nucleation affect the hierarchy of interactions in the crystal structure. It was demonstrated that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds are strongly modified under pressure, [31][32][33] when they have to compromise with the increased role of close packing. Most importantly, ambient pressure molecular crystals easily sublimate, melt and evaporate, but under high-pressure the temperature of the system can be increased to higher values, which increases the kinetic energy of molecular motion. According to Boltzmann's statistics for ideal gas molecules, their average kinetic energy increases linearly with temperature and is equal to kBT/2 (where kB is Boltzmann constant) per each degree of freedom. This kinetic energy at normal conditions is of the order of the Ep energy of cohesion forces in (3-NO2-PhS)2 and high temperature can easily destabilize these interactions (mainly C-H•••O, cf. Figure S2) and promote a variation of conformers in polymorphs β and γ. It is characteristic that the Ep values of these polymorphs nucleated at high temperature are higher, compared to the potential energy of the conformer present in polymorph α (Table 2). Indeed, our high-pressure high-temperature crystallizations yielded new polymorphic forms. The crystals obtained by the high-pressure kinetic crystallizations have all features of kinetic polymorphs listed above. Most surprisingly, these features of new highpressure polymorphs also include that their density is lower compared to the density of the dynamic polymorph α obtained at ambient pressure (Table 1). This counterinitiative result at first glance seems to contradict numerous high-pressure crystallizations and syntheses that led to high-density polymorphs. In fact, high-pressure techniques are generally aimed at obtaining harder, highdensity forms of crystals. 34 However, such crystallizations are performed slowly under the dynamic regime, allowing the system to equilibrate. Listed above all characteristic features (i-iv) of kinetic polymorphs can be rationalized in terms of the thermodynamic conditions of the crystallization process: (i) the low symmetry is a consequence of the conformational and orientational variety consistent with the high entropy of the system at high-temperature, which is also connected with (ii) the high Z' number; the high T also explains the high Ep states of excited molecules (compared to lower Ep conformer in the dynamic polymorph α).The quick crystallization leaves no sufficient time for the molecules to reorient or change the positions of substituents. Finally, the low density (iii) despite the high-pressure conditions, can result of several reasons: (a) the low-density polymorph is more compressible than the high-density one, hence their density difference diminishes with pressure; (b) the nucleation takes place at high temperature and high entropy strongly favouring the low-density form, because strong rota-vibrations require an additional space; and (c) the nucleation directs the crystallization leaving no space for other polymorphs, particularly that the crystallization is the fastest close to the melting curve.</p>Table 2. Torsion angles τ, τ2 and τ3 (cf. Figure 1) in the conformers present in polymorphs α (half molecule independent), β and γ (both with 4 independent molecules labelled A, B, C and D), as well as their potential energy ΔEp related to the fully optimized isolated conformer. LE -indicates low Ep and HE denotes high Ep conformer<p>It is convenient to heat sample under pressure, which increases the freezing point and hence moves the nucleation to the higher excitation region. Furthermore, high-pressure, the viscosity of the solution or melt significantly increases, 35 which hampers the rigid-molecule and internal reorientations and movements of molecules. These effects of viscosity are thus consistent with varied conformations and the Z' number increased. The increased viscosity expands the time scale for the kinetic crystallization. In other words, the kinetic process at highpressure is considerably slower than at 0.1 MPa. This 'extended' kinematic regime increases the likelihood of the nucleation of kinematic polymorphs. Then the growth of their seeds is favourably continued on lowering the temperature, which reduces the concertation of the solution to below the saturation and prevents the nucleation of other polymorphs, even when the process is slowed down to the dynamic regime.</p><p>Interestingly, all our attempts to obtain the kinetic polymorphs β and γ by mechanochemical methods, liquidassisted grinding (LAG) with acetonitrile and isopropanol, dry ball milling, failed. This contrasts with the successful production of heterodimeric low-density polymorph A of 4-Cl-PhSSPh-2-NO2, 36,37 but it also shows the importance of the high-entropy nucleation in the process of obtaining low-density polymorphs β and γ of (3-NO2-PhS)2.</p><p>To conclude, the high-pressure crystallization of lowdensity polymorphs β and γ of (3-NO2-PhS)2 provides new information about this counterinitiative phenomenon, previously considered as a sporadic event in the case of heterodimeric 4-Cl-PhSSPh-2-NO2, obtained as a product of high-pressure disulphide exchange reaction. 27 The highpressure coordinates added in the thermodynamic space to those of usually applied, temperature and concertation extend the space for the interpretation of mechanism leading to the formation of different polymorphs. The Ostwald's rule of stages appears as a natural consequence of the kinetic effect 'enhanced' under pressure. It can be noted that (3-NO2-PhS)2 low-density polymorphs β and γ are noncentrosymmetric, unlike polymorph α, which is consistent with Wallach's rule, stating that the density of racemates in higher than those of enantiomers. Numerous exemptions from Wallach's rule 38 can be regarded as a premonition that more experimental results and studies are needed for the rigorous description of the crystallization process, which still today is often considered to be more 'art' than 'science'. 1</p>ASSOCIATED CONTENT Supporting Information<p>Detailed experimental data including protocol for obtaining high-pressure nucleated polymorphs, single-crystals of polymorphs β and γ, the shortest intermolecular contacts plotted for all polymorphic forms, A, B, C and D conformers present in form β and γ, as well as the results of ball-mill experiments can be  find in Supporting Information.

This counterinitiative density relation results from the kinetic high-entropy nucleation, the work performed by pressure compensates the product of increased entropy and temperature. This high-entropy nucleation illustrates the molecular-scale mechanism of empirical Ostwald's rule of stages.

The mechanism for this interaction probably is adsorption of nitrofurantoin onto the surface of magnesium trisilicate. Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin. The resulting increase in nitrofurantoin serum levels may increase toxicity, and the decreased urinary levels could lessen its efficacy as a urinary tract antibacterial. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions As a result of the presence of nitrofurantoin, a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur.

One of the main advantages of such models is the strong semantic prior learned from a large collection of image-caption pairs. Such a prior learns, for instance, to bind the word “dog” with various instances of dogs that can appear in different poses and contexts in an image.While the synthesis capabilities of these models are unprecedented, they lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set, and synthesize novel renditions of those same subjects in different contexts. The main reason is that the expressiveness of their output domain is limited; even the most detailed textual description of an object may yield instances with different appearances.

ohio valley specialty , marietta , oh , usa ; www.ovsc.com ) or absorbent cotton which in our case was collected from cotton swabs purchased from dollar tree , a chain store everywhere in the usa .additional materials include regular agarose ( gel temperature 331.5 c and melt temperature 871.5 c ;

Human captioning typically captures the most prominent features of an object, but provides insufficient detail to reconstruct finer features like color patterns (e.g. of the teapot). In some cases (e.g. the skull mug) the object itself may be exceedingly difficult to describe through natural language. When provided with an image, DALLE-2 is able to recreate more appealing samples, particularly for well-known objects with limited detail (Aladdin’s lamp). However, it still struggles with unique details of personalized objects that the image encoder (CLIP) is unlikely to have seen (mug, teapot). In contrast, our method can successfully capture these finer details, and it does so using only a single word embedding. However, note that while our creations are more similar to the source objects, they are still variations that may differ from the source. Our evaluation results are summarized in Figure 10(a).We highlight four observations of particular interest:First, the semantic reconstruction quality of our method and many of the baselines is comparable to simply sampling random images from the training set.Second, the single-word method achieves comparable reconstruction quality, and considerably improved editability over all multi-word baselines.

Special-purpose constraint propagation algorithms frequently make implicit use of short supports -- by examining a subset of the variables, they can infer support (a justification that a variable-value pair still forms part of a solution to the constraint) for all other variables and values and save substantial work. Recently short supports have been used in general purpose prop-agators, and (when the constraint is amenable to short supports) speed ups of more than three orders of magnitude have been demonstrated. In this paper we present SHORTSTR2, a development of the Simple Tabular Reduction algorithm STR2 +. We show that SHORTSTR2 is complementary to the existing algorithms SHORTGAC and HAGGISGAC that exploit short supports, while being much simpler. When a constraint is amenable to short supports, the short support set can be exponentially smaller than the full-length support set. Therefore SHORTSTR2 can efficiently propagate many constraints that STR2 + can not even load into memory. We also show that SHORTSTR2 can be combined with a simple algorithm to identify short supports from full-length supports, to provide a superior drop-in replacement for STR2 +.","answer":"[[\\"SHORTSTR2\\", \\"drop-in replacement\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"SHORTSTR2\\", \\"short supports\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"drop-in replacement\\", \\"Simple Tabular Reduction algorithm STR2 +\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"full-length supports\\", \\"SHORTSTR2\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"Constraint propagation\\", \\"constraint programming\\", \\"PART-OF\\"], [\\"short support set\\", \\"full-length support set\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"full-length supports\\", \\"algorithm\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"SHORTGAC\\", \\"HAGGISGAC\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"algorithm\\", \\"SHORTSTR2\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"SHORTSTR2\\", \\"SHORTGAC\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"SHORTSTR2\\", \\"HAGGISGAC\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"Simple Tabular Reduction algorithm STR2 +\\", \\"SHORTSTR2\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"algorithm\\", \\"short supports\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

The present prevalence rate of GBS carriers among parturients in the western Galilee in Israel is unknown.AIM: A prospective study of the GBS carrier rate according to origin and gestational age in the western Galilee in Israel.(METHODS) A prospective study including 700 pregnant women. All women were screened for carriage of GBS by vaginal and rectal cultures.(RESULTS) Sixteen percent of the parturients were found to be GBS colonized. The prevalence of GBS was 13.7% in Jewish women and 19% in Arab women, P=0.038. The women were also divided into two groups according to the gestational age one group included 414 women in 24-37 weeks gestation, and the other group included 286 women in term pregnancy. No difference was found in the rate of GBS carriers between the two gestational age groups.Question:Is there an increase in the incidence of gbs carrier rates among pregnant women in northern Israel?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a well-studied therapeutic target, though its characteristically rapid desensitization complicates the development of drugs with specific agonist effects. Moreover, some experimental compounds such as GTS-21 (2,4diMeOBA), a derivative of the α7-selective partial agonist benzylidene anabaseine (BA), produce a prolonged residual desensitization (RD) in which the receptor remains non-activatable long after the drug has been removed from extracellular solution. In contrast, the desensitization caused by GTS-21's dihydroxy metabolite (2,4diOHBA) is relatively short-lived. RD is hypothetically due to stable binding of the ligand to the receptor in its desensitized state. We can attribute the reduction in RD to a single BA hydroxyl group on the 4' benzylidene position. Computational prediction derived from homology modeling showed the serine36 (S36) residue of α7 as a reasonable candidate for point-to-point interaction between BA compounds and the receptor. Through evaluating the activity of BA and simple derivatives on wild-type and mutant α7 receptors, it was observed that the drug-receptor pairs which were capable of hydrogen bonding at residue 36 exhibited significantly less stable desensitization. Further experiments involving the type II positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU-120596 showed that the various BA compounds' preference to induce either a PAM-sensitive (D(s)) or PAM-insensitive (D(i)) desensitized state is concentration dependent and suggested that both states are destabilized by S36 H-bonding. These results indicate that the fine-tuning of agonists for specific interaction with S36 can facilitate the development of therapeutics with targeted effects on ion channel desensitization properties and conformational state stability.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"dihydroxy\\", \\"2,4diOHBA\\", \\"serine\\", \\"2,4diMeOBA\\", \\"benzylidene anabaseines\\", \\"hydroxyl\\", \\"acetylcholine\\", \\"benzylidene anabaseine\\", \\"hydrogen\\", \\"GTS-21\\", \\"H\\", \\"PNU-120596\\", \\"benzylidene\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to study Cu(II) dynamic behavior in a doped biological model crystal, bis(l-histidinato)cadmium dihydrate, in order to gain better insight into copper site stability in metalloproteins. Temperature-dependent changes in the low temperature X-band EPR spectra became visible around 100 K and continued up to room temperature. The measured 298 K g-tensor (principal values: 2.17, 2.16, 2.07) and copper hyperfine coupling tensor (principal values: -260, -190, -37 MHz) were similar to the average of the 77 K tensor values pertaining to two neighboring histidine binding sites. The observed temperature dependence was interpreted using Anderson's theory of motional narrowing, where the magnetic parameters for the different states are averaged as the copper rapidly hops between sites. The EPR pattern was also found to undergo a sharp sigmoidal-shaped, temperature-dependent conversion between two species with a critical temperature Tc ≈ 160 K. The species below Tc hops between the two low temperature site patterns, and the one above Tc represents an average of the molecular spin Hamiltonian coupling tensors of the two 77 K sites. In addition, the low and high temperature species hop between one another, contributing to the dynamic averaging. Spectral simulations using this 4-state model determined a hop rate between the two low temperature sites νh4 = 4.5 × 10(8) s(-1) and between the low and high temperature states νh2 = 1.7 × 10(8) s(-1) at 160 K. An Arrhenius relationship of hop rate and temperature gave energy barriers of ΔE4 = 389 cm(-1) and ΔE2 = 656 cm(-1) between the two low temperature sites and between the low and high temperature states, respectively.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"histidine\\", \\"Copper\\", \\"Bis(l-histidinato)cadmium Dihydrate\\", \\"copper\\", \\"Cu(II)\\", \\"bis(l-histidinato)cadmium dihydrate\\"]}"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

If we start by considering languages with a labeled attachment score of 85% or higher, they are characterized by high precision and recall for root nodes, typically 95/90, and by a graceful degradation of attachment score as arcs grow longer, typically 95â90â85, for arcs of length 1, 2 and 3â6. before we turn to Swedish and Turkish, focusing on recall and precision of root nodes, as a reflection of global syntactic structure, and on attachment score as a function of arc length.Citation Sentence:Typical examples are Bulgarian ( Simov et al. , 2005 ; Simov and Osenova , 2003 ) , Chinese ( Chen et al. , 2003 ) , Danish ( Kromann , 2003 ) , and Swedish ( Nilsson et al. , 2005 ) .Context after the citation:Japanese (Kawata and Bartels, 2000), despite a very high accuracy, is different in that attachment score drops from 98% to 85%, as we go from length 1 to 2, which may have something to do with the data consisting of transcribed speech with very short utterances. A second observation is that a high proportion of non-projective structures leads to fragmentation in the parser output, reflected in lower precision for roots. This is noticeable for German (Brants et al., 2002) and Portuguese (Afonso et al., 2002), which still have high overall accuracy thanks to very high attachment scores, but much more conspicuous for Czech (BÂ¨ohmovÂ´a et al., 2003), Dutch (van der Beek et al., 2002) and Slovene (DËzeroski et al., 2006), where root precision drops more drastically to about 69%, 71% and 41%, respectively, and root recall is also affected negatively.

INTRODUCTION Patients with diabetes complicated by hypertension and microalbuminuria have elevated cardiovascular risk , and controlling blood pressure in these patients is an urgent clinical priority . The present study aimed to examine the effects of a fixed-dose combination of antihypertensives on blood pressure and microalbuminuria . METHODS Patients with type 2 diabetes , mild-to-moderate hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure 85-105 mmHg , systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg , and 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure > 130 mmHg ) , and microalbuminuria were randomized to 1 year of doubleblind treatment with fixed-dose manidipine/delapril ( n=54 ) or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) ( n=56 ) . RESULTS Blood pressure was significantly reduced at 1 year in both groups ( -22.2/-14.6 mmHg and -19.5/-14.3 mmHg , for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively , P < 0.001 for each ) , with no significant between-group difference . Reductions in microalbuminuria occurred in both groups , with mean changes at 1 year of -3.9 mg/mmol creatinine ( 95 % CI -5.3 , -2.5 ) for manidipine/delapril ( P < 0.001 vs. baseline ) and -2.7 mg/mmol creatinine ( 95 % CI -4.0 , -1.3 ) for losartan/HCTZ ( P < 0.001 vs. baseline and P=0.199 between groups ) . Glycemia over the 1-year study was largely unaffected ; the blood glucose concentration was reduced from baseline with manidipine/delapril , although not statistically significant ( mean change -0.2 mmol/L , P=0.064 ) . Both treatments were well tolerated , with discontinuation for adverse events for one ( 1.9 % ) patient in the manidipine/delapril group and two ( 3.6 % ) in the losartan/HCTZ group .

To evaluate and compare the performance of two calcium alginate dressings in the management of venous ulcers, a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study was conducted among 19 outpatients at two wound clinics in California. Ten patients (53%) were treated with Alginate A and nine patients (47%) with Alginate B. Dressings were changed weekly and patients were followed for a maximum of 6 weeks or until the venous ulcer no longer required the use of an alginate dressing. At each dressing change, the wound was assessed and dressing performance evaluated. Absorbency of exudate, patient comfort during wear, ease of removal, adherence to wound bed, dressing residue following initial irrigation, patient comfort during removal, ease of application, and conformability were assessed. Patients using Alginate A experienced significantly less foul odor (P = 0.02) and less denuded skin (P = 0.04) than Alginate B at follow-up wound assessments. With the exception of conformability, Alginate A was rated significantly better than Alginate B (P less than or equal to 0.05) in all dressing performance assessments. No significant healing differences were observed. As the different performance characteristics of various calcium alginate dressings become more obvious in clinical practice, further study is warranted to determine their optimal effectiveness.Title 2:Use of a fibrous dressing in exuding leg ulcers.Abstract 2:In a multicentre, prospective, randomised trial of 44 patients with exuding leg ulcers, a new hydrofibre dressing was compared with an alginate dressing in terms of dressing performance, patient comfort, safety and cost-effectiveness. The groups were well matched with regard to sex and age. A statistically significant difference between treatment groups was observed in mean wear time, with a longer wear time of four days observed in the hydrofibre dressing group compared to three days in the alginate group. The hydrofibre dressing group therefore demonstrated a significantly lower frequency of dressing changes required per week. Significantly more patients achieved a seven-day wear time with the hydrofibre dressing than with the alginate dressing. There was no difference with regard to percentage change in ulcer area. Cost-effectiveness was based on the cost of dressings, compression therapy and nursing time to achieve a healed wound. However, because of small patient numbers, it was difficult to make an accurate comparison. This study suggests that the hydrofibre dressing may have clinical benefits that merit further investigation with larger patient numbers.","answer":"The current evidence base does not suggest that alginate dressings are more or less effective in the healing of venous leg ulcers than hydrocolloid or plain non-adherent dressings, and there is no evidence to indicate a difference between different proprietary alginate dressings. However, the RCTs in this area are considered to be of low or unclear methodological quality. Further, good quality evidence is required from well designed and rigorously conducted RCTs that employ - and clearly report on - methods to minimise bias, prior to any definitive conclusions being made regarding the efficacy of alginate dressings in the management of venous leg ulcers."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] The synthesis and characterisation of nitrogen-doped fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, graphene and graphene nanoribbons have revealed that nitrogen-doped carbon nanostructures are promising materials for electrocatalysis, [2-9, 11, 13-14] energy conversion and storage, [2, 4-7, 10, 13-14] and sensing, [13][14] among others. The synthesis of nitrogendoped nanocarbons still presents challenges for controlling: (i) the inclusion percent and the distribution of nitrogen within the graphitic lattice; (ii) the bonding of the nitrogen atoms, as principally three types of nitrogen (pyridinic, graphitic, and pyrrolic) can exist; (iii) wall-selectivity, in the case of layered nanocarbons (e.g. double-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, or stacked layers of graphene). Among the above-mentioned challenges, wall-selectivity has received little attention [15][16][17] and provides numerous opportunities for establishing and understanding the fundamental properties of nitrogen-doped nanocarbons and for developing their potential applications. [3] Scheme 1. Synthetic approach for the preparation of coaxial N-SWNT@SWNT. Herein, we report a wall-and hybridisation-selective synthetic methodology to produce double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT) with an inner tube doped exclusively with graphitic nitrogen atoms (Scheme 1). Such coaxial carbon nanotubes have been prepared in two steps by using a nitrogen-rich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, namely dicyanopyrazophenanthroline 1, as feedstock and empty single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) as reaction vessels. Firstly, dicyanopyrazophenanthroline 1 is sublimed into the internal cavity of SWNT.</p><p>Then, the filled SWNTs (1@SWNT) are exposed to an electron beam or thermally treated so the encapsulated dicyanopyrazophenanthroline 1 converts into a nanotube to produce DWNT with an inner nanotube doped with nitrogen (N-SWNT@SWNT). The graphitic nitrogen content in the inner tube can be controlled with the annealing temperature to reach values up to 100%, as demonstrated by a combination of Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and cyclic voltammetry.</p><p>Dicyanopyrazophenanthroline 1 was selected as feedstock because of the high C/N ratio (16/6), the fact that all the nitrogen atoms are already incorporated in the π framework as sp 2 or sp nitrogen; and its ability to sublime.</p><p>Dicyanopyrazophenanthroline 1 was synthesised following a reported procedure [18] and then to ensure a high level of purity it was further purified by chromatography on alumina and reprecipitation (see experimental procedures in supporting information).</p><p>Opened SWNT were filled with 1 by heating a mixture of the compound with SWNT in 10 -6 mbar vacuum at 120 ºC. HR-TEM imaging confirmed that the molecules become encapsulated inside the SWNT, yielding 1@SWNT (Figure 1). The molecules of 1 are disordered within the cavity of the SWNT, although in some areas, the molecules appear to stack within the nanotube cavity (  HR-TEM imaging clearly showed the propensity of 1 to convert into a nanotube.</p><p>To investigate in more detail the structural features of N-SWNT@SWNT, bulk filling and annealing experiments were carried out with SWNT with diameters 1.4-1.7 nm in order to obtain sufficient material for structural characterisation. The filling of SWNT with 1 and the transformation process of 1@SWNT into N-SWNT@SWNT by annealing at different temperatures was monitored by resonance Raman spectroscopy and the samples were further analysed by HR-TEM, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).</p><p>Figure 1 shows the Raman spectra of the pristine SWNT, 1@SWNT and N-SWNT@SWNT formed by annealing at different temperatures. In all the spectra, the G-band, D-band, 2D-band and radial breathing mode (RBM) bands typical of SWNT can be clearly observed. In the spectrum of 1@SWNT, additional Raman bands corresponding to those of the spectra of 1 were detected (Figure S1). The Raman spectra show the appearance of new bands in the RBM region, of a new D-band and of a new contribution (shoulder) in the 2D-band with the increasing annealing temperatures. In the case of the samples obtained at 1300 and 1400 ºC, the new bands in the RBM region are consistent with the formation of an internal tube within the SWNT cavity (N-SWNT@SWNT). Furthermore, the Raman spectrum of 1@SWNT exhibits a nitrile band consistent with the structure of precursor 1 that disappears upon annealing (Figure S1). To confirm that the precursor molecules are inside SWNT and that the new inner nanotube grows coaxially to the host nanotube, 1@SWNT and N-SWNT@SWNT were investigated by HR-TEM. The images of 1@SWNT evidenced excellent filling rates of molecules inside the SWNT cavities (Figures 3a and S2). Also, the images of N-SWNT@SWNT samples obtained at 1300ºC and 1400ºC showed long continuous structures within the SWNT consistent with the formation of wellstructure inner nanotubes (Figures 3b and S3). In addition, caps on internal nanotubes can be clearly observed similar to those formed under the electron beam. EDX provide the first evidence of incorporation of nitrogen in the nanotube with a new emerging peak of nitrogen that is not observed in the empty SWNT sample (Figure 3c).</p><p>The nitrogen inclusion percentage and bonding on 1@SWNT and N-SWNT@SWNT was investigated by XPS (Figures 3d and S4; Table 1). The N1s region of the XPS spectrum of 1@SWNT indicates a 10.6% of nitrogen present, distributed between pyridinic, nitrilic and graphitic nitrogen. The percentage of pyridinic and nitrilic nitrogen is higher than that of graphitic nitrogen, which agrees with the structure of molecule 1. The presence of graphitic nitrogen on 1@SWNT was ascribed to the partial decomposition of 1 within the SWNT because of the high temperature used (300 ºC) during the filling and cleaning processes.</p><p>Importantly, the XPS spectrum of N-SWNT@SWNT obtained after annealing at 1300 ºC confirms the incorporation of 0.9% of nitrogen and shows the disappearance of nitrilic nitrogen -in agreement with Raman -and a higher proportion of graphitic nitrogen versus pyridinic nitrogen. The measured nitrogen incorporation indicates 2.4% of nitrogen in the inner tube (Table 1 and Table S1), which equates to two or more nitrogen atoms per nm in length. Remarkably, the N-SWNT@SWNT obtained at 1400 ºC shows only a contribution of graphitic nitrogen, while the total nitrogen inclusion percentage is virtually unchanged, which imply the formation of an internal nanotube doped exclusively with graphitic nitrogen.  Nitrilic [b] Pyridinic [b] Graphitic [b] 1@SWNT [a] Estimated assuming an external tube diameter of 1.4 nm, a 100% filling (Table S1).</p><p>[b] Measured by XPS.</p><p>The electrochemical properties of N-SWNT@SWNT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry in a rotating disk electrode (Figures 4a and S5; Table S2). The voltammetric curves in an argon saturated aqueous 0.1 M KOH solution show no redox processes, but in an oxygen saturated solution, the voltammograms reveal a reduction wave characteristic of the oxygen reduction reaction, [2-4, 6-7, 9, 11, 13-14] in which the presence and bonding of nitrogen atoms are directly linked to the electrode potentials. [19][20][21][22][23][24][25] The glassy carbon (GC) electrodes containing N-SWNT@SWNT show more anodic potentials at 1 mAcm -2 than those containing pristine SWNT (0.564 V vs NHE). Furthermore, the potential at 1 mAcm -2 of the N-SWNT@SWNT (1300 ºC) with 83.8% of graphitic nitrogen (0.580 V vs NHE) is more anodic than that of N-SWNT@SWNT (1400 ºC) with 100.0% of graphitic nitrogen (0.685 V vs NHE). The voltammograms confirm that the presence of graphitic nitrogen shifts the potential to more anodic values and also show that the nitrogen atoms of the internal nanotube are able to modulate the electrochemical properties even if they are encapsulated by the external carbon nanotube. To investigate if the internal nitrogen-doped nanotube is able transduce some of its properties across the external one, computational modelling was performed on semiconducting and metallic DWNT models with different doping degrees in the internal tube (Table S3). First, the extra electron of nitrogen at the doping levels measured yields metallic DWNTs in all cases through a direct electron transfer mechanism (Table S4). In addition, an analysis of the electron distribution indicates that there is a direct charge transfer from the doped internal tube to the external tube and that this transfer increases with N content (Table S4). Secondly, the density of states (DOS) shows very little changes in the states of the external undoped SWNT, in contrast to the electronic structure of the internal nanotubes, which is extensively altered due to the presence of nitrogen (Figures S6 and S7). The analysis of the frontier orbitals shows that there are levels from the internal and external tubes in a similar range of energies and that the nitrogen atoms area and the external tubes are coupled (Figure S8). This can be seen in the HOMO molecular orbital, showing an enhanced electronic density near the nitrogen atoms in the external tube (Figure 4b). The electronic doping of the external SWNT induced by the internal tube creates potential differences (Table S4), which are consistent with the ones observed by the cyclic voltammetry.</p><p>To conclude, we have reported a wall-and hybridisation-selective synthetic methodology to prepare nitrogen-doped double-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWNT@SWNT). A nitrogen-rich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (1) has been inserted into the cavity of SWNT and then by exposing the samples to an electron beam or to annealing temperatures over 1300 ºC, the encapsulated molecules are transformed into a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube within the SWNT cavity.</p><p>The transformation can be monitored by Raman spectroscopy and HR-TEM. XPS confirms the inclusion of ~1% of nitrogen in the newly formed carbon nanotube and also illustrate that the hybridisation of the nitrogen atoms can be controlled with the annealing temperature. For instance, thermal annealing at 1400 ºC produce double-walled carbon nanotubes with an inner tube doped exclusively with graphitic nitrogen, while annealing at 1300 ºC produce double-walled carbon nanotubes with an inner tube doped with both pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen.</p><p>Electrochemical studies and theoretical calculations confirm that the internal nitrogen-doped nanotube is able transduce some of its properties across the external nanotube.

The procedure splits the data into possibly overlapping bins which are then clustered. The output of the algorithm is a graph where nodes represent clusters and edges represent the sharing of data points between two clusters. However, several parameters must be selected before applying Mapper and the resulting graph may vary dramatically with the choice of parameters. We define an intrinsic notion of Mapper instability that measures the variability of the output as a function of the choice of parameters required to construct a Mapper output. Our results and discussion are general and apply to all Mapper-type algorithms. We derive theoretical results that provide estimates for the instability and suggest practical ways to control it. We provide also experiments to illustrate our results and in particular we demonstrate that a reliable candidate Mapper output can be identified as a local minimum of instability regarded as a function of Mapper input parameters.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: In this article, we study the question of the statistical convergence of the 1-dimensional Mapper to its continuous analogue, the Reeb graph. We show that the Mapper is an optimal estimator of the Reeb graph, which gives, as a byproduct, a method to automatically tune its parameters and compute confidence regions on its topological features, such as its loops and flares. This allows to circumvent the issue of testing a large grid of parameters and keeping the most stable ones in the brute-force setting, which is widely used in visualization, clustering and feature selection with the Mapper.","answer":"Our approach provides a more general setting than that of [1] .

METHOD Thirty-seven survivors of traumatic events were assessed within a week of the traumatic event and 6 months later . The assessment included magnetic resonance imaging of the brain ( including 124 coronal slices of 1.5-mm thickness ) , psychometric testing , and structured clinical interviews . The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale conferred PTSD diagnoses at 6 months . RESULTS Ten subjects ( 27 % ) had PTSD at 6 months . The subjects with PTSD did not differ from those without PTSD in hippocampal volume ( right or left ) at 1 week or 6 months . There was no reduction in hippocampal volume in the PTSD subjects between 1 week and 6 months . CONCLUSIONS Smaller hippocampal volume is not a necessary risk factor for developing PTSD and does not occur within 6 months of expressing the disorder . This brain abnormality might occur in individuals with chronic or complicated PTSDTitle 2:Increased prevalence of electrophysiological abnormalities in children with psychological, physical, and sexual abuse.Abstract 2:This retrospective study examined the association between abuse history and neurological abnormalities in 115 consecutive patients admitted to a child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit . Increased electrophysiological abnormalities were found in abused patients compared with non-abused patients ( 54.4 % vs. 26.9 % , P = 0.021 ) , predominantly in the left side of the frontal , temporal , or anterior region ( P = 0.036 ) . This may support the hypothesis that early abuse alters brain development , particularly limbic structures .

The impact of neglect has not been assessed , though it is the most prevalent form of childhood maltreatment . METHODS Regional CC area was measured from magnetic resonance imaging scans in 26 boys and 25 girls admitted for psychiatric evaluation ( 28 with abuse or neglect ) and compared with CC area in 115 healthy control subjects .  Data were analyzed by multivariate analysis of covariance , with age and midsagittal area as covariates . RESULTS Total CC area of the abused/neglected patients was 17 % smaller than in control subjects ( p = .0001 ) and 11 % smaller than in psychiatric patients who had not been abused or neglected ( contrast group ; p = .01 ) . Control subjects and the contrast group did not differ in total CC area . Neglect was the strongest experiential factor and was associated with a 15%-18 % reduction in CC regions 3 , 4 , 5 , and 7 ( all p < .02 ) . In contrast , sexual abuse seemed to be the strongest factor associated with reduced CC size in girls . CONCLUSIONS These data are consistent with animal research that demonstrated reduced CC size in nursery-reared compared with semi-naturally reared primates .

However , volumetric analyses of the ACC revealed no significant differences between groups . Probabilistic maps of the labels of the pregenual ACC indicated that the difference between groups in gray matter density was due to shape differences .

successfully be trained in a reinforcement learning fashion to solve unseen tasks, has the capability to generalize to larger map sizes, and can learn to navigate in dynamic environments.We evaluate on configurations of MazeBase grid-worlds, with randomly generated environments of several different sizes.Furthermore, we show that the module enables to learn to plan when the environment also includes stochastic elements, providing a cost-efficient learning system to build low-level size-invariant planners for a variety of interactive navigation problems.Planning is a key component for artificial agents in a variety of domains.However, a limit of classical planning algorithms is that one needs to know how to search for an optimal (or good) solution, for each type of plan.When the complexity of the planning environment and the diversity of tasks increase, this makes writing planners difficult, cumbersome, or entirely infeasible.\\"Learning to plan\\" has been an active research area to address this shortcoming BID13 BID5 .To be useful in practice, we propose that methods for learning to plan should have at least two properties: they should be traces free, i.e. not require traces from an optimal planner, and they should generalize, i.e. learn planners that generalize to plans of the same type but of unseen instance and/or planning horizons.In a Reinforcement Learning (RL) setting, learning to plan can be framed as the problem of finding a policy that maximises the expected reward, where such policy is a greedy function that selects actions that will visit states with a higher value for the agent.In such cases, Value Iteration (VI) is a algorithm that is naturally used to learn to estimate the value of states, by propagating the rewards and values until a fixed point is reached.When the environment can be represented as an occupancy map (a 2D grid), it is possible to approximate this learning algorithm using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to propagate the value on the grid cells.This enables one to differentiate directly through the planner steps and perform end-to-end learning.One way to train such models is with a supervised loss on the trace from a search/planning algorithm, e.g. as seen in the supervised learning section of Value Iteration Networks (VIN) BID17 , in which the model is tasked with reproducing the function to iteratively build values aimed at solving the shortest path task.However, this baseline violates our wished trace free property because of the required target values, and it doesn't fully demonstrate the capabilities to deal with interactive and generalized settings.That is what we set out to extend and further study.In this work we extend the formalization used in VIN to more accurately represent the structure of gridworld-like scenarios, enabling Value Iteration modules to be naturally used within the reinforcement learning framework, while also removing some of the limitations and underlying assumptions of the model.Furthermore we propose hierarchical extensions of such a model that allow agents to do multi-step planning, effectively learning models with the capacity to provide useful path-finding and planning capabilities in relatively complex tasks and comparably large scenarios.We show that our models can not only learn to plan and navigate in complex and dynamic environments, but that their hierarchical structure provides a way to generalize to navigation tasks where the required planning and the size of the map are much larger than the ones seen at training time.Our main contributions include: (1) introducing VProp, a network module which successfully learns to solve pathfinding via reinforcement learning, (2) demonstrating the ability to generalize, leading our models to solve large unseen maps by training exclusively on much smaller ones, and (3) showing that our modules can learn to navigate environments with more complex dynamics than a static grid-world.Architectures that try to solve the large but structured space of navigation tasks have much to benefit from employing planners that can be learnt from data, however these need to quickly adapt to local environment dynamics so that they can provide a flexible planning horizon without the need to collect new data and training again.Value Propagation modules' performances show that, if the problem is carefully formalized, such planners can be successfully learnt via Reinforcement Learning, and that great generalization capabilities can be expected when these models are built on convnets and are correctly applied to 2D path-planning tasks.Furthermore, we have demonstrated that our methods can even generalize when the environments are dynamics, enabling them to be employed in complex, interactive tasks.In future we expect to test our methods on a variety of tasks that can be embedded as graph-like structures (and for which we have the relevant convolutional operators).We also plan to evaluate the effects of plugging VProp into architectures that are employing VI modules (see Section 3), since most of these models could make use of the ability to propagate multiple channels to tackle more complex interactive environments.Finally, VProp architectures could be applied to algorithms used in mobile robotics and visual tracking BID2 , as they can learn to propagate arbitrary value functions and model a wide range of potential functions.","answer":"We propose Value Propagation, a novel end-to-end planner which can learn to solve 2D navigation tasks via

We identified a novel mode of communication by which apoptotic cells induce additional apoptosis in the same tissue. Strong induction of apoptosis in one compartment of the Drosophila wing disc causes apoptosis of cells in the other compartment, indicating that dying cells can release long-range death factors. We identified Eiger, the Drosophila tumor necrosis factor( TNF) homolog, as the signal responsible for apoptosis-induced apoptosis( AiA). Eiger is produced in apoptotic cells and, through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase( JNK) pathway, is able to propagate the initial apoptotic stimulus. We also show that during coordinated cell death of hair follicle cells in mice, TNF-α is expressed in apoptotic cells and is required for normal cell death. AiA provides a mechanism to explain cohort behavior of dying cells that is seen both in normal development and under pathological conditions.Introduction:Apoptosis is a distinct form of programmed cell death in which cells activate an intrinsic suicide program to self-destruct. This process plays a major role in development and tissue homeostasis, and abnormal regulation of apoptosis is associated with a variety of human diseases( Fuchs and Steller, 2011). Dying cells can secrete signals that will stimulate the recruitment of phagocytes( find-me signals) as well as expose signals on their surface to facilitate their engulfment( eat-me signals)( Lauber et al., 2003; Ravichandran, 2003). However, apoptosis has been traditionally regarded as a silent process that does not affect surrounding tissues. Only more recently has it become clear that apoptotic cells are the source of signals that can have profound effects on their neighbors. Cells that undergo apoptosis in response to stress and injury can secrete mitogenic and morphogenetic signaling proteins to stimulate growth and tissue repair( Bergmann and Steller, 2010; Morata et al., 2011; Greco, 2013). These factors include Wnt, Dpp/Bmps and Hedgehog( Hh) proteins, which all play major roles in the regulation of growth and patterning during development( Huh et al., 2004; Perez-Garijo et al., 2004; Ryoo et al., 2004; Fan and Bergmann, 2008). Mitogenic signaling by apoptotic cells has been reported for a diversity of animals, from Hydra, to flat worms, Drosophila and vertebrates, and it has been implicated in regeneration, wound healing and tumor growth( Tseng et al., 2007; Chera et al., 2009; Bergmann and Steller, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Pellettieri et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011). This mechanism appears well suited to communicate cellular loss to stem and progenitor cells in the tissue environment to stimulate proliferation and tissue repair. On the other hand, large groups of cells often undergo coordinated death during development and under conditions of severe tissue injury( Glucksmann, 1951; Jacobson et al., 1997). Classic examples for such group suicide behavior in normal development include the elimination of the tadpod tail during amphibian metamorphosis, and the removal of interdigital membranes during digit individualization in vertebrates. In Drosophila, apoptosis plays a crucial role in several morphogenetic events, sculpting tissues and organs, removing a large number of cells in a coordinated manner and inducing cellular reorganization( Lohmann et al., 2002; Link et al., 2007; Manjon et al., 2007; Suzanne et al., 2010; Suzanne and Steller, 2013). In vertebrates, another example of communal death is the regressive phase of the hair follicle( HF), which undergoes cycles of growth( anagen), degeneration( catagen) and rest( telogen)( Hardy, 1992; Fuchs, 2007). In catagen, all the cells in the lower portion of the HF are eliminated by apoptosis( Lindner et al., 1997; Botchkareva et al., 2006). In all these cases, cell death takes place in a very rapid and highly synchronized manner. However, it is not known how this cohort behavior is achieved. Likewise, many pathological states are associated with extensive cell death, which leads to severe damage and can have grave consequences for patients. Examples include alcohol-/drug-induced liver failure, viral infection, cardiac infarction, ischemic stroke and cachexia( Sharma and Anker, 2002; Kang and Izumo, 2003; Guicciardi and Gores, 2005; Yuan, 2009). In all these pathologies, apoptosis accounts for widespread cell loss and is thought to contribute to patient mortality( Thompson, 1995; Favaloro et al., 2012). One possible explanation for all these ‘mass suicide’ phenomena is that apoptotic cells may release signals to coordinate their ‘communal death’. Here we investigated whether apoptotic cells are able to produce signals that can explain the coordinated behavior of groups of dying cells. We observed that massive induction of apoptosis in the posterior compartment of Drosophila wing discs caused non-autonomous apoptosis at a considerable distance in the anterior compartment. Moreover, apoptosis of cells in the anterior compartment requires signaling from apoptotic cells in the posterior compartment, indicating that apoptosis-induced-apoptosis( AiA) is an active phenomenon. We next explored the mechanism underlying AiA and found that apoptotic cells produce Eiger, the TNF homolog in Drosophila. Eiger activates the JNK pathway in neighboring cells and induces them to die. Finally, we examined whether AiA also occurs in vertebrates and whether it plays a physiological role for the coordinated death of groups of cells. We found that during the regressive phase( catagen) of the HF, apoptotic cells produce TNF-α. Inhibition of TNF-α disrupts the coordinated death of HF cells in catagen, indicating that this mechanism plays a physiological role to maintain synchronicity in the HF cycle. Taken together, these observations reveal a novel mechanism to coordinate cohort behavior of dying cells that is seen both in normal development and under pathological conditions.Discussion:Our experiments demonstrate that induction of apoptosis in one compartment results in induction of non-autonomous apoptosis in the neighboring compartment. This is true under many different conditions: both when we generate undead cells( expressing rpr/hid and p35) or upon induction of genuine apoptosis( expressing rpr/hid alone); once there is ectopic expression of mitogens that leads to excessive proliferation and growth or while blocking mitogenic production or growth of the compartment. One intriguing observation is that this non-autonomous cell death usually displays a pattern consisting of two groups of cells in the wing pouch. One possible explanation for this is that the affected cells are the most susceptible to the death signal. In fact, the regions of the wing pouch where we observe the non-autonomous cell death are also more prone to cell death as a response to different apoptotic stimuli, such as irradiation or hid over-expression( Milan et al., 1997; Moon et al., 2005). Another possibility to explain why we observe cell death at a distance would be that dying cells are producing other signals that inhibit apoptosis. This protective signal would diffuse only short range, and in this way the distance of cells to the border would determine the ratio between the pro-apoptotic and the protective signal, tipping the balance in favor of death or survival. In fact, it has been shown that cells neighboring apoptotic cells downregulate Hippo pathway and consequently activate Diap1( Grusche et al., 2011; Sun and Irvine, 2011). Another good candidate for such an anti-apoptotic signal would be Wg, as it is expressed in an opposite pattern from the non-autonomous apoptosis and is also diffusing from apoptotic cells in the posterior compartment. However, we tried to modify Wg levels in different ways and we did not observe any change in the apoptosis pattern( data not shown). On the other hand, in physiological conditions such as the coordinated cell death of HF cells observed in mice, it would be expected that signaling between apoptotic cells would occur at a much shorter range, probably affecting the immediate neighbors. In any case, the observation that TNF-α is exclusively detected in apoptotic cells and the fact that its inhibition leads to desynchronization of the HF cycle strongly suggests that AiA can be a mechanism to coordinate cell death within a tissue. In our experimental systems, AiA requires both the TNF and JNK signaling pathways. Eiger is produced by apoptotic cells in the posterior compartment of the wing disc and it activates JNK in cells of the neighboring compartment, inducing them to die. Downregulation of Eiger in the posterior compartment or JNK in the anterior compartment was able to suppress AiA. However, it remains to be elucidated whether Eiger directly diffuses to the cells in the anterior compartment, or if some other mechanism is responsible for the activation of JNK in dying cells in the anterior compartment. Recently, it was shown that, upon wounding, JNK activity can be propagated at a distance through a feed-forward loop( Wu et al., 2010). Significantly, AiA is not restricted to the Drosophila wing disc. We obtained evidence for a role of TNF-α-mediated AiA during the destruction of the hair follicle( HF) in catagen, the regressive phase of the hair cycle( Figure 9). TNF-α plays a known role to promote cell death and has been previously implicated in HF progression, wound healing and regeneration( Werner and Grose, 2003; Tong and Coulombe, 2006; Bohm et al., 2010). However, the cellular source of TNF-α remained unknown and it was previously not appreciated that apoptotic cells can be the source of these signals. Our results suggest that AiA and at least some of the underlying mechanism have been conserved in evolution to promote coordinated cell death. The observation that apoptotic cells can signal to other cells in their environment and instruct them to die has potentially many important implications. On the one hand, there are situations where propagation of an apoptotic stimulus may be a useful mechanism to achieve the rapid and coordinated death of large cell populations. Our experiments in mice show that this can be the case during the catagen phase of the HF cycle. There are many other examples of cell death being used during development to sculpt tissues and organs, including the removal of structures during metamorphosis( tadpole tail, larval organs in insects, elimination of inappropriate sex organs in mammals, deletion of the amnio serosa during insect embryogenesis) and the separation of digits through apoptosis of the interdigital webbing in many vertebrates( Glucksmann, 1951; Jacobson et al., 1997; Fuchs and Steller, 2011). In all these cases, AiA may facilitate cohort behavior and contribute to the rapid and complete elimination of large fields of cells. Propagation of cell death may also be an efficient way to prevent infection. It is known that cells respond to viral infection by entering apoptosis and in this way impede the replication of the virus( Barber, 2001). The process of AiA would extend apoptosis to the neighboring cells, preventing also their infection and thus avoiding the spread of the virus. However, propagation of apoptosis may be detrimental in pathological conditions where excessive cell death underlies the etiology of the disease. This may be the case for neurodegenerative disorders, hepatic diseases, cardiac infarction, etc( Thompson, 1995; Favaloro et al., 2012). In all these cases it remains to be studied whether extensive amounts of apoptosis that are observed in the affected tissues are a direct consequence of cell damage in an autonomous manner or if part of the cell loss could be attributed to a process of propagation through AiA. Finally, AiA may play a role in cancer. It is known that radiotherapy in humans can induce biological effects in non-irradiated cells at a considerable distance, a phenomenon called radiation-induced bystander effect( Hei et al., 2011; Prise and O’Sullivan, 2009). Our current findings provide a possible explanation for some of these effects. Therefore, large-scale induction of apoptosis by AiA may contribute to successful cancer therapy. TNF family proteins are being used as models for drug development aimed to treat cancer( Ashkenazi, 2008). Furthermore, Eiger, the only TNF member in Drosophila, has a known role in the elimination of pre-tumoral scrib− clones( Igaki et al., 2009; Ohsawa et al., 2011). In addition, cell competition induces cell death even in aggressive scrib−RasV12 tumors, raising the possibility that AiA is induced during tumor initiation, which may affect the tumor microenvironment and ultimately tumor growth( Menendez et al., 2010). It is well known that TNF can play both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing roles, but AiA has not been investigated in this context( Pikarsky and Ben-Neriah, 2006; Vainer et al., 2008). Future studies will shed new light on the relevance of signaling by apoptotic cells and the implications of this signaling mechanism in different scenarios.","answer":"The tissues of developing organisms can be shaped by apoptosis , a form of regulated cell killing . Although this process can occur in individual cells , apoptotic signals may also dictate the ‘communal death’ of many cells simultaneously . This occurs frequently in animal development: in human fetuses , for example , cells in the hand are directed to die to remove webbing between the fingers . Apoptosis has been thought to resemble a form of silent suicide by cells , but more recent work suggests that apoptotic cells can also transmit signals . Now , Pérez-Garijo et al . find that these cells can stimulate other cells to die in both fruit flies and mice . In fruit flies , apoptosis is activated by proteins known as Grim , Hid and Reaper . To explore whether apoptotic cells could communicate with other cells , Pérez-Garijo et al . created ‘undead’ cells in which one of these proteins was turned on , but other downstream proteins ( that are responsible for the cellular execution phase of apoptosis ) had been turned off: these cells were undergoing apoptosis , but could not complete the process and die . Strikingly , undead cells in the posterior ( back ) region of the wing imaginal disc—the tissue in the larva that gives rise to the wing in the adult fruit fly—could trigger apoptosis in cells in the anterior ( front ) half . Pérez-Garijo et al . found that the JNK pathway activated apoptosis in anterior cells . In fruit flies , the Eiger protein turns on this pathway; when Eiger was absent from posterior cells in the wing imaginal disc , apoptosis in anterior cells ceased , indicating that Eiger might signal at long range . Eiger is related to a protein called TNF that has been implicated in cycles of destruction and renewal of hair follicles in mice . Pérez-Garijo et al . found that TNF is produced by apoptotic cells in hair follicles , and that blocking TNF inhibits the death of other cells in the same cohort: this suggests that a common mechanism could regulate the communal death of cells in flies and mammals . These studies therefore shed light on a conserved pathway in the modulation of tissue development ."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Obesity is an inflammatory state characterized by an augment in circulating inflammatory factors. Leptin may modulate the synthesis of these factors by white adipose tissue decreasing insulin sensitivity. We have examined the effect of chronic central administration of leptin on circulating levels of cytokines and the possible relationship with cytokine expression and protein content as well as with leptin and insulin signaling in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. In addition, we analyzed the possible correlation between circulating levels of cytokines and peripheral insulin resistance. We studied 18 male Wistar rats divided into controls (C), those treated icv for 14 days with a daily dose of 12 μg of leptin (L) and a pair-fed group (PF) that received the same food amount consumed by the leptin group. Serum leptin and insulin were measured by ELISA, mRNA levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by real time PCR and serum and adipose tissue levels of these cytokines by multiplexed bead immunoassay. Serum leptin, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-γ and HOMA-IR were increased in L and TNF-α was decreased in PF and L. Serum leptin and IL-2 levels correlate positively with HOMA-IR index and negatively with serum glucose levels during an ip insulin tolerance test. In L, an increase in mRNA levels of IL-2 was found in both adipose depots and IFN-γ only in visceral tissue. Activation of leptin signaling was increased and insulin signaling decreased in subcutaneous fat of L. In conclusion, leptin mediates the production of inflammatory cytokines by adipose tissue independent of its effects on food intake, decreasing insulin sensitivity.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"IL-2\\", \\"TNF-u03b1\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor-u03b1\\", \\"leptin\\", \\"interferon-u03b3\\", \\"Leptin\\", \\"IL-6\\", \\"interleukin-2\\", \\"IL-10\\", \\"IFN-u03b3\\", \\"cytokines\\", \\"insulin\\", \\"cytokine\\", \\"IL-4\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Pulsatilla koreana has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine if SB365, Pulsatilla saponin D isolated from the root of P. koreana inhibits the progression of colon cancer. We found that SB365 strongly suppressed the growth and proliferation of colon cancer cells and induced their apoptosis. Also, SB365 showed anti-angiogenic activity by decreasing the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF. These results were confirmed by an in vivo study showing that SB365 significantly inhibited tumor growth by the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis with stronger anticancer activity than 5-FU. When further examined for its anticancer mechanism, SB365 effectively suppressed the AKT/mTOR pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that SB365 inhibits the AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to the suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis together with induction of apoptosis. Therefore, SB365 is a good candidate as a natural product for use in the treatment of colon cancer.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Pulsatilla saponin D\\", \\"SB365\\", \\"5-FU\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

While image classification has now become prevalent in fields like computer vision, self−driving cars, robotics, etc., it is fairly new in the field of microstructures [1−3]. Although the above−mentioned applications differ by various factors, yet they share the common process of correctly annotating an image with one or a probability of labels that correlates to a series of classes or categories. This is known as image classification. The process of identifying the type of microstructure in diverse tasks linked to image−based scene perspectives has taken advantage of the combination of machine learning techniques applied to the development of neural networks. Deep learning is basically a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher−level features from the raw input. It allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction [4−5]. It discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the back propagation algorithm to indicate how machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. These methods are extracted by neural networks. Among the deep learning models, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and their modification (FCNNs) have been shown particularly successful used for image classification and segmentation [6−7]. There is a limited number of studies on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks in the Friction Stir Welding Process. Hartl et al. [8] used Convolutional Neural Network modeling for the process monitoring in the Friction Stir Welding Process. Convolutional Neural Network DenseNet−121 was used for automated visual inspection in Friction Stir Welding process [9].</p><p>The present study focuses on the application of the Deep Convolutional Neural Network algorithm for predicting the welding efficiency of Friction Stir Welded Copper joints on the basis of microstructure images. 2. Experimental Procedure CNN models is one of the oldest deep neural networks hierarchy that have hidden layers among the general layers to help the weights of the system learn more about the features found in the input image. The basic architecture of a CNN consists of a convolutional layer as shown in Figure 1 that separates and identifies the various features of the image for analysis in a process called as feature extraction and a fully connected layer that utilizes the output from the convolution process and predicts the class of the image based on the features extracted in previous stages. The image is composed of various pixels which possess a different numerical value to yield the density within the RGB color space spectrum. The key idea is that there will be the existence of a relationship between which will further act as different features. It should be noted that the spatial arrangement of those obtained features will have no impact on the considered model. So, it can be concluded that there is not any relationship between these individual features. The Convolutional Neural Network model has variables in the form of pixels that have a natural topology. There should be a translation invariance too so that the orientation and size of the given object in an image do not affect the working of the Convolutional Neural Network architecture. Kernels are used to capture the relationship between the different features i.e. different pixels composing the image. Kernels are considered as a grid of weights that are overlaid on the particular portion of the given image centered around a single pixel. Once the kernel is overlaid, each weight from the kernel is multiplied by the given pixel which is some number. As shown in Equation 1, the output of the central pixel is the sum of all those multiplications between the kernel and its respective pixel. Outputoverthecentered pixel = p p=1 W p .pixel p (1) There are three types of layers that make up CNN:</p><p>1. Convolutional Layer: This layer is the first layer which is used to extract various features from the input images. In this layer, the mathematical operation of convolution is performed between the input image and a filter of a particular size MxM which is slided over the input image and the dot product is taken between the filter and the parts of the input image with respect to the size of the filter MxM. The output generated is known as the feature map which gives us the information about the image. This feature map is then fed to other layers. 2. Pooling Layer: A convolutional layer is followed by a pooling layer which is basically used to decrease the size of the convolved feature map to reduce the computational costs. This is performed by decreasing the connections between layers and independently operating on each feature map. There are several pooling techniques like max pooling (largest element is taken from the feature map), average pooling (average of elements is taken) etc. 3. Fully Connected Layer: It consists of weights and biases along with the neurons and is used to connect the neurons between two different layers.</p>Results and Discussion<p>The basic architecture of the model used in present study is shown in Figure 3. Firstly, it should be noted that the convolution operation is performed between two tensors in the Neural Networks. In this operation, two tensors are taken into account as inputs which result in output as a tensor. The convolution operation is denoted by the \\" * \\" operator. The Equation 2 is used to carry out the convolution operation.</p><p>The input microstructure image can be considered as X and the filter can be denoted by f . So the convolution operation can be obtained by Equation 3.</p><p>The convolution operation is shown in Figure 4. The mathematical operations are as follows:</p><p>1</p><p>If the dimension of an input image is n × n and the dimension of applied filter is f × f then the dimension of an output image is given by (n − f + 1) × (n − f + 1). The features which are extracted from the data by a given convolution layer are sent to the fully connected layer which generates the final output. Generally, the fully connected layer in a Convolutional Neural Network represents a traditional Neural Network.</p><p>The convolution layer results an output in the form of two−dimensional matrix but it should be noted that the fully connected layer can only operate with one−dimensional data. So, the value generated by applying Equation 3 is firstly converted into one−dimensional format as shown in Figure 5. After the conversion into one−dimensional array, the values are forwarded to the fully connected layer. The individual values obtained are treated as a separate feature representing an image. The incoming data is further subjected to two operations i.e. a non−linear transformation and linear transformation by a fully connected layers. Firstly, the data is subjected to linear transformation as shown in Equation 4.</p><p>Where, b is the bias, W is the weight and an input image is represented by X. It should be noted that weight is the matrix of randomly initialized numbers. Putting the values of Equation 5, 6 and 7 in Equation 4, the following Equation is obtained:</p><p>Now, in order to capture the complex relationship, non−linear transformation architecture in the form of an activation function is incorporated. In the present work, the sigmoid activation function has been used which is represented by Equation 9.</p><p>Deep networks need large amount of training data to achieve good performance. In order to achieve a large dataset, image augmentation was required. Image augmentation artificially creates training images through different ways of processing or combination of multiple processing, such as random rotation, shifts, shear and flips, etc. This can be easily done with the help of ImageDataGenerator API in Keras.</p><p>Both the classes of the dataset were firstly divided into train and test. The datasets were then augmented to increase the dataset size. The following base code was used to generate images by varying the various parameters: Following the above procedure, around 3000 images for train and 300 images for test were generated. Further, for training the model, CNN algorithm was used and Keras library was used for writing the code for the same.</p><p>In python programming, the model type that is most commonly used is Sequential type. It is the easiest way to build a CNN model and permits us to build a model layer by layer. The add () function is used to add layers to the model. In the above model, there are three convolution and pooling pairs followed by a flatten layer which is usually used as a connection between the convolution and dense layer. Further, two dense layer was added with a dropout layer. Dense layer is the regular deeply connected neural network layer. A dropout layer is basically used for regularization and reduces over fitting. The optimizer used was adam. The batch size was chosen to be 16 and the model was trained with class mode as binary as there are two classes to be classified. The number of epoch taken was 50 for training purpose. One epoch refers to one cycle through the full training dataset. The model was then evaluated using the test dataset. The classification report is used for determining the accuracy of the model. The model was further checked by taking an image from test dataset and predicting its class label with the help of following code:</p><p>The basic architecture for the model is shown in Figure 3. In the model, there were three convolution layer followed by pooling layer. Convolutional layers in a CNN systematically apply learned filters to input images in order to create feature maps that summarize the presence of those features in the input. A pooling layer is added after a convolutional layer to apply nonlinearity to the feature maps output by the convolutional layer. The pooling layer operates upon each feature map separately to create a new set of the same number of pooled feature maps. This involves selecting a pooling operation. The size of the pooling operation or filter is smaller than the size of feature map (we have used 2x2 pixels with a stride of 2 pixels). This means pooling layer will always reduce the size of each feature map. The pooling operation used was maximum pooling which basically takes the maximum value for each patch of feature map. Further, a flatten layer was added which is usually used as a connection between the convolution and dense layer. Flattening is basically converting the data into 1−d array for inputting it to next layer. The output of convolutional layer is flattened to create a single long feature vector which is then connected to the final classification model, which is called a fully− connected layer. A dense layer was added followed by a dropout layer and another dense layer. A dense layer is connected deeply which means each neuron in the dense layer receives input from all neurons of its previous layer. It basically performs a matrix−vector multiplication and the values used in the matrix are actually parameters that can be trained and updated with the help of back propagation. The activation function used for this layer was 'relu' which is helpful in applying the element wise activation function. The dropout layer used was basically for reducing the over fitting. Figure 6 shows the plot of loss function with respect to the number of epochs.</p>Conclusion<p>Convolution Neural Network is a powerful tool for image recognition and it has a great capability of complex problem−solving. While training the Artificial Neural Network models, few transformations should be kept in mind. There is a final layer with a sigmoid activation function and a single node for binary classification problems. The present research work basically focuses upon building a basic CNN model for the classification of the two classes of microstructures. The model was made with an accuracy of 80% which can be improved. Further improvement in the model can be made by: • Using more images for the dataset • Adjusting the learning rate • Adjusting the batch size which will allow the model to recognize the patterns better. If the batch size is low, the patterns will repeat less and hence convergence will be difficult whereas if the batch size is high, learning will be slow.</p><p>• Adjusting the number of epochs The future scope of the work is to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for detection of defects present in Friction Stir Welded joints.</p>","answer":"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special type of Artificial Neural Network which takes input in the form of an image.

The present work deals with the prediction of the welding efficiency of the Friction Stir Welded joints on the basis of microstructure images by carrying out training on 3000 microstructure images and further testing on 300 microstructure images.

BACKGROUND An explanation for the increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with venous thrombosis is lacking . The objective of this study was to investigate whether risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease also increase the risk of venous thrombosis . DESIGN AND METHODS Cases who had a first venous thrombosis ( n=515 ) and matched controls ( n=1,505 ) were identified from a population-based , nested , case-cohort study ( the HUNT 2 study ) comprising 71 % ( n=66,140 ) of the adult residents of Nord-Trøndelag County in Norway . RESULTS The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of venous thrombosis for subjects with concentrations of C-reactive protein in the highest quintile was 1.6 ( 95 % confidence interval : 1.2-2.2 ) compared to subjects with C-reactive protein in the lowest quintile . This association was strongest in subjects who experienced venous thrombosis within a year after blood sampling with a three-fold increased risk of participants in the highest versus the lowest quintile . Having first degree relatives who had a myocardial infarction before the age of 60 years was positively associated with venous thrombosis compared to not having a positive family history [ odds ratio 1.3 ( 95 % confidence interval : 1.1-1.6 ) ] . Subjects with blood pressure in the highest quintile had half the risk of developing venous thrombosis compared to subjects whose blood pressure was in the lowest quintile . There were no associations between the risk of venous thrombosis and total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein-cholesterol , high density lipoprotein-cholesterol , triglycerides , glucose or smoking . We confirmed the positive association between obesity and venous thrombosis . CONCLUSIONS C-reactive protein and a family history of myocardial infarction were positively associated with subsequent venous thrombosis . Blood pressure was inversely correlated to venous thrombosis .

Abstract:The ocular surface has been suggested as a site of infection with Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).This review examines the evidence for this hypothesis, and its implications for clinical practice.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is transmitted by person-to-person contact, via airborne droplets, or through contact with contaminated surfaces.SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) to facilitate infection in humans.This review sets out to evaluate evidence for the ocular surface as a route of infection.A literature search in this area was conducted on 15 April 2020 using the Scopus database.In total, 287 results were returned and reviewed.There is preliminary evidence for ACE2 expression on corneal and conjunctival cells, but most of the other receptors to which coronaviruses bind appear to be found under epithelia of the ocular surface.Evidence from animal studies is limited, with a single study suggesting viral particles on the eye can travel to the lung, resulting in very mild infection.Coronavirus infection is rarely associated with conjunctivitis, with occasional cases reported in patients with confirmed COVID-19, along with isolated cases of conjunctivitis as a presenting sign.Coronaviruses have been rarely isolated from tears or conjunctival swabs.The evidence suggests coronaviruses are unlikely to bind to ocular surface cells to initiate infection.Additionally, hypotheses that the virus could travel from the nasopharynx or through the conjunctival capillaries to the ocular surface during infection are probably incorrect.Conjunctivitis and isolation of the virus from the ocular surface occur only rarely, and overwhelmingly in patients with confirmed COVID-19.Necessary precautions to prevent person-to-person transmission should be employed in clinical practice throughout the pandemic, and patients should be reminded to maintain good hygiene practices.","answer":"{\\"verdict\\": \\"SUPPORT\\", \\"evidence\\": [\\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is transmitted by person-to-person contact, via airborne droplets, or through contact with contaminated surfaces.\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

gel methods  @xcite , including solution processes for semiconductor devices .@xcite microscopic insights on the wettability  @xcite relates the hamaker constant with molecular interactions , which can be , in principle , evaluated from _ ab initio _ simulations . from the asymptotic behavior of molecular binding curves , or potential energy surfaces ( pes ) , @xmath4 , the hamaker constant can be computed as @xmath5 , provided that only a binding with a single @xmath6 matters and a naive superposition is expected .@xcite the index , add , then stands for additive and @xmath7 denotes the molecular density which appears when the superposition integral is counted . though we can find several such prototypical works  @xcite of the _ab initio _ assessment applied to simple and highly symmetric molecules , we would immediately encounter troubles when attempting to apply the framework to practical solute molecules .most molecules of industrial interest are not so highly symmetric that we can not generally expect the additivity of the interaction .@xcite in these cases , too many alignments of coalescence are possible due to the anisotropy of molecules , bewildering us how to model the coalescence with the confidence for capturing the nature of the system .    the main subject of the present paper is how to estimate @xmath0 for the practical solute molecules via @xmath8 with plausible considerations mainly for the anisotropy .once we could establish such a scheme , such database of molecular interactions aided by recent _ ab initio _methods  @xcite can provide the hamaker constants over various liquids .it would help to predict , control , and design such solution processes including not only wettablities but also suspensions and solvabilities by using empirical molecular dynamics simulations .@xcite    the present study has been originally motivated by the demand to estimate @xmath0 for a cyclohexasilane molecule , si@xmath1h@xmath2 ( chs ) , which is used as an ink for printed electronics technology to fabricate polycrystalline si film transistors .@xcite the ink including si - based precursors is sprayed on a substrate , which is sintered to form an amorphous si thin film , without using expensive vacuum equipment in the conventional semiconductor processes .the ink printing process has hence attracted recent interests for realizing more saving and lower environmental impact technology .@xcite controlling the wettability of these inks is of rather general interest because the technology is about to be applied further to fabricate oxide or carbon nanotube film semiconductor devices  @xcite by using various inks instead of si - based ones . for going beyond conventional / experimental preparations of inks ,several simulations have been made to analyze the wettability of droplets on ink - jet processes dynamically using molecular dynamics  @xcite or empirical models  @xcite .the predictability of these simulations strongly depends on the force fields that are currently prepared by empirical parameterizations of lennard - jones type potentials .the _ ab initio _assessment for these parameterizations is obviously recognized as an important breakthrough in getting more universal applicability .    for chs, there is no reference to @xmath0 , and then we tried evaluating @xmath8 from its binding curve . besides the anisotropy discussed above , the commonly available framework , dft ( density functional theory ) , is known to fail to describe molecular interactions mostly , and the dft performance strongly depends on exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals adopted .@xcite in the present case , the interaction of this system , chs , is of non-@xmath9 staking nature , known as an _aliphatic - aliphatic _ one  @xcite between the @xmath10 bonds at the homo ( highest - occupied molecular orbital ) levels of the monomers . unlike _ aromatic - aromatic _ interactions of _e.g. _ benzene dimer , there has been only a few investigations on _ aliphatic - aliphatic _ interactions and hence no established scheme of how to treat the anisotropy of molecules in the evaluation of binding curves even for moderately tractable size and symmetry of the target molecules . as is well - known , accurate correlated methods such as ccsd(t ) are required to get enough reliable estimations of molecular interaction .@xcite such methods are , in general , quite costly in the sense of the scalability on the system size @xmath11 , _e.g. _ , @xmath12 for ccsd(t )  @xcite .such severe scalabilities obstruct the applications to larger molecules being likely in the practical cases .in contrast , dmc ( diffusion monte carlo ) method is quite promising and its applicability to more practical issues gets rapidly extended .@xcite this framework is regarded in principle as the most reliable that can achieve numerically exact solutions in some cases  @xcite , and there has been so far several applications to noncovalent systems  @xcite , to calibrate even over accurate molecular orbital methods such as ccsd(t ) .dmc scales at worst to @xmath13 ,  @xcite making it possible to be applied further to larger molecules including molecular crystals .@xcite    in this paper , we therefore applied dmc to evaluate @xmath8 of chs . upon a careful benchmark on benzene molecule ( given in appendix c ), we have established a scheme ( i ) coping with the anisotropy of the molecules , ( ii ) reducing statistical errorbars and biases that are small enough for a usable predictions , and ( iii ) based on several possible validations on the predicted @xmath0 for which no experimental reference value is available .the scheme is applied to chs getting @xmath14 [ zj ] which is in a reasonable range validated by several side considerations . by making comparisons with binding curves by dft, we also provide a useful calibration over several xc for the predictability of @xmath0 .the paper is then organized as follows : in the main body of the paper , we provide descriptions of the scheme applied to chs , followed by validations of the prediction as briefly as possible so as to concentrate on following the established procedure .thus , put aside into appendices are detailed descriptions for computational methods ( appendix a ) , some formalism of hamaker constants considered in the present work ( appendix b ) , and all the discussions on the validations of the procedure made on the benzene dimer benchmark ( appendix c - e ) .technical details about evaluation of @xmath8 for chs are also given alongside the benzene case in the appendices .summaries of the paper are given as concluding remarks at the end of main text .for detailed correction schemes , such as bsse ( basis set superposition error ) , cbs ( complete basis set ) schemes as well as time - step error in dmc are given in supporting information .[ dimer - pattern ] . computational details for the evaluation are given in appendix a. for the chs monomer structure , we took the chair conformation  @xcite since it is known to be most stable .the monomer geometry is optimized at the b3lyp/6 - 311 g level using gaussian09 .@xcite to plot a binding curve , we vary binding distances of a dimer coalescence , keeping each of the monomer structures fixed to the above one .this is valid to some extent because we focus on @xmath6 extracted from the long - range behavior where each of the monomer structures may be almost the same as that of an isolated monomer .the inter - monomer distance is defined as that between the centers of gravity of the monomers .[ ljfitting ] shows dmc binding curves for each coalescence configurations , compared with ccsd(t ) references .the sandwich ( type a ) configuration is identified to give the most stable binding energy @xmath15 over the others , @xmath16 98 % at @xmath17k as given in table  [ table : two - body ] .our careful benchmark for benzene case given in appendix c clarifies that the deepest binding configuration almost dominates hamaker constants .we can therefore concentrate only on the type a binding curve to extract @xmath6 from its asymptotic behavior .hereafter we adopt a symbol , @xmath18 , as a @xmath6 value for the most stable coalescence configuration .van duijneveldt ,  f.  b. ; van duijneveldt -

The competitive adsorption between whey protein concentrate (WPC) or sodium caseinate (SCN) and four bile salts, sodium cholate (NaC), dexocycholate (NaDC), taurocholate (NaTC) and glycodeoxycholate (NaGDC) has been studied in protein stabilized oil-in-water emulsions. The bile salts that contain a conjugated amino acid (NaTC and NaGDC) were considerably more efficient at displacing both WPC and SCN proteins from the emulsion droplet interface, even though they are known to have a lower hydrophobicity than NaC and NaDC. This is explained in terms of a steric resistance to adsorption from the conjugated amino acids in NaTC and NaGDC. This leads to them adopting an adsorbed conformation at the oil-water interface that penetrates less into the oil phase causing greater disruption of the adsorbed layer and hence leads to greater displacement of protein from the interface. Complementary computer simulations of the adsorption of the four bile salts at the decane-water interface support the hypothesis that the NaTC and NaGDC adopt flatter conformations that stick out further in to the aqueous phase, which arises from a lower free energy of adsorption. The adsorption isotherms for the four bile salts have also been measured. These have been found to have a form that fits closely the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm. The results for NaC suggest that it adsorbs as individual molecules and forms a saturated monolayer over much of the concentration range used in the displacement experiments, since it is below its critical micelle concentration in this range. For the other three bile salts on the other hand, the primary adsorbing species appears to be the micelle form, since the surface coverage is above that of a saturated monolayer for much of the concentration range studied.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"dexocycholate\\", \\"NaGDC\\", \\"sodium\\", \\"amino acids\\", \\"taurocholate\\", \\"amino acid\\", \\"NaDC\\", \\"bile salts\\", \\"NaTC\\", \\"decane\\", \\"NaC\\", \\"glycodeoxycholate\\", \\"sodium cholate\\", \\"Di-hydroxy and Tri-hydroxy Bile Salts\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

In this paper, we approach the problems by closely modelling questions in a neural network framework. We first introduce syntactic information to help encode questions. We then view and model different types of questions and the information shared among them as an adaptation task and proposed adaptation models for them. On the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), we show that these approaches can help attain better results over a competitive baseline.IntroductionEnabling computers to understand given documents and answer questions about their content has recently attracted intensive interest, including but not limited to the efforts as in BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . Many specific problems such as machine comprehension and question answering often involve modeling such question-document pairs.The recent availability of relatively large training datasets (see Section \\"Related Work\\" for more details) has made it more feasible to train and estimate rather complex models in an end-to-end fashion for these problems, in which a whole model is fit directly with given question-answer tuples and the resulting model has shown to be rather effective.In this paper, we take a closer look at modeling questions in such an end-to-end neural network framework, since we regard question understanding is of importance for such problems. We first introduced syntactic information to help encode questions. We then viewed and modelled different types of questions and the information shared among them as an adaptation problem and proposed adaptation models for them. On the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), we show that these approaches can help attain better results on our competitive baselines.Related WorkRecent advance on reading comprehension and question answering has been closely associated with the availability of various datasets. BIBREF0 released the MCTest data consisting of 500 short, fictional open-domain stories and 2000 questions. The CNN/Daily Mail dataset BIBREF1 contains news articles for close style machine comprehension, in which only entities are removed and tested for comprehension. Children's Book Test (CBT) BIBREF2 leverages named entities, common nouns, verbs, and prepositions to test reading comprehension. The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) BIBREF3 is more recently released dataset, which consists of more than 100,000 questions for documents taken from Wikipedia across a wide range of topics. The question-answer pairs are annotated through crowdsourcing. Answers are spans of text marked in the original documents. In this paper, we use SQuAD to evaluate our models.Many neural network models have been studied on the SQuAD task. BIBREF6 proposed match LSTM to associate documents and questions and adapted the so-called pointer Network BIBREF7 to determine the positions of the answer text spans. BIBREF8 proposed a dynamic chunk reader to extract and rank a set of answer candidates. BIBREF9 focused on word representation and presented a fine-grained gating mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level representations based on the properties of words. BIBREF10 proposed a multi-perspective context matching (MPCM) model, which matched an encoded document and question from multiple perspectives. BIBREF11 proposed a dynamic decoder and so-called highway maxout network to improve the effectiveness of the decoder. The bi-directional attention flow (BIDAF) BIBREF12 used the bi-directional attention to obtain a question-aware context representation.In this paper, we introduce syntactic information to encode questions with a specific form of recursive neural networks BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . More specifically, we explore a tree-structured LSTM BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 which extends the linear-chain long short-term memory (LSTM) BIBREF17 to a recursive structure, which has the potential to capture long-distance interactions over the structures.Different types of questions are often used to seek for different types of information. For example, a \\"what\\" question could have very different property from that of a \\"why\\" question, while they may share information and need to be trained together instead of separately. We view this as a \\"adaptation\\" problem to let different types of questions share a basic model but still discriminate them when needed. Specifically, we are motivated by the ideas \\"i-vector\\" BIBREF18 in speech recognition, where neural network based adaptation is performed among different (groups) of speakers and we focused instead on different types of questions here.Set-UpWe test our models on Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) BIBREF3 . The SQuAD dataset consists of more than 100,000 questions annotated by crowdsourcing workers on a selected set of Wikipedia articles, and the answer to each question is a span of text in the Wikipedia articles. Training data includes 87,599 instances and validation set has 10,570 instances. The test data is hidden and kept by the organizer. The evaluation of SQuAD is Exact Match (EM) and F1 score.We use pre-trained 300-D Glove 840B vectors BIBREF20 to initialize our word embeddings. Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are initialized randomly with Gaussian samples. CharCNN filter length is 1,3,5, each is 50 dimensions. All vectors including word embedding are updated during training. The cluster number K in discriminative block is 100. The Adam method BIBREF25 is used for optimization. And the first momentum is set to be 0.9 and the second 0.999. The initial learning rate is 0.0004 and the batch size is 32. We will half learning rate when meet a bad iteration, and the patience is 7. Our early stop evaluation is the EM and F1 score of validation set. All hidden states of GRUs, and TreeLSTMs are 500 dimensions, while word-level embedding d_w is 300 dimensions. We set max length of document to 500, and drop the question-document pairs beyond this on training set. Explicit question-type dimension d_{ET} is 50. We apply dropout to the Encoder layer and aggregation layer with a dropout rate of 0.5.ResultsTable 1 shows the official leaderboard on SQuAD test set when we submitted our system. Our model achieves a 68.73% EM score and 77.39% F1 score, which is ranked among the state of the art single models (without model ensembling).Table 2 shows the ablation performances of various Q-code on the development set. Note that since the testset is hidden from us, we can only perform such an analysis on the development set. Our baseline model using no Q-code achieved a 68.00% and 77.36% EM and F1 scores, respectively. When we added the explicit question type T-code into the baseline model, the performance was improved slightly to 68.16%(EM) and 77.58%(F1). We then used TreeLSTM introduce syntactic parses for question representation and understanding (replacing simple question type as question understanding Q-code), which consistently shows further improvement. We further incorporated the soft adaptation. When letting the number of hidden question types ( K ) to be 20, the performance improves to 68.73%/77.74% on EM and F1, respectively, which corresponds to the results of our model reported in Table 1 . Furthermore, after submitted our result, we have experimented with a large value of K and found that when K=100 , we can achieve a better performance of 69.10%/78.38% on the development set.Figure UID61 shows the EM/F1 scores of different question types while Figure UID62 is the question type amount distribution on the development set. In Figure UID61 we can see that the average EM/F1 of the \\"when\\" question is highest and those of the \\"why\\" question is the lowest. From Figure UID62 we can see the \\"what\\" question is the major class.Figure 5 shows the composition of F1 score. Take our best model as an example, we observed a 78.38% F1 score on the whole development set, which can be separated into two parts: one is where F1 score equals to 100%, which means an exact match. This part accounts for 69.10% of the entire development set. And the other part accounts for 30.90%, of which the average F1 score is 30.03%. For the latter, we can further divide it into two sub-parts: one is where the F1 score equals to 0%, which means that predict answer is totally wrong. This part occupies 14.89% of the total development set. The other part accounts for 16.01% of the development set, of which average F1 score is 57.96%. From this analysis we can see that reducing the zero F1 score (14.89%) is potentially an important direction to further improve the system.ConclusionsClosely modelling questions could be of importance for question answering and machine reading. In this paper, we introduce syntactic information to help encode questions in neural networks. We view and model different types of questions and the information shared among them as an adaptation task and proposed adaptation models for them. On the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), we show that these approaches can help attain better results over a competitive baseline.Figure 1: A high level view of our basic model.Figure 2: The inference layer implemented with a residual network.Figure 3: The discriminative block for question discrimination and adaptation.Table 1: The official leaderboard of single models on SQuAD test set as we submitted our systems (January 20, 2017).Figure 4: Question Type AnalysisQuestion: how much of improvement the adaptation model can get?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\" 69.10%/78.38%\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"Table 2 shows the ablation performances of various Q-code on the development set.

These are mainly attributable to the simplifying assumptions made about the excitation source, which are usually required to maintain such low bit rates. In this paper a new LPC vocoder is presented which splits the LPC excitation into two frequency bands using a variable cutoff frequency. The lower band is responsible for representing the voiced parts of speech, whilst the upper band represents unvoiced speech. In doing so the coder 's performance during both mixed voicing speech and speech containing acoustic noise is greatly improved, producing soft natural sounding speech. The paper also describes new parameter determination and quantisation techniques vital to the operation of this coder at such low bit rates.","answer":"[[\\"parameter determination\\", \\"LPC vocoder\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"parameter determination\\", \\"quantisation techniques\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"buzzy or metallic artefacts\\", \\"synthetic speech\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"variable cutoff frequency\\", \\"LPC excitation\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"quantisation techniques\\", \\"LPC vocoder\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"low bit rates\\", \\"LPC vocoder\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"bit rates\\", \\"LPC based speech coders\\", \\"FEATURE-OF\\"], [\\"variable cutoff frequency\\", \\"frequency bands\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"mixed voicing speech\\", \\"LPC vocoder\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"speech containing acoustic noise\\", \\"LPC vocoder\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"LPC vocoder\\", \\"soft natural sounding speech\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Currently, application of IGF-IR -targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), alone or in combination with other drugs, is a promising strategy for breast cancer therapy. Single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies have been introduced as appropriate tools for tumor-targeting purposes because of their advantages over whole antibodies. In the present study, we employed a naïve phage library and isolated scFvs against a specific epitope from extracellular domain of IGF-IR by panning process. The selected scFvs were further characterized using polyclonal and monoclonal phage ELISA, soluble monoclonal ELISA, and colony PCR and sequencing. Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of selected scFv antibodies on breast cancer cell lines were also evaluated by MTT and Annexin V/PI assays. The results of ELISA indicated specific reactions of the isolated scFvs against the IGF-IR peptide, and analyses of PCR product and sequencing confirmed the presence of full length VH and Vκ inserts. Treatment of MCF7 and SKBR3 cells with anti-IGF-IR scFv led to a significant growth inhibition. The results also showed that scFv treatment significantly augmented trastuzumab growth inhibitory effects on SKBR3 cells. The percentage of the apoptotic MCF7 and SKBR3 cells after 24-h treatment with scFv was 39 and 30.70 %, respectively. Twenty-four-hour treatment with scFv in combination with trastuzumab resulted in 44.75 % apoptosis of SKBR3 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the targeting of IGF-IR by scFv can be an effective strategy in the treatment of breast cancer and provide further evidence for effectiveness of dual targeting of HER2 and IGF-IR in breast cancer therapy.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"MCF7\\", \\"breast cancer cells\\", \\"SKBR3 cells\\", \\"breast cancer cell lines\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"proliferation\\", \\"apoptosis\\", \\"targeting\\", \\"growth inhibition\\", \\"survival\\", \\"metastasis\\", \\"apoptotic\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"monoclonal antibodies\\", \\"VH and Vu03ba inserts\\", \\"scFvs\\", \\"anti-insulin-like growth factor I receptor single chain antibody\\", \\"mAbs\\", \\"drugs\\", \\"Single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies\\", \\"scFv antibodies\\", \\"scFv\\", \\"whole antibodies\\", \\"anti-IGF-IR scFv\\", \\"IGF-IR\\", \\"HER2\\", \\"nau00efve phage library\\", \\"Insulin-like growth factor I receptor\\", \\"specific epitope\\", \\"trastuzumab growth inhibitory\\", \\"trastuzumab\\", \\"IGF-IR peptide\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"presence\\", \\"tumor-targeting purposes\\", \\"Antiproliferative\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"analyses of PCR product\\", \\"Annexin V/PI assays\\", \\"monoclonal phage ELISA\\", \\"ELISA\\", \\"treatment of breast cancer\\", \\"breast cancer therapy\\", \\"polyclonal\\", \\"monoclonal ELISA\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"colony PCR\\", \\"promising strategy\\", \\"MTT\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"extracellular domain\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

A combination of mitoxantrone plus prednisone is preferable to prednisone alone for reduction of pain in men with metastatic, hormone-resistant, prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these treatments on health-related quality of life (HQL).  Patients And Methods Men with metastatic prostate cancer (n = 161) were randomized to receive either daily prednisone alone or mitoxantrone (every 3 weeks) plus prednisone. Those who received prednisone alone could have mitoxantrone added after 6 weeks if there was no improvement in pain . HQL was assessed before treatment initiation and then every 3 weeks using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Module-Prostate 14 (QOLM-P14), a trial-specific module developed for this study. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to determine the mean duration of HQL improvement and differences in improvement duration between groups of patients.  results At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains, and only physical functioning and pain were better in the mitoxantrone-plus-prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group. After 6 weeks, patients taking prednisone showed no improvement in HQL scores, whereas those taking mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life (P =.009), four functioning domains, and nine symptoms (.001 < P <. 01), and the improvement (> 10 units on a scale of 0 to100) lasted longer than in the prednisone-alone group (.004 < P <.05). The addition of mitoxantrone to prednisone after failure of prednisone alone was associated with improvements in pain, pain impact, pain relief, insomnia, and global quality of life (.001 < P <.003).  conclusion Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.sentence: Those who received prednisone alone could have mitoxantrone added after 6 weeks if there was no improvement in pain .","answer":"[[\\"prednisone\\", \\"mitoxantrone\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

To determine the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) gene and its role in gastric and colon cancers, we analyzed 10 gastric and 10 colon non-drug-selected cell lines and a similar number of tissue samples of these cancers. We compared the expression of MRP and mdrl mRNA in cell lines and tissues using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In mdrl-negative cells, the relationship between the level of MRP gene expression and sensitivity to anticancer drugs was examined. The effect of verapamil, an MRP-modulating agent, was also examined in these cells. The expression of MRP gene in gastric cancer cell lines varied from a low to a high level, but mdrl was not detected in any of these cell lines. Colon cancer cell lines expressed low to intermediate levels of MRP gene, and half of the cells co-expressed low to high levels of mdrl. In tissue samples, the expression pattern of the two multidrug resistance (MDR) genes was broadly similar to that described for the cell lines, except that most of the gastric cancer tissue samples did express low levels of mdrl. No significant correlation was observed between the level of MRP gene expression and sensitivity to anticancer drugs in gastric and colon cell lines.

We have developed a 3-dimensional human hemi-cornea which comprises an immortalized epithelial cell line and keratocytes embedded in a collagen stroma. In the present study, we have used MTT reduction of the whole tissue to clarify whether the production of this complex 3-D-model is transferable into other laboratories and whether these tissues can be constructed reproducibly. Our results demonstrate the reproducible production of the hemi-cornea model according to standard operation procedures using 15 independent batches of reconstructed hemi-cornea models in two independent laboratories each. Furthermore, the hemi-cornea tissues have been treated with 20 chemicals of different eye-irritating potential under blind conditions to assess the performance and limitations of our test system comparing three different prediction models. The most suitable prediction model revealed an overall in vitro-in vivo concordance of 80% and 70% in the participating laboratories, respectively, and an inter-laboratory concordance of 80%. Sensitivity of the test was 77% and specificity was between 57% and 86% to discriminate classified from non-classified chemicals.

These interactions are typically mediated through environmental modifications; microbes change the environment by taking up resources and excreting metabolites, which affects the growth of both themselves and also other microbes. We show here that the way microbes modify their environment and react to it sets the interactions within single-species populations and also between different species. A very common environmental modification is a change of the environmental pH. We find experimentally that these pH changes create feedback loops that can determine the fate of bacterial populations; they can either facilitate or inhibit growth, and in extreme cases will cause extinction of the bacterial population. Understanding how single species change the pH and react to these changes allowed us to estimate their pairwise interaction outcomes. Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs—bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.Introduction:Microbes thrive essentially everywhere on this planet, usually as part of complex multispecies communities[1]. The interactions between the microbes influence their growth and survival and thus the composition of those communities[2–8]. Although microbial interactions are of clear importance, only limited insights exist. They are often obtained from microbial systems in which a specific molecular mechanism causes a specific interaction, like mutualism caused by crossfeeding of amino acids, organic acids, and unknown substances[9–17]; crossprotection from antibiotics[18–21]; or competition by toxins[13, 22–24]. Can we develop a more general understanding of microbial interactions? Despite the large number of possible types of interactions, they all have certain points in common because interactions are, in general, mediated through the environment. First, microbes change the environment by consuming resources and excreting metabolites. Second, these changes to the environment influence the growth and survival of both the microbe that originally altered the environment as well as other microbial species that are present. Therefore, the interaction between microbes may be set by how their metabolisms change the environment and react to those changes. A very important parameter for microbes is the pH, and different species prefer different pH values. Therefore, pH strongly influences the species composition in soil[25–29] or the human gut microbiome[30]. On the other hand, many biochemical reactions involve a turnover of protons, and therefore microbes also alter the pH around them. We chose the pH as a model environmental parameter—because it can be easily measured, manipulated, and buffered and is, moreover, important for all microbes—and show here that the way microbes modify the pH of their environment feeds back on them but also influences other microbes. This determines their growth behavior and the interactions between different bacterial species based upon how each species interacts with pH changes in the environment. We show here, with the pH as a model parameter, that knowing the preferred environmental conditions of bacteria and how the bacteria manipulate the environment sets their interactions and allows us to predict the interactions between the microbes based on their metabolic properties. This approach may deliver a framework to understand and predict microbial interactions independent of the underlying molecular mechanism.Discussion:Although bacterial interactions are commonly regarded as a very complex business, we found here a surprising simplicity. By studying how bacteria change their environment and react to it, we were able to understand a variety of interactions within populations as well as interactions between different species. Although the interaction outcomes were quite different, they were all mediated by a single environmental parameter—the pH—which shows that even a rather complex set of interactions can be mediated through the same environmental parameter. This significantly simplifies the situation and gives hope that even more complex microbial communities may be tractable. Moreover, the pH is a very general parameter that essentially all microbes influence and depend on. Indeed, the pH could be identified as a major driver of bacterial interactions in nature in several cases like the oral[46, 47] or gut microbiome[48, 49]. Many microbes are known to show an Allee effect by cooperatively secreting “public goods”—like enzymes that break down complex sugars[50–53]. However, in our system, the Allee effect was mediated by the pH without the necessity of a specialized enzymatic machinery. This suggests that cooperation may be easier to achieve and more widespread than is often assumed. Cooperation is a very important collective phenomenon, in which organisms work together to achieve something they could not on their own. However, we could also find a different type of collective action with which bacteria collectively deteriorate their environment and thus cause their own extinction—the ecological suicide. We discuss this surprising effect in more depth in a separate manuscript[35]. After understanding the interactions within a population as mediated through the environment, we went a step further and applied the same reasoning to interspecies interactions. Surprisingly, a simple model could quite accurately forecast the interaction motifs that we later found experimentally: bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—all driven by pH modifications. In our model( Fig 3), the pH could be replaced by any other environmental parameter or a combination of parameters that is affected by and affects microbes—like oxygen or metabolite concentrations. Therefore, describing microbial interactions as a combination of modifying the environment and reacting to it may give a general framework for microbial interactions independent of the exact underlying biochemical mechanism. And indeed, several examples for the described interaction motifs have been found in other studies. Bistability has been observed in the gut microbiome[54], successive growth in the colonization of chitin particles[55] or the human gut[56], and stabilization in a variety of crossfeeding and crossprotection metabolisms[11, 18]. To our knowledge, ecological suicide and thus also extended suicide are not yet described in microbes. However, a self-inflicted decline of populations could be found in several macro-organisms[57–59]. In many cases, microbial interactions may not be driven by a single parameter—the pH in our case—but a set of multiple parameters. However, also in these cases, the interactions are mediated by modifying and reacting to the environment. Correspondingly, our framework can be used and expanded towards multivariate systems and may thus lay the basis to understand more complex microbial interactions.","answer":"Microbes typically live alongside many other species in complex communities .

To identify previously unknown platelet receptors we compared the transcriptomes of in vitro differentiated megakaryocytes (MKs) and erythroblasts (EBs). RNA was obtained from purified, biologically paired MK and EB cultures and compared using cDNA microarrays. Bioinformatical analysis of MK-up-regulated genes identified 151 transcripts encoding transmembrane domain-containing proteins. Although many of these were known platelet genes, a number of previously unidentified or poorly characterized transcripts were also detected. Many of these transcripts, including G6b, G6f, LRRC32, LAT2, and the G protein-coupled receptor SUCNR1, encode proteins with structural features or functions that suggest they may be involved in the modulation of platelet function. Immunoblotting on platelets confirmed the presence of the encoded proteins, and flow cytometric analysis confirmed the expression of G6b, G6f, and LRRC32 on the surface of platelets. Through comparative analysis of expression in platelets and other blood cells we demonstrated that G6b, G6f, and LRRC32 are restricted to the platelet lineage, whereas LAT2 and SUCNR1 were also detected in other blood cells.

Models are tuned through repeated simulation until they match the observed behaviour. More recent work has used the fine scale motions of animals to validate and fit the rules of interaction of animals in groups. Here, we use a Bayesian methodology to compare a variety of models to the collective motion of glass prawns( Paratya australiensis). We show that these exhibit a stereotypical ‘phase transition’, whereby an increase in density leads to the onset of collective motion in one direction. We fit models to this data, which range from: a mean-field model where all prawns interact globally; to a spatial Markovian model where prawns are self-propelled particles influenced only by the current positions and directions of their neighbours; up to non-Markovian models where prawns have ‘memory’ of previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour. We show that the mean-field model fits the large scale behaviour of the system, but does not capture the observed locality of interactions. Traditional self-propelled particle models fail to capture the fine scale dynamics of the system. The most sophisticated model, the non-Markovian model, provides a good match to the data at both the fine scale and in terms of reproducing global dynamics, while maintaining a biologically plausible perceptual range. We conclude that prawns’ movements are influenced by not just the current direction of nearby conspecifics, but also those encountered in the recent past. Given the simplicity of prawns as a study system our research suggests that self-propelled particle models of collective motion should, if they are to be realistic at multiple biological scales, include memory of previous interactions and other non-Markovian effects.Introduction:The most striking features of the collective motion of animal groups are the large-scale patterns produced by flocks, schools and other groups. These patterns can extend over scales that exceed the interaction ranges of the individuals within the group[1]–[4]. For most flocking animals, the rules dictating the interactions between individuals, which ultimately generate the behaviour of the whole group, are still not known in any detail. Many ‘self-propelled’ particle models have been proposed for collective motion, each based on a relatively simple set of interaction rules between individuals moving in one, two or three dimensions[2],[5]–[8]. Typically these models implement a simple form of behavioural convergence, such as aligning the focal individual's velocity in the average direction of its neighbours or attraction towards the position of those neighbours. Generally such rules are explicitly kept as simple as possible while remaining realistic, with the aim of explaining as much as possible of collective motion from the simplest constituent parts. Each of the models in the literature is capable of reproducing key aspects of the large-scale behaviour of one or more biological systems of interest. Together these models help explain what aspects of inter-individual interactions are most important for creating emergent patterns of coherent group motion. With this proliferation of putative interaction rules has come the recognition that some patterns of group behaviour are common to many models, and that different models can have large areas of overlapping behaviour depending on the choice of parameters[4]. Common patterns of collective behaviour are also observed empirically across a diverse range of animal and biological systems. For example, a form of phase transition from disorder to order has been described in species as diverse as fish[9], ants[10], locusts[11], down to cells[12] and bacteria[13]. In all these systems, as density of these species is increased there is a sudden transition from random disordered motion to ordered motion with the group collectively moving in the same direction. These studies indicate that a great deal can be understood about collective behaviour without reduction to the precise rules of interaction. In many contexts however the rules of interaction are of more interest than the group behaviour they lead to. For example, when comparing the evolution of social behavior across different species, it is important to know if the same rules evolved independently in multiple instances, or whether each species evolved a different solution to the problem of behaving coherently as a group[1]. Recently researchers in the field have become interested in using tracking data from real systems on the fine scale to infer what precise rules of motion each individual uses and how they interact with the other individuals in the group[14]–[19]. This is an important trend in the field of collective motion as we move from a theoretical basis, centred around simulation studies, to a more data-driven approach. The most frequent approach to inferring these rules has been to find correlations between important measurable aspects of the behaviour of a focal individual and its neighbours. For example, Ballerini et al.[14] looked at how a focal individual's neighbours were distributed in space relative to the position of the focal individual itself in a group of starlings. Significant anisotropy in the position of the nearest neighbour, averaged over all individuals, was regarded as evidence for an interaction between each bird and that neighbour. More recently Katz et al.[18] and Herbert-Read et al.[19] investigated how the change in velocity of each individual in groups of fish was correlated to the positions and velocities of the neighbouring fish surrounding the focal individual. This provides evidence not only for the existence of an interaction between neighbours but also estimates the rules that determine that interaction. In these studies the rules of interaction are presented non-parametrically and cannot be immediately translated into a specific self-propelled particle model. Nor are these models validated in terms of the global schooling patterns produced by the fish. An alternative model-based approach that does fit self-propelled particle and similar models to data is proposed by Eriksson et al.[16] and Mann[17]. Under this approach, the recorded fine-scale movements of individuals are used to fit the parameters of, and select between, these models in terms of relative likelihood or quality-of-fit. This approach has the advantage of providing a parametric ‘best-fit’ model and can provide a quantitative estimate the relative probability of alternative hypotheses regarding interactions. What all previous empirical studies have lacked is a simultaneous verification of a model at both the individual and collective level. Either fine scale individual-level behaviour is observed without explicit fitting of a model[18],[19] or global properties, such as direction switches[11],[20], speed distributions[21],[22] or group decision outcome[23] have been compared between model and data. Verification at multiple scales is the necessary next step now that inference based on fine-scale data is becoming the norm. Just as simulations of large-scale phenomena can appear consistent with observations of group behaviour without closely matching the local rules of interaction, so can fine-scale inferred rules be inconsistent with large-scale phenomena if these rules of inferred from too limited a set of possible models or from correlations between the wrong behavioural measurements. The closest that any study so far has come to finding consistency between scales has been Lukeman et al.[15]. In their study the local spatial distribution of neighbouring individuals in a group of scoter ducks was used to propose parametric rules of interaction, with some parameters measured from the fine-scale observables, but with others left free to be fitted using large-scale data. We suggest that if group behaviour emerges from individual interactions, then the form of these interactions should be inferable solely from fine-scale data without additional fitting at the large-scale. An inability to replicate the group behaviour using a selected model demonstrates that the model space has been insufficiently explored. When faced with alternative hypothesised interaction rules, model-based parametric inference provides the best means of quantitatively selecting between them. In this paper we study the collective motion of small groups of the glass prawn, Paratya australiensis. Paratya australiensis is an atyid prawn which is widepsread throughout Australia[24]. Although typically found in large feeding aggregations, it does not appear to form social aggregations and has not been reported to exhibit collective behaviour patterns in the wild. We conduct a standard ‘phase transition’ experiment[9],[11],[12], studying how density affects collective alignment of the prawns. We complement this approach by using Bayesian inference to perform model selection based on empirical data at a detailed individual level. We select between models by calculating the probability of the fine scale motions using a Bayesian framework specifically to allow fair comparison between competing models of varying complexity. Comparison of the marginal likelihood, the probability of the data conditioned on the model, integrating over the uncertain parameter values, is a well developed and robust means of model selection that forms the core of the Bayesian methodology[25]–[28] and which has been applied to compare models in the biological sciences, particularly neuroscience[29]. Bayesian methods are also well established in animal behaviour through consideration of optimal decision making in the presence of conflicting information, both environmental[30] and social[31],[32]. In adopting this approach, we reject the dichotomy of model inference based on either fine scale behaviour of the individuals or the motion of the group. Instead we use reproduction of the large scale dynamics through simulation as a necessary but not sufficient condition of the correct model.Discussion:A number of physical[36]–[38], technological[39] and biological systems, including animals[9]–[11],[40], tissue cells[12], microorganisms[13],[41] are known to increase their collective order with density. Glass prawns are one additional example of such a system, which is particularly interesting since they are not known as gregarious or social species. By confining the prawns to a ring we facilitated their interactions and in doing so generated collective motion. This adds further support to the idea that collective motion is a universal phenomenon independent of the underlying interaction rules[4],[11],[42]. While we do not expect that prawns often find themselves confined in rings in a natural setting, they and other non-social animals do aggregate in response to environmental features such as food and shelter. Such environmental aggregations can, above a certain density, result in an apparently ‘social’ collective motion. The true value of this study, however, is found not in the addition of one more species to this growing list, but in demonstrating a rigorous methodology for selecting an optimal and multi-scale consistent model for the interactions between individuals in a group. We have used a combination of techniques to identify the optimal model for our experiments: Bayesian model selection, validation against global properties and consistency with biological reasoning. We applied Bayesian model selection to identify the model that best predicts the fine-scale interactions between prawns. This approach allows us to perform model selection in the presence of many competing hypotheses of varying complexity, while avoiding over fitting[17]. This indicated the selection of a non-Markovian model with a persistent ‘memory’ effect. We find that interactions are governed by a perceptual range which is symmetric about the focal individual which is somewhat greater than the average body length of the prawns( approximately radians). Reproduction of the large-scale dynamics is frequently used to validate mathematical models of biological systems, but presents only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for model validation. Indeed, all of the models we have assessed in this work can, with the appropriate parameters, generate aligned motion consistent with experiment. The fact that our mean-field model reproduces global dynamics, but fails at a fine-scale level is not particularly surprising. Mean-field models are not designed to reproduce spatially local dynamics[1]. More illuminating, however, is the failure of Markovian spatial models to reproduce the fine-scale dynamics when the locality of interactions between individuals is imposed. Models S1, S2, S3, S4 are variants of the standard one dimensional Vicsek self-propelled particle model[43], which has previously been validated against the global alignment patterns of marching locusts[11]. For the prawns these models perform poorly on both capturing the fine scale dynamics of interactions and in reproducing the large scale alignment patterns seen in the data. This inconsistency allowed us to reject standard self-propelled particle models as a good model of the data. To identify a better model we first visually inspected the interactions between the prawns. These observations suggested a ‘memory effect’, whereby a prawn would remain influenced by individuals beyond the moment of interaction. The resulting models are able reproduce the fine scale and large scale dynamics of the prawns, while also maintaining the biologically-intuitive locality of interactions between individuals. More generally, we would expect other examples of animal motion to be non-Markovian, with individuals taking time to react to others, to complete their own actions and also potentially reacting through memory of past situations. In this context, it is important to consider the limitations of recent studies identifying rules of interaction of fish[18],[19]. These studies concentrated on quantifying local interactions, but do not try to reproduce global properties. It may be that non-Markovian and other effects are needed to produce these properties. In what circumstances can we expect non-Markovian effects to play an important role in collective behaviour? Inference based on a Markovian model must account for behavioural changes of a focal individual in terms of their current environment. As such the crucial factor is how much the local environment changes between when the animal receives information and when it responds. Large changes in the local environment can be caused by long response times or by rapid movements of other animals relative to the focal individual. Where behavioural changes are strongly discontinuous, such as the binary one-dimensional movement in this study, non-Markovian effects may become especially important. This is because the focal individual may have to execute a number of small changes( such as stopping and turning through a several small angles) in order to register as having changed its direction of motion. Over the course of making many adjustments the environment can change dramatically from the moment that the change was initiated. We have compared the models on the large scale by evaluating the quality-of-fit between the distribution of large scale outcomes predicted by model simulations with that seen in experiments. The model we select from the fine scale analysis is also evaluated as the best on this large scale analysis, and produces simulation results that are qualitatively consistent with experiment( see Figure 6). Because the same model is selected from both analyses we have not been forced to weight the relative importance of each. In future it may be necessary to decide on an appropriate weighting of these different criteria where they disagree on the optimal model. The research presented here provides a first step towards the use of multi-scale inference in the study of collective animal behaviour and in other multi-level complex systems.","answer":"The collective movement of animals in a group is an impressive phenomenon whereby large scale spatio-temporal patterns emerge from simple interactions between individuals .

Thus, a novel cell source must be developed. We recently reported that mature rodent hepatocytes can be reprogrammed into progenitor-like cells with a repopulative capacity using small molecule inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that hepatic progenitor cells can be obtained from human infant hepatocytes using the same strategy. These cells, named human chemically induced liver progenitors( hCLiPs), had a significant repopulative capacity in injured mouse livers following transplantation. hCLiPs redifferentiated into mature hepatocytes in vitro upon treatment with hepatic maturation-inducing factors. These redifferentiated cells exhibited cytochrome P450( CYP) enzymatic activities in response to CYP-inducing molecules and these activities were comparable with those in primary human hepatocytes. These findings will facilitate liver cell transplantation therapy and drug discovery studies.Introduction:Expansion of functional human hepatocytes is a prerequisite for liver regenerative medicine. Human hepatocytes are currently regarded as the only competent cell source for transplantation therapy( Fisher and Strom, 2006); however, their availability is limited due to a shortage of donors. Moreover, the therapeutic application of hepatocytes is hampered by their inability to proliferate in vitro. To overcome this, researchers have sought to generate expandable cell sources as alternatives to primary hepatocytes. Such cell sources include embryonic stem cell- and induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived hepatic cells( Carpentier et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2011; Takebe et al., 2013; Woo et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2014), lineage-converted hepatic cells( induced hepatic cells;( Du et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014), and facultative liver stem/progenitor cells( LPCs) residing in adult liver tissue( Huch et al., 2015). However, while primary hepatocytes efficiently repopulate injured mouse livers( repopulation indexes( RIs) > 50%), the repopulation efficiency of these laboratory-generated hepatocytes is limited, with reported RIs generally less than 5%( reviewed in Rezvani et al., 2016). Researchers have also attempted to expand primary human hepatocytes( PHHs) in vitro. Several studies reported the expansion of these cells( Hino et al., 1999; Shan et al., 2013; Utoh et al., 2008; Walldorf et al., 2004; Yamasaki et al., 2006), suggesting that they are potentially applicable for transplantation therapy. However, the growth rate and proliferative lifespan of PHHs are limited. For example, Yoshizato’s group reported that PHHs can be cultured for several passages, but their growth rate is slow( population doubling time of 20–300 days)( Yamasaki et al., 2006). This finding indicates that culture of PHHs must be improved for the clinical application of these cells. We recently reported that a cocktail of small molecule signaling inhibitors reprograms rodent adult hepatocytes into culturable LPCs, named chemically induced liver progenitors( CLiPs)( Katsuda et al., 2017). Notably, rat CLiPs extensively repopulate chronically injured mouse livers without causing any tumorigenic features. Here, using the same strategy, we demonstrate that human infant hepatocytes can be also converted into proliferative LPC-like cells, which are named human CLiPs.Discussion:In this study, we demonstrated that hCLiPs can repopulate chronically injured livers of immunodeficient mice. An efficient repopulative capacity is one of the most important requirements of a candidate cell source for transplantation therapy; however, it is very challenging to develop such a cultured cell source. Laboratory-generated hepatic cells, such as pluripotent cell-derived hepatic cells and those transdifferentiated from cells of different lineage origins, have a poor repopulative capacity( Rezvani et al., 2016). The RI of laboratory-generated hepatocytes is typically less than 5%( Rezvani et al., 2016). After our report of rodent CLiPs( Katsuda et al., 2017), four groups recently reported methods for in vitro generation of proliferative liver( progenitor) cells from human hepatocytes( Fu et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018;; Kim et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018). In three of these studies( Fu et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018;; Kim et al., 2019), the generated cells exhibited relatively low repopulative efficiency with approximately 13% of RI at maximum. In contrast, Zhang el al. reported strikingly high repopulation efficiency with as high as 64% of RI( Zhang et al., 2018). Importantly, although the proliferative efficiency is limited compared with IPHHs, they succeeded in induction of proliferative hepatic cells even from APHHs. Moreover, contrary to the dichotomous repopulation of hCLiPs in our study( RI >80% or nearly 0%), Zhang et al demonstrated highly stable repopulation among transplanted animals. Our study is, thus, not the first one to report substantial repopulation using an in vitro-generated human hepatic cell source. Nonetheless, to solidify a novel concept, more evidence must be provided independently from multiple laboratories. As such, we still believe that our work also plays an important role in pioneering this new field. Another important finding in this study is that hCLiPs may be a novel cell source for drug discovery studies. The major criterion for the application of cultured hepatic cells in drug discovery studies, particularly to evaluate the functions of drug-metabolizing enzymes, is the inducibility of CYP enzymatic activities. CYP enzymes play central roles in the metabolism of clinically used drugs and xenobiotics. In general, CYP induction accelerates the clearance of xenobiotics, leading to beneficial or harmful outcomes depending on the context. Thus, recapitulation of CYP induction in cultured hepatocytes or their equivalents is important to precisely predict the effects of a tested drug on hepatocytes. However, PHHs lose their hepatic functions, including CYP inducibility, upon in vitro culture. Laboratory-generated hepatocytes reportedly exhibit basal CYP activities after maturation( Baxter et al., 2015; Kanninen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2011; Takayama et al., 2018; Takayama et al., 2014). Although a few groups described CYP inducibility in terms of enzymatic activity( Inamura et al., 2011; Pettinato et al., 2016; Takayama et al., 2012), such reports are very limited, to the best of our knowledge. We propose that hCLiPs are a novel platform for drug discovery studies. An issue yet to be addressed is clarification of the mechanism underlying the small molecule-mediated conversion of PHHs to hCLiPs. Mini-screen of three small molecules Y, A and C demonstrated that A and C individually accelerated proliferation of PHHs, while Y alone exhibited no beneficial effect on proliferation, and even negatively affected proliferation when combined with AC( in comparison of YAC with AC). This is in line with our previous observation in rodent hepatocyte culture, in which Y minimally affected the proliferation of these three small molecules( Katsuda et al., 2017). AC substantially induced the proliferation of rodent hepatocytes at the comparable, if not at the same, level with YAC( Katsuda et al., 2017). Thus, the synergistic effect of A83-01 and CHIR99021 is the key to hepatocyte proliferation in rodent and human hepatocytes. Importantly, comparative analysis of APHHs and IPHHs suggested that activity of Wnt signaling in response to CHIR99021 may partly explain the proliferative ability of IPHHs. On the other hand, APHHs responded to A83-01 equally or even more efficiently than IPHHs, leaving a question how A83-01 affected the proliferation of IPHHs, but not APHHs. Since A83-01 is essential to IPHH proliferation as assessed in the mini-screen( Figure 1A), this small molecule might affect IPHHs in a TGFβ-independent manner. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the difference between the proliferative ability endowed by FAC between IPHHs and APHHs. Another important issue to be considered is the requirement for FBS in hCLiP induction, which is not the case for rodent CLiP induction. FBS-derived factor( s) essential for hCLiP induction should be identified in a future study. Comparison of our study with the recently reported four studies provides hints to mechanistic understanding of in vitro PHH expansion( Fu et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018). Notably, hepatocyte growth factor( HGF), which is not included in our culture condition, is used in all these four studies, suggesting its critical role. Indeed, Kim et al.( 2019) particularly emphasizes its essential role in the presence of AC. On the other hand, Zhang et al.( 2018) ascribe the proliferative capacity of PHHs particularly to Wnt signaling( Zhang et al., 2018). Interestingly, these authors reported that Wnt3a plays an essential role, while neither CHIR99021 nor Wnt signaling amplifier Rspo1 substituted for the pro-proliferative effect of Wnt3a. Moreover, these authors proposed a unique idea that hypoxic culture condition supports the stable proliferation of PHHs by suppressing PHH senescence. In line with this observation, Fu et al. also demonstrated that a sirtuin suppressor nicotinamide decreases proliferation of PHH. This finding highlights the difference between human and rodent PHHs: nicotinamide is known to induce proliferation of rat hepatocytes( Mitaka et al., 1991) and thus is frequently added to hepatocyte culture medium( including ours), but this may not be the case for induction of PHH proliferation. Collectively, these findings, including ours, provide important insight to optimization of the methodology of PHH expansion.","answer":"One of the most successful treatments for liver disease is transplanting a donor liver into a patient .

Departmental chairs had a median h index of 22 (range 3-55) and program directors a median of 17 (range 0-62). Plot of the log of the rank versus h index demonstrated a remarkable linear pattern (R(2) = 0.995, p < 0.0001), suggesting that this is a power-law relationship.The distribution of the h index within an academic population is described for the first time and appears related to the ubiquitous power-law distribution.As expected, the h index increased with academic rank and there was a statistically significant difference between each rank.Within the field of academic neurosurgery, clear differences of h indices between academic ranks exist. On average, an increase of the h index by 5 appears to correspond to the next highest academic rank, with the exception of chairperson.Scopus h-index was of borderline significance in predicting physician salary (P = 0.12).","answer":"Greater h-index is associated with greater academic rank in academic neurosurgery.

These cells are a mesenchymal highly migratory group of cells that give rise to a wide variety of cell derivatives: melanocytes, sensory neurons, bone, Schwann cells, etc.Cell types with neural crest ancestry consequently comprise a number of specialized varieties, such as ectodermal neurons, melanocytes and Schwann cells, as well as mesodermal osteoblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells.Melanocytes, the pigmented cells of the skin, and the glial Schwann cells lining peripheral nerves are developmentally derived from an early and transient ectodermal structure of the vertebrate embryo, the neural crest, which is also at the origin of multiple neural and non-neural cell types.Later, SoxE proteins drive the formation of multiple neural crest derivatives including chondrocytes, melanocytes, and cells of the peripheral nervous system, particularly Schwann cells/peripheral glia.Melanocytes and Schwann cells are derived from the multipotent population of neural crest cells.The present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cells.Melanocytes and Schwann cells both arise from the neural crest during development, and some melanocytes arise directly from Schwann cell precursors lining developing spinal nervesSchwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), originate from multipotent neural crest cells that also give rise to other cells, including neurons, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cellsIn the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchymeThe present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cellsThus, the nevus cells shared a common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells in the expression of these antigenic substancesMelanocytes, the pigmented cells of the skin, and the glial Schwann cells lining peripheral nerves are developmentally derived from an early and transient ectodermal structure of the vertebrate embryo, the neural crest, which is also at the origin of multiple neural and non-neural cell typesFurthermore, although both populations are initially part of the Foxd3 lineage, hypaxial melanocytes lose Foxd3 at late stages upon separation from the nerve, whereas we recently found that epaxial melanocytes segregate earlier from Foxd3-positive neural progenitors while still residing in the dorsal neural tube.Reversal of developmental restrictions in neural crest lineages: transition from Schwann cells to glial-melanocytic precursors in vitro.Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), originate from multipotent neural crest cells that also give rise to other cells, including neurons, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells.In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme.Thus, the nevus cells shared a common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells in the expression of these antigenic substances.Other already committed cells are the angioblasts forming the endothelial lining of the blood vessels, the neural crest cells differentiating into melanocytes and Schwann cells, and the blood-derived cells like chrondro- or osteoclasts.The dorsal neural tube first generates neural crest cells that exit the neural primordium following an epithelial-to-mesenchymal conversion to become sympathetic ganglia, Schwann cells, dorsal root sensory ganglia, and melanocytes of the skin.We show here that neural crest cells arising from the neural tube located at the level of somites 47-53 can differentiate both in vitro and in vivo into melanocytes and Schwann cells but not into neurons.This capacity may be due to the common origin of Schwann cells and melanocytes in the neural crest.Melanocytes and Schwann cells both arise from the neural crest during development, and some melanocytes arise directly from Schwann cell precursors lining developing spinal nerves.In the vertebrate embryo, multiple cell types originate from a common structure, the neural crest (NC), which forms at the dorsal tips of the neural epithelium.","answer":"neural crest cells, or NCC"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

(2017) ; Yu et al. (2018) ; ; inter alia) and constitutes an important caveat to conclusions drawn regarding a model's language understanding abilities.While semantically invariant text transformations can remarkably alter a model's predictions, the converse problem of model undersensitivity is equally troublesome: a model's text input can often be drastically changed in meaning while retaining the original prediction.In particular, previous works (Feng et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2018a; Sugawara et al., 2018) show that even after deletion of all but a small fraction of input words, models often produce the same output.However, such reduced inputs are usually unnatural to a human reader, and it is both unclear what behaviour we should expect from natural language models evaluated on unnatural text, and how to use such unnatural inputs to improve models.In this work, we show that in RC undersensitivity can be probed with automatically generated natural language questions.In turn, we use these to both make RC models more sensitive when they should be, and more robust in the presence of biased training data.Fig.1 shows an examples for a BERT LARGE model ) trained on SQuAD2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) that is given a text and a comprehension question, i.e. \\"What was Fort Caroline renamed to after the Spanish attack?\\" which it correctly answers as \\"San Mateo\\" with 98% confidence.Altering this question, however, can increase model confidence for this same prediction to 99%, even though the new question is unanswerable given the same context.That is, we observe an increase in model probability, despite removing relevant question information and replacing it with irrelevant content.We formalise the process of finding such questions as an adversarial search in a discrete input space arising from perturbations of the original question.There are two types of discrete perturbations that we consider, based on part-of-speech and named entities, with the aim of obtaining grammatical and semantically consistent alternative questions that do not accidentally have the same correct answer.We find that SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017 ) models can be attacked on a substantial proportion of samples, even with a limited computational adversarial search budget.The observed undersensitivity correlates negatively with standard performance metrics (EM/F 1 ), suggesting that this phenomenon -where present -is a reflection of a model's lack of question comprehension.When training models to defend against undersensitivity attacks with data augmentation and adversarial training, we observe that they can generalise their robustness to held out evaluation data without sacrificing standard performance.Furthermore, we notice they are also more robust in a learning scenario that has dataset bias with a train/evaluation distribution mismatch, increasing their performance by up to 11%F 1 .In summary, our contributions are as follows:• We propose a new type of adversarial attack targeting the undersensitivity of neural RC models, and show that current models are vulnerable to it.• We compare two defence strategies, data augmentation and adversarial training, and show their effectiveness at reducing undersensitivity errors on held-out data, without sacrificing standard performance.• We demonstrate that robust models generalise better in a biased data scenario, improving their ability to answer questions with many possible answers when trained on questions with only one.We have investigated a problematic behaviour of RC models -being overly stable in their predictions when given semantically altered questions.This undersensitivity can be drastically reduced with appropriate defences, such as adversarial training, and results in more robust models without sacrificing standard performance.Future work should study in more detail the causes and better defences to model undersensitivity, which we believe provides an alternative viewpoint on evaluating a model's RC capabilities.5 approximate as we stratify by article 6 We also include an experiment with the setup used in (Lewis & Fan, 2019) Table 7 : Breakdown of undersensitivity error rate on NewsQA with a held-out attack space (lower is better).A APPENDIX: POS PERTURBATION DETAILS.We exclude these PoS-tags when computing perturbations:","answer":"We demonstrate vulnerability to undersensitivity attacks in SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA neural reading comprehension models, where the model predicts the same answer with increased confidence to adversarially chosen questions, and compare defence strategies."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

However , the prognostic role of complete and so‐called optimal and suboptimal debulking and its interaction with biological factors has not been not fully definedTitle 2:Predictors of response to subsequent chemotherapy in platinum pretreated ovarian cancer: a multivariate analysis of 704 patients [seecomments].Abstract 2:BACKGROUND The probability of response to chemotherapy following platinum based treatment in ovarian cancer has usually been related to the ' platinum-free interval ' . However , in a recent European-Canadian trial of paclitaxel , serous histology , tumor bulk , and hemoglobin , but not treatment free interval , were predictors of response . To determine if these observations were unique to this study ( or this drug ) , data from other active agents given as second- or third-line treatment in ovarian cancer were obtained and analyzed . METHODS In the first part of the study , results of trials in 1185 platinum pretreated ovarian cancer patients were obtained on six agents : paclitaxel , epirubicin , docetaxel , carboplatin , irinotecan , and gemcitabine . Response results according to histology , baseline hemoglobin , tumor size and time from last chemotherapy were determined for each agent and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel procedure was used to obtain an overall assessment of significance for each factor . In the second part of the study , individual data from 704 patients in four studies ( three agents : paclitaxel , docetaxel and epirubicin ) were pooled for univariate and multivariate analysis of factors predictive of response . RESULTS In the analysis of results of individual agents all factors examined were significant predictors of response : serous histology ( P = 0.001 ) , tumor size < or = 5 cm ( P = 0.02 ) , normal baseline hemoglobin ( P = 0.003 ) , and > or = 6 mo since last treatment ( P = 0.001 ) . While these results were interesting , they did not supply definitive answers regarding independent response predictors . Therefore a multifactor analysis was undertaken on the 704 patients for whom individual data were available . Of the 11 factors examined in a univariate analysis , 10 met the criteria for inclusion in a stepwise logistic regression . In the final model only 3 factors remained as significant independent predictors of response : serous histology ( P = 0.009 ) , no. disease sites ( P = 0.003 ) , and tumor size ( P = 0.001 ) . Time from last treatment , when evaluated as a continuous variable , was not in the final model and was highly correlated with tumor size ( P = 0.0005 ) . CONCLUSIONS On the basis of this analysis , we conclude that tumor burden ( as assessed by size of the largest lesion and number of disease sites ) and histology are factors of importance in response to subsequent chemotherapy in relapsed ovarian cancer . Time from last treatment was correlated with tumor size in this data set and its effect on response was dependent on whether it was examined as a categorical or continuous variable , so we conclude it is not the sole critical factor of biologic importance . We recommend description of these factors in reports of phase II studies , confirmation of these findings in other data sets and further investigation of the mechanism of sensitivity of serous tumors","answer":"Conclusions MTV and TLG from 18F-FDG PET were significant prognostic factors in patients with ovarian cancer .Despite the clinical heterogeneity and difference in methodology between the studies , patients with a high MTV or TLG have a higher risk of disease progression or death"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Therefore, regeneration of pulp is considered an ideal treatment to preserve teeth.Constitutive stabilization of ß-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to excessive dentin and cementum formationWnt/ß-catenin signaling plays an important role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation during development. Essential roles of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in tooth morphogenesis have been well knownOur results indicate that persistent stabilization of ß-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to premature differentiation of odontoblasts and differentiation of cementoblasts, and induces excessive dentin and cementum formation in vivo. These results suggest that temporospatial regulation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling plays critical roles in the differentiation of odontoblasts and cementoblasts, and that inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling may be important for the formation of dentin and cementum during tooth developmentLocal modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling has therapeutic potential to improve the regeneration of dentin and periodontiumIt is known that the dental follicle (DF) consists of progenitor cells that give rise to the cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bonebut little information is available about the regulation of DF cell differentiation into either cementogenic or osteogenic cell lineages for the regeneration of diseased periodontal tissue. Here, we investigated the roles of DF, Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS), and pulp cells in the cementumThese results suggest that the combined use of DF, HERS, and pulp cells could direct DF cell differentiation into cementoblasts and/or osteoblasts in vivo, thus providing a novel strategy for the successful repair and regeneration of diseased periodontal tissueHERS cells played a role in the induction and maturation of cementum-like tissues formed by DF cellsimplants of DF cells in the presence of pulp cells led to the formation of bone-like tissuesInterestingly, in the presence of both HERS and pulp cells, DF cells formed both cementum-like and bone-like tissues. We demonstrated that while HERS cells are able to induce DF cell differentiation into cementoblasts and promote cementum formation, pulp cells could direct DF cell differentiation into osteoblasts and enhance alveolar bone formationPeriodontal ligament (PDL) and cementum complex and dentin pulp complex have been tissue engineered using human dental pulp stem cells and PDL stem cellsHistological, immunohistochemical, and scanning electronic microscopy examinations results showed that bioengineered dentin could induce cementogenesis and PDL formation, and condense PDL arranged perpendicularly on the dentin surface via a layer of cementum-like tissue","answer":"The dental follicle (DF) consists of progenitor cells that give rise to the cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone.

Evaluation research is needed, but, as human interaction is difficult to standardise, there is a need to capture the content beyond moral reasoning. This allows for a better understanding of Moral Case Deliberation, which may contribute to further development of valid outcome criteria and stimulate the normative discussion of what Moral Case Deliberation should contain. To explore and compare the content beyond moral reasoning in the dialogue in Moral Case Deliberation at Swedish workplaces. A mixed-methods approach was applied for analysing audio-recordings of 70 periodic Moral Case Deliberation meetings at 10 Swedish workplaces. Moral Case Deliberation facilitators and various healthcare professions participated, with registered nurses comprising the majority. Ethical considerations: No objection to the study was made by an Ethical Review Board. After oral and written information was provided, consent to be recorded was assumed by virtue of participation. Other than ' moral reasoning ' (median (md): 45% of the spoken time), the Moral Case Deliberations consisted of 'reflections on the psychosocial work environment ' to a varying extent (md: 29%). Additional content comprised 'assumptions about the patient's psychosocial situation ' (md: 6%), 'facts about the patient's situation ' (md: 5%), 'concrete problem-solving ' (md: 6%) and ' process ' (md: 3%). The findings suggest that a restorative function of staff's wellbeing in Moral Case Deliberation is needed, as this might contribute to good patient care. This supports outcome criteria of improved emotional support, which may include relief of moral distress. However, facilitators need a strategy for how to proceed from the participants ' own emotional needs and to develop the use of their emotional knowing to focus on the ethically difficult patient situation.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"moral distress\\", \\"moral reasoning\\", \\"problem-solving\\", \\"understanding\\", \\"Understanding\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"psychosocial work\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"human\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"patientu0027s situation\\", \\"No objection\\", \\"emotional knowing\\", \\"considerations\\", \\"patient situation\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"audio-recordings\\", \\"written information\\", \\"emotional support\\", \\"patient care\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"mixed-methods approach\\", \\"recorded\\", \\"moral question\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"participants\\", \\"Swedish\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"facilitator\\", \\"Ethical Review Board\\", \\"healthcare professions\\", \\"registered nurses\\", \\"staffu0027s\\", \\"healthcare professionals\\", \\"facilitators\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"analysing\\", \\"Evaluation research\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"workplaces\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

To elucidate the role of age-related epigenetic changes in healthy ageing and potential longevity, we tested for association between whole-blood DNA methylation patterns in 172 female twins aged 32 to 80 with age and age-related phenotypes. Twin-based DNA methylation levels at 26, 690 CpG-sites showed evidence for mean genome-wide heritability of 18%, which was supported by the identification of 1, 537 CpG-sites with methylation QTLs in cis at FDR 5%. We performed genome-wide analyses to discover differentially methylated regions( DMRs) for sixteen age-related phenotypes( ap-DMRs) and chronological age( a-DMRs). Epigenome-wide association scans( EWAS) identified age-related phenotype DMRs( ap-DMRs) associated with LDL( STAT5A), lung function( WT1), and maternal longevity( ARL4A, TBX20). In contrast, EWAS for chronological age identified hundreds of predominantly hyper-methylated age DMRs( 490 a-DMRs at FDR 5%), of which only one( TBX20) was also associated with an age-related phenotype. Therefore, the majority of age-related changes in DNA methylation are not associated with phenotypic measures of healthy ageing in later life. We replicated a large proportion of a-DMRs in a sample of 44 younger adult MZ twins aged 20 to 61, suggesting that a-DMRs may initiate at an earlier age. We next explored potential genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying a-DMRs and ap-DMRs. Genome-wide overlap across cis-meQTLs, genotype-phenotype associations, and EWAS ap-DMRs identified CpG-sites that had cis-meQTLs with evidence for genotype–phenotype association, where the CpG-site was also an ap-DMR for the same phenotype. Monozygotic twin methylation difference analyses identified one potential environmentally-mediated ap-DMR associated with total cholesterol and LDL( CSMD1). Our results suggest that in a small set of genes DNA methylation may be a candidate mechanism of mediating not only environmental, but also genetic effects on age-related phenotypes.Introduction:DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that plays an important role in gene expression regulation, development, and disease. Increasing evidence points to the distinct contributions of genetic[1],[2],[3],[4],[5], environmental[6],[7],[8], and stochastic factors to DNA methylation levels at individual genomic regions. In addition, DNA methylation patterns at specific CpG-sites can also vary over time within an individual[9],[10] and correspondingly, age-related methylation changes have been identified in multiple tissues and organisms[11],[12],[13],[14],[15]. Although age-related changes in methylation have been implicated in healthy ageing and longevity, the causes and functional consequences of these remain unclear. Ageing is a complex process, which represents the progression of multiple degenerative processes within an individual. Studies in different organisms have identified many factors that contribute to lifespan and the rate of healthy ageing within an individual. These include components of biological mechanisms involved in cellular senescence, oxidative stress, DNA repair, protein glycation, and others( see[16]). Taking these into account, the concept of biological age has been proposed as a better predictor of lifespan and functional capacity than chronological age alone. Previous studies have proposed that certain traits can be used as measures of biological age[17] and have put forward a stringent definition of an ageing biomarker( see[18]). Here, we examined age-related phenotypes that have previously been considered biomarkers of ageing( see[19]), specifically white cell telomere length, blood pressure, lung function, grip strength, bone mineral density, parental longevity, parental age at reproduction, and serum levels of 5-dehydroepiandrosterone( DHEAS), cholesterol, albumin, and creatinine. Epigenetic studies of age-related phenotypes can help identify molecular changes that associate with the ageing process. Such changes may include both biological markers of accumulated stochastic damage in the organism, as well as specific susceptibility factors that may play a regulatory role. We explored the hypothesis that epigenetic changes contribute to the rate of ageing and potential longevity in a sample of 172 middle-aged female twins, where methylation profiles and age-DMRs were previously characterized in 93 individuals from the sample[14]. We compared DNA methylation patterns with chronological age in the sample of 172 individuals and related epigenetic variation to age-related phenotypes that have previously been used as biomarkers of ageing. We identified phenotype-associated DNA methylation changes and combined genetic, epigenetic, expression, and phenotype data to help understand the underlying mechanism of association between epigenetic variation, chronological age, and ageing-related traits.Discussion:We identify hundreds of CpG-sites that exhibit age-related directional changes in methylation. The majority of these effects are hyper-methylated with age, a large proportion replicate in an independent sample, and some changes are observed in multiple tissues. These findings indicate that a-DMRs are not likely stochastic events, but instead may associate with biological mechanisms involved in ageing and potential longevity. To address this we compared methylation variants to measures of biological ageing, focusing on markers like telomere length and other age-associated phenotypes that have previously been linked to ageing. However, our phenotype-methylation comparisons identified only a small subset of a-DMRs that also associate with ageing related traits. These findings suggest that although a-DMRs do not appear to be random events, the majority of observed a-DMRs may either be neutral( or of very small individual effect) to measures of biological age at later stages in life, or may relate to as yet unknown pathways that correlate with biological ageing. The a-DMRs we detected in blood overlap with previously reported a-DMRs obtained in saliva and brain samples, and previous observations also show that some hyper-methylated a-DMRs occur in both blood and buccal tissues[14]. These results indicate that a proportion of a-DMRs are conserved across tissues in samples of different ages and genders, and raise the question of when such age related methylation changes occur during an individual's lifespan and what their functional role is. Functional annotation of a-DMRs show an enrichment of genes involved in regulation of development, morphology, regulation of transcription, and DNA binding, which has also been previously observed in brain samples[13]. The genes nearest to a-DMRs also showed an enrichment of DNA binding motifs for transcription factors linked to ageing. Functional genomic annotation indicated that a-DMRs tend to associate with epigenetic marks targeting low levels of transcription. Consistent with this, a-DMR genes showed predominantly low levels of expression in LCLs and significant negative correlations between methylation and gene expression. Altogether, we find that a-DMRs are located in regions of the genome that functionally link to development and ageing, and tend to show low gene expression rates in our sample of middle-aged individuals. DNA methylation plays a key role in development and tissue differentiation and therefore, it is plausible that at some a-DMRs differential methylation patterns are established early on in development prior to tissue differentiation and continue to intensify over time. For example, CpG-sites that are methylated during early development may become hyper-methylated over time, either because such sites are more prone to methylation or because cells carrying the methylated variant are more likely to replicate. Our findings indicate that age-related changes in methylation occur throughout life, but the timing of the initial age-related trigger at each CpG-site remains unclear. Our results are consistent with a model where at some CpG-sites the initial change may occur during development and early life, but specifically at an age prior to adulthood. Age DMR studies of younger samples could be useful in establishing the proportion of a-DMRs that are also observed at earlier stages in life. We were able to replicate up to 38% of a-DMRs in a sample of younger adults, but samples from newborns or samples obtained prior to tissue differentiation would help resolve the question of when a-DMRs are established, especially tissue conserved a-DMRs. We tested for methylation associations with age-related phenotypes( ap-DMRs) to gain insight into potential mechanisms underlying a-DMRs. We identified four ap-DMRs, of which only one( cg13870866 in TBX20) was also an a-DMR. Two of the ap-DMRs were in genes already implicated in ageing, longevity, or cell senescence, STAT5A[32] and WT1[33]. Our genotype-methylation-phenotype overlap results suggest that in a small proportion of genes DNA methylation may be a candidate mechanism of mediating genetic association effects on ageing-related phenotypes, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that rare genetic variants in the methylation probe sequence drive some of these associations. We also assayed DNA methylation levels at the four ap-DMR probes in 48 of the individuals in the current study using the new Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and obtained significant positive correlations in DNA methylation levels at three ap-DMRs( cg16463460, cg09259772, and cg13870866), indicating evidence for technical validation at these probes. A difficult question in epigenetic studies of phenotypic data is establishing the timing of the epigenetic change relative to trait progression. The age-related phenotype methylation changes identified here may occur prior to the phenotypic change and potentially contribute to phenotype variation, or they may occur as a consequence of ageing processes in the cell. In this cross-sectional study we cannot establish the timing of ap-DMRs with respect to phenotype progression, but can use the findings as potential markers of rate of ageing. Regions that exhibit evidence for DNA methylation heritability, such as the IGF2/H19 region, also exhibit more stable DNA methylation levels over time and tend to occur in functionally important promoter regions[4]. Epigenetic variants in heritable methylation regions are likely to be present at birth, to be more stable over time, and may be involved in regulating the rate of ageing. In our study, 26 a-DMRs also had cis-meQTLs and represent a candidate set of heritable DNA methylation regions that are likely to be more stable and may be involved in longevity. On the other hand, environment-dependent changes in DNA methylation in MZ twins have been reported to occur preferentially in gene-poor regions( see[34]). Here, we identify CSMD1 as the most likely example of an environmentally driven DMR for LDL, but this gene does not fall in a gene-poor locus. The methylation heritability estimates obtained in our data, 0. 176 and 0. 188( Figure S2), are slightly greater than those previously reported for whole-blood methylation[4], which may be due to the difference in regions assayed by the two arrays and to the promoter locations of our probes. Correspondingly we identified 1, 537 CpG-sites with meQTLs. It is possible that a proportion of the meQTLs in our data are due to linkage disequilibrium between the cis-meQTL SNPs and unknown genetic variants in the probe sequence. Obtaining genetic sequences for these individuals will establish the extent to which rare-probe variants exist and affect meQTL findings. However, the overlap across probes with meQTLs across studies and tissues suggests that a significant proportion of the QTLs are conserved across tissues[35],[36]. These are likely to exhibit stable patterns of methylation across mitosis and meiosis, and may be of functional importance. Many factors will impact the power to detect differential methylation effects related to age and age-related phenotypes. One of these factors relates to the coverage and precision of the methylation assay. In our case, the coverage of methylation sites on the Illumina27k array is relatively sparse and promoter-specific, and therefore limits power to detect age related methylation changes. It is likely that additional age related changes in methylation may be identified using higher resolution methylation assays in larger sample sizes of wider age ranges. In this study, we identified methylation changes associated with chronological age and ageing-related phenotypes and we explored mechanisms underlying ageing-related changes in DNA methylation. Both environmental and genetic factors are thought to contribute to healthy ageing, and epigenetic mechanisms represent a potential pathway of mediating these effects on ageing and age related traits.","answer":"Epigenetic patterns vary during healthy ageing and development .

The activation of the complement cascade, a cornerstone of the innate immune response, produces a number of small (74-77 amino acid) fragments, originally termed anaphylatoxins, that are potent chemoattractants and secretagogues that act on a wide variety of cell types. These fragments, C5a, C4a, and C3a, participate at all levels of the immune response and are also involved in other processes such as neural development and organ regeneration. Their primary function, however, is in inflammation, so they are important targets for the development of antiinflammatory therapies. Only three receptors for complement peptides have been found, but there are no satisfactory antagonists as yet, despite intensive investigation. In humans, there is a single receptor for C3a (C3a receptor), no known receptor for C4a, and two receptors for C5a (C5a₁ receptor and C5a₂ receptor). The most recently characterized receptor, the C5a₂ receptor (previously known as C5L2 or GPR77), has been regarded as a passive binding protein, but signaling activities are now ascribed to it, so we propose that it be formally identified as a receptor and be given a name to reflect this. Here, we describe the complex biology of the complement peptides, introduce a new suggested nomenclature, and review our current knowledge of receptor pharmacology.","answer":"[[\\"amino acid\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"anaphylatoxins\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

In this pilot study, the performance of an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) system in imaging periodontal structures in humans was evaluated. Gingival sulcus depth measurements were obtained and compared with traditional probes. In total, 445 sites of 23 periodontally healthy individuals were measured by 3 instruments: North Carolina manual probe, Florida automated probe and OCT at 1325 nm. To obtain quantitative measurements from OCT images, the gingival refractive index was also determined. Discomfort / pain perception and the duration of examinations were compared among the instruments. The analysis of OCT images allowed the identification of relevant anatomic dental and periodontal regions. The average sulcus depth measured by OCT, 0.85 ± 0.27 mm and 0.87 ± 0.28 mm, was lower than the values obtained by manual and automated probing. Discomfort / pain were prevalent for traditional probes, which are invasive methods, than for the non-invasive OCT technique. OCT has the potential to be a reliable tool for in vivo periodontal tissues evaluation and for reproducible sulcus depth measurements in healthy sites. Further technological advances are required to reduce the procedure time and promote evaluation of posterior oral regions.

Wethen report the sorted eigenvalues of the within-class covariance of the representations in Figure 3 . Asthe blue curves show, the eigenvalues in unseen data of validation (b and e) and test (c and d)have considerably higher ranges than train data (a and d)for all the datasets we used.To better understand the effect of such high variance in the quality of generalisation in the representations of our network, we carry out K-nearest neighbor (KNN) experiments on the dataset without, and the dataset with distribution shift. Asthe results in Figure 4 show, the performance degredation from validation (c) compared to test (d) in case of distribution mismatch is significantly higher compared to the performance drop from validation(a) to test(b) when the test data comes from a similar distribution.This observation is also aligned with what we observed in the visualisations from FIG2 that showed the data is more spread than validation data, when coming from a shifted distribution.To tackle this problem, we propose Deep Within-Class Covariance Analysis (DWCCA), a deep neural network layer that reformulates the conventional Within-Class Covariance Normalization (WCCN) BID12 as a DNN-compatible version.DWCCA is trained end-to-end using back-propagation, can be placed in any arbitrary position in a DNN, and is capable of significantly reducing the within-class covariance of the internal representation in a DNN.We empirically show that DWCCA significantly reduces the within-class covariance of the DNN's representations, in both cases.Further, we evaluate the generalization quality of the DNN's representations after applying DWCCA by performing nearest neighbor classification on its representations.Our results show that DWCCA significantly improves the nearest neighbor classification results in both cases, hence improving the generalization quality of the representations.And finally we report the end-to-end classification results of the trained models on an acoustic scene classification task, using data from the annual IEEE Challenges on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE).It turns out that the classification results for the dataset with distribution shift are significantly improved by integrating the DWCCA layer, while the performance on the dataset without distribution mismatch stayed the same.In FIG2 , the network's internal representations in each class are projected into 2D via PCA and each class is represented by a different colour.Looking at first (a-c) and second (d-f) row, it can be seen that for the dataset without mismatched distribution the embeddings of unseen data (validation and test) are spread less after applying DWCCA.Also comparing the unseen embeddings to the training embeddings (with lower opacity and in grey) it can be seen that the unseen embeddings projected closer to the training embeddings after applying DWCCA.Comparing third (g-i) and fourth (j-l) row, it can be seen that for the case of a distribution shift DWCCA also reduces the variance of the embeddings in each class, resulting in them being embedded closer to the training embeddings (grey).This suggests that this property can improve the generalisation of the representations.We will empirically evaluate this hypothesis later in this section by applying KNN classification on the representations.Looking at Figure 3 , we can see that in all plots from dataset with, and dataset without distribution shift, DWCCA significantly reduces the within-class variability.This can be observed by looking at the eigenvalues of the covariances of the representations.An interesting observation is the range of eigenvalues in vanilla: In both datasets, eigenvalues have significantly larger range on unseen data (validation and test) compared to the training data.The maximum eigenvalue in DCASE2016 is around 0.7, while the maximum eigenvalue for unseen is around 7, about 10 times more.Also the maximum eigenvalue of the train set of DCASE2017 is around 2, while the max.eigenvalue on unseen data is around 20 (10 times larger).Bylooking at the KNN results in Fig. 4 it can be seen that in both cases (mismatch / no mismatch), the KNN classification accuracy increases by adding DWCCA. Also, while the KNN performance is in a reasonable range on the validation set of both datasets, the test accuraty in the mismatch case (DCASE2017) drops significantly compared to the validation set. Additionallyit can be seen that applying DWCCA significantly improves the performance on the test set with shifted distribution, adding an improvement of about 6 percentage point, while the improvement on the test set without mismatch is around 2 percentage points. Looking at theresults of end-to-end classifications in TAB2 , we see that the performance of vanilla on DCASE 2017 consistently and significantly improves when adding DWCCA, on all development folds as well as on the unseen test data. We observe around6 percentage points improvement by adding DWCCA to VGG.Looking at the results of the dataset without mismatch, we see that although the results on all folds were improved by adding DWCCA, the results on the unseen test set do not significantly change. This can be explainedbetter by looking at FIG2 : the embeddings of validation (b) and test (c) indicatethat the testdata is projected closer to the training set than the validation set. This observation suggeststhat the unseen test in DCASE2016 might be similar (even more similar than the validation data) to the training set. This can also be confirmedby looking at the results of the best CNN baseline, as well as vanilla: the performances on the unseen test set are consistently higher than all the validation folds. Hence, DWCCA could not helpas there was not a large generalisation gap between training and test.It is worth mentioning that both vanilla and DWCCA are single models, trained on mono single channel spectrograms and no ensemble or multi-channel features were used in these experiments. In other words, a single VGGmodel achieves comparable performances to an ensemble of multi-channel Resnets. We also provide class-wise f-measureson the unseen test set for both datasets in TAB3 . While on the dataset without distributionshift, the average f1 stays the same by adding DWCCA in both calibrated and non calibrated models, we can observe that there is a boost of 13 percentage points on the \\"train\\" class which was the class with the lowest f1 (both calibrated and non calibrated). It seems that DWCCA does not have a significantimpact on classes with high f1: \\"office\\" and \\"beach\\" which stay the highest correctly predicted classes and do not face significant changes by DWCCA.On the dataset with distribution shift, we can see a significant improvement of 4 and 7 percentage points on average f1 for non-calibrated and calibrated models, respectively. The worst class in DCASE2017 was \\"beach\\" with 32%, which was boosted by 24 and 37 percentage points for noncalibrated and calibrated models, respectively. On the other hand, the best performing class, \\"forest path\\", drops by only 2 and 3 percentage points for non-calibrated and calibrated models, respectively.From the experimental results, we may thus conclude that overall, reducing the within-class covariance of representations using DWCCA results in more robust performance and, in case of a large gap between training and test, DWCCA can improve the generalisation. Additionally, the networks tend to reach a moreuniform performance across various classes by improving the performance on the worst classes while not significantly degrading the best performing classes.In this paper, we presented the DWCCA layer, a DNN compatible version of the classic WCCN which is used to normalize the within-class covariance of the DNN's representation and improve the performance of CNNs on data-points with shifted distributions.Using DWCCA, we improved the performance of the VGG network by around 6 percentage point when the test datapoints were from a shifted distribution.We analysed the embedding's generalisation by reporting KNN classification accuracies and showed that DWCCA also improves the generalisation of DNN representations both for with and without distribution mismatch.We also showed that large within-class covariance of representations can be a sign for bad generalisation and showed that DWCCA can significantly reduce WCC and improve generalisation of the representations.","answer":"We propose a novel deep neural network layer for normalising within-class covariance of an internal representation in a neural network that results in significantly improving the generalisation of the learned representations."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L) result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers.Small heat shock protein 20 interacts with protein phosphatase-1 and enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling.Hsp20 overexpression in intact animals resulted in significant enhancement of cardiac function, coupled with augmented Ca cycling and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load in isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with specific increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at both Ser16 and Thr17, relieving its inhibition of the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a. Accordingly, the inotropic effects of Hsp20 were abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable PLN (S16A/T17A). Interestingly, the activity of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), a known regulator of PLN signaling, was significantly reduced by Hsp20 overexpression, suggesting that the Hsp20 stimulatory effects are partially mediated through the PP1-PLN axis. This hypothesis was supported by cell fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization studies, which revealed an association between Hsp20, PP1, and PLN.Hsp20 is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling by targeting the PP1-PLN axis. These findings, coupled with the well-recognized cardioprotective role of Hsp20, suggest a dual benefit of targeting Hsp20 in heart disease.Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20.Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20","answer":"Protein phosphatase 1, or PP1"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

It is possible that vitamin C, an antioxidant, may prevent cigarette smoke (CS)-induced NF-κB activation that involves degradation of I-κBε and nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p50 in alveolar epithelial cells. Therefore, to examine the hypothesis, we verified the effect of vitamin C on CS-induced expression of NF-κB driven luciferase reporter and NF-κB binding at its target DNA by EMSA in alveolar epithelial A549 cells. We also examined the level of I-κBε and sub-cellular distribution of c-Rel by western blotting and immunofluorescence respectively in CSE-treated A549 cells with or without vitamin C pretreatment. We observed a significant reduction in CSE induced luciferase expression, NF-κB DNA binding, I-κBε degradation and c-Rel nuclear translocation in cells pretreated with vitamin C. To further validate the result, we examined sub-cellular distribution of c-Rel in lungs of CS-exposed guinea pigs treated or untreated with vitamin C. Result showed that vitamin C treatment resulted in markedly reduced c-Rel nuclear translocation. All these results demonstrate that vitamin C prevents CS(E)-induced NF-κB activation and thus it could be used for the prevention of CS-induced inflammatory diseases.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"vitamin C\\", \\"Vitamin C\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"I-u03baBu03b5\\", \\"c-Rel\\", \\"p50\\", \\"NF-u03baB\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Proper animal models of CI-AKI can help understand the mechanisms involved and prevent the disorder. We used the 5/6-nephrectomized (NE) rat to develop a CI-AKI model and to evaluate differences in the toxic effects on the kidney between iohexol and iodixanol. We found that six weeks after ablative surgery was the preferred time to induce CI-AKI. We compared multiple pretreatment plans and found that dehydration for 48 hours before iodixanol (320, 10 mL/kg) administration was optimal to induce CI-AKI in the 5/6 NE rats. Compared with iodixanol, iohexol induced a significantly greater reduction in renal function, severe renal tissue damage, intrarenal hypoxia, and apoptotic tubular cells. Iohexol and iodixanol resulted in similarly marked increases in levels of inflammation and oxidative stress .

PINK1 and parkin cooperate in the selective autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria( mitophagy) in cultured cells. However, evidence for their role in mitophagy in vivo is still scarce. Here, we generated a Drosophila model expressing the mitophagy probe mt-Keima. Using live mt-Keima imaging and correlative light and electron microscopy( CLEM), we show that mitophagy occurs in muscle cells and dopaminergic neurons in vivo, even in the absence of exogenous mitochondrial toxins. Mitophagy increases with aging, and this age-dependent rise is abrogated by PINK1 or parkin deficiency. Knockdown of the Drosophila homologues of the deubiquitinases USP15 and, to a lesser extent, USP30, rescues mitophagy in the parkin-deficient flies. These data demonstrate a crucial role for parkin and PINK1 in age-dependent mitophagy in Drosophila in vivo.Introduction:Loss-of-function mutations in PARK2 and PINK1, which encode the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin and the mitochondrial ubiquitin kinase PINK1, respectively, are the most prevalent recessive causes of Parkinson’s disease( PD), an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder( Corti et al., 2011). Parkin and PINK1 cooperate in the selective autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria( mitophagy)( Pickrell and Youle, 2015). Upon mitochondrial damage, PINK1 is stabilized on the outer mitochondrial membrane( OMM) and phosphorylates ubiquitin and parkin at their respective S65 residues. This activates parkin to catalyze ubiquitination of many OMM proteins that are then either degraded by the proteasome or act as signals for autophagic clearance of the mitochondrion( Pickrell and Youle, 2015). Parkin-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitination and mitophagy are counteracted by specific deubiquitinases( Bingol et al., 2014; Cornelissen et al., 2014). PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy can be triggered in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in vitro, typically by exposure to mitochondrial depolarizing agents( Narendra et al., 2008; Geisler et al., 2010; Cai et al., 2012; Ashrafi et al., 2014; Cornelissen et al., 2014; Oh et al., 2017). Along with other mitochondrial quality control mechanisms PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy contributes to the maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial network( Pickles et al., 2018). Despite the wealth of mechanistic information on PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy in cultured cells, questions still surround the existence and physiological relevance of this pathway in vivo( Cummins and Götz, 2018; Whitworth and Pallanck, 2017). Direct evidence for the occurrence of PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy in vivo is still scarce. Ubiquitin phosphorylated at S65( pS65-Ub), a biomarker of PINK1 activity, accumulates in brains from elderly human subjects( Fiesel et al., 2015) and from mice with a genetic defect in mitochondrial DNA proofreading( Pickrell et al., 2015), suggesting that PINK1-mediated mitophagy is induced by aging and accumulation of mitochondrial damage. However, a recent study reported that mitophagy occurs independently of PINK1 in the mouse( McWilliams et al., 2018). In Drosophila, deficiency of PINK1 or parkin causes reduced life span and severe flight muscle degeneration with accumulation of swollen mitochondria( Greene et al., 2003; Pesah et al., 2004; Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006). In parkin mutant flies, half-lives of mitochondrial proteins are drastically prolonged, consistent with a role for parkin in mitophagy, but the effect of PINK1 on mitochondrial protein turnover is much more limited( Vincow et al., 2013). Overall, it remains to be directly demonstrated whether PINK1 and parkin can target damaged mitochondria to lysosomes in vivo. Recently, the mt-Keima reporter was developed to quantitatively image mitophagy in vitro and in vivo( Katayama et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2015). Here, we used live mt-Keima imaging and correlative light and electron microscopy( CLEM) to assess mitophagy in Drosophila in vivo and to determine the role of parkin and PINK1 in this pathway.Discussion:Our data show that mitophagy occurs in Drosophila flight muscle and dopaminergic neurons in vivo, even in the absence of exogenous mitochondrial toxins. Mitophagy in these cells rises with aging, and this age-dependent increase is abrogated by PINK1 or parkin deficiency. Thus, PINK1 and parkin appear to be particularly important for mitophagy during aging, which may explain why loss of these proteins in patients causes an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease rather than a congenital or developmental disorder. Consistent with this, pS65-Ub, a readout of PINK1 activity, is almost undetectable in postmortem brains from neurologically normal, young human subjects, but accumulates in brains from elderly individuals( Fiesel et al., 2015). A recent study reported that PINK1 is dispensable for mitophagy in the mouse in vivo( McWilliams et al., 2018). This conclusion was based on imaging using the mito-QC reporter, which differs from the mt-Keima probe used in our study. mito-QC is targeted to the OMM, whereas mt-Keima is localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Upon mitochondrial damage, activated parkin ubiquitinates a wide variety of OMM proteins, many of which are then extracted from the OMM and degraded by the proteasome before engulfment of the mitochondrion into an autophagosome( Tanaka et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2011; Sarraf et al., 2013). The mito-QC probe consists of a tandem mCherry-GFP tag fused to a large portion of the OMM protein FIS1( McWilliams et al., 2016), which is itself a substrate of parkin( Chan et al., 2011; Sarraf et al., 2013). If mito-QC is ubiquitinated by parkin and extracted from the OMM, this would prevent mito-QC delivery to lysosomes and reduce its sensitivity as a reporter for PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy. An alternative explanation for the discrepant results could be that mice may not accumulate sufficient mitochondrial damage in their lifespan to activate PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy. The abundance of pS65-Ub in cerebral cortex is very low in wild-type mice, but is substantially higher in mice expressing a proof-reading-deficient version of mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ( Pickrell et al., 2015). This suggests that a ‘second hit’ in addition to aging may be required to induce PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy in mice and may explain why PINK1 or parkin deficiency by itself does not cause a degenerative phenotype in this species. In a recent Drosophila study Lee et al. were unable to detect mitophagy in flight muscle and found no evidence for a major role for PINK1 or parkin in mitophagy in other fly tissues( Lee et al., 2018). The discrepancy with our correlative mt-Keima and TEM imaging findings may be due to the fact that Lee et al. mostly relied on imaging with mito-QC, a probe that may be less sensitive for parkin-mediated forms of mitophagy, as discussed above. Also, Lee et al. restricted their analysis of flight muscle to 2-day-old or younger flies, and may thus have missed the PINK1/parkin-dependent rise in mitophagy that occurs at later ages. Recent publications proposed a distinction between basal and induced mitophagy( McWilliams et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018). According to this terminology, the physiological mitophagy observed in our study could be labeled as basal. However, this may be confusing, because the term ‘basal’ suggests a relatively stationary background phenomenon, whereas our data show that ‘basal’ mitophagy in the fly is strongly induced by normal aging. We did not detect a significant reduction in mitophagy in 1-week-old PINK1B9 and parkin RNAi flies, at a time point when these flies already display mitochondrial abnormalities( Greene et al., 2003; Cornelissen et al., 2014). This suggests that the mitochondrial changes in 1-week-old PINK1B9 and parkin RNAi flies are caused by loss of aspects of PINK1 and parkin function that are unrelated to mitophagy. For example, parkin also regulates Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria( Gautier et al., 2016). PINK1 promotes mitochondrial complex I activity through phosphorylation of the complex I subunit NdufA10( Morais et al., 2014) and is involved in crista junction remodeling via phosphorylation of dMIC60( Tsai et al., 2018). Alternatively, the early mitochondrial abnormalities in PINK1- and parkin-deficient flies may be due to more subtle reductions in mitophagy that are not detectable with mt-Keima imaging. Genetic manipulation in Drosophila is relatively straightforward. As illustrated by our dUSP15 and dUSP30 knockdown experiments, this novel mt-Keima fly model is a convenient tool to determine the impact of individual genes on PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy in vivo. This model will greatly facilitate the identification of targets for modulation of a pathway with growing relevance for neurodegenerative diseases.","answer":"Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder where certain nerve cells slowly die , and the symptoms gradually worsen over time . While the risk of developing the condition increases with age , in certain patients the illness is caused by defects in two proteins , PINK1 and parkin . PINK1 and parkin help to manage mitochondria , the compartments in our cells that create molecules that serve as the energy currency for nearly all biological processes . When mitochondria get damaged , they release harmful substances that can kill their host cell . To prevent this , PINK1 and parkin can start a process known as mitophagy , which allows the cell to safely dispose of these dangerous mitochondria . Yet , mitophagy that is triggered by PINK1 and parkin has only been observed in cells grown in the laboratory; there is very little direct evidence that it also takes place in living organisms . If this mechanism does not happen in animals , then it is probably not relevant to Parkinson’s disease . Here , Cornelissen et al . genetically engineered fruit flies that carry a fluorescent marker which helps to track when and where damaged mitochondria are destroyed by a cell . The experiments revealed that mitophagy took place in muscles and in brain tissues . As the animals grew older , mitophagy became more frequent . However , this increase in mitophagy was not seen in insects that did not have PINK1 and parkin . These results showed that the role of PINK1 and parkin in mitophagy is not restricted to cells grown artificially . The fruit flies designed by Cornelissen et al . will be useful to investigate how PINK1 and parkin keep cells healthy by disposing of harmful mitochondria in living organisms . Ultimately , this may help to develop treatments that slow down the development of Parkinson’s disease ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The class II major histocompatibility complex gene HLA-DRA is expressed in B cells, activated T lymphocytes, and in antigen-presenting cells. In addition, HLA-DRA gene expression is inducible in a variety of cell types by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Here we show that the lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2A plays a critical role in HLA-DRA gene expression in class II-positive B cell lines, and that the high mobility group protein (HMG) I / Y binds to multiple sites within the DRA promoter, including the Oct-2A binding site. Coexpression of HMG I / Y and Oct-2 in cell lines lacking Oct-2 results in high levels of HLA-DRA gene expression, and in vitro DNA-binding studies reveal that HMG I / Y stimulates Oct-2A binding to the HLA-DRA promoter. Thus, Oct-2A and HMG I / Y may synergize to activate HLA-DRA expression in B cells. By contrast, Oct-2A is not involved in the IFN-gamma induction of the HLA-DRA gene in HeLa cells, but antisense HMG I / Y dramatically decreases the level of induction. We conclude that distinct sets of transcription factors are involved in the two modes of HLA-DRA expression, and that HMG I / Y may be important for B cell-specific expression, and is essential for IFN-gamma induction.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"cell lines\\", \\"class II - positive B cell lines\\", \\"HeLa cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"T lymphocytes\\", \\"antigen - presenting cells\\", \\"B cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"HLA - DRA promoter\\", \\"HLA - DRA gene\\", \\"antisense HMG I / Y\\", \\"class II major histocompatibility complex gene\\", \\"HLA - DRA\\", \\"Oct - 2A binding site\\", \\"DRA promoter\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"HMG\\", \\"interferon - gamma\\", \\"transcription factor Oct - 2A\\", \\"high mobility group protein\\", \\"lymphoid - specific transcription factor\\", \\"IFN - gamma\\", \\"I / Y\\", \\"HMG I / Y\\", \\"class II major histocompatibility complex\\", \\"Oct - 2A\\", \\"lymphoid - specific transcription factor Oct - 2A\\", \\"Oct - 2\\", \\"transcription factors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please answer the question. Do not include any text in your response other than the answer.Context: The ultimate aim of language technology is to interact with humans.However, most language models are trained without direct signals of human preference,with supervised target strings serving as (a sometimes crude) proxy.One option to incorporate user feedback is via human-in-the-loop, i.e., a user would be expected to provide feedback for each sample online as the model trains, but this degree of dense supervision is often prohibitive and inefficient.Automated metrics offer a promising compromise: learned models of human preference like BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), summarization preferences (Wu et al., 2021) have significantly improved correlation with human judgment compared to earlier metrics (BLEU, METEOR, etc.), and are cheap to evaluate. But — these functions are usually not per-token differentiable: like humans, metrics can only offer quality estimates for full generations.Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a natural path forward for optimizing non-differentiable, scalar objectives for LM-based generation when it is cast as a sequential decision-making problem. However, Goodhart’s Law222Strathern (1997) paraphrases: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.looms: particularly in the case of imperfect metrics that use neural networks, it is easy to find nonsense samples that achieve high-quality estimates. Recent works have shown promising results in aligning LMs to human preferences via RL by constraining preference-based rewards to incorporate notions of fluency (Wu et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022) but progress in this line of work is heavily hindered by a lack of open-source benchmarks and algorithmic implementations—resulting in perception that RL is a challenging paradigm for NLP (Choshen et al., 2020; Kreutzer et al., 2021).Question: How do these automated metrics for human preferences differ and what factors do they consider when predicting human preferences?","answer":"The automated metrics that are mentioned while discussing related work are BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020), and Ouyang et al (2022).

We describe the 3D-QSAR-assisted design of an Aurora kinase   A inhibitor with improved physicochemical properties, in   vitro activity, and in   vivo pharmacokinetic profiles over those of the initial lead. Three different 3D-QSAR models were built and validated by using a set of 66 pyrazole (Model   I) and furanopyrimidine (Model   II) compounds with IC (50) values toward Aurora kinase   A ranging from 33   nM to 10.5   μM. The best 3D-QSAR model, Model   III, constructed with 24 training set compounds from both series, showed robustness (r (2) (CV) = 0.54 and 0.52 for CoMFA and CoMSIA, respectively) and superior predictive capacity for 42 test set compounds (R (2) (pred) = 0.52 and 0.67, CoMFA and CoMSIA). Superimposition of CoMFA and CoMSIA Model   III over the crystal structure of Aurora kinase   A suggests the potential to improve the activity of the ligands by decreasing the steric clash with Val147 and Leu139 and by increasing hydrophobic contact with Leu139 and Gly216 residues in the solvent-exposed region of the enzyme. Based on these suggestions, the rational redesign of furanopyrimidine 24 (clog   P=7.41; Aurora   A IC (50) = 43   nM; HCT-116 IC (50) = 400   nM) led to the identification of quinazoline 67 (clog   P=5.28; Aurora   A IC (50) = 25   nM; HCT-116 IC (50) = 23   nM). Rat in   vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that 67 has better systemic exposure after i.v. administration than 24, and holds potential for further development.","answer":"[[\\"quinazoline\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"Aurora u2005 A\\"], [\\"furanopyrimidine\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"Aurora kinase u2005 A\\"], [\\"pyrazole\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"Aurora kinase u2005 A\\"], [\\"furanopyrimidine\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"Aurora u2005 A\\"]]"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Administration of a high-dose regimen of methamphetamine (METH) rapidly and profoundly decreases plasmalemmal and vesicular dopamine (DA) transport in the striatum, as assessed in synaptosomes and purified vesicles, respectively. To determine whether these responses were common to other amphetamines of abuse, effects of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on the plasmalemmal DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) were assessed. Similar to effects of METH reported previously, multiple high-dose MDMA administrations rapidly (within 1 h) decreased plasmalemmal DA uptake, as assessed ex vivo in synaptosomes prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections, this deficit was reversed completely 24 h after drug treatment. Also in contrast to effects of multiple METH injections, 1) MDMA caused little or no decrease in binding of the DAT ligand WIN35428, and 2) neither prevention of hyperthermia nor prior depletion of DA prevented the MDMA-induced reduction in plasmalemmal DA transport. However, a role for phosphorylation was suggested because pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors attenuated the deficit caused by MDMA in an in vitro model system. In addition to affecting DAT function, MDMA rapidly decreased vesicular DA transport as assessed in striatal vesicles prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections reported previously, this decrease partially recovered by 24 h after drug treatment. Taken together, these results reveal several differences between effects of MDMA and previously reported METH on DAT and VMAT-2; differences that may underlie the dissimilar neurotoxic profile of these agents.","answer":"[[\\"amphetamines\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DA transporter\\"], [\\"methylenedioxymethamphetamine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DA transporter\\"], [\\"METH\\", \\"DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"methylenedioxymethamphetamine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"VMAT-2\\"], [\\"methylenedioxymethamphetamine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"WIN35428\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"amphetamines\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"VMAT-2\\"], [\\"MDMA\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DA transporter\\"], [\\"amphetamines\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"vesicular monoamine transporter-2\\"], [\\"MDMA\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"monoamine\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"vesicular monoamine transporter-2\\"], [\\"amphetamines\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"DA\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"MDMA\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"METH\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"VMAT-2\\"], [\\"METH\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"methylenedioxymethamphetamine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"vesicular monoamine transporter-2\\"], [\\"MDMA\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"VMAT-2\\"], [\\"MDMA\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"vesicular monoamine transporter-2\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

IMGT consists of five databases, ten on-line tools and more than 8,000 HTML pages of Web resources. IMGT provides a common access to standardized data from genome, genetics, proteome and three-dimensional structures.amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering (NUMEROTATION) that are used in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB cards, results of contact analysis and renumbered flat files.Standardized sequence and structure analysis of antibody using IMGT(®) databases and tools allows one to bridge, for the first time, the gap between antibody sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures. This is achieved through the IMGT Scientific chart rules, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts of classification (IMGT gene and allele nomenclature), description (IMGT standardized labels), and numerotation (IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles).Kabat Database was initially started in 1970 to determine the combining site of antibodies based on the available amino acid sequences at that time.comparative analysis of the main-chain conformation of the L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2 hypervariable regions in 17 immunoglobulin structures that have been accurately determined at high resolution is described. This involves 79 hypervariable regions in all. We also analysed a part of the H3 region in 12 of the 15 VH domains considered here. On the basis of the residues at key sites the 79 hypervariable regions can be assigned to one of 18 different canonical structures. We show that 71 of these hypervariable regions have a conformation that is very close to what can be defined as a \\"standard\\" conformation of each canonical structure. These standard conformations are described in detail. The other eight hypervariable regions have small deviations from the standard conformations that, in six cases, involve only the rotation of a single peptide groupthe basis of comparative studies of known antibody structures and sequences it has been argued that there is a small repertoire of main-chain conformations for at least five of the six hypervariable regions of antibodies, and that the particular conformation adopted is determined by a few key conserved residues.","answer":"The most prevalent antibody numbering systems are the Kabat system, the Chothia system as well as the IMGT numbering system."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

The recruitment patterns and latencies were evaluated by  electromyographic activity during arm elevation in the scapular plane . Isokinetic work ratios of the shoulder rotator muscles were used to analyze muscular performance . A 2 x 2 ANOVA detected that muscular performance and recruitment patterns were similar for both groups and sides . However , the ANOVA revealed a significant side and group interaction , indicating that the scapular muscle latencies of the affected shoulder was greater than that of the nonaffected side only for the IG ( p < .001 ) . These findings indicated that subjects with light to moderate impingement syndrome showed late recruitment of the scapular muscles during arm elevation . However , muscular performance of the shoulder rotator muscles was not affectedTitle 2:Shoulder disorders: a state-of-the-art reviewAbstract 2:This paper provides an up-to- date overview of the occurrence , diagnosis , risk factors , prognostic indicators and outcome of shoulder disorder ( SD ) , and of the validity and reproducibility of diagnostic classifications and diagnostic imaging techniques for SD . Furthermore , the available evidence on the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , corticosteroid injections and physiotherapy for SD is summarized on the basis of r and omized controlled trials with an acceptable quality of their methods . The annual incidence of SD is estimated at about 7 % , its 1-year period prevalence at about 51 % and its lifetime prevalence at about 10 % . While approximately 50 % of all patients with SD seek medical care , about 95 % are treated in primary health care . Of all new episodes of SD presenting to primary care , approximately 50 % seem to resolve within 6 months , while about 40 % seem to persist for up to 12 months . Several prognostic indicators for a favourable or a poor outcome of SD have been identified , but a comprehensive prognostic model is not available . While evidence for the prognostic validity of popular diagnostic classifications of SD is lacking , their reproducibility has been shown to be poor . The accuracy and clinical usefulness of diagnostic imaging techniques appear to be sufficiently verified for SD in secondary care , while their clinical usefulness in primary care and prognostic validity are not . NSAIDs and steroid injections for SD have been shown to be effective within 6 weeks , but their effect on long-term outcome remains unclear . There is very limited evidence for the effectiveness in SD of physiotherapy , including exercise therapy , ultrasound , electrotherapy , laser , mobilization and manipulationTitle 3:Epidemiologic surveillance of upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorders in the working population.Abstract 3:OBJECTIVE Since 2002 , an epidemiologic surveillance system of work-related , upper-limb musculoskeletal disorders ( MSDs ) has been implemented in France 's Pays de la Loire region to assess the prevalence of MSDs and their risk factors in the working population . METHODS The surveillance was based on a network of occupational physicians ( OPs ) and used the recommendations of a group of European experts ( criteria document consensus ) . In 2002 - 2003 , 80 of 400 OPs volunteered to participate . All underwent a training program to st and ardize the physical examination .  Health status was assessed by self-administered question naire and physical examination . Occupational risk factors were assessed by self-administered question naire .  Exposure scores were computed for each anatomic zone by summing the risk factors taken into account by the criteria document . RESULTS More than 50 % of the 2,685 men and women r and omly included in 2002 - 2003 experienced nonspecific musculoskeletal symptoms during the preceeding 12 months and approximately 30 % experienced them in the preceeding week . The prevalence of clinical ly diagnosed MSDs was high : approximately 13 % of workers experienced at least 1 of the MSDs . The most frequent disorder was rotator cuff syndrome followed by carpal tunnel syndrome and lateral epicondylitis . The prevalence of MSDs increased with age and varied widely across economic sectors and occupations . More than half of the workers were exposed to at least 2 risk factors of MSDs . Exposure varied according to industrial activity and occupation . According to the criteria document , a high percentage of MSD cases could be classified as probably work related ( 95 % in men and 89 % in women age < 50 , and 87 % in men and 69 % in women age > 50 ) . CONCLUSION Nonspecific upper-limb symptoms and specific upper-limb MSDs are common in the working population . These results show the need to implement prevention programs in most sectors to reduce the prevalence of MSDsTitle 4:Predictors of chronic shoulder pain: a population based prospective study.Abstract 4:OBJECTIVE To determine the natural history of shoulder pain in the population , and predictors of outcome on the basis of clinical and individual factors . In addition , to determine whether outcome is influenced by the definition of shoulder pain used . METHODS A prospect i ve cohort study , over a 3 year period , of subjects recruited from a cross sectional population screening study of shoulder pain , conducted in the Greater Manchester area of the UK . RESULTS Of 92 subjects classified as having shoulder pain in the cross sectional study , 50 ( 54 % ) reported shoulder pain at followup about 3 years later . In 90 % of cases this was accompanied by some disability specifically relating to the symptoms . Baseline factors that predicted symptoms at followup were : pain ( indicated on a manikin ) within a more narrowly defined shoulder region , shoulder pain related disability , pain on the day of examination , symptoms lasting more than one year , and a high score on the General Health Question naire , a measure of psychological distress . CONCLUSION Shoulder pain in the population is a longterm disabling symptom , although many subjects do not seek early medical consultation . Disability ( independent of whether there was restriction of movement on examination ) is a strong predictor of continuing symptoms . The outcome observed in epidemiological studies of shoulder pain will be influenced by the initial definition of symptomsTitle 5:Isometric abduction muscle activation in patients with rotator tendinosis of the shoulder.Abstract 5:OBJECTIVE To examine the influence of pain on activation in brief maximal and sustained submaximal isometric abduction in patients with rotator tendinosis of the shoulder . DESIGN R and omized , controlled experimental trial . PARTICIPANTS Ten patients with complaints of at least 3 months ' duration ( median range , 1 to 2 years ) and nine healthy controls . INTERVENTION Patients and controls were r and omized into subacromial local anesthetic injection on 2 different days . METHODS The uninvolved shoulder was tested first , elbow flexed 90 degrees , shoulder abducted 45 degrees . The protocol consisted of three brief maximal voluntary contractions ( MVCs ) , followed by a sustained submaximal contraction until exhaustion and three MVCs during a 20-minute recovery period . Electromyography ( EMG ) was obtained bilaterally from the supraspinatus , infraspinatus , upper trapezius , and middle deltoid muscles . Pain was scored on a visual analogue scale ( 0 to 100 ) . RESULTS Mean pain rating on MVC of the involved side of patients was reduced from 28 to 10 by subacromial injection . Mean MVC force improved from 163N to 184N ( 95 % confidence interval for the difference , 14 to 29N ) . The accompanying EMG amplitude during MVC increased significantly in three of the four muscles examined . Pain , force , and EMG of the uninvolved side and in controls were unaltered . Endurance time and EMG ( given as microV ) during the submaximal contraction were not influenced by pain . MVC did not fully recover during the postexhaustive period , while the corresponding EMG amplitudes were comparable to values in unfatigued muscle . CONCLUSION Pain reduced central motor drive during maximal efforts in the unfatigued state , but no additional reduction was seen after a sustained submaximal contractionTitle 6:Scapular Muscle Recruitment Patterns: Trapezius Muscle Latency with and without Impingement SymptomsAbstract 6:Background Altered muscle activity in the scapular muscles is commonly believed to be a factor contributing to shoulder impingement syndrome . However , one important measure of the muscular coordination in the scapular muscles , the timing of the temporal recruitment pattern , is undetermined . Purpose To evaluate the timing of trapezius muscle activity in response to an unexpected arm movement in athletes with impingement and in normal control subjects . Study Design Prospect i ve cohort study . Methods Muscle latency times were measured in all three parts of the trapezius muscle and in the middle deltoid muscle of 39 “ overh and athletes ” with shoulder impingement and compared with that of 30 overh and athletes with no impingement during a sudden downward falling movement of the arm .  Results There were significant differences in the relative muscle latency times between the impingement and the control group subjects . Those with impingement showed a delay in muscle activation of the middle and lower trapezius muscle . Conclusion The results of this study indicate that overh and athletes with impingement symptoms show abnormal muscle recruitment timing in the trapezius muscle . The findings support the theory that impingement of the shoulder may be related to delayed onset of contraction in the middle and lower parts of the trapezius muscleTitle 7:Scapular kinematics during transfers in manual wheelchair users with and without shoulder impingement.Abstract 7:BACKGROUND Scapular function during humeral elevation has been reported in groups with and without shoulder impingement pathology . To date , no one has assessed scapular kinematics during upper extremity loaded tasks that manual wheelchair users must perform on a daily basis . Therefore , the objective of this study was to compare scapular kinematics and muscle activation patterns during two different wheelchair transfers in groups of manual wheelchair users with and without shoulder impingement . METHODS A case controlled study of manual wheelchair users , with and without shoulder impingement was performed . Twenty-three male manual wheelchair users ( 13 without shoulder impingement , 10 with shoulder impingement ) performed transfers toward the involved or dominant limb ( lead limb transfer ) and away from the instrumented limb ( trail limb transfer ) . Position and orientation measures of the thorax , scapula and humerus were obtained using an electromagnetic tracking system .  Muscle activity data were collected using telemetered electromyography . Each subject performed three trials of wheelchair transfers to each side . FINDINGS Manual wheelchair users with impingement performed transfers with reduced thoracic flexion , increased scapular internal rotation , and increased humeral internal rotation as compared to those without impingement . Differences were found between the tasks in the scapular motions and EMG amplitude . Trail limb transfer presented with reduced scapular upward rotation and posterior tip as compared to the lead limb transfer task . Increased muscle activity for the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles was demonstrated in the trail limb transfer . INTERPRETATION This study provides the first kinematic description of scapular kinematics during transfer tasks . Shoulder impingement and direction of transfer does affect transfer task performance in manual wheelchair users .

However, in many centers, because of cost - constraints, these devices are reused multiple times. We studied microbiological contamination and bioburden on reprocessed needles to evaluate whether these devices can be successfully sterilized. We studied 10 EUS needles each of 19 G, 22 G, and 25 G in size, and five 22-G ProCore needles. After initial use, each needle was reprocessed by a standardized protocol. We used standard microbiological cultures, as well as ATP bioluminescence technique to quantify bioburden as relative light units (RLU). We defined significant soil contamination by RLU values >200. We also used extractant fluid to disrupt cell membranes in an attempt to enhance ATP detection. We found culture positivity in 3/34 (8.8%), and detectable bioburden on the exposed surface of 33/35 (94.3%), and inside lumen of 29 (82.9%) reprocessed FNA needles. Significant bioburden was found in three (8.6%) and two (5.7%) needles on the surface and lumen, respectively. We found that use of extractant fluid enhanced detection of bioburden. Larger (19 G) needles had higher surface contamination (P = 0.016), but there was no relation of luminal contamination with needle diameter (P = 0.138). Sheath design and presence of side bevel did not influence extent of contamination. There was significant correlation between the surface and intraluminal bioburden (P < 0.001). There is significant bioburden in reprocessed EUS needles; standard microbiological cultures have low sensitivity for detection of needle contamination. We have provided objective evidence for the futility of reprocessing attempts, and practice of EUS needle reuse should be discontinued.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"cell membranes\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"microbiological\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"ATP\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"detectable\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"no relation\\", \\"did not influence\\", \\"presence\\", \\"detection\\", \\"culture positivity\\", \\"discontinued\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"sterilized\\", \\"sensitivity\\", \\"microbiological cultures\\", \\"bioluminescence technique\\", \\"evaluate\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"protocol\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [\\"ProCore needles\\", \\"FNA needles\\", \\"single-use\\", \\"needles\\", \\"single-use devices\\", \\"devices\\", \\"needle\\", \\"bevel\\"], \\"Organization\\": [\\"centers\\"], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"extent\\", \\"size\\", \\"luminal\\", \\"intraluminal\\", \\"inside\\", \\"lumen\\", \\"side\\", \\"surface\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The arrangement of the subunits in an oligomeric protein often cannot be inferred without ambiguity from crystallographic studies. The annotation of the functional assembly of protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is incomplete and frequently inconsistent. Instructions for the reconstruction, by symmetry, of the functional assembly from the deposited coordinates are often absent. An automatic procedure is proposed for the inference of assembly structures that are likely to be physiologically relevant. The method scores crystal contacts by their contact size and chemical complementarity. The subunit assembly is then inferred from these scored contacts by a clustering procedure involving a single adjustable parameter. When predicting the oligomeric state for a non-redundant set of 55 monomeric and 163 oligomeric proteins from dimers up to hexamers, a classification error rate of 16% was observed.Literature Review:","answer":"One of the first methods for distinguishing between homodimers and monomers in crystal structures used the buried surface area and a simple score based on atom-pair frequencies across the interface BIB001 . Two atoms from different protein chains are counted as a pair if they are less than 8 Å apart. A distance dependent score is then obtained by considering the pair frequencies between atoms belonging to 17 different types according to the connectivity with their covalent partners. The method was trained and tested on their own dataset comprising of 96 monomers and 76 homodimers ( Table 2) . This approach was subsequently extended with a hierarchical graph partitioning procedure for automatic determination of quaternary structure and implemented in a webserver called PITA (Protein InTerfaces and Assemblies) BIB002 . A new dataset, Ponstingl et al. BIB002 (Table 2) , containing 55 monomers and 163 oligomers, was compiled for the purpose of training and testing the predictor. Its overall accuracy (see Equation (5)) using atom-pair scoring was 84%, which is a marginally better performance with respect to the one obtained when using only the interface area as prediction feature (with a cutoff of 1000 Å 2 : all interfaces larger than the cutoff defined as biological, otherwise crystallographic). The major pitfall of the method was in differentiating tetramers from dimers."},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

There are several other non-nitrogenous scaffolds that are being studied as leads for opioid receptor modulators with the most prominent being the salvinorins, which have been studied predominantly as KOP agonists.10–12 Our studies of the pawhuskins have led to the synthesis of pawhuskin A (1)13 and C (2)14 (Figure 1) as well as several analogues, and to the demonstration that compound 1 is a moderately selective KOP antagonist. During these explorations we synthesized compound 3,15 with the prenyl group on the \\"left-half\\" of the molecule (the portion biochemically derived from shikimate) placed in a different orientation than in the parent pawhuskin A. To our surprise, this regioisomer turned out to be an opioid receptor antagonist with high selectivity for the KOP (δ/κ > 67 and δ/μ > 67) and to be a bit more potent than pawhuskin A (Ke = 0.15 μM vs. 0.20 μM).15</p><p>In our synthesis of pawhuskin A we employed a directed ortho metalation approach (Scheme 1).13 Lithiation of the ring may be directed by the MOM protecting group and presumably the benzylic alcohol anion of the known starting material (5) to afford the intermediate anion. Transmetalation to the copper species followed by treatment with prenyl bromide gave the final product alcohol (6) in modest yields as the only easily isolated product. In attempts to improve the yield use of copper iodide and TMEDA was explored because this had been shown in our prior work with halogen metal exchange reactions in similar systems to afford superior yields.16 The addition of TMEDA and use of copper iodide in ether afforded a mixture of the arene 6 and the isomeric prenylated compound 7 in a 1:1.2 ratio (Table 1, entry 1) and a combined yield of 36%. A more thorough exploration of the conditions showed that either regioisomer could be made with some selectivity. Slightly colder reaction temperatures afforded the best combined yield of products favoring compound 7 (entry 2). Forgoing the transmetalation step improved the ratio of compound 7 to 6 but the overall yield was particularly disappointing (entry 3). Reaction at room temperature in THF with copper bromide but without TMEDA afforded the alternate regioisomer 6 as the predominant product (6:7 2.9:1 entry 4) in a combined yield of 47%. Variation of the reaction temperature and the scale, which also might afford better control of the reaction temperature, did not improve this ratio (entries 5–7).</p><p>With a viable route to compound 6 in hand we set about preparation of the pawhuskin A analogue 4. Treatment of the benzylic alcohol 6 with methanesulfonyl chloride in trimethylamine gave the mesylate which was converted into the bromide without isolation. An Arbuzov reaction was carried out by heating the bromide with triethyl phosphite to give the desired phosphonate 8 in moderate yield. Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons coupling of phosphonate 8 and the known aldehyde 915 afforded the protected stilbene 10 (Scheme 2). Global deprotection of the methoxymethyl ether groups by treatment with p-toluenesulfonic acid in methanol gave the desired analogue 4.</p><p>Analogue 4 was tested for opioid receptor activity by first assessing if intrinsic agonist activity was present. After finding no agonist activity, this compound was tested for antagonist selectivity against the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors (MOP, DOP, and KOP). To our surprise the analogue 4 displayed strong antagonist activity that was very selective for the DOP (Ke = 25 nM, κ/δ> 400, MOP/DOP μ /δ> 400, Figure 2). This was an intriguing result. In essence, moving the prenyl substituent from a position ortho to the stilbene junction in isomer 4 to a position meta to the central olefin, as in compound 3,15 shifted the activity from highly delta selective to highly kappa selective (Table 2).</p><p>In order to rationalize this dramatic change in selectivity when the prenyl group is shifted, docking studies were conducted. The structure of the mouse DOP with the bound antagonist naltrindole was solved in 2012 by the Kobilka group.17 We started with this structure and used the Autodock Vina18 software package to perform docking of compounds 3 and 4 into the receptor. Stilbene 4 fits neatly into the DOP receptor binding pocket with the free phenols of the catechol ring predicted to make hydrogen bonds with LYS108, GLN105, TYR109, and TYR308 of the DOP structure (Figure 3A, visualization was conducted using the Chimera software suite).17,19 Interestingly, the hydrophobic isoprenoid groups of isomer 4 overlap quite well with the indole (geranyl group) and cyclopropylmethyl (prenyl group) groups of naltrindole (Figure 3B). When the KOP selective compound 3 is docked using the same procedure, the lowest energy conformation overlaps almost perfectly with that of the predicted lowest energy conformation of compound 4. The prominent exception is the prenyl group which is now directed up and away from the region occupied by the cyclopropylmethyl moiety of naltrindole in the x-ray structure (Figure 3C). This change robs compound 3 of key hydrophobic interactions that presumably support the binding of naltrindole and compound 4 to the DOP. The lowest energy docking pose for compound 4 has a score of −8.9 vs. a −7.3 for the lowest energy pose of stilbene 3. This correlates nicely with the large difference in the functional binding assay.</p><p>The overall binding motif of compound 4 can be viewed in the context of the message and address concept of opioid binding in which the geranyl group, like the indole of naltrindole, extends into a region of the receptor that confers selectivity. In contrast the prenyl group and the phenols are the message which allows binding to key parts of the receptor architecture, in this case blocking the ability of ligand to bind and signal (Figure 3D). In contrast, for the docked pose of kappa-selective compound 3 the hydrophobic contributions to the message part of the binding are not possible. This dramatically reduces the overall interaction as depicted by the docking score.</p><p>The differences with respect to the docking of the natural product pawhuskin A (1, Figure 3C) are more difficult to rationalize. If one assumes that pawhuskin A adopts an orientation similar to the delta-selective compound 4, it leads to an intermediate docking score of −8.4. In this orientation, the phenols of pawhuskin A are orientated away from the space occupied by the methoxy groups of compound 4. If that orientation improves the hydrophobic interaction between compound 4 and the receptor, it would lead to stronger binding. A favorable orientation of the prenyl group of pawhuskin A may compensate for some of the reduction caused by the absence of the methoxy groups, and allow functional antagonism at the DOP albeit with reduced apparent affinity.</p><p>In conclusion, we have synthesized a highly selective delta opioid receptor antagonist (4) based on the stilbene motif of the pawhuskin natural products. Our studies on directed ortho metalation of compound 5 have uncovered conditions which favor prenylation ortho to the benzylic position (i.e. compound 6) or meta to this substituent (compound 7). Incorporation of compound 7 into the final stilbene has yielded the kappa-selective compound 3, while incorporation of the isomeric 6 has given this new delta-selective stilbene 4. Docking studies have shed some light on the potential differences in the binding modes of the stilbene isomers 3 and 4 to the DOP, and provided some rationale for the large difference in selectivity. We are currently undertaking further studies on the activity of compounds 3 and 4, as well as synthesis of other pawhuskin analogues. These efforts will be reported in due course.</p>","answer":"Studies of directed ortho metalation reactions on an aromatic substrate with multiple potential directing groups have identified conditions that favor either of two regioisomers. One of these regioisomers has been converted to an analogue of the stilbene pawhuskin A, and been shown to have high selectivity as an antagonist of the delta opioid receptor. Docking studies have suggested that this compound can adopt a conformation similar to naltrindole, a known delta antagonist."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

scale relationships and further subdivide identical multilocus sequence types ( sts ) using more loci or a large amount of shared genomic sequences .given the common occurrence of homologous recombination , it becomes crucial to investigate the genome - wide extent of homologous recombination , which could also benefit the construction of the strain history and tracking the spread of emerging pathogens .identifying recombinational exchanges in closely related strains is challenging as recombinational exchanges involved in a small number of nucleotides may be mistaken as point mutations . guttman and dykhuizen ( 1994 )have successfully examined the clonal divergence of e. coli strains in the ecor group a by considering the divergence time and mutation rate and showed that recombination has occurred at a rate 50-fold higher than the mutation rate in four loci .( 2000 ) estimated the ancestral allele for the isolates that differ only one locus out of the seven mlst loci and assigned recombination based on the number of derived nucleotides from the ancestral allele and on whether the nucleotides are novel in the population .we adopted a new approach ( illustrated in fig .  1 ) to identify recombinant genes in neisseria meningitidis strains with identical sts , which does not requirethe estimation of divergence time and ancestral alleles and can be applied on any two strains with identical sts . in brief ,nucleotide substitution was assumed to follow a binomial distribution and an upper bound of genome - wide divergence (  ) by point mutation was calculated for no observed substitution in all nucleotide sites of the seven mlst loci .the estimated maximum genome - wide divergence was then used as a benchmark to compute a p - value for the observed nucleotide changes of each gene in the genome to be explained by point mutation .genes that have more than the expected number of nucleotide changes at a significance level of 0.001 were deemed as recombinant genes .our results revealed that up to 19% of commonly present genes in n. meningitidis strains with identical sts have been affected by homologous recombination .inference of homologous recombination in strains with identical sts . under a binomial distribution of nucleotide substitution ,there is a probability for no nucleotide change in the seven mlst loci . that is ( 1- )= 0.001 , here n is the number of nucleotides in the seven mlst loci and  is the upper bound of genome - wide nucleotide divergence (  ) at 0.001 significance level given no change in the seven mlst loci . at genome - wide divergence  , genes that have more than the expected number of nucleotide changes at 0.001 significance level were deemed as nonvertically acquired genes . in another study on e. coli o104 ( st678 ) genomes , we visualized recombinant genes by plotting the pairwise dna distance of orthologous genes along the genome and identified 167 genes in three gene clusters that have likely undergone homologous recombination . a reanalysis on the orthologs between e. coli on2010 and 55989 ( labeled as ec55989 thereafter to avoid unnecessary confusion ) genomes using both pairwise dna distance and the p - values as described in ref .in fact , the use of nucleotide divergence between two genomes for homologous recombination detection has been successful in other studies , one of which was on two e. coli st131 strains .it has been observed that a higher portion ( at least 9% ) of core genes in the e. coli st131 genomes than in the e. coli st678 genomes ( fig .  2 ) are affected by homologous recombination .the findings in both n. meningitidis and e. coli showed extensive genomic variation within identical sts .since many bacterial species have a comparable or higher level of recombinogenicity than n. meningitidis or e. coli , extensive genomic variation within identical sts should be expected in many bacterial species .inferring genes involved in homologous recombination by comparing orthologs between two e. coli strains on2010 and ec55989 .( b ) p - values were calculated based on the maximum genome - wide divergence given the seven identical mlst loci as illustrated in figure  1 . for simplicity ,please note that more genes ( 4207 genes in total ) were examined here than in our previous study ( 3794 genes ) , since our previous study focused on the genes present in both the o104 strains and the iai1 strain .it is important to note that the high genomic variation discovered within identical sts should not be interpreted as artifacts of these studies .the high level of genomic variation within identical sts could , instead , be explained by that many non - vertical genes within identical sts are deleterious or transiently adaptive and undergo fast rates of evolution .in fact , the ratio of recombination to mutation rates was higher in the comparison of clonally related strains than of relatively broadly sampled strains from the corresponding species .such a discrepancy between the estimated recombination - mutation ratios highlights the need for a population genetics framework for the study of recombination and bacterial genome evolution .among the three gene clusters of recombinant genes we identified in e. coli o104 , one gene cluster contained 125 genes and was likely involved in direct chromosomal homologous recombination specific to the on2010 strain .these 125 genes were found in 20 different functional categories and 70 of them were found in all the studied 57 e. coli and shigella genomes .this is consistent with the conclusion that genes from all functional categories are subject to dna exchange .furthermore , the nearest phylogenetic neighbors of these genes were not clustered in a single phylogenetic group .we hypothesized that extensive recombination with a broad spectrum of strains has taken place in one genome , and this highly mosaic genome then recombined with the precursor to the on2010 genome .the other two gene clusters of recombinant genes in e. coli o104 were located in the prophage regions , but the genes in these two gene clusters were identical between on2010 and ec55989 genomes .it is noteworthy that the reanalysis with more single - copy genes ( with details in fig . these prophage genes are not present in all o104 strains and the outgroup iai1 strain .this could be explained by frequent recombination of the prophage genes with infecting phages or different prophages from other bacterial chromosomes .since all examined o104 genomes are of conserved genome synteny , our observations support the argument that homologous ( legitimate ) recombination drives module exchange between phages .together , these findings suggest that homologous recombination takes place frequently in both core genes and dispensable genes .as the cost of sequencing drops , the characterization of bacterial isolates has utilized more shared genes or loci and shifted toward phylogenomic analysis .quite often , multiple gene alignments were concatenated into a single super - alignment , from which phylogenies were reconstructed using a variety of methodologies .such a data set , also known as a supermatrix , has been demonstrated to solve previously ambiguous or unresolved phylogenies , even in the presence of a low amount of horizontal gene transfer in the data set .unfortunately , the supermatrix approach becomes very sensitive to recombination when applied to strains with identical sts due to limited genuine sequence diversity .the concatenated sequences of 3794 genes in the e. coli o104 strains were overwhelmed by the phylogenetic signal of the 125 recombinant genes , as many other genes are identical among the e. coli o104 strains ( fig . the accuracy and robustness of the constructed evolutionary relationships can be improved by the exclusion of recombinogenic and incongruent sequences .in fact , the removal of the 125 recombinant genes from the e. coli o104 data set has resulted in consistent phylogenetic relationships of o104 strains by different phylogenetic approaches .one interesting finding of our e. coli o104 study is that the number of identical loci implemented in bigsdb was less sensitive to homologous recombination than the concatenated sequences of all loci .this could be explained by the fact that recombination has affected a relatively small number of genes but introduced a substantial amount of diversity in the on2010 genome .it is further noteworthy that supertrees , another widely used approach for phylogenomic analysis are not suitable for characterizing strains with identical mlst types , as many individual genes are identical or nearly identical and contain no or very limited phylogenetic information for each individual gene tree .homologous recombination can bring the beneficial mutations arising in different genomes together and have a strong impact on ecological adaptation .one well - known example was the recombination in the pena genes during the emergence of penicillin resistance in n. meningitidis .variation of the pena gene corresponding to different levels of penicillin susceptibility has also been observed between n. meningitidis strains with the same mlst types .furthermore , genetic variation within the same mlst types has been evident in the capsule gene cluster and genes used for vaccine target in n. meningitidis .these observations suggest a strong relationship between homologous recombination and pathogenic adaptation involved in antibiotic resistance , capsule biosynthesis and vaccine efficacy .recombination has affected fimh which encodes mannose -

Since disease does not respect cultural borders and may spread between populations speaking different languages, we would like to build multilingual models. However, the data required to train models for every language may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to obtain, particularly for low-resource languages. Taking Japanese as our target language, we explore methods by which data in one language might be used to build models for a different language. We evaluate strategies of training on machine translated data and of zero-shot transfer through the use of multilingual models. We find that the choice of source language impacts the performance, with Chinese-Japanese being a better language pair than English-Japanese. Training on machine translated data shows promise, especially when used in conjunction with a small amount of target language data.IntroductionThe spread of influenza is a major health concern. Without appropriate preventative measures, this can escalate to an epidemic, causing high levels of mortality. A potential route to early detection is to analyse statements on social media platforms to identify individuals who have reported experiencing symptoms of the illness. These numbers can be used as a proxy to monitor the spread of the virus.Since disease does not respect cultural borders and may spread between populations speaking different languages, we would like to build models for several languages without going through the difficult, expensive and time-consuming process of generating task-specific labelled data for each language. In this paper we explore ways of taking data and models generated in one language and transferring to other languages for which there is little or no data.Related WorkPreviously, authors have created multilingual models which should allow transfer between languages by aligning models BIBREF0 or embedding spaces BIBREF1, BIBREF2. An alternative is translation of a high-resource language into the target low-resource language; for instance, BIBREF3 combined translation with subsequent selective correction by active learning of uncertain words and phrases believed to describe entities, to create a labelled dataset for named entity recognition.MedWeb DatasetWe use the MedWeb (“Medical Natural Language Processing for Web Document”) dataset BIBREF4 that was provided as part of a subtask at the NTCIR-13 Conference BIBREF5. The data is summarised in Table TABREF1. There are a total of 2,560 pseudo-tweets in three different languages: Japanese (ja), English (en) and Chinese (zh). These were created in Japanese and then manually translated into English and Chinese (see Figure FIGREF2). Each pseudo-tweet is labelled with a subset of the following 8 labels: influenza, diarrhoea/stomach ache, hay fever, cough/sore throat, headache, fever, runny nose, and cold. A positive label is assigned if the author (or someone they live with) has the symptom in question. As such it is more than a named entity recognition task, as can be seen in pseudo-tweet #3 in Figure FIGREF2 where the term “flu” is mentioned but the label is negative.Methods ::: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT):The BERT model BIBREF6 base version is a 12-layer Transformer model trained on two self-supervised tasks using a large corpus of text. In the first (denoising autoencoding) task, the model must map input sentences with some words replaced with a special “MASK” token back to the original unmasked sentences. In the second (binary classification) task, the model is given two sentences and must predict whether or not the second sentence immediately follows the first in the corpus. The output of the final Transformer layer is passed through a logistic output layer for classification. We have used the original (English) BERT-base, trained on Wikipedia and books corpus BIBREF7, and a Japanese BERT (jBERT) BIBREF8 trained on Japanese Wikipedia. The original BERT model and jBERT use a standard sentence piece tokeniser with roughly 30,000 tokens.Methods ::: Multilingual BERT:Multilingual BERT (mBERT) is a BERT model simultaneously trained on Wikipedia in 100 different languages. It makes use of a shared sentence piece tokeniser with roughly 100,000 tokens trained on the same data. This model provides state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer results on natural language inference and part-of-speech tagging tasks BIBREF9.Methods ::: Translation:We use two publicly available machine translation systems to provide two possible translations for each original sentence: Google's neural translation system BIBREF10 via Google Cloud, and Amazon Translate. We experiment using the translations singly and together.Methods ::: Training procedure:Models are trained for 20 epochs, using the Adam optimiser BIBREF11 and a cyclical learning rate BIBREF12 varied linearly between 5 times 10^{-6} and 3 times 10^{-5}.ExperimentsUsing the multilingual BERT model, we run three experiments as described below. The “exact match” metric from the original MedWeb challenge is reported, which means that all labels must be predicted correctly for a given pseudo-tweet to be considered correct; macro-averaged F1 is also reported. Each experiment is run 5 times (with different random seeds) and the mean performance is shown in Table TABREF11. Our experiments are focused around using Japanese as the low-resource target language, with English and Chinese as the more readily available source languages.Experiments ::: BaselinesTo establish a target for our transfer techniques we train and test models on a single language, i.e. English to English, Japanese to Japanese, and Chinese to Chinese. For English we use the uncased base-BERT, for Japanese we use jBERT, and for Chinese we use mBERT (since there is no Chinese-specific model available in the public domain). This last choice seems reasonable since mBERT performed similarly to the single-language models when trained and tested on the same language.For comparison, we show the results of BIBREF13 who created the most successful model for the MedWeb challenge. Their final system was an ensemble of 120 trained models, using two architectures: a hierarchical attention network and a convolutional neural network. They exploited the fact that parallel data is available in three languages by ensuring consistency between outputs of the models in each language, giving a final exact match score of 0.880. However, for the purpose of demonstrating language transfer we report their highest single-model scores to show that our single-language models are competitive with the released results. We also show results for a majority class classifier (predicting all negative labels, see Table TABREF1) and a random classifier that uses the label frequencies from the training set to randomly predict labels.Experiments ::: Zero-shot transfer with multilingual pre-trainingOur first experiment investigates the zero-shot transfer ability of multilingual BERT. If mBERT has learned a shared embedding space for all languages, we would expect that if the model is fine-tuned on the English training dataset, then it should be applicable also to the Japanese dataset. To test this we have run this with both the English and Chinese training data, results are shown in Table TABREF11. We ran additional experiments where we froze layers within BERT, but observed no improvement.The results indicate poor transfer, especially between English and Japanese. To investigate why the model does not perform well, we visualise the output vectors of mBERT using t-SNE BIBREF14 in Figure FIGREF14. We can see that the language representations occupy separate parts of the representation space, with only small amounts of overlap. Further, no clear correlation can be observed between sentence pairs.The better transfer between Chinese and Japanese likely reflects the fact that these languages share tokens; one of the Japanese alphabets (the Kanji logographic alphabet) consists of Chinese characters. There is 21% vocabulary overlap for the training data and 19% for the test data, whereas there is no token overlap between English and Japanese. Our finding is consistent with previous claims that token overlap impacts mBERT's transfer capability BIBREF9.Experiments ::: Training on machine translated dataOur second experiment investigates the use of machine translated data for training a model. We train on the machine translated source data and test on the target test set. Results are shown in Table TABREF11. Augmenting the data by using two sets of translations rather than one proves beneficial. In the end, the difference between training on real Japanese and training on translations from English is around 9% while training on translations from Chinese is around 4%.Experiments ::: Mixing translated data with original dataWhilst the results for translated data are promising, we would like to bridge the gap to the performance of the original target data. Our premise is that we start with a fixed-size dataset in the source language, and we have a limited annotation budget to manually translate a proportion of this data into the target language. For this experiment we mix all the translated data with different portions of original Japanese data, varying the amount between 1% and 100%. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure FIGREF17. Using the translated data with just 10% of the original Japanese data, we close the gap by half, with 50% we match the single-language model, and with 100% appear to even achieve a small improvement (for English), likely through the data augmentation provided by the translations.Discussion and ConclusionsZero-shot transfer using multilingual BERT performs poorly when transferring to Japanese on the MedWeb data. However, training on machine translations gives promising performance, and this performance can be increased by adding small amounts of original target data. On inspection, the drop in performance between translated and original Japanese was often a result of translations that were reasonable but not consistent with the labels. For example, when translating the first example in Figure FIGREF2, both machine translations map “UTF8min風邪”, which means cold (the illness), into “UTF8min寒さ”, which means cold (low temperature). Another example is where the Japanese pseudo-tweet “UTF8min花粉症の時期はすごい疲れる。” was provided alongside an English pseudo-tweet “Allergy season is so exhausting.”. Here, the Japanese word for hay fever “UTF8min花粉症。” has been manually mapped to the less specific word “allergies” in English; the machine translation maps back to Japanese using the word for “allergies” i.e. “UTF8minアレルギー” in the katakana alphabet (katakana is used to express words derived from foreign languages), since there is no kanji character for the concept of allergies. In future work, it would be interesting to understand how to detect such ambiguities in order to best deploy our annotation budget.Table 1: MedWeb dataset overview statistics.Table 2: Overall results, given as mean (standard deviation) of 5 runs, for different training/test data pairs.

Speciﬁcally, human workers on AMT were asked to read the context and generated response by interactive simulation via ConvLab, then score the following two evaluation metrics on a Likert scale (1-5): 1) Appropriateness : evaluates whether the generated responses are appropriate for the given context, 2) Fluency : evaluates whether the gen- erated responses are comprehensible and human-like. We compare the performance of GPT-Critic with same baselines on ConvLab evaluation. Figure 3 summarizes the overall results of human eval- uation, where 60 workers evaluate the quality of 30 randomly selected dialogues for each algorithm. The results show that GPT-Critic signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline algorithms in appropriateness which is related to task accomplishment. Moreover, the result of ﬂuency shows that GPT-Critic does not hurt the agent’s capability to generate human-like sentences.Question: What are the metrics used to evaluate the naturalness of the sentences generated by the policy?","answer":"They evaluated the naturalness of the generated sentences by the fluency metric in the human evaluation."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

off , arguing against a second epoch of star formation .* bss might be evolved stars back in the blue region of the hr diagram after a red supergiant phase .however , abundances of nitrogen in blue stragglers are much lower than those predicted by models for stars in blue loops @xcite .* bss may be stars that , for some reason , have evolved bluewards . in particular _ homogeneous evolution _ has been proposed as a mechanism that can result in blueward evolution for very high ( near - critical ) initial rotational velocity @xcite .however there is no strong _ a priori _ reason to believe that many such extreme rotators will be formed .* bss may be formed by coalescence of two stars .this mechanism requires a high stellar density environment .though it is probably the major channel for the formation of bss in globular cluster , it is unlikely to be able to explain bss in ob associations . * bss result from mass exchange in close binaries .examples of this process abound amongst massive binaries ( see review by negueruela in these proceedings ) .therefore this channel must contribute some bss in young clusters and associations .while the properties of bss in globular clusters have been the object of many studies , the mechanisms for forming bss in young open clusters have deserved little attention .the most relevant works are those of @xcite and @xciteas part of our programme to fully characterise a sample of young open clusters , we have obtained spectroscopy of large numbers of stars in the young open clusters ngc  663 , ngc  869 and ngc  3766 , and the moderately older clusters ngc  6649 and ic  4725 .we obtained spectra for 38 bright stars in @xmath0 persei and the immediately surrounding area on 2003 november 15th , using the 4.2-m wht at the la palma observatory , equipped with the isis spectrograph and the r600b grating ( 0.4  / pixel ) .in addition , 17 members were observed with the 2.5-m int , also at the la palma observatory , with the ids spectrograph and the r900v grating ( 0.6  / pixel ) , in july 2003 .spectra for 140 members of ngc 663 were obtained in two runs during october / november 2002 , one with the int+ids and the r400v grating ( 1.2  / pixel ) and the other one with the 1.93-m telescope at observatoire de haute - provence and the carlec spectrograph and the 300 ln / mm grating ( 1.8  / pixel ) .spectra of the brightest members of ngc 6649 were obtained with the wht+isis and the r300b grating ( 0.9  / pixel ) on 2004 may 20th .finally observations of ngc 3766 and ic 4725 were obtained in may 2004 with the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla , equipped with emmi in the longslit spectrograph mode .in order to detect bss in our sample of open clusters , we use two types of hr diagram .when strmgren photometry of a sufficient large sample exists , we use the observational @xmath1 diagram for the determination of cluster ages .if we have spectroscopy of a large number of members , we can also construct a \`\` theoretical '' hr diagram using the following procedure : from our spectra , we determine accurate spectral types and then take the corresponding @xmath2 from the tabulation of @xcite .we then calculate the individual reddening for each star , using precision @xmath3 ( and @xmath4 where available ) photometry from the literature and @xmath5 from 2mass .the photometry and the kurucz model corresponding to the spectral type are used as input for the @xmath6 code for parameterised modelling and characterisation of photometry and spectroscopy implemented by @xcite , which estimates the reddening .after dereddening , we correct for the adopted distance modulus and transform to @xmath7 using the calibration of bc for a given spectral type given by @xcite .all the isochrones shown are from @xcite .[ fig : phot3766 ]    we have strmgren photometry for 55 stars in this cluster from @xcite and @xcite . the cluster hr digram ( fig .1 ) clearly demonstrates the age of the cluster , @xmath8myr .this age is fully consistent with the spectral types of the stars around the ms turn - off ( b2v ) .however , there is an object with @xmath9 lying clearly to the left of the isochrone .this star ( s5 ) is located at the very centre of the cluster .its spectral type b0.7iii confirms that it is earlier than any other member , but also that its parameters ( distance and reddening ) are those of a cluster member .we thus conclude that this object is a blue straggler in ngc  3766 .the other object marked with an open square ( s326 , bf  cen ) also is a very interesting case .its spectrum clearly shows that it is a double - line spectroscopic binary .@xcite found that it is an eclipsing binary with a 3.7-d orbital period .the primary component is a b1.5v star with 8.7@xmath10 and 5@xmath11 , while the secondary component is a b6iii star with 3.8@xmath10 and 7@xmath11 .the latter rotates synchronously , while the primary rotates much faster , implying that it is a post - mass transfer system .taking into account that the secondary contributes a substantial amount of light , the b1.5v star alone would be located to the left of the turn - off and be a mild blue straggler .this is a good example of a blue straggler created by mass transfer .      in the observational photometric diagram of ngc  869, there are many stars to the left of the ms turn - off @xcite .this is also evident in the theoretical hr diagram ( fig .  2 ) built from our spectral types and the photometry from @xcite .the spectral types of the stars leaving the main sequence ( b1.5v ) are compatible with an age of @xmath12myr. however , a large number of evolved stars lying to the left of the turn - off have spectral types indicating higher masses .[ fig : phot869 ]    we can distinguish two kinds of bss .most of them concentrate around the @xmath13 isochrone .though @xcite show that many of these objects are not very fast rotators _ now _ , the fact that all of them are evolved from the ms leads us to speculate that their position to the left of the turn - off may be related to initial fast rotation .a few other bss occupy positions indicating much higher masses .the b2ia and b3ia supergiants are amongst the most massive b - type supergiants in the sample of @xcite , with evolutionary masses of the order of @xmath14. both types of bss are present at the cluster core and most of them are certainly cluster members .[ fig : two ]    a similar effect , well - defined ms turn - off and most of the evolved stars lying to the left , can also be seen in two other relatively massive clusters , perhaps slightly younger than ngc  869 , for which abundant data exist in the literature : ngc 3293 and ngc 4755 ( see fig .  3 ) .in these three open clusters and many others of similar age , there are b - type supergiants lying well above the corresponding isochrones for the cluster .their progenitors are stars more massive than @xmath15 and therefore they are necessarily bss in clusters older than @xmath16myr .      from the observational photometric diagram , the cluster has an age @xmath8myr , again in good agreement with the spectral types of stars close to the turn - off ( b2v ) .we find two obvious photometric bss located near the cluster core ( s4 and s30 ) .their spectral types ( b1iii in both cases ) support their bs nature and their cluster membership .our spectra reveal at least three other spectroscopic bss which were saturated in our photometry .they include the o9.5v star s162 and , of particular interest , ls i + 61@xmath17 235 ( s194 ) , a b0.5ive star in the be / x - ray binary rx  j0146.9 + 6121 .the age of this cluster is @xmath18myr @xcite , confirmed by the study of the characteristics of the double mode cepheid member v367 sct .we build the theoretical hr diagram from our spectra and the photometry of @xcite .the spectral types of the brightest blue members show good agreement with this age , presenting a ms turn - off around b4v ( fig .there are two obvious bss , the brightest of which is a b1iiie star ( s9 ) , unambiguously associated with an _ xmm - newton _ x - ray source .this object appears to be a low luminosity be / x - ray binary or a member of the class of @xmath19-cas - like x - ray sources ( see contribution by motch et al . in these proceedings ) .the age of this cluster has been set at @xmath20myr by several different studies and is also constrained by the presence of a classical cepheid , u sgr . from the spectral types , we find the ms turn - off around b6v , in good agreement with this age , but leaving at least four evolved bss , three of which are be stars ( see fig .  4 ) .    [fig : dia6649 ]though the sample of open clusters for which a detailed analysis has been made is still quite small , we observe the following interesting trends :    * blue stragglers are found in all open clusters surveyed * in clusters @xmath21myr old , most evolved stars appear too massive for these ages .in particular , many of these clusters contain ia and iab supergiants , which must be descended from stars with @xmath22 according to all theoretical evolutionary paths .such massive stars have lifetimes @xmath23myr @xcite , rendering all these supergiants bss . * among clusters younger than @xmath8myr ,very few bss are be stars .* from the data on ic  4725 and ngc  6649 , incomplete samples in ngc  2516 and ic  2488 and data in the literature @xcite , it would seem that most bss in clusters in the @xmath24  myr range are be stars . *our data suggest that a non - negligible fraction of bss in moderately young open clusters are formed by mass transfer in a close binary ( x - ray sources in ngc  663 and ngc  6649 , eclipsing binary in ngc  3766 ) , but not all bss are binaries , making it unlikely that this might be the only channel . *likely different mechanisms are dominant at different ages .this research is partially supported by the spanish mcyt under grant aya2002 - 00814 and the generalitat valenciana under grant gv04b/729 .in is a researcher of the programme _ ramn y cajal _ , funded by the spanish ministerio de ciencia y tecnologa and the university of alicante .the int and wht are operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias . some observations presented herewere obtained as part of the ing service programme .partially based on observations collected at the european southern observatory , chile ( eso 73.d-0032 ) .partially based on observations made at observatoire de haute provence ( cnrs ) , france .this research has made use of the simbad data base , operated at cds , strasbourg ( france ) and the webda open cluster database .balona , l.a .1994 , mnras 267 , 1060 balona , l.a . ,koen c. 1994 , mnras 267 , 1071 helt b.e ., andersen j. & kamper b.c . 1989 , ssrv 50 , 346 evans , c.j ., et al . 2005 , a&a 437 , 467 humphreys , r.m . , & mcelroy , d.b . 1984 , apj 284 , 565 johnson , h.l .1960 , apj 131 , 620 keller , s.c ., grebel , e.k . ,miller , g.j . , & yoss , k.m .2001 , aj 122 , 248 maeder , a. 1987 , a&a 178 , 159 maz - apellniz , j. 2004 , , 116 , 859 marco , a. & bernabeu , g. 2001 , a&a 372 , 477 mathys , g. 1987 , a&as 71 , 201 mcerlean , n.d . , lennon , d.j . & dufton , p.l .1999 , a&a 349 , 553 mermilliod j.c .1982 , a&a 109 , 37 meynet , g. , & maeder , a. 2003 , a&a 404 , 975 schaller , g. ; schaerer , d. ; meynet , g. ; maeder , a. 1992 , a&as 96 , 269 shobbrook , r.r .1985 , mnras 212 , 591 shobbrook , r.r . 1987 , mnras 225 , 999 smartt , s.j . ,2002 , a&a 391 , 979 strom , s.e . , wolff , s.c . , & dror , d.h.a .2005 , aj 129 , 809 stryker , l. l. 1993 , pasp 105 , 1081 walker , a.r . ;laney , c.d .1987 , mnras 224 , 61","answer":"combination of high - precision photometry and spectroscopy allows the detailed study of the upper main sequence in open clusters .  we are carrying out a comprehensive study of a number of clusters containing be stars in order to evaluate the likelihood that a significant number of be stars form through mass exchange in a binary .  our first results show that most young open clusters contain blue stragglers . in spite of the small number of clusters so far analysed  , some trends are beginning to emerge . in younger open clusters , such as ngc  869 and ngc  663  , there are many blue stragglers , most of which are not be stars . in older clusters , such as ic  4725 , the fraction of be stars among blue stragglers is very high .  two be blue stragglers are moderately strong x - ray sources , one of them being a confirmed x - ray binary .  such objects must have formed through binary evolution .  we discuss the contribution of mass transfer in a close binary to the formation of both blue stragglers and be stars"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Thiazolidinediones are a new class of anti-diabetic agents which increase insulin sensitivity by binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR (gamma)) and stimulating the expression of insulin-responsive genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. These drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. However the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT). The present study studied the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and ciglitazone, on ENT1 in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Although incubating HASMCs for 48h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ENT1 mRNA and protein levels, troglitazone acutely inhibited [3H]adenosine uptake and [3H]NBMPR binding of HASMCs with IC50 values of 2.35+/-0.35 and 3.99+/-0.57microM, respectively. The effect of troglitazone on ENT1 was PPAR (gamma) -independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ENT1. In contrast, pioglitazone and ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and ciglitazone in that its side-chain contains a Vitamin E moiety. The difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ENT1 because Vitamin E did not inhibit [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Using the nucleoside transporter deficient PK15NTD cells stably expressing ENT1 and ENT2, it was found that troglitazone inhibited ENT1 but had no effect on ENT2. From these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting ENT1. Pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of ENT1.","answer":"[[\\"troglitazone\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"ENT1\\"], [\\"thiazolidinediones\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"ENT1\\"], [\\"troglitazone\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"ENT2\\"], [\\"[3H]adenosine\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"ENT1\\"], [\\"troglitazone\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"ENT1\\"], [\\"[3H]NBMPR\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"ENT1\\"], [\\"troglitazone\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"ENT1\\"], [\\"Thiazolidinediones\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma\\"], [\\"Thiazolidinediones\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"insulin\\"], [\\"Thiazolidinediones\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"PPAR (gamma\\"], [\\"thiazolidinediones\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Genomic profiles of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are still insufficiently understood, and the genetic alterations associated with drug responses have not been studied. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with previously published results on pancreas (n = 12) and small intestine NETs (n = 50). The mean numbers of somatic mutations in each case varied widely from 20 to 4682. Among 12 GEP-NETs, eight showed mutations of more than one cancer-related gene, including TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL. TP53 was recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases. Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response and one small intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with BRAF V600E mutation showed progression after pazopanib treatment. We found BRAF V600E (G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and BRAF G593S (G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs from the rectum (n = 26), colon (n = 7), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1) by Sanger sequencing. All tumor specimens were obtained before chemotherapy. In conclusion, BRAF V600E mutation is likely to result in resistance to pazopanib but may be a potentianally actionable mutation in metastatic GEP-NETs patients.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"MGA\\", \\"TP53\\", \\"SPEN\\", \\"TBC1D12\\", \\"ERBB3\\", \\"PTEN\\", \\"KDM6A\\", \\"CNBD1\\", \\"BRAF\\", \\"MLL3\\", \\"EP300\\", \\"CTNNB1\\", \\"APC\\", \\"VHL\\", \\"RB1\\", \\"SMARCB1\\", \\"KRAS\\", \\"BCOR\\", \\"EGFR\\", \\"RASA1\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a materials science research paper.

Several studies have pointed to a link between immune and endocrine systems, including a regulatory function of GH on monocyte activation. The present study demonstrates that human THP-1 promonocytic cells, engineered by gene transfer to constitutively produce human growth hormone (hGH), secreted depressed amounts of TNF-alpha in response to challenge by LPS. The effect of GH appears to occur in an autocrine fashion, since the inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha secretion by constitutive GH production could be abolished in the presence of anti-hGH mAb. The GH-induced inhibitory effect was also observed using normal human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Inhibition of TNF-alpha production by THP-1-hGH-transfected cells cultured in the presence of LPS is dependent on a selective pathway, since no inhibition of TNF-alpha production was observed when cells were cultured in the presence of PMA. Inhibition of TNF-alpha secretion by LPS-stimulated THP-1-hGH cells was associated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB. The capacity of GH to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-alpha production by monocytes without altering other pathways leading to TNF-alpha production may be of potential relevance in septic shock, since GH is available for clinical use.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"THP - 1 - hGH - transfected cells\\", \\"LPS - stimulated THP - 1 - hGH cells\\", \\"LPS\\", \\"THP - 1 promonocytic cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"monocytes\\", \\"normal human monocytes\\", \\"lipopolysaccharide - stimulated human monocytes\\", \\"monocyte - derived macrophages\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"nuclear factor - kappaB\\", \\"anti - hGH mAb\\", \\"TNF - alpha\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Loperamide is a peripheral opiate agonist able to inhibit ACTH secretion. In this work, the interactions between loperamide and two ACTH secretagogues, lysine vasopressin (LVP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), were investigated in patients with Addison 's disease. After loperamide (16 mg orally) or placebo administration, 5 patients received LVP (0.06 IU/kg i.v. over 1 h) and 6 patients received oCRH (1 micrograms/kg i.v. as bolus). In all patients loperamide induced a significant fall in plasma ACTH levels. LVP increased ACTH levels after both loperamide (from 48 + /- 17.3 to a peak of 95 + /- 21 pmol/l) and placebo (from 231 + /- 59.5 to 365 + /- 86.6 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was not significant. CRH caused a rise in plasma ACTH after both loperamide (from 30 + /- 16.6 to a peak of 108 + /- 31 pmol/l) and placebo (from 98.5 + /- 47 to 211 + /- 61.7 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was significant, and the first phase of CRH-induced ACTH secretion was significantly lower after loperamide. These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of LVP and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, LVP and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way. Although these findings might be explained by the involvement of different intracellular ACTH-secreting mechanisms, an influence of loperamide on some suprapituitary factors modulating the ACTH response is suggested.","answer":"[[\\"loperamide\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"CRH\\"], [\\"loperamide\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"ACTH\\"], [\\"loperamide\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"ACTH\\"], [\\"Loperamide\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"corticotropin-releasing hormone\\"], [\\"Loperamide\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"lysine vasopressin\\"], [\\"Loperamide\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"adrenocorticotropin\\"], [\\"loperamide\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"LVP\\"], [\\"Loperamide\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"ACTH\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

To obtain insight into the network dynamics of fatty-acid β-oxidation, we constructed a detailed computational model of the pathway and subjected it to a fat overload condition. The model contains reversible and saturable enzyme-kinetic equations and experimentally determined parameters for rat-liver enzymes. It was validated by adding palmitoyl CoA or palmitoyl carnitine to isolated rat-liver mitochondria: without refitting of measured parameters, the model correctly predicted the β-oxidation flux as well as the time profiles of most acyl-carnitine concentrations. Subsequently, we simulated the condition of obesity by increasing the palmitoyl-CoA concentration. At a high concentration of palmitoyl CoA the β-oxidation became overloaded: the flux dropped and metabolites accumulated. This behavior originated from the competition between acyl CoAs of different chain lengths for a set of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases with overlapping substrate specificity. This effectively induced competitive feedforward inhibition and thereby led to accumulation of CoA-ester intermediates and depletion of free CoA( CoASH). The mitochondrial[NAD+]/[NADH] ratio modulated the sensitivity to substrate overload, revealing a tight interplay between regulation of β-oxidation and mitochondrial respiration.Introduction:Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying acquired and inborn metabolic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes and deficiencies in the fatty-acid oxidation, are largely elusive. Although we know many important molecular factors, yet the complexity of the metabolic and regulatory network hampers elucidating the relation between the primary disease factors and their systemic effects[1],[2]. Moreover, the experimental accessibility of large parts of the metabolic networks is limited. Computational kinetic models yield insight into the dynamics of metabolic networks and make predictions about the parts that are experimentally inaccessible. Fatty-acid( FA) β-oxidation is a prime example of a pathway involved in many diseases, but for which it is difficult to acquire a complete and quantitative view on the relation between metabolite concentrations and fluxes. Insulin resistance, one of the hallmarks of metabolic syndrome, is strongly associated with elevated levels of free FAs[3]. It has been argued that an imbalance between cellular FA uptake and oxidation leads to accumulation of FAs and other lipid molecules in the cytosol, which in turn causes insulin resistance[4],[5]. Others showed that a functioning acyl-CoA uptake into mitochondria is needed to develop insulin resistance, leading to the hypothesis that intermediates of FA β-oxidation are part of the problem[6]. Since the acyl-CoA intermediates are difficult to measure, conclusions are often based on acyl-carnitine levels in the blood[7],[8], which are interpreted as a reflection of acyl-CoA concentrations in the mitochondria. Similar limitations hamper the understanding of systemic effects of enzyme deficiencies in the FA β-oxidation and their impact on global energy and glucose regulation[9],[10]. Clearly, a more direct view on the dynamics of β-oxidation intermediates is urgently needed. A careful look at the basic biochemistry of the FA β-oxidation reveals complex interactions, of which the implications have never been investigated( Figure 1). First, it is a cyclic pathway. In each cycle the acyl-CoA substrate is shortened by two carbon atoms and the product is a substrate for the next cycle. Second, the shortened acyl-CoA product competes with the substrate for a set of enzymes with overlapping chain-length specificity. The complete breakdown of palmitoyl CoA, an acyl CoA with 16 carbon atoms, to 8 molecules of acetyl CoA( C2) requires seven reaction cycles. There are, however, only four acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and two parallel sets of enzymes for the further conversion of enoyl CoA( Figure 1). This results in a competition in two ways: substrates of different chain lengths compete for common enzymes, while enzymes with overlapping specificity compete for common substrates. The competition between substrates generates a feedforward inhibition in the network: the more palmitoyl CoA molecules enters the pathway, the more enzyme molecules they occupy, which are then not available for shorter acyl CoAs downstream in the pathway. Third, the two parallel pathways for the breakdown of enoyl-CoA molecules are of a different nature. Enoyl CoAs are either converted by a sequence of three enzymes( crotonase, medium/short-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase( M/SCHAD) and medium-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase( MCKAT)) or via the mitochondrial trifunctional protein( MTP), which catalyzes the entire sequence of reactions( Figure 1). At present it is unclear how these properties affect the pathway behavior. In contrast to the myriad of models of carbohydrate metabolism, we know of only two kinetic models of FA β-oxidation and each of these ignores the above biochemical interactions. The first model[11] contains only a single cycle of β-oxidation and thereby lacks the competition between the pathway substrate and its downstream products. The second model does comprise the complete conversion of acyl CoAs to acetyl CoA, but the authors overlooked that this should lead to competition and modeled it as if distinct pools of each enzyme existed for each substrate[12]. In this study we present and validate a quantitative kinetic model of the mitochondrial FA β-oxidation, which explicitly includes molecular competition. This model reveals how the complex biochemical wiring of the network gives rise to non-intuitive or ‘emergent’ behavior[13]. We will show i) how the competition renders the pathway vulnerable to substrate overload; ii) how the robustness of the system can be modulated; and iii) what the role is of the experimentally inaccessible CoA esters in this process.Discussion:In this paper we present the first dynamic model of the FA β-oxidation that appreciates the complex biochemical interactions in the network. Notably, we included the extensive competition in the system, as well as the qualitatively different pathways for conversion of enoyl CoAs. The parameters were based on biochemical analysis of individual enzymes and not fitted to obtain the desired metabolite and flux profiles. In this light, the correspondence between model predictions and experimental observations( Figure 2) was remarkably good. This allowed us to further explore the properties of the pathway. We found that the unique pathway structure makes the FA β-oxidation vulnerable to substrate overload: at high palmitoyl-CoA concentrations the shorter CoA esters accumulate to outcompete the palmitoyl CoA. Above a critical palmitoyl-CoA concentration this results in depletion of CoASH and a steep decline in flux. This is an example of an ‘emergent’ property: it would not have occurred in a linear pathway without competition. Hence, it could not be predicted from the properties of the individual enzymes, but resulted from the wiring of the entire network. It is tempting to speculate that this overload phenotype is at the basis of various diseases and may be one of the mechanisms of lipotoxicity. We emphasize, however, that we modeled the FA β-oxidation in isolation. In reality, surrounding pathways may protect the pathway from overload. In addition, the model revealed two possible protection mechanisms at the pathway boundaries. In the following we will discuss these protective mechanisms as well the possible role of fatty-acid overload in insulin resistance. First, according to the model the flux decline could be prevented by decreasing the activity of CPT1. Accordingly, increased concentrations of the CPT1 inhibitor malonyl CoA as well as a decreased catalytic capacity of CPT1 have been observed experimentally[27]–[32]. The most convincing data are for malonyl CoA, which is increased in skeletal muscle of obese humans and rodents[27],[28],[31],[32] as well as in liver tissue from obese mice[27]. Instead of being a cause of obesity via decreased FA oxidation and increased synthesis, malonyl CoA may rather confer protection against overload of the β-oxidation. A second mechanism to prevent overload was to keep the products of the thermodynamically unfavorable M/SCHAD reaction low. In the parallel MTP pathway the long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA( LCHAD) dehydrogenase is linked to the preceding long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and the following long-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase at the inner mitochondrial membrane[19],[23],[33]. Since the intermediate CoA esters are not detectable, it has been proposed that they are directly channeled from one active site to another[19],[23],[33]–[37]. The overall equilibrium constant of the lumped MTP reaction is 0. 7, dampening the thermodynamic hurdle at LCHAD. Channeling has not been described for the short-chain intermediates( C4 and C6) and therefore we modeled their conversion by a sequence of enzymes( the ‘crotonase branch’) including the M/SCHAD reaction. The impact of the thermodynamic hurdle at M/SCHAD is demonstrated by the fact that the long-chain intermediates have a strong preference for the MTP branch, even though they could in principle be converted by the crotonase branch( Figure S4). Only C4 and C6 substrates, which are not recognized by MTP, take the crotonase route. Due to the low equilibrium constant of M/SCHAD( Keq = 2×10−4), the C6 and C4 intermediates accumulate in the model as well as in the experiment( Figure 2). A high mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio shifts the M/SCHAD equilibrium in the forward direction, prevents accumulation of the short-chain intermediates and eventually protects against the overload phenotype( Figure 3). This provides a functional explanation for the co-existence of M/SCHAD and Complex I in a respiratory supercomplex[38],[39]: locally, the NADH produced by M/SCHAD may be kept low by channeling it directly to complex I. In agreement with this hypothesis, the respiration-linked β-oxidation rate in gently-disrupted mitochondria( assuming an intact complex between M/SCHAD and Complex I) was much higher than in completely-disrupted mitochondria[40]. Besides the protection mechanisms found in the model, alternative mechanisms might be provided by surrounding pathways. Limited formation of palmitoyl CoA, either by inhibition of the synthetase reaction or due to a low cytosolic CoA concentration, would be very effective. Little is known however, about regulation of palmitoyl CoA synthesis. Another option is upregulation of the pathways that consume the product acetyl CoA, such as the Krebs cycle or the formation of ketone bodies. Indeed, the liver can produce high amounts of ketone bodies when confronted with a high fat load[41]. According to the model, a decreased acetyl-CoA concentration( K1acesink in the parameter list) should increase the concentration of CoASH( Table S1), although not as strongly as a decrease of the mitochondrial NADH concentration. So far, direct experimental evidence for the overload phenotype is lacking. It is not unlikely, however, that it is at the basis of the well-known association of high FA levels to insulin resistance. Chronic exposure of muscle to elevated lipid levels results in an increased expression of FA β-oxidation genes, but this is not accompanied by an upregulation of downstream metabolic pathways, such as the TCA cycle and electron transport chain. In line with our model, it has been reported that this results in incomplete oxidation of fatty acids and accumulation of acyl carnitines and ketone bodies( reviewed in[41]). The fact that CPT1 is required to confer insulin resistance, suggests that the accumulated intermediate metabolites of the FA β-oxidation and/or ketone bodies may be involved in insulin resistance[6]. It is unclear, however, if the CoA esters or the carnitine esters are responsible for this effect, or both. Administration of l-carnitine, which is the ‘scavenger’ of CoA esters, sometimes restores glucose tolerance, in rats as well as humans[7],[42]. It is tempting to speculate that carnitine protects by trans-esterification of CoA esters to carnitine esters, which liberates CoASH and prevents accumulation of intermediates. In vivo it is not clear, however, if carnitine prevents overload, since it plays a dual role: in the mitochondrial matrix it scavenges intermediate CoA esters, but in the cytosol it drives the uptake of acyl CoAs into the mitochondria. Since glucose and FA oxidation share the mitochondrial cofactors NAD+/NADH and CoASH, it may be expected that the presence of glucose will make the β-oxidation even more susceptible to overload. Vice versa a severe drop in CoASH will also compromise glucose oxidation via the TCA cycle. To further understand the interplay between glucose and FA metabolism and the quantitative role of various protective pathways, it will be of key interest to link the new model with( partially) existing models of glucose metabolism, TCA cycle, respiration, ketone-body synthesis and FA synthesis[43]–[46]. This should be the next step in elucidating the mechanisms behind acquired and inborn diseases of glucose and FA metabolism.","answer":"Lipid metabolism plays an important role in the development of metabolic syndrome , a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes .

In fact, perturbation theory was the first successful method for what previously had been an intractable theoretical problem. In perturbation theory, the fluid is considered to be similar to a reference fluid with known correlation functions and thermodynamic properties and the functions and properties of the fluid of interest may be calculated by means of a rapidly convergent expansion.</p><p>Three steps contributed to the development and utility of perturbation theory. Two were, first, the availablity of a convenient and accurate theory for the radial distribution function and thermodynamics of a useful unperturbed or reference fluid, the hard sphere fluid, whose intermolecular or pair potential is zero until the spheres come into contact at a distance, d, the hard sphere diameter, and then is positive and infinite, and, second, the formulation of convenient expressions for the second and higher order perturbation terms in a perturbation expansion. However, without the third step, perturbation theory would have been restricted to fluids whose molecules had an infinitely hard repulsive core and, thus, limited in usefulness. The third contribution was the idea that the steep, but not infinitely steep, repulsive force between realistic molecules at short separations, can be approximated by an effective temperature-dependent hard sphere potential. It is this third step that is the subject of this paper.</p><p>The pair potential is the potential energy of a pair of molecules in the fluid and is important because because this function, when added together with the pair potentials of all the pairs of molecules in the fluid, gives the dominant contribution to the potential energy of the system that is being considered (the entire contribution if the potential energy is pairwise additive). The thermodynamic properties are obtained from an integral, the partition function, of the Boltzmann term, the exponential of the negative of the potential energy, divided by kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.</p><p>Prior to the perturbation theories cited above, Frisch et al5 formulated a first order perturbation theory for a Lennard-Jones 12–6 (LJ) fluid whose intermolecular potential is given by</p><p>(1)u(R)=4ε{(σR)12−(σR)6}, where R is the separation of the molecules, ε is the maximum strength of the attractive interaction, and σ is the value of R at which u(R) changes from negative to positive values. The LJ potential mimicks a realistic fluid, such as argon. However, their theory was limited in usefulness by the fact that the unperturbed fluid was a hard sphere fluid and, to a lesser extent, by the lack of higher order terms in the expansion. The repulsion between LJ molecules is not infinitely hard. Later, Barker and Henderson1 (BH) developed a simple approximation for the second order term, which they called the compressiblity approximation and successfully applied their approach to a fluid whose molecules interact by means of a square well potential (which does have a hard repulsion) and so separated the question of whether the repulsive core can be approximated as hard from the utility of perturbation theory. They obtained excellent results; this was a valuable step but, in the absence of a method of dealing with the finite slope of a repulsive potential, was not directly applicable to, say, the LJ fluid.</p><p>The key to the final step was the earlier work of Rowlinson6–7. He considered a repulsive, R−n intermolecular potential,</p><p>ε′ > 0, σ′, and n > 0 are parameters specifying the strength and steepness of this potential. Rowlinson suggested that if n was large, this inverse n fluid could be replaced by an equivalent hard sphere fluid with an effective diameter. He found that n = 12 was large enough for his method to be applicable. Consider the f-function for a given pair interaction, u(R),</p><p>(3)f(R)=exp{−βu(R)}−1, where β = 1/kT. The f-function is the excess of the Boltzmann term of a molecular pair over that of a pair of ideal gas molecules.</p><p>We can obtain Rowlinson's result by defining the f-function of the equivalent, effective hard sphere potential by setting the integral of the equivalent hard sphere f-function equal to that of the R−n fluid. Thus,</p><p>(4)∫0∞fHS(R)dR=∫0∞f(R)dR, where fHS(R) is the f-function of a hard sphere fluid of diameter d and f(R) is the f-function of the fluid of interest, defined by eqs (2) and (3). Since fHS(R) is −1 for R < d and zero otherwise, the first integral is just −d. Evaluating the second integral and expanding to order n−1 gives Rowlinson's result for the temperature dependent effective hard sphere diameter that represents the n−1 fluid,</p><p>(5)d=σ(βε)−n(1+γn), where γ = 0.5772157 ··· is Euler's constant. Rowlinson found that an effective diameter given by eq (5) gave good results for a fluid described by eq (2) with n = 12.</p><p>McQuarrie and Katz8 then applied the theory of Frisch et al with the R−6 part of the LJ potential being the perturbation energy and with the R−12 term being the potential that defines the unperturbed fluid. They treated the unperturbed system by Rowlin-son's method. The results were not encouraging. This is partly due to the fact that the perturbation expansion was taken only to first order but, as pointed out by Barker and Henderson2, is mainly due to the fact that the magnitude of the maximum value of the perturbation energy in their treatment is 4ε. As a result, because the perturbation parameter enters as βu(R), the expansion parameter can become as large as 4 (or even larger near the triple point). Thus, the McQuarrie-Katz treatment is really a theory of the LJ fluid at high temperatures, much above the critical temperature.</p><p>Barker and Henderson2 proposed another separation of the LJ potential into the unperturbed energy and the perturbation energy. They suggested that the unperturbed part of u(R) be the part for which R < σ and the perturbation energy be the part for which R > σ. They developed a parametrization of u(R) for R < σ in terms of an inverse steepness parameter, α, such that for α = 0, the perturbation energy was the hard sphere energy and for α = 1, the R < σ part of the LJ energy was recovered. Although the approach is seemingly different from that of Rowlinson, it is interesting that the BH approach led to eq (4) but with the upper limit in the integral on the RHS equal to σ rather that ∞. Thus, the hard sphere fluid with a temperature-dependent value of d could be used as a reference fluid. This is very convenient. Values for d(T) can be computed at the beginning and parametrized. The BH theory, when taken to second order using the compressiblity approximation, gave accurate results, even for temperatures as low as the triple point temperature, where βε is about 1.4.</p><p>Subsequently, Weeks, Chandler, and Andersen, developed an alternative perturbation theory that is based on a different separation of u(R) into unperturbed and perturbed energies. It is interesting that their theory also represents the reference fluid by a hard sphere fluid with a state-dependent diameter. In their theory, the effective diameter is given by an equation that is similar to eq (4) but with a hard sphere correlation function inside the integral on the RHS. This leads to values of d that are temperature and density dependent, which is slightly less convenient but manageable.</p><p>John Rowlinson has made many contributions to the development and history of science and to the growth of science in the UK.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  A time-of-arrival (ToA)-based ranging scheme using an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio link is proposed. This ranging scheme implements a search algorithm for the detection of a direct path signal in the presence of dense multipath, utilizing generalized maximum-likelihood (GML) estimation. Models for critical parameters in the algorithm are based on statistical analysis of propagation data and the algorithm is tested on another independent set of propagation measurements. The proposed UWB ranging system uses a correlator and a parallel sampler with a high-speed measurement capability in each transceiver to accomplish two-way ranging between them in the absence of a common clock. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Wireless sensor network is a promising technique for many applications. However, new technique also introduces new problems. To get to know the locations of sensors is one challenging problem referred to as the localization problem. For large wireless sensor networks, to identify the exact locations for every sensor is not feasible and the cost may be very high. Furthermore coarse accuracy is usually sufficient for many applications. In this paper, we propose an area localization scheme (ALS) for large wireless sensor networks. This scheme estimates the position of a sensor within a certain area rather than finds the exact coordinates. In ALS, most of the complicated calculations are done by the powerful sinks, while the sensors do not have to make a lot of communications and calculations themselves, which help to save energy and extend the life time of the network. Moreover, the granularity of the areas estimated may be easily adjusted by changing the system parameters, which makes this scheme flexible. 3.

[Z. Dai, J. C. Sirard, M. Mock, and T. M. Koehler, Mol. Microbiol. 16:1171-1181, 1995]) and P2, whose transcription start sites are separated by 650 bp.AtxA controls the expression of more than a hundred genes belonging to all genetic elements, the chromosome and both virulence plasmids, including those encoding the major virulence factors. AtxA can activate or repress gene expression.Here we employ 5' and 3' deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the atxA control region to demonstrate that atxA transcription from the major start site P1 is dependent upon a consensus sequence for the housekeeping sigma factor SigA and an A+T-rich upstream element for RNA polymerase.We also show that an additional trans-acting protein(s) binds specifically to atxA promoter sequences located between -13 and +36 relative to P1 and negatively impacts transcription. Deletion of this region increases promoter activity up to 15-fold.A majority of genes on the virulence plasmid pXO1 that are regulated by the presence of either CO2 or AtxA separately are also regulated synergistically in the presence of both. These results also elucidate novel pXO1-encoded small RNAs that are associated with virulence conditions.This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA.Transcriptome analysis identifies Bacillus anthracis genes that respond to CO2 through an AtxA-dependent mechanismThe majority of the regulated genes responded to both AtxA and carbon dioxide rather than to just one of these factors. Interestingly, we identified two previously unrecognized small RNAs that are highly expressed under physiological carbon dioxide concentrations in an AtxA-dependent mannerThis response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA.As a similar organization is found in transcription regulators in many other pathogens, AtxA might become the paradigm of a new class of virulence regulators.AtxA, a Bacillus anthracis global virulence regulator.Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA: oligomeric state, function and CO(2) -signalling.The accumulation of the global virulence regulator AtxA protein was strongly reduced in the mutant strain.This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxAThis response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA.Opposing effects of histidine phosphorylation regulate the AtxA virulence transcription factor in Bacillus anthracis.The B. anthracis pleiotropic regulator CodY activates toxin gene expression by post-translationally regulating the accumulation of the global regulator AtxA.Cross-talk to the genes for Bacillus anthracis capsule synthesis by atxA, the gene encoding the trans-activator of anthrax toxin synthesis.AtxA, a unique regulatory protein of unknown molecular function, positively controls expression of the major virulence genes of Bacillus anthracis.Consistent with the role of atxA in virulence factor expression, a B. anthracis atxA-null mutant is avirulent in a murine model for anthrax.This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA.PlcR is the first example described of a pleiotropic regulator involved in the control of extracellular virulence factor expression in pathogenic Bacillus spp.Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA: oligomeric state, function and CO(2) -signalling.AtxA, a unique regulatory protein of unknown molecular function, positively controls expression of the major virulence genes of Bacillus anthracis.","answer":"AtxA is the gene encoding the trans-activator of anthrax toxin synthesis and is essential for virulence of B. anthracis. It is located on the resident 185-kb plasmid pXO1 and its activation is stimulated by bicarbonate. AtxA controls the expression of more than a hundred genes belonging to all genetic elements, the chromosome and both virulence plasmids, including those encoding the major virulence factors. AtxA can activate or repress gene expression. In atxA+ strains, toxin gene expression is increased 5- to 20-fold in cells grown in 5% CO2 relative to cells grown in air. Dual promoters control expression of AtxA.  Transcription of the atxA gene occurs from two independent promoters, P1 and P2, whose transcription start sites are separated by 650 bp. Comparison of the resulting protein patterns indicated that synthesis of non-toxin proteins is influenced by growth in elevated CO2 and the toxin gene regulator, atxA. The AtxA virulence regulator of Bacillus anthracis is required for toxin and capsule gene expression. DNA sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites in 17 mutants carrying CO2- and atxA-regulated fusions revealed 10 mutants carrying independent insertions on the 185-kb toxin plasmid pXO1 which did not map to the toxin genes. We purified histidine-tagged AtxA [AtxA(His)] from Escherichia coli and used anti-AtxA(His) serum to detect AtxA in protein preparations from B. anthracis cells.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical success rate of endodontically treated premolars restored with fiber posts and direct composite restorations and compare that treatment with a similar treatment of full-coverage with metal-ceramic crowns.                Subjects included in this study had one maxillary or mandibular premolar for which endodontic treatment and crown build up was indicated and met specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Only premolars with Class II carious lesions and preserved cusp structure were included. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 2 experimental groups: (1) teeth endodontically treated and restored with adhesive techniques and composite or (2) teeth endodontically treated, restored with adhesive techniques and composite, and then restored with full-coverage metal-ceramic crowns. Sixty teeth were included in the first group and 57 in the second. All restorations were performed by one operator. Causes of failure were categorized as root fracture, post fracture, post decementation, clinical and/or radiographic evidence of marginal gap between tooth and restoration, and clinical and/or radiographic evidence of secondary caries contiguous with restoration margins. Subjects were examined for the listed clinical and radiographic causes of failure by 2 calibrated examiners at intervals of 1, 2, and 3 years. Exact 95% confidence intervals for the difference between the 2 experimental groups were calculated.                At the 1-year recall, no failures were reported. The only failure modes observed at 2 and 3 years were decementations of posts and clinical and/or radiographic evidence of marginal gap between tooth and restoration. There was no difference in the failure frequencies of the 2 groups (95% confidence interval, -17.5 to 12.6). There was no difference between the number of failures caused by post decementations and the presence of marginal gaps observed in the 2 groups (95% confidence intervals, -9.7 to 16.2 and -17.8 to 9.27).                Within the limitations of this study, the results upheld the research hypothesis that the clinical success rates of endodontically treated premolars restored with fiber posts and direct composite restorations after 3 years of service were equivalent to a similar treatment of full coverage with metal-ceramic crowns.Title 2:Clinical evaluation of fiber-reinforced epoxy resin posts and cast post and cores.Abstract 2:This retrospective study evaluated treatment outcome of cast post and core and Composipost systems after 4 yrs of clinical service.                200 patients were included in the study. They were divided in two groups of 100 endodontically treated teeth restored with a post. Group 1: Composipost systems were luted into root canal following the manufacturer's instructions. Group 2: Cast post and cores were cemented into root canal preparations with a traditional technique. The patients were recalled after 6 months, 1, 2 and 4 yrs and clinical and radiographic examinations were completed. Endodontic and prosthodontic results were recorded.                Group 1: 95% of the teeth restored with Composiposts showed clinical success; 3% of these samples were excluded for noncompliance and 2% showed endodontic failure. Group 2: Clinical success was found with 84% of teeth restored with cast post and core. 2% of these samples were excluded for noncompliance, 9% showed root fracture, 2% dislodgment of crown and 3% endodontic failure. Statistical evaluation showed significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.001). The results of this retrospective study indicated that the Composipost system was superior to the conventional cast post and core system after 4 yrs of clinical service.","answer":"Our systematic review could not specify which type of post and core system should be used when two or three dentine walls remain.

We propose a model by which SNX27 regulates trafficking of β-Pix to focal adhesions and thereby influences cell motility.We found that SNX27a redirected part of 5-HT4(a)R to early endosomes.sorting nexin 27 (SNX27), a recently described member of a protein family involved in intracellular trafficking,SNX27 co-localized with transferrin receptor-positive vesicles, pointing to its participation in T cell endocytic recycling.This protein is a unique member of the sorting nexin family of proteins, a group generally involved in the endocytic and intracellular sorting machineryThese previously unreported results indicate that SNX27 is a participant in NK cell polarization, as a mediator or target of the mechanism.Like most sorting nexins, SNX27 possesses a functional PX domain that selectively binds the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) and is important for trafficking to the early endosome.This is consistent with a role of SNX27 as a general regulator for sorting of membrane proteins containing a PDZ-binding motif, and its absence may alter the trafficking of these proteins, leading to growth and survival defects.Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) belongs to the sorting nexin family of proteins, which participate in vesicular and protein trafficking. Similarly to all sorting nexin proteins, SNX27 has a functional PX domain that is important for endosome binding, but it is the only sorting nexin with a PDZ domain.These results identify SNX27 as a PDZ-containing component of the T cell immunological synapse, and demonstrate a role for this protein in the regulation of the Ras-ERK pathway, suggesting a functional relationship between SNX27 and DGKζ.Sorting nexins have been implicated in trafficking of proteins through endosomal compartments.","answer":"Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) regulates endocytic sorting/recycling and intracellular trafficking of ion channels and receptors."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Compared to the well-studied S. enterica there is a marked lack of information regarding the genetic makeup and diversity of S. bongori. S. bongori has been found predominantly associated with cold-blooded animals, but it can infect humans. To define the phylogeny of this species, and compare it to S. enterica, we have sequenced 28 isolates representing most of the known diversity of S. bongori. This cross-species analysis allowed us to confidently differentiate ancestral functions from those acquired following speciation, which include both metabolic and virulence-associated capacities. We show that, although S. bongori inherited a basic set of Salmonella common virulence functions, it has subsequently elaborated on this in a different direction to S. enterica. It is an established feature of S. enterica evolution that the acquisition of the type III secretion systems( T3SS-1 and T3SS-2) has been followed by the sequential acquisition of genes encoding secreted targets, termed effectors proteins. We show that this is also true of S. bongori, which has acquired an array of novel effector proteins( sboA-L). All but two of these effectors have no significant S. enterica homologues and instead are highly similar to those found in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli( EPEC). Remarkably, SboH is found to be a chimeric effector protein, encoded by a fusion of the T3SS-1 effector gene sopA and a gene highly similar to the EPEC effector nleH from enteropathogenic E. coli. We demonstrate that representatives of these new effectors are translocated and that SboH, similarly to NleH, blocks intrinsic apoptotic pathways while being targeted to the mitochondria by the SopA part of the fusion. This work suggests that S. bongori has inherited the ancestral Salmonella virulence gene set, but has adapted by incorporating virulence determinants that resemble those employed by EPEC.Introduction:Salmonella serovars are predominately pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae that are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor with Escherichia coli ∼100 million years ago[1]. The genus Salmonella currently comprises two species; S. bongori and S. enterica, with S. enterica being comprised of 6 subspecies enterica, salamae, arizonae, diarizonae, houtenae and indica[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]. These S. enterica subspecies are further subdivided into >2500 serovars. Although S. bongori have been reported to infect humans[7],[8], the species is predominantly associated with cold-blooded animals whereas serovars causing disease in humans and other warm-blooded animals mostly belong to S. enterica subspecies enterica. Since S. enterica incorporates clinically important pathogens, our knowledge about the genus Salmonella is heavily biased and there is a marked paucity of information relating to the genetic and phylogenetic makeup of S. bongori. Even though E. coli and Salmonella are estimated to have diverged millions of years ago, their genomes still display significant similarity including extensive regions of synteny. However, in common with other Enterobacteriaceae significant diversity has been driven by horizontal gene transfer on a background of gradual genome sequence drift[9]. Many of the genes which are unique to Salmonella serovars, compared to E. coli, are found on large discrete genomic islands that include prophage elements and specialised loci termed Salmonella pathogenicity islands( SPIs)[10],[11],[12]. These Salmonella-specific functions include many genes required for the full expression of virulence and some of these were acquired by S. enterica following the split from S. bongori. For example, S. enterica encodes two complete type III secretion systems encoded by SPI-1( T3SS-1) and SPI-2( T3SS-2)[13],[14],[15],[16], whereas S. bongori lacks SPI-2, which is required for optimal replication within macrophages[15],[17],[18]. Several characteristics of S. bongori suggest that this species may, in evolutionary terms, lie somewhere between E. coli and S. enterica. Consequently, to prove this hypothesis we have studied multiple genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of S. bongori and compared these to S. enterica and other Enterobacteriaceae. In terms of genotype, we have determined a reference quality sequence of S. bongori 12419, originally isolated from an African frog in 1972( Salmonella Reference Collection C strain SARC11) and prepared draft sequences of a globally and temporally diverse S. bongori collection including 21 representatives of the 23 known serovars( SV). From our data we have been able to determine inter and intra-species phylogeny and have used this to differentiate ancestral and more recently acquired virulence and metabolic functions. These data show that S. bongori possesses only a basic set of ancestral Salmonella virulence functions and lacks several metabolic pathways that define S. enterica. Nevertheless, S. bongori has not remained functionally static; it has acquired a repertoire of 12 T3SS candidate effector proteins, 10 of which are not found in other salmonellae but are significantly similar to known effectors found in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli( EPEC) strains. We herein demonstrate that representatives of these effectors are translocated and that at least one of these effectors, S. bongori outer protein H( SboH), is functionally related to the non-LEE encoded EPEC effector NleH1.Discussion:Our understanding of Salmonella evolution has been built largely on data from representative isolates of the relatively recently emerged Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica. S. bongori and S. enterica are thought to have diverged between 40-63. 4 Myrs ago[72] and so comparing the genomes of these two distinct species provides a unique opportunity to understand the ancestral Salmonella and determine the evolutionary events that mark speciation and those that track different branch points in Salmonella evolution following this event. We have shown that a diverse set of S. bongori isolates form a tight cluster of sequence types that, when examined on a whole genome basis, appear to comprise at least three phylogenetic groups. The G+C content in S. bongori represents a midpoint between S. enterica subspecies enterica and E. coli( Figure S2), but the phylogenetic analysis with MLST data and whole genome sequences suggests that this may be an artifact of the host specialisation into warm blooded animals that took place in the evolution of S. enterica subspecies enterica. The variation across the S. bongori species, both within and between the phylogenetic groups, contrasts sharply with that observed across S. enterica, with a comparable amount of variation across the groups in S. bongori, to that which is found between two serotypes of S. enterica subspecies enterica. The apparent lack of variation is difficult to explain since even if S. bongori had been stably maintained for a long period within its current niche significant genome diversity would still be expected, even if this was largely neutral. This reduced level of apparent diversity could be a bias of sampling, yet the isolates sequenced in this study are from a wide range of sources and are globally and temporally diverse. Although the answer to this question is still equivocal it is possible that S. bongori has been through a recent evolutionary bottleneck. Despite their apparent evolutionary divergence, metabolic analysis showed that the biochemical maps of S. bongori and S. Typhi are very similar, suggesting that Salmonella serovars acquired many of the basic functions for an enteric lifestyle early in their evolution. This has been recently supported by the finding that the ability to use tetrathionate as an electron acceptor provides a competitive advantage to S. Typhimurium in the inflamed gut over normal flora[73]. The ttr cluster is conserved in S. bongori[74]. Where S. bongori did differ from S. enterica serovars, it generally most closely resembled E. coli and the wider Enterobacteriaceae, i. e. the presumed ancestral state. Whilst the independent acquisition of the lac operon by S. bongori is difficult to explain, for E. coli the acquisition of the lac operon may have facilitated metabolism of milk sugar and adaptation to the mammalian gut. Conversely the loss of this function from S. enterica subspecies enterica may be associated with its invasive lifestyle since recent evidence has shown that lacI expression interferes with the function of SPI-2 and attenuates virulence in macrophage[75]. This comparative analysis also highlighted metabolic traits that mark the evolution of S. enterica subspecies enterica including the differing abilities to ferment L-tartrate and citrate. These metabolic differences are already known to differentiate high and low pathogenicity Salmonella strains( S. Paratyphi B and S. Paratyphi B variant Java)[76]. Outside of Salmonella the ability to ferment citrate almost equally divides clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae biotypes into two groups and is thought to represent an adaptation to different nutrient conditions found within the host[77]. S. bongori possess a basic Salmonella virulence ‘tool kit’ consisting of SPI-1, 3a, 3b, 4, 5 and 9. Although the S. bongori SPI-3 and SPI-5 have a different structure compared to those in S. enterica these SPIs are conserved across the salmonellae and could be considered part of the Salmonella core genome. Moreover, many of these core SPIs show significant regulatory and functional interplay between the functions they encode. For example the SPI-4 adhesin SiiE is required for efficient translocation of T3SS-1 effectors in S. Typhimurium[78] and SPI-4, SPI-5 and SPI-1 genes are under joint control by the SirA/HilA global regulatory cascade[78],[79],[80],[81]. From this it is tempting to speculate that these SPIs define one of the earliest virulence networks of Salmonella. Clearly there are multiple factors missing from S. bongori which limit its ability to cause disease in warm blooded animals demonstrated by experiments that have introduced SPI-2 into S. bongori[61]. The genome of S. bongori has not remained static since divergence; we see parallels with S. enterica serovars in the functions that have been acquired following divergence. For example both S. bongori and S. enterica have independently acquired different T6SSs. It is clear that the Salmonella genus as a whole includes representatives of each of the major T6SS phylogenetic groups, thus reinforcing the long-term importance of these systems. Also like S. enterica, S. bongori has sequentially acquired a range of T3SS-1 effector proteins many of which we have shown to be translocated. The S. bongori effectors have homologues in EPEC, EHEC and C. rodentium including EspJ; which in EPEC and EHEC prevents receptor mediated phagocytosis of opsonised cells[46] and so could be important for S. bongori in resisting phagocytosis. This strategy would be well in line with previous observations of the S. bongori life style as the bacteria are not able to sustain an intracellular life style in macrophages mainly due to absence of the SPI-2 T3SS-2 and its effectors[61] and likely also because of the lack of cob-pdu operon too[60]. We also functionally characterised the effector SboH and have shown that it inhibits apoptosis in a similar manner to its EPEC homologue NleH1. Moreover, in infection SboH reduces bacterial cytotoxicity. In EPEC the anti-apoptotic activity of NleH1 has been proposed to sustain colonisation of the mucosal epithelium by reducing the ‘turn-over’ of surface enterocytes and associated any bacteria or microcolonies[52]. The acquisition of these effectors that most closely resemble those from pathogenic E. coli strains causing watery diarrhea suggests that following the split of S. bongori and S. enterica, S. bongori has adopted a specialised infection strategy which might in parts be more similar to the extracellular pathogenic E. coli than S. enterica. This infection strategy might be optimised to colonise cold-blooded reptiles, but still provides the basic armoury for S. bongori to emerge as an opportunistic pathogen of humans and animals.","answer":"The bacterial genus Salmonella consists of two species: Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori .

BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) can augment inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged lungs. High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a pro-inflammatory mediator in ventilator-induced lung injury, but its mechanisms are not well defined. This study investigated the role of HMGB1 in lung inflammation in response to the combination of MV and LPS treatment. METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to one of four groups: sham control; LPS treatment; mechanical ventilation; mechanical ventilation with LPS treatment. Mechanically ventilated animals received 10 ml/kg tidal volumes at a rate of 40 breaths/min for 4 h. In the HMGB1-blockade study, sixteen rats were randomly assigned to HMGB1 antibody group or control antibody group and animals were subjected to MV+LPS as described above. A549 cells were pre-incubated with different signal inhibitors before subjected to 4 h of cyclic stretch. Lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio, total protein and IgG concentration, number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung histological changes were examined. The levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and HMGB1 in BALF were measured using ELISA. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to analyze mRNA and protein expression of HMGB1. Western blot were employed to analyze the activation of IκB-α, NF-κB, JNK, ERK, and p38. RESULTS: MV significantly augmented LPS-induced lung injury and HMGB1 expression, which was correlated with the increase in IL-1β, IL-6 and MIP-2 levels in BALF. In vivo, intratracheally administration of HMGB1 antibody significantly attenuated pulmonary inflammatory injury. In vitro experiments showed cyclic stretch induced HMGB1 expression through signaling pathways including p38 and NF-κB. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that moderate tidal volume MV augmented LPS induced lung injury by up-regulating HMGB1. The mechanism of HMGB1-mediated lung injury is likely to be signaling through p38 and NF-κB pathways.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"macrophage inflammatory protein-2\\", \\"ERK\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor-u03b1\\", \\"Iu03baB-u03b1\\", \\"p38\\", \\"IL-1u03b2\\", \\"HMGB1\\", \\"IL-6\\", \\"NF-u03baB\\", \\"JNK\\", \\"MIP-2\\", \\"interleukin-1u03b2\\", \\"High mobility group box 1\\", \\"TNF-u03b1\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Neuronal adaptation is a key mechanism in the detection of patterns that are continuously repeated across short( seconds to minutes) temporal windows. Here, we found in mice that a subcortical structure in the auditory midbrain was sensitive to patterns that were repeated discontinuously, in a temporally sparse manner, across windows of minutes to hours. Using a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular approaches, we found changes in neuronal response gain that varied in mechanism with the degree of sound predictability and resulted in changes in frequency coding. Analysis of population activity( structural tuning) revealed an increase in frequency classification accuracy in the context of increased overlap in responses across frequencies. The increase in accuracy and overlap was paralleled at the behavioral level in an increase in generalization in the absence of diminished discrimination. Gain modulation was accompanied by changes in gene and protein expression, indicative of long-term plasticity. Physiological changes were largely independent of corticofugal feedback, and no changes were seen in upstream cochlear nucleus responses, suggesting a key role of the auditory midbrain in sensory gating. Subsequent behavior demonstrated learning of predictable and random patterns and their importance in auditory conditioning. Using longer timescales than previously explored, the combined data show that the auditory midbrain codes statistical learning of temporally sparse patterns, a process that is critical for the detection of relevant stimuli in the constant soundscape that the animal navigates through.Introduction:As we interact with the environment, our brain is constantly detecting patterns—i. e., regularities—in the sensory world. This capacity allows us to recognize surrounding stimuli and make predictions necessary for survival. Patterns in the sensory input are extracted through a process known as statistical learning[1]. Regularities in the continuous sensory input that fit relatively short windows, in the order of seconds to tens of seconds, can be encoded through neuronal adaptation of response gain in both subcortical and cortical structures[2–4]. However, little is known about the circuits that code patterns that are temporally sparse, i. e., when the regularity is repeated discontinuously across time windows of minutes and hours. Statistical learning of sparse patterns is important for grammatical learning or musical sensitivity in humans[5, 6], both of which are achieved through exposures that occur across days to years. This type of learning is likely to involve long-term plasticity mechanisms, different from neuronal adaptation. Changes in neuronal response gain that reflect fast adaptation are ubiquitous in the auditory cortex( AC)[2, 7, 8] but can also be found in the inferior colliculus, a subcortical midbrain structure that is the first convergence station in the auditory circuit[9]. For example, stimulus probability selectivity[3, 4, 10, 11], as well as some forms of response selectivity to natural sounds[12–14], is observed in some divisions of the inferior colliculus[4]. Correlations between inferior colliculus activity and temporal patterns, such as speech or rhythmic tapping, have also been described in humans[11, 12]. We hypothesized that neuronal correlates of statistical learning of temporally sparse patterns can also be found in the inferior colliculus. The context can be a strong predictor of the soundscape. In real life, as animals move through the environment, they can reencounter the same context and its characteristic sounds in temporally spread bouts. Here, in order to understand the neuronal coding of temporally sparse patterns in the sensory input, we used context–sound associations as stimuli. Thus, we set out to specifically test( 1) whether mice can detect temporally sparse context–sound associations and( 2) whether this detection triggers changes in the response patterns of neurons in the inferior colliculus. To recreate a natural environment while maintaining control over the experimental variables, we used the Audiobox—a socially, acoustically, and behaviorally enriched environment in which mice lived in groups for up to 2 weeks[15]. Mice were exposed to sounds that were associated with the context, with different degrees of predictability. The consequence of this exposure was assessed at the behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular levels. First, we measured the effect that temporally sparse sound exposure had on the response gain of collicular neurons by simultaneously measuring evoked responses across different frequency bands. We subsequently assessed the effect these changes had on frequency coding and discrimination before testing how physiological changes in sensory gating paralleled behavioral generalization measures. We then confirmed that plasticity-associated changes in gene and protein expression had taken place. Since conditioning-triggered midbrain plasticity can depend on corticofugal input[16], we tested the dependence of the observed changes on cortical feedback. Finally, to ascertain the origin of changes in the activity of inferior colliculus neurons, we assessed the effect that sound exposure had on upstream and downstream structures.Discussion:Statistical learning is essential for a correct interpretation of the sensory input. This form of learning is likely to be distributed throughout different brain regions, depending on the stimulus patterns to be learned, their modalities, and spatiotemporal combinations[48–50]. Some forms of statistical processing must happen at the level of subcortical structures as part of sensory gating. Neuronal adaptation—changes in firing rate as a result of continuous stimulation—is maybe the best-studied mechanism of experience-dependent plasticity believed to be underlying statistical learning of environmental regularities that occur within the recent stimulation history. It has been hypothesized to increase the dynamic range of neurons as well as gating of specific inputs[51] and is observed in cortical[2, 7, 52–54] and subcortical structures[2–4]. Meta-adaptation has been observed across 5-second windows in a continuously alternating sensory stimulation paradigm in the inferior colliculus[4]. Yet the circuits underlying statistical learning of temporally sparse patterns have not been characterized. This timescale of statistical learning is reflected in the sensitivity of neurons in the auditory system for natural sounds[12–14, 55–58]. Neuronal adaptation is achieved through short-term plasticity[59–61]; therefore, it is unlikely to be the mechanism underlying the type of statistical learning that needs to be accumulated across bouts of exposure that are separated by minutes to hours, like the one we describe here. Using a combination of electrophysiological, behavioral, and molecular approaches, we show that the inferior colliculus, an auditory subcortical structure, was sensitive to statistical learning of temporally sparse auditory patterns. We exposed mice to sounds that were fully predictable( predictable group). This exposure was self-initiated, limited to visits to the water corner( context specific), and lasted only for the duration of the individual visits( temporally sparse). Exposure to these patterns resulted in an increase in response gain that was frequency unspecific and was not due to mere sound exposure, since the random group( exposed to a sound in a fixed context but at random time intervals) showed a different pattern of collicular plasticity. Increase in response gain changed the pattern of population activity, resulting in increased between-frequency overlap in the structural tuning but a more consistent trial-to-trial within-frequency coding. These effects were paralleled at the behavioral level, at which increased response generalization was, paradoxically, not paralleled by a decrease in frequency discrimination as is discussed below. Cortical feedback played a minor role in the maintenance of collicular plasticity, and changes were not observed in the main input structure, the cochlear nucleus[62, 63]. This suggests that plasticity was initiated in the inferior colliculus, as further supported by changes in gene expression indicative of long-term plasticity. The combined analysis of local( region-specific tuning curves) and global( structural tuning) neuronal responses allowed us to uncover 2 coexisting mechanisms of frequency coding in the predictable group. On one hand, consistency in frequency coding was increased, as reflected in frequency-specific increase in classification accuracy. On the other hand, the potential for increased generalization was reflected in the increased overlap between structural tuning curves in the predictable group. Both increased discrimination and increased generalization were paralleled at the behavioral level. While, typically, a decrease in PPI has been interpreted as a decrease in frequency discrimination, here we found that different prepulse tones can generate discriminable startle responses and yet be less effective in generating PPI near the background tone. Thus, at the behavioral level, increased generalization in the startle’s inhibition was found to coexist with normal frequency discrimination near the exposed frequency. This highlights the relevance of responses across spatially distributed neuronal populations, in which even increased responses away from the tuned region( the tail of the structural tuning) might have an impact on behavioral output. Predictable sounds, when highly repetitive and consistent, are less salient. It is maybe because of this that behavioral responses to pure tones are largely more inhibited in the predictable group. In striking contrast, mice in the random group showed no evidence of diminished discrimination at either the neuronal population level or behaviorally, probably reflecting the saliency of randomness. Indeed, in this group, changes in response gain were—unlike in the predictable group—typically constrained to the tuned region. Corticocollicular projections are believed to modulate collicular sensory filters[23, 64–67]. The narrow corridors of the Audiobox prevented us from optogenetically modulating cortical activity during the exposure. Cortical inactivation during the recording, however, subtly increased the size of the evoked responses in both control and predictable groups and had no effect on either the suprathreshold tonotopic shift induced by sound exposure or the increase in bandwidth. However, it affected the levels of spontaneous activity. The frequency-specific low level in spontaneous activity in the tuned region disappeared upon inactivation, meaning that the cortical feedback can locally reduce spontaneous activity in one region of the inferior colliculus to increase the SNR. Nonetheless, overall, the cortical inactivation data suggest that the AC plays a small role in the maintenance of learning-induced plasticity and that this is limited to local modulations of spontaneous activity. Whether corticofugal feedback is required to initiate this plasticity in the early times of exposure will require further investigation. Recently, Slee and David[68] reported increases in spontaneous activity in the inferior colliculus that resulted in suppression of responses to the target sound during an auditory detection task. Differences in excitability can be attributed to changes in interactions within the local circuit. In the predictable group, we observed changes in excitation/inhibition ratios at the presynaptic level that had no parallel at the postsynaptic level. Together, this might reflect the implementation of a switch that can be either turned on or off depending on, for example, the presence of a global signal in the form of a neuromodulator or brain state[69, 70]. Indeed, a frequency-specific decrease in spontaneous activity in the predictable group resulted in an increase in SNR( evoked/spontaneous activity). SNRs have been studied in the context of speech saliency in noisy backgrounds[71–73] and have been hypothesized to contribute to compromised sensory gating in neuropsychiatric diseases, highlighting their importance for auditory processing[74]. Recordings were performed in anaesthetized animals, and although anesthesia does not prevent the expression of preattentive mechanisms, the exact implementation of the proposed switch might be different in the behaving animal[75, 76]. In both exposed groups, we observed a surprising shift in suprathreshold tonotopy with respect to the control group. This was reflected in a homogeneous shift in BFs across all depths measured. This shift was significantly larger in the predictable group than in the random group. While reinforcement-driven plasticity is characterized by locally measured shifts toward a conditioned frequency in both inferior colliculus and AC[77, 78], spatially broad frequency shifts cannot always be measured. In the one case in which this was done[64], the shift was also found to extend beyond the directly activated frequency band. Whether the inferior colliculus uses the BF shift as a coding mechanism or this is rather a byproduct of other plastic changes will require further investigation. In fact, BF might not be a very reliable coding variable[79, 80]. Measurements such as structural tuning, in which simultaneous responses across a widespread neuronal population are measured, might better represent the information that the brain is using at any given point in time. Differences in sensory filtering at the level of the inferior colliculus are likely to influence how information is conveyed downstream to thalamus and cortex. Depending on whether the change impinges primarily on the excitatory or inhibitory ascending input into the thalamus, the overall effect might be either to enhance or suppress selective responses. The collicular inhibitory input into the thalamus acts monosynaptically on thalamocortical projecting neurons[81], potentially regulating the magnitude and timing of cortical activity and thus playing a crucial role in sensory gating. We did not find obvious changes in excitability or frequency representation at the cortical level after predictable sound exposure. In the auditory system, which processes a constant input of stimuli arising from all directions, preselection of to-be-attended stimuli might happen at the level of subcortical structures. In other sensory systems, filtering of stimuli might involve different circuit mechanisms[82, 83]. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the inferior colliculus, a subcortical structure, plays a significant role in the detection of statistical regularities that arise from temporally sparse interactions with a naturalistic environment. The effect this learning had on subsequent behavior suggests that the observed changes in coding modulate the filtering of the exposed sounds to control behavioral outcomes. Our study places the inferior colliculus as a key player in the processing of context–sound associations, which are of great relevance in sound gating. This role might be the basis for the link between the inferior colliculus and autism, in which patients exhibit alterations in sensory gating[84–86]. The finding that neuronal responses are sensitive to the context in which sounds appear suggests that the inferior colliculus might integrate stimuli across a parameter space that goes beyond the auditory domain. Thus, the inferior colliculus could be acting as an early multimodal warning system.","answer":"Some things are learned simply because they are there and not because they are relevant at that moment in time .

These inductive biases can take many forms, including domain knowledge and pretuned hyper-parameters. In general, there is a trade-off between generality and performance when algorithms use such biases. Stronger biases can lead to faster learning, but weaker biases can potentially lead to more general algorithms. This trade-off is important because inductive biases are not free; substantial effort may be required to obtain relevant domain knowledge or to tune hyper-parameters effectively. In this paper, we re-examine several domain-specific components that bias the objective and the environmental interface of common deep reinforcement learning agents. We investigated whether the performance deteriorates when these components are replaced with adaptive solutions from the literature. In our experiments, performance sometimes decreased with the adaptive components, as one might expect when comparing to components crafted for the domain, but sometimes the adaptive components performed better. We investigated the main benefit of having fewer domain-specific components, by comparing the learning performance of the two systems on a different set of continuous control problems, without additional tuning of either system. As hypothesized, the system with adaptive components performed better on many of the new tasks.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is an evaluation platform that poses the challenge of building AI agents with general competency across dozens of Atari 2600 games.

There are many datasets readily available for these tasks in English. However, evaluating distributed representation in languages that do not have such resources (e.g., Japanese) is difficult. Therefore, as a first step toward evaluating distributed representations in Japanese, we constructed a Japanese word similarity dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first resource that can be used to evaluate distributed representations in Japanese. Moreover, our dataset contains various parts of speech and includes rare words in addition to common words.IntroductionTraditionally, a word is represented as a sparse vector indicating the word itself (one-hot vector) or the context of the word (distributional vector). However, both the one-hot notation and distributional notation suffer from data sparseness since dimensions of the word vector do not interact with each other. Distributed word representation addresses the data sparseness problem by constructing a dense vector of a fixed length, wherein contexts are shared (or distributed) across dimensions. Distributed word representation is known to improve the performance of many NLP applications such as machine translation BIBREF0 and sentiment analysis BIBREF1 to name a few. The task to learn a distributed representation is called representation learning.However, evaluating the quality of learned distributed word representation itself is not straightforward. In language modeling, perplexity or cross-entropy is widely accepted as a de facto standard for intrinsic evaluation. In contrast, distributed word representations include the additive (or compositional) property of the vectors, which cannot be assessed by perplexity. Moreover, perplexity makes little use of infrequent words; thus, it is not appropriate for evaluating distributed presentations that try to represent them.Therefore, a word similarity task and/or a word analogy task are generally used to evaluate distributed word representations in the NLP literature. The former judges whether distributed word representations improve modeling contexts, and the latter estimates how well the learned representations achieve the additive property. However, such resources other than for English (e.g., Japanese) seldom exist. In addition, most of these datasets comprise high-frequency nouns so that they tend not to include other parts of speech. Hence, previous data fail to evaluate word representations of other parts of speech, including content words such as verbs and adjectives.To address the problem of the lack of a dataset for evaluating Japanese distributed word representations, we propose to build a Japanese dataset for the word similarity task.The main contributions of our work are as follows:Related WorkIn general, distributed word representations are evaluated using a word similarity task. For instance, WordSim353 2002:PSC:503104.503110, MC BIBREF2 , RG BIBREF3 , and SCWS Huang:2012:IWR:2390524.2390645 have been used to evaluate word similarities in English. Moreover, baker-reichart-korhonen:2014:EMNLP2014 built a verb similarity dataset (VSD) based on WordSim353 because there was no dataset of verbs in the word-similarity task. Recently, SimVerb-3500 was introduced to evaluate human understanding of verb meaning Gerz:2016:EMNLP. It provides human ratings for the similarity of 3,500 verb pairs so that it enables robust evaluation of distributed representation for verbs. However, most of these datasets include English words only. There has been no Japanese dataset for the word-similarity task.Apart from English, WordSim353 and SimLex-999 Hill:2015:CL have been translated and rescored in other languages: German, Italian and Russian Leviant:2015:arXiv. SimLex-999 has also been translated and rescored in Hebrew and Croatian Mrksic:2017:TACL. SimLex-999 explicitly targets at similarity rather than relatedness and includes adjective, noun and verb pairs. However, this dataset contains only frequent words.In addition, the distributed representation of words is generally learned using only word-level information. Consequently, the distributed representation for low-frequency words and unknown words cannot be learned well with conventional models. However, low-frequency words and unknown words are often comprise high-frequency morphemes (e.g., unkingly INLINEFORM0 un + king + ly). Some previous studies take advantage of the morphological information to provide a suitable representation for low-frequency words and unknown words BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . Morphological information is particularly important for Japanese since Japanese is an agglutinative language.Construction of a Japanese Word Similarity DatasetWhat makes a pair of words similar? Most of the previous datasets do not concretely define the similarity of word pairs. The difference in the similarity of word pairs originates from each annotator's mind, resulting in different scales of a word. Thus, we propose to use an example-based approach (Table TABREF9 ) to control the variance of the similarity ratings. We remove the context of word when we extracted the word. So, we consider that an ambiguous word has high variance of the similarity, but we can get low variance of the similarity when the word is monosemous.For this study, we constructed a Japanese word similarity dataset. We followed the procedure used to construct the Stanford Rare Word Similarity Dataset (RW) Luong-etal:conll13:morpho.We extracted Japanese word pairs from the Evaluation Dataset of Japanese Lexical Simplification kodaira. It targeted content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). It included 10 contexts about target words annotated with their lexical substitutions and rankings. Figure FIGREF1 shows an example of the dataset. A word in square brackets in the text is represented as a target word of simplification. A target word is not only recorded in the lemma form but also in the conjugated form. We built a Japanese similarity dataset from this dataset using the following procedure.Comparison to Other DatasetsTable TABREF17 shows how several resources vary. WordSim353 comprises high-frequency words and so the variance tends to be low. In contrast, RW includes low-frequency words, unknown words, and complex words composed of several morphemes; thus, the variance is large. VSD has many polysemous words, which increase the variance. Despite the fact that our dataset, similar to the VSD and RW datasets, contains low-frequency and ambiguous words, its variance is 3.00. The variance level is low compared with the other corpora. We considered that the examples of the similarity in the task request reduced the variance level.We did not expect SCWS to have the largest variance in the datasets shown in Table TABREF17 because it gave the context to annotators during annotation. At the beginning, we thought the context would serve to remove the ambiguity and clarify the meaning of word; however after looking into the dataset, we determined that the construction procedure used several extraordinary annotators. It is crucial to filter insincere annotators and provide straightforward instructions to improve the quality of the similarity annotation like we did.To gain better similarity, each dataset should utilize the reliability score to exclude extraordinary annotators. For example, for SCWS, an annotator rating the similarity of pair of “CD” and “aglow” assigned a rating of 10. We assumed it was a typo or misunderstanding regarding the words. To address this problem, such an annotation should be removed before calculating the true similarity. All the datasets except for RW simply calculated the average of the similarity, but datasets created using crowdsourcing should consider the reliability of the annotator.AnalysisWe present examples of a pair with high variance of similarity as shown below:(e.g., a pairing of “fastUTF8min（速い）” and “earlyUTF8min（早い）”.)Although they are similar in meaning with respect to the time, they have nothing in common with respect to speed; Annotator A assigned a rating of 10, but Annotator B assigned a rating of 1.Another example, the pairing of “be eagerUTF8min（懇願する）” and “requestUTF8min（頼む）”. Even though the act indicated by the two verbs is the same, there are some cases where they express different degrees of feeling. Compared with “request”, “eager” indicates a stronger feeling. There were two annotators who emphasized the similarity of the act itself rather than the different degrees of feeling, and vice versa. In this case, Annotator A assigned a rating of 9, but Annotator B assigned a rating of 2.Although it was necessary to distinguish similarity and semantic relatedness BIBREF7 and we asked annotators to rate the pairs based on semantic similarity, it was not straightforward to put paraphrase candidates onto a single scale considering all the attributes of the words. This limitation might be relaxed if we would ask annotators to refer to a thesaurus or an ontology such as Japanese Lexicon GoiTaikei:1997.(e.g., a pairing of “sloganUTF8min（スローガン）” and “sloganUTF8min（標語）”.)In Japanese, we can write a word using hiragana, katakana, or kanji characters; however because hiragana and katakana represent only the pronunciation of a word, annotators might think of different words. In this case, Annotator A assigned a rating of 8, but Annotator B assigned a rating of 0. Similarly, we confirmed the same thing in other parts of speech. Especially, nouns can have several word pairs with different spellings, which results in their IAA became too low compared to other parts of speech.(e.g., a pairing of “oftenUTF8min（しばしば）” and “frequentlyUTF8min（しきりに）”.)We confirmed that the variance becomes larger among adverbs expressing frequency. This is due to the difference in the frequency of words that annotators imagines. In this case, Annotator A assigned a rating of 9, but Annotator B assigned a rating of 0. Similarly, we confirmed the same thing among adverbs expressing time.ConclusionIn this study, we constructed the first Japanese word similarity dataset. It contains various parts of speech and includes rare words in addition to common words. Crowdsourced annotators assigned similarity to word pairs during the word similarity task. We gave examples of similarity in the task request sent to annotators, so that we reduced the variance of each word pair. However, we did not restrict the attributes of words, such as the level of feeling, during annotation. Error analysis revealed that the notion of similarity should be carefully defined when constructing a similarity dataset.As a future work, we plan to construct a word analogy dataset in Japanese by translating an English dataset to Japanese. We hope that a Japanese database will facilitate research in Japanese distributed representations.Language Resource Referenceslrec lrec2018Figure 1: An example of the dataset from a previous study (Kodaira et al., 2016).Table 1: The number of parts of speech classified into each frequency.Table 2: Example of the degree of similarity when we requested annotation at Lancers.Table 3: Inter-annotator agreements of each POS.Table 4: Examples of verb pairs in our dataset.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  In this paper we present a hierarchical routing protocol in a large wireless, mobile network such as found in the automated battlefield or in extensive disaster recovery operations. Conventional routing does not scale well to network size. Likewise, conventional hierarchical routing cannot handle mobility efficiently. We propose a novel soft state wireless hierarchical routing protocol-Hierarchical State Routing (HSR). We distinguish between the \\"physical\\" routing hierarchy (dictated by geographical relationships between nodes) and \\"logical\\" hierarchy of subnets in which the members move as a group (e.g., company, brigade, battalion in the battlefield). HSR keeps track of logical subnet movements using home agent concepts akin to Mobile IP. A group mobility model is introduced and the performance of the HSR is evaluated through a detailed wireless simulation model.Literature Review:","answer":"In MMWN routing protocol BIB001 the network is maintained using a clustering hierarchy. Each cluster has two types of mobile nodes: switches and endpoints. Each cluster also has location manager (LM), which performs the location management for each cluster (see Fig. 1 ). All information in MMWN is stored in a dynamically distributed database. The advantage of MMWN is that only LMs perform location updating and location finding, which means that routing overhead is significantly reduced when compared to the traditional table driven algorithms (such as DSDV and WRP). However, location management is closely related to the hierarchical structure of the network, making the location finding and updating very complex. This is because in the location finding and updating process, messages have to travel through the hierarchical tree of the LMs. Also the changes in the hierarchical cluster membership of LMs will also affect the hierarchical management tree and introduce a complex consistency management. This feature introduces implementation problems, which are difficult to overcome BIB002 ."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

(1R)-Normetanephrine is the natural stereoisomeric substrate for sulfotransferase 1A3 (SULT1A3)-catalyzed sulfonation. Nothing appears known on the enantioselectivity of the reaction despite its potential significance in the metabolism of adrenergic amines and in clinical biochemistry. We confronted the kinetic parameters of the sulfoconjugation of synthetic (1R)-normetanephrine and (1S)-normetanephrine by recombinant human SULT1A3 to a docking model of each normetanephrine enantiomer with SULT1A3 and the 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate cofactor on the basis of molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the stability of the complexes. The K(M), V(max), and k(cat) values for the sulfonation of (1R)-normetanephrine, (1S)-normetanephrine, and racemic normetanephrine were similar. In silico models were consistent with these findings as they showed that the binding modes of the two enantiomers were almost identical.

It has been debated whether pediatric EoE and adult EoE represent different disease entities. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the blood eosinophil molecular pattern of children with EoE is (i) distinct from that of healthy children; and (ii) different from that of adults with EoE. Blood eosinophils from children and adults with EoE, and healthy controls, were analyzed with flow cytometry regarding levels of CD23, CD44, CD54, CRTH2, FOXP3, and galectin-10. Eosinophil FOXP3 and galectin-10 mRNA levels were determined by qPCR. The data were analyzed using a multivariate method of pattern recognition. An eosinophil molecular pattern capable of distinguishing children with EoE from control children was identified. A smaller fraction of eosinophils from children with EoE expressed CD44 and a larger fraction expressed CRTH2 than the controls. Eosinophils from children with EoE also had higher levels of galectin-10 mRNA and lower levels of FOXP3 mRNA. The eosinophils from children with EoE had lower levels of surface CD54 and of FOXP3 mRNA compared with the eosinophils from the adult patients. A key finding was the detection in healthy individuals of age-related differences in the levels of several eosinophil markers. Children with EoE can be distinguished from healthy children based on the molecular patterns of their blood eosinophils. Age-related physiologic differences in eosinophil molecular patterns may partly explain the different blood eosinophil phenotypes in children vs adults with EoE.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"galectin-10\\", \\"FOXP3\\", \\"eosinophil\\", \\"CD54\\", \\"Eosinophils\\", \\"eosinophils\\", \\"CRTH2\\", \\"Blood eosinophils\\", \\"blood eosinophils\\", \\"Eosinophil FOXP3\\", \\"blood eosinophil\\", \\"CD44\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"pattern recognition\\", \\"expressed\\", \\"Eosinophilic esophagitis\\", \\"disease\\", \\"eosinophilic esophagitis\\", \\"EoE\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"galectin-10\\", \\"CD54\\", \\"mRNA\\", \\"CRTH2\\", \\"CD23\\", \\"CD44\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"healthy children\\", \\"detection\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"markers\\", \\"flow cytometry\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"healthy individuals\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"analyzed\\", \\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Constraint-based modeling enables the analysis of the phenotypic landscape of these organisms, predicting the response to genetic and environmental perturbations. However, since constraint-based models can only describe the metabolic phenotype at the reaction level, understanding the mechanistic link between genotype and phenotype is still hampered by the complexity of gene-protein-reaction associations. We implement a model transformation that enables constraint-based methods to be applied at the gene level by explicitly accounting for the individual fluxes of enzymes( and subunits) encoded by each gene. We show how this can be applied to different kinds of constraint-based analysis: flux distribution prediction, gene essentiality analysis, random flux sampling, elementary mode analysis, transcriptomics data integration, and rational strain design. In each case we demonstrate how this approach can lead to improved phenotype predictions and a deeper understanding of the genotype-to-phenotype link. In particular, we show that a large fraction of reaction-based designs obtained by current strain design methods are not actually feasible, and show how our approach allows using the same methods to obtain feasible gene-based designs. We also show, by extensive comparison with experimental 13C-flux data, how simple reformulations of different simulation methods with gene-wise objective functions result in improved prediction accuracy. The model transformation proposed in this work enables existing constraint-based methods to be used at the gene level without modification. This automatically leverages phenotype analysis from reaction to gene level, improving the biological insight that can be obtained from genome-scale models.Introduction:The advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques and genome annotation methods have enabled the construction of genome-scale models for hundreds of organisms[1]. At the same time, the constraint-based framework, with its wide variety of methods, has become a widely used tool to perform in silico experiments and predict cellular responses to different kinds of genetic and environmental perturbations[2, 3]. Studies using constraint-based models cover a wide range of applications from biomedical research to industrial biotechnology, including the study of cancer metabolism[4], drug target discovery for cancer cell lines[5] and pathogenic microorganisms[6], and the design of microbial cell factories[7] and synthetic microbial communities[8]. Understanding the complex relation between the genotype and phenotype of an organism is a fundamental part of systems biology research. Unlike statistical approaches such as genome-wide association studies( GWAS)[9], genome-scale reconstructions provide a mechanistic link between genotype and phenotype. The first component of this link is a list of gene-protein-reaction( GPR) associations that determines the set of metabolic reactions encoded in the genome. Another component is the stoichiometric matrix representing these reactions. This matrix is at the core of every constraint-based method, allowing the computation of the metabolic phenotype as described by metabolic fluxes at steady-state. Navigating back and forth in the space of genotype-to-phenotype relationships is hampered by the complex association between genes, enzymes and reactions. From the perspective of the central dogma of biology the simplest genetic mechanism is: one gene—one protein—one function. However, most GPR associations in a genome-scale metabolic network are quite complex due to the presence of enzyme complexes( multiple genes—one protein), isozymes( multiple proteins—one function) and promiscuous enzymes( one protein—multiple functions). Since most constraint-based methods do not explicitly account for GPR associations, they can only provide analysis at the reaction level. For instance, simulating a steady-state flux distribution predicts the rates of all metabolic reactions for a given phenotypic state, but fails to elucidate the contribution of individual genes/enzymes to that phenotype. GPR associations, typically implemented as Boolean rules, can be used to interpret the results of constraint-based analysis in an ad-hoc fashion. This is the case in rational strain design, where optimization procedures are used to find optimal interventions to maximize the production of a given compound[7, 10]. With a few exceptions[11–13], such methods can only compute reaction-based modifications that must be translated to gene-level modifications a posteriori, without guarantee that the optimality of the predicted phenotype is preserved. Undesired side-effects may arise if any of the target reactions involve promiscuous enzymes. In this work, we present a model transformation that generates a stoichiometric representation of GPR associations that can be directly integrated into the stoichiometric matrix. We show that the results obtained with the transformed model are consistent with those obtained from reaction-level models, and highlight the advantages of performing different kinds of analysis at the gene level. We also propose new variants of existing methods that take advantage of this representation to formulate gene-wise objective functions and test their predictive ability using experimental datasets.Discussion:The integration of GPRs directly into the stoichiometric matrix enables bidirectional analysis between the gene and reaction levels. In one direction it is possible to observe the impact of gene perturbations on reaction fluxes. In the other direction one can perturb the environmental conditions and observe the required adaptations at the gene level. The complexity of GPR associations and their evolution has been recently analysed considering the role of environmental adaptation in driving enzyme specificity[59]. A recent reconstruction of the underground metabolism of E. coli revealed an even larger number of metabolic reactions available in the cell as a result of enzymatic side activities, playing an important role in the fitness landscape of the organism[60]. Our framework provides a mechanistic link between genotype and phenotype and should facilitate the development of new methods to integrate multi-omics datasets into genome-scale models, as well as methods to integrate metabolism with other biological processes. In this work, we explored the reformulation of previously published simulation methods with gene-wise constraints. It would be interesting to explore other suitable applications, such as the formulation of simulation methods that account for enzyme production costs[61, 62]. A new generation of genome-scale models and simulation methods is on the rise[63]. This includes genome-scale models that account for gene expression and protein production[18, 64, 65], models that account for protein structure[66], and methods that predict the effect of genetic variation in protein function[67]. While such detailed models are not readily available for every organism, our method provides a suitable approach to leverage existing models to a new level. All the source code, models, and generated data are publicly available in the following repository: https://github. com/cdanielmachado/GPRTransform.","answer":"Genome-scale models of metabolism enable the exploration of the phenotypic landscape of an organism .

It can thus informally be thought of as the pushforward distribution for “sampling” representations in the latent space. We characterise the decomposition of latent spaces in vaes to be the fulfilment of two factors (as shown in Figure 1):a.An “appropriate” level of overlap in the latent space—ensuring that the range of latent values capable of encoding a particular datapoint is neither too small, nor too large.This is, in general, dictated by the level of stochasticity in the encoder: the noisier the encoding process is, the higher the number of datapoints which can plausibly give rise to a particular encoding.b.The aggregate encoding q_{{phi}}left(bm{z}right) matching the prior pleft(bm{z}right), where the latter expresses the desired dependency structure between latents. We posit a generalisation of disentanglement in vaes—decomposing their latent representations—that can help avoid such pitfalls.We characterise decomposition in vaes as the fulfilment of two factors:a) the latent encodings of data having an appropriate level of overlap, andb) the aggregate encoding of data conforming to a desired structure, represented through the prior.We emphasize that neither of these factors is sufficient in isolation: withoutan appropriate level of overlap, encodings can degrade to a lookup tablewhere the latents convey little information about data, and without the aggregate encoding of data following a desired structure, the encodings do not decompose as desired.Question: What is the aim of using VAEs ?","answer":"The aim to use VAEs is to explore their decomposition capability to fulfill latent encoding of overlapping data and aggregate encoding of this data conforming to desired structure.

However, two bottlenecks constrain efforts towards fast imaging of large populations. First, the resulting large video data is challenging to analyze. Second, there is an explicit tradeoff between imaging speed, signal-to-noise, and field of view: with current recording technology we cannot image very large neuronal populations with simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we describe multi-scale approaches for alleviating both of these bottlenecks. First, we show that spatial and temporal decimation techniques based on simple local averaging provide order-of-magnitude speedups in spatiotemporally demixing calcium video data into estimates of single-cell neural activity. Second, once the shapes of individual neurons have been identified at fine scale( e. g., after an initial phase of conventional imaging with standard temporal and spatial resolution), we find that the spatial/temporal resolution tradeoff shifts dramatically: after demixing we can accurately recover denoised fluorescence traces and deconvolved neural activity of each individual neuron from coarse scale data that has been spatially decimated by an order of magnitude. This offers a cheap method for compressing this large video data, and also implies that it is possible to either speed up imaging significantly, or to “zoom out” by a corresponding factor to image order-of-magnitude larger neuronal populations with minimal loss in accuracy or temporal resolution.Introduction:A major goal of neuroscience is to understand interactions within large populations of neurons, including their network dynamics and emergent behavior. This ideally requires the observation of neural activity over large volumes. Recently, light-sheet microscopy and genetically encoded indicators have enabled unprecedented whole-brain imaging of tens of thousands of neurons at cellular resolution[1]. However, light-sheet microscopy generally suffers from slow volumetric speeds( e. g.[2], but see also[3, 4]) and is usually applied to small and transparent brains. In scattering brains, current technologies with single-neuron resolution are usually based on slow, serially-scanned two-photon( 2P) imaging methods that can only sample from O( 102 − 103) neurons simultaneously with adequate temporal resolution[5]. Recent advances have enabled faster light-sheet imaging in cortex[6] and fast volumetric 2P imaging[7], but we must still contend with critical trade-offs between temporal and spatial resolution—and the need for even faster imaging of even larger neural populations. Another critical challenge is the sheer amount of data generated by these large-scale imaging methods. A crucial step for further neural analysis involves a transition from voxel-space to neuron-source space: i. e., we must detect the neurons and extract and demix each neuron’s temporal activity from the video. Simple methods such as averaging voxels over distinct regions of interest( ROIs) are fast, but more statistically-principled methods based on constrained non-negative matrix factorization( CNMF) better conserve information, yield higher signal-to-noise ratio, recover more neurons, and enable the demixing of spatially overlapping neurons[8]. The methods described in[8] were not optimized for very large datasets, but NMF is a key machine learning primitive that has enjoyed more than a decade of intensive algorithmic optimization[9–12] that we can exploit here to scale the CNMF approach. We find that a very simple idea leads to order-of-magnitude speedups: by decimating the data( i. e., decreasing the resolution of the data by simple local averaging[13]), we can obtain much faster algorithms with minimal loss of accuracy. Decimation ideas do not just lead to faster computational image processing, but also offer prescriptions for faster image acquisition over larger fields of view( FOV), and for observing larger neural populations. Specifically, we propose the following two-phase combined image acquisition/analysis approach. In the first phase, we use conventional imaging methods to obtain estimates of the visible neuronal locations and shapes. After this cell-identification phase is complete we switch to low-spatial-resolution imaging, which in the case of camera-based imaging simply corresponds to “zooming out” on the image, i. e., expanding the spatial size of each voxel. This has the benefit of projecting a larger FOV onto the same number of voxels; alternatively, if the number of voxels recorded per second is a limiting factor, then recording fewer( larger) voxels per frame implies that we can image at higher frame-rates. We are thus effectively trading off spatial resolution for temporal resolution; if we cut the spatial resolution too much we may no longer be able to clearly identify or resolve single cells by eye in the obtained images. However, we show that, given the high-spatial-resolution information obtained in the first imaging phase, the demixing stage of CNMF can recover the temporal signals of interest even from images that have undergone radical spatial decimation( an order of magnitude or more). In other words, CNMF significantly shifts the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution, enabling us to image larger neuronal populations at higher temporal resolution. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first describe how temporal and spatial decimation( along with several other improvements) can be used within the CNMF algorithm to gain order-of-magnitude speed-ups in calcium imaging video processing. Next we investigate how decimation can enable faster imaging of larger populations for light-sheet and 2P imaging. We show the importance of the initial cell identification phase, quantitatively illustrate how CNMF changes the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution, and discuss how spatially decimated imaging followed by demixing can be interpreted as a simple compression and decoding scheme. We show that good estimates of the neural shapes can be obtained on a small batch of standard-resolution data, corresponding to a short cell-identification imaging phase. Finally we demonstrate that interleaved imaging that translates the pixels by subpixel shifts on each frame further improves the fidelity of the recovered neural time series.Discussion:The basic message of this paper is that standard approaches for imaging calcium responses in large neuronal population—which have historically been optimized so that humans can clearly see cells blink in the resulting video—lead to highly redundant data, and we can exploit this redundancy in several ways. In the first part of the paper, we saw that we can decimate standard calcium imaging video data drastically, to obtain order-of-magnitude speedups in processing time with no loss( and in some cases even some gain) in accuracy of the recovered signals. In the second part of the paper, we saw that, once the cell shapes and locations are identified, we can drastically reduce the spatial resolution of the recording( losing the ability to cleanly identify cells by eye in the resulting heavily-pixelated movies) but still faithfully recover the neural activity of interest. This in turn leads naturally to a proposed two-phase imaging approach( first, identify cell shapes and locations at standard resolution; then image at much lower spatial resolution) that can be seen as an effort to reduce the redundancy of the resulting video data. We anticipate a number of applications of the results presented here. Regarding the first part of the paper: faster computational processing times are always welcome, of course, but more fundamentally, the faster algorithms developed here open the door towards guided experimental design, in which experimenters can obtain images, process the data quickly, and immediately use this to guide the next experiment. With more effort this closed-loop approach can potentially be implemented in real-time, whether for improving optical brain-machine interfaces[26], or enabling closed-loop optogenetic control of neuronal population dynamics[27, 28]. Highly redundant data streams are by definition highly compressible. The results shown in S1 and S2 Videos illustrate clearly that spatially-decimated image acquisition( the second phase of our two-phase imaging approach) can be seen as a computationally trivial low-loss compression scheme. Again, regarding applications of this compression viewpoint: reductions in memory usage are always welcome—but more fundamentally, this type of compression could for example help enable wireless applications in which bandwidth and power-budget limitations are currently a significant bottleneck[21, 29–31]. Regarding applications of the proposed two-phase imaging approach: we can potentially use this approach to image either more cells, or image cells faster, or some combination of both. In most of the paper we have emphasized the first case, in which we ‘zoom out’ to image larger populations at standard temporal resolution. However, a number of applications require higher temporal resolution. One exciting example is the larval zebrafish, where it is already possible to image the whole brain, but light-sheet whole-brain volumetric imaging rates are low[1] and current efforts are focused on faster acquisition[3, 4, 32]. Higher temporal resolution is also needed for circuit connectivity inference[33, 34] or the real-time closed-loop applications discussed above, where we need to detect changes in activity as quickly as possible. Finally, genetically encoded voltage indicators[35] may soon enable imaging of neuronal populations with single-cell, millisecond-scale resolution; these indicators are still undergoing intense development[36–39] but when more mature the resulting signals will be much faster than currently-employed calcium indicators and significantly higher temporal resolution will be required to capture these signals. A number of previous papers can be interpreted in terms of reducing the redundancy of the output image data. Our work can be seen as one example of the general theme of increasing the ratio N/D, with N denoting the number of imaged neurons and D the number of observations per timestep, with demixing algorithms used post hoc to separate the overlapping contributions of each cell to each observed pixel. In a compressed sensing framework,[40] proposed to image randomized projections of the spatial calcium concentration at each timestep, instead of measuring the concentration at individual locations. In[41],[42], and[43], information is integrated primarily across depth, either by creating multiple foci, axially extended point spread functions( PSFs), or both, respectively. In contrast to these methods,[7] instead scanned an enlarged near-isotropic PSF, generated with temporal focusing, to quickly interrogate cells in a single plane at low spatial resolution. This approach is closest in spirit to the one-phase spatially decimated imaging approach analyzed in Figs 6–8, and could potentially be combined with our two-phase approach to achieve further speed/accuracy gains. We expect that different strategies for increasing N/D will have different advantages in different situations. One advantage of the approach developed here is its apparent simplicity—at least at a conceptual level, we just need to ‘zoom out’ without the need for radically new imaging hardware. Throughout this work we have remained deliberately agnostic regarding the physical implementation of the spatial decimation; all of the decimation results presented here were based on software decimation after acquisition of standard-resolution images. Thus to close we turn now to a discussion of potential experimental caveats. One critical assumption in our simulations is that the total recorded photon flux per frame is the same for each decimation level l. This is a reasonable assumption for light-sheet imaging( assuming we are not limited by laser power or by the peak or average light power on the sample): in this case, increasing the effective pixel size could be achieved easily, either isotropically with a telescope, or anisotropically, with a cylindrical lens or anamorphic prism pair. However, faster whole-brain light-sheet imaging requires faster shifts of the light sheet and imaged focal plane. This challenge can be solved by extended depth-of-field( EDoF) pupil encoding[3, 4, 32], remote focusing[44], or with an electrically tunable lens[45]. Higher light-sheet imaging rates can also be obtained with swept confocally-aligned planar excitation( SCAPE) microscopy[6]. In short, we believe our proposed two-phase imaging approach fits well with a variety of proven light sheet methods; for similar reasons, the two-phase approach would also fit well with light-field imaging methods[46–48]. In traditional two-photon imaging the situation is more complicated. The image is created by serially sweeping a small, diffraction limited point across the sample. Along the “fast” axis, the beam moves continuously, and the integrated signal across a line is constant, regardless of detection pixelation—the signal is simply partitioned into more or fewer bins. Along the “slow” axis, however, the galvonometers are moved in discrete steps, and low pixel numbers generally mean that portions of the image are not scanned, increasing frame speed, but concomitantly these ‘missed’ areas generate no signal. This consequently reduces the total number of photons collected. Thus to achieve the same photon flux over the larger( lower spatially sampled) pixels, while maintaining the same SNR, we require an enlarged PSF, which maps a larger sampled volume to each pixel. This approach was recently demonstrated to be effective in[7]; alternative strategies for enlarging the PSF could involve fixed diffractive optical elements[49] or spatial light modulator( SLM) systems[50]. Programmable phase-only SLMs offer the additional benefit of being able to dynamically change the size and shape of the excitation PSF, even between frames, which may help disambiguate closely spaced sources, and effectively control the recorded source sparsity. In any instantiation, maximal imaging speed will be limited by the time required to collect enough photons for adequate SNR, which in turn is limited by photophysics and the light tolerance of the sample. In future work we plan to pursue both light-sheet and 2P implementations of the proposed two-phase imaging approach, to quantify the gains in speed and FOV size that can be realized in practice. We also expect techniques for denoising, demixing, and deconvolution of calcium imaging video to continue to improve in the near future, as more accurate nonlinear, non-Gaussian models for calcium signals and noise are developed; as new demixing methods become available, we can easily swap these methods in in place of the CNMF approach used here. We expect that the basic points about temporal and spatial decimation discussed in this paper will remain valid even as newer and better demixing algorithms become available.","answer":"The voxel rate of imaging systems ultimately sets the limit on the speed of data acquisition .

Spiders are a principal arthropod group that preys on numerous pests of vegetables and other crops. In this study, we determined the effects of the two most commonly used insecticides, spinosad and λ-cyhalothrin, on diversity of spiders on cabbage in south Texas. In two seasons (fall 2008 and spring 2009), we collected a total of 588 spiders belonging to 53 species in 11 families from spinosad and λ-cyhalothrin-treated cabbages and the untreated control plants. A great majority of spiders were collected from the pitfall traps (554) where only a few (34) were collected from the blower/vacuum sampling. In the insecticide-treated plots, there were significantly fewer spider individuals, species and families than in untreated fields. Spinosad had significantly less effect on spiders in total individuals, number of species and families than λ-cyhalothrin. The effects of the two insecticides were further demonstrated by the Shannon-Weiner index (H') and the hierarchical richness index (HRI). Spider diversity in the spinosad-treated plots were not significantly different from that in the untreated fields but were greater than those in λ-cyhalothrin-treated plots in both seasons when measured by H' values. In contrast, the H' values of spider's diversity in the λ-cyhalothrin-treated plots were significantly lower than spinosad-treated and untreated plots. High values of HRI for spider richness in the spinosad-treated plots suggested that spinosad had less effect on spiders than λ-cyhalothrin. We concluded that spinosad was more compatible with spiders on cabbage compared to λ-cyhalothrin and that this information should be used when developing insecticide resistance management strategies.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"spinosad\\", \\"Spinosad\\", \\"u03bb-cyhalothrin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

In this paper we propose to bridge this gap by generating paraphrases of the input question with the goal that at least one of them will be correctly mapped to a knowledge-base query. We introduce a novel grammar model for paraphrase generation that does not require any sentence-aligned paraphrase corpus. Our key idea is to leverage the flexibility and scalability of latent-variable probabilistic context-free grammars to sample paraphrases. We do an extrinsic evaluation of our paraphrases by plugging them into a semantic parser for Freebase. Our evaluation experiments on the WebQuestions benchmark dataset show that the performance of the semantic parser significantly improves over strong baselines.IntroductionSemantic parsers map sentences onto logical forms that can be used to query databases BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , instruct robots BIBREF2 , extract information BIBREF3 , or describe visual scenes BIBREF4 . In this paper we consider the problem of semantically parsing questions into Freebase logical forms for the goal of question answering. Current systems accomplish this by learning task-specific grammars BIBREF5 , strongly-typed CCG grammars BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , or neural networks without requiring any grammar BIBREF8 . These methods are sensitive to the words used in a question and their word order, making them vulnerable to unseen words and phrases. Furthermore, mismatch between natural language and Freebase makes the problem even harder. For example, Freebase expresses the fact that “Czech is the official language of Czech Republic” (encoded as a graph), whereas to answer a question like “What do people in Czech Republic speak?” one should infer people in Czech Republic refers to Czech Republic and What refers to the language and speak refers to the predicate official language.We address the above problems by using paraphrases of the original question. Paraphrasing has shown to be promising for semantic parsing BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . We propose a novel framework for paraphrasing using latent-variable PCFGs (L-PCFGs). Earlier approaches to paraphrasing used phrase-based machine translation for text-based QA BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , or hand annotated grammars for KB-based QA BIBREF10 . We find that phrase-based statistical machine translation (MT) approaches mainly produce lexical paraphrases without much syntactic diversity, whereas our grammar-based approach is capable of producing both lexically and syntactically diverse paraphrases. Unlike MT based approaches, our system does not require aligned parallel paraphrase corpora. In addition we do not require hand annotated grammars for paraphrase generation but instead learn the grammar directly from a large scale question corpus.The main contributions of this paper are two fold. First, we present an algorithm (§ \\"Paraphrase Generation Using Grammars\\" ) to generate paraphrases using latent-variable PCFGs. We use the spectral method of narayan-15 to estimate L-PCFGs on a large scale question treebank. Our grammar model leads to a robust and an efficient system for paraphrase generation in open-domain question answering. While CFGs have been explored for paraphrasing using bilingual parallel corpus BIBREF14 , ours is the first implementation of CFG that uses only monolingual data. Second, we show that generated paraphrases can be used to improve semantic parsing of questions into Freebase logical forms (§ \\"Semantic Parsing using Paraphrasing\\" ). We build on a strong baseline of reddylargescale2014 and show that our grammar model competes with MT baseline even without using any parallel paraphrase resources.Paraphrase Generation Using GrammarsOur paraphrase generation algorithm is based on a model in the form of an L-PCFG. L-PCFGs are PCFGs where the nonterminals are refined with latent states that provide some contextual information about each node in a given derivation. L-PCFGs have been used in various ways, most commonly for syntactic parsing BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 .In our estimation of L-PCFGs, we use the spectral method of narayan-15, instead of using EM, as has been used in the past by matsuzaki-2005 and petrov-2006. The spectral method we use enables the choice of a set of feature functions that indicate the latent states, which proves to be useful in our case. It also leads to sparse grammar estimates and compact models.The spectral method works by identifying feature functions for “inside” and “outside” trees, and then clusters them into latent states. Then it follows with a maximum likelihood estimation step, that assumes the latent states are represented by clusters obtained through the feature function clustering. For more details about these constructions, we refer the reader to cohen-13 and narayan-15.The rest of this section describes our paraphrase generation algorithm.Paraphrase ClassificationOur sampling algorithm overgenerates paraphrases which are incorrect. To improve its precision, we build a binary classifier to filter the generated paraphrases. We randomly select 100 distinct questions from the Paralex corpus and generate paraphrases using our generation algorithm with various lattice settings. We randomly select 1,000 pairs of input-sampled sentences and manually annotate them as “correct” or “incorrect” paraphrases. We train our classifier on this manually created training data. We follow madnani2012, who used MT metrics for paraphrase identification, and experiment with 8 MT metrics as features for our binary classifier. In addition, we experiment with a binary feature which checks if the sampled paraphrase preserves named entities from the input sentence. We use WEKA BIBREF32 to replicate the classifier of madnani2012 with our new feature. We tune the feature set for our classifier on the development data.Ungrounded Graphs from ParaphrasesWe use GraphParser BIBREF7 to convert paraphrases to ungrounded graphs. This conversion involves three steps: 1) parsing the paraphrase using a CCG parser to extract syntactic derivations BIBREF33 , 2) extracting logical forms from the CCG derivations BIBREF34 , and 3) converting the logical forms to an ungrounded graph. The ungrounded graph for the example question and its paraphrases are shown in Figure 3 , Figure 3 and Figure 3 , respectively.Grounded Graphs from Ungrounded GraphsThe ungrounded graphs are grounded to Freebase subgraphs by mapping entity nodes, entity-entity edges and entity type nodes in the ungrounded graph to Freebase entities, relations and types, respectively. For example, the graph in Figure 3 can be converted to a Freebase graph in Figure 3 by replacing the entity node Czech Republic with the Freebase entity CzechRepublic, the edge (speak.arg _2 , speak.in) between x and Czech Republic with the Freebase relation (location.country.official_language.2, location.country.official_language.1), the type node language with the Freebase type language.human_language, and the target node remains intact. The rest of the nodes, edges and types are grounded to null. In a similar fashion, Figure 3 can be grounded to Figure 3 , but not Figure 3 to Figure 3 . If no paraphrase is isomorphic to the target grounded grounded graph, our grounding fails.LearningWe use a linear model to map ungrounded graphs to grounded ones. The parameters of the model are learned from question-answer pairs. For example, the question What language do people in Czech Republic speak? paired with its answer lbrace textsc {CzechLanguage}rbrace  . In line with most work on question answering against Freebase, we do not rely on annotated logical forms associated with the question for training and treat the mapping of a question to its grounded graph as latent.Let q be a question, let p be a paraphrase, let u be an ungrounded graph for p , and let g be a grounded graph formed by grounding the nodes and edges of u to the knowledge base mathcal {K} (throughout we use Freebase as the knowledge base). Following reddylargescale2014, we use beam search to find the highest scoring tuple of paraphrase, ungrounded and grounded graphs (hat{p}, hat{u}, hat{g}) under the model theta in mathbb {R}^n : ({hat{p},hat{u},hat{g}}) = operatornamewithlimits{arg,max}_{(p,u,g)} theta cdot Phi (p,u,g,q,mathcal {K}),, where Phi (p, u, g, q, mathcal {K}) in mathbb {R}^n denotes the features for the tuple of paraphrase, ungrounded and grounded graphs. The feature function has access to the paraphrase, ungrounded and grounded graphs, the original question, as well as to the content of the knowledge base and the denotation |g|_mathcal {K} (the denotation of a grounded graph is defined as the set of entities or attributes reachable at its target node). See sec:details for the features employed. The model parameters are estimated with the averaged structured perceptron BIBREF35 . Given a training question-answer pair (q,mathcal {A}) , the update is: theta ^{t+1} leftarrow theta ^{t} + Phi (p^+, u^+, g^+, q,mathcal {K}) - Phi (hat{p}, hat{u}, hat{g}, q, mathcal {K}),, where ({p^+,u^+,g^+}) denotes the tuple of gold paraphrase, gold ungrounded and grounded graphs for q . Since we do not have direct access to the gold paraphrase and graphs, we instead rely on the set of oracle tuples, mathcal {O}_{mathcal {K}, mathcal {A}}(q) , as a proxy: (p^{+},u^{+},{g^{+}}) = operatornamewithlimits{arg,max}_{(p,u,g) in mathcal {O}_{mathcal {K},mathcal {A}}(q)} theta cdot Phi ({p,u,g,q,mathcal {K}}),, where mathcal {O}_{mathcal {K}, mathcal {A}}(q) is defined as the set of tuples ( p , u , g ) derivable from the question q , whose denotation |g|_mathcal {K} has minimal F_1 -loss against the gold answer mathcal {A} . We find the oracle graphs for each question a priori by performing beam-search with a very large beam.Evaluation Data and MetricWe evaluate our approach on the WebQuestions dataset BIBREF5 . WebQuestions consists of 5,810 question-answer pairs where questions represents real Google search queries. We use the standard train/test splits, with 3,778 train and 2,032 test questions. For our development experiments we tune the models on held-out data consisting of 30% training questions, while for final testing we use the complete training data. We use average precision (avg P.), average recall (avg R.) and average F _1 (avg F _1 ) proposed by berantsemantic2013 as evaluation metrics.BaselinesWe use GraphParser without paraphrases as our baseline.

Previous studies demonstrated that disrupting the ability to execute an eye movement interferes with the allocation of covert attention. One technique that prevents the execution of an eye movement involves the abduction of the eye in the orbit while presenting the stimuli outside of the effective oculomotor range (Craighero, Nascimben, & Fadiga, 2004). Although eye abduction is supposed to disrupt activation of the oculomotor program responsible for the shift of covert attention, this crucial assumption has never been tested experimentally. In the present study we used saccadic curvature to examine whether eye abduction eliminates the target-distractor competition in the oculomotor system. We experimentally reduced the ability to execute saccades by abducting the eye by 30° (monocular vision). This way the peripheral part of the temporal hemifield was located outside the oculomotor range. Participants made a vertical eye movement while on some trials a distractor was shown either inside or outside of the oculomotor range. The curvature away from distractors located outside the oculomotor range was reduced, but not completely eliminated. This confirms that eye abduction influences the activation of the oculomotor program, but points to the fact that other forms of motor planning, such as head movements are also represented in the oculomotor system. The results are in line with the idea that covert attention is an emerging property of movement planning, but is not restricted to saccade planning.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"Eye\\", \\"eye\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"saccadic\\", \\"saccades\\", \\"planning\\", \\"abduction\\", \\"covert attention\\", \\"monocular vision\\", \\"movement\\", \\"eye movement\\", \\"head movements\\", \\"saccade\\", \\"abducting\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [\\"oculomotor system\\"], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"examine\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"Participants\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"studies\\", \\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"vertical\\", \\"orbit\\", \\"inside\\", \\"peripheral part\\", \\"outside\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

Our aim was to investigate whether a causal relationship exists between HF and the development of cancer . Methods : HF was induced by inflicting large anterior myocardial infa rct ion in  APCmin mice , which are prone to developing precancerous intestinal tumors , and tumor growth was measured . In addition , to rule out hemodynamic impairment , a heterotopic heart transplantation model was used in which an infa rct ed or sham-operated heart was transplanted into a recipient mouse while the native heart was left in situ . After 6 weeks , tumor number , volume , and proliferation were quantified . C and i date secreted proteins were selected because they were previously associated both with ( colon ) tumor growth and with myocardial production in post – myocardial infa rct ion proteomic studies . Myocardial gene expression levels of these selected c and i date s were analyzed , as well as their proliferative effects on HT-29 ( colon cancer ) cells . We vali date d these c and i date s by measuring them in plasma of healthy subjects and patients with HF . Finally , we associated the relation between cardiac specific and inflammatory biomarkers and new-onset cancer in a large , prospect i ve general population cohort . Results : The presence of failing hearts , both native and heterotopically transplanted , result ed in significantly increased intestinal tumor load of 2.4-fold in APCmin mice ( all P<0.0001 ) . The severity of left ventricular dysfunction and fibrotic scar strongly correlated with tumor growth ( P=0.002 and P=0.016 , respectively ) . We identified several proteins ( including serpinA3 and A1 , fibronectin , ceruloplasmin , and paraoxonase 1 ) that were elevated in human patients with chronic HF ( n=101 ) compared with healthy subjects ( n=180 ; P<0.001 ) . Functionally , serpinA3 result ed in marked proliferation effects in human colon cancer ( HT-29 ) cells , associated with Akt-S6 phosphorylation . Finally , elevated cardiac and inflammation biomarkers in apparently healthy humans ( n=8319 ) were predictive of new-onset cancer ( n=1124 ) independently of risk factors for cancer ( age , smoking status , and body mass index ) . Conclusions : We demonstrate that the presence of HF is associated with enhanced tumor growth and that this is independent of hemodynamic impairment and could be caused by cardiac excreted factors . A diagnosis of HF may therefore be considered a risk factor for incident cancerTitle 2:Development and validation of multivariable models to predict mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failureAbstract 2:INTRODUCTION From a prospect i ve multicentre multicountry clinical trial , we developed and vali date d risk models to predict prospect i ve all-cause mortality and hospitalizations because of heart failure ( HF ) in patients with HF . METHODS AND RESULTS BIOSTAT-CHF is a research programme design ed to develop and externally vali date risk models to predict all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations . The index cohort consisted of 2516 patients with HF from 69 centres in 11 European countries . The external validation cohort consisted of 1738 comparable patients from six centres in Scotl and , UK . Patients from the index cohort had a mean age of 69 years , 27 % were female , 83 % were in New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class II-III and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) was 31 % . The full prediction models for mortality , hospitalization owing to HF , and the combined outcome , yielded c-statistic values of 0.73 , 0.69 , and 0.71 , respectively . Predictors of mortality and hospitalization owing to HF were remarkably different . The five strongest predictors of mortality were more advanced age , higher blood urea nitrogen and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide , lower haemoglobin , and failure to prescribe a beta-blocker . The five strongest predictors of hospitalization owing to HF were more advanced age , previous hospitalization owing to HF , presence of oedema , lower systolic blood pressure and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate .  Patients from the validation cohort were aged 74 years , 34 % were female , 85 % were in NYHA class II-III , and mean LVEF was 41 % ; c-statistic values for the full and compact model were comparable to the index cohort . CONCLUSION A small number of variables , which are usually readily available in the routine clinical setting , provide useful prognostic information for patients with HF . Predictors of mortality were remarkably different from predictors of hospitalization owing to HFTitle 3:Lack of Association Between Heart Failure and Incident Cancer.Abstract 3:BACKGROUND Several recent studies have suggested an increased cancer risk among patients with heart failure ( HF ) . However , these studies are constrained by limited size and follow-up , lack of comprehensive data on other health attributes , and adjudicated cancer outcomes . OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine whether HF is associated with cancer incidence and cancer-specific mortality . METHODS The study assembled a cohort from the Physicians ' Health Studies I and II , 2 r and omized controlled trials of aspirin and vitamin supplements conducted from 1982 to 1995 and from 1997 to 2011 , respectively , that included annual health evaluations and determination of cancer and HF diagnoses . In the primary analysis , the study excluded participants with cancer or HF at baseline and performed multivariable-adjusted Cox models to determine the relationship between HF and cancer , modeling HF as a time-varying exposure . In a complementary analysis , the study used the l and mark method and identified cancer-free participants at 70 years of age , distinguishing between those with and without HF , and likewise performed Cox regression . Sensitivity analyses were performed at 65 , 75 , and 80 years of age . RESULTS Among 28,341 Physicians ' Health Study participants , 1,420 developed HF . A total of 7,363 cancers developed during a median follow-up time of 19.9 years ( 25th to 75th percentile : 11.0 to 26.8 years ) . HF was not associated with cancer incidence in crude ( hazard ratio : 0.92 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.80 to 1.08 ) or multivariable-adjusted analysis ( hazard ratio : 1.05 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.86 to 1.29 ) . No association was found between HF and site-specific cancer incidence or cancer-specific mortality after multivariable adjustment . Results were similar when using the l and mark method at all l and mark ages . CONCLUSIONS HF is not associated with an increased risk of cancer among male physiciansTitle 4:Heart Failure After Myocardial Infarction Is Associated With Increased Risk of Cancer.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND Heart failure ( HF ) is associated with excess morbidity and mortality for which noncardiac causes are increasingly recognized . The authors previously described an increased risk of cancer among HF patients compared with community controls . OBJECTIVES This study examined whether HF was associated with an increased risk of subsequent cancer among a homogenous population of first myocardial infa rct ion ( MI ) survivors . METHODS A prospect i ve cohort study was conducted among Olmsted County , Minnesota , residents with incident MI from 2002 to 2010 . Patients with prior cancer or HF diagnoses were excluded . RESULTS A total of 1,081 participants ( mean age 64 ± 15 years ; 60 % male ) were followed for 5,327 person-years ( mean 4.9 ± 3.0 years ) . A total of 228 patients developed HF , and 98 patients developed cancer ( excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer ) . Incidence density rates for cancer diagnosis ( per 1,000 person-years ) were 33.7 for patients with HF and 15.6 for patients without HF ( p = 0.002 ) . The hazard ratio ( HR ) for cancer associated with HF was 2.16 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.39 to 3.35 ) ; adjusted for age , sex , and Charlson comorbidity index ; HR : 1.71 ( 95 % CI : 1.07 to 2.73 ) . The HRs for mortality associated with cancer were 4.90 ( 95 % CI : 3.10 to 7.74 ) for HF-free and 3.91 ( 95 % CI : 1.88 to 8.12 ) for HF patients ( p for interaction = 0.76 ) . CONCLUSIONS Patients who develop HF after MI have an increased risk of cancer . This finding extends our previous report of an elevated cancer risk after HF compared with controls , and calls for a better underst and ing of shared risk factors and underlying mechanismsTitle 5:Association between cardiovascular vs. non-cardiovascular co-morbidities and outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.Abstract 5:AIMS The prevalence of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular co-morbidities and their relative importance for outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFPEF ) remain poorly characterized . This study aim ed to investigate this . METHODS AND RESULTS The Karolinska-Rennes ( KaRen ) Study was a multinational prospect i ve observational study design ed to characterize HFPEF . Inclusion required acute HF , defined by the Framingham criteria , LVEF ≥ 45 % , and NT-pro-BNP ≥ 300 ng/L or BNP ≥ 100 ng/L. Detailed clinical data were collected at baseline and patients were followed prospect ively for 18 months . Predictors of the primary ( HF hospitalization or all-cause mortality ) and secondary ( all-cause mortality ) outcomes were assessed with multivariable Cox regression . A total of 539 patients [ 56 % women ; median ( interquartile range ) age 79 ( 72 - 84 ) years ; NT-pro-BNP/BNP 2448 (1290 - 4790)/429 ( 229 - 805 ) ng/L ] were included .  Known history of HF was present in 40 % . Co-morbidities included hypertension ( 78 % ) , atrial fibrillation/flutter ( 65 % ) , anaemia ( 51 % ) , renal dysfunction ( 46 % ) , CAD ( 33 % ) , diabetes ( 30 % ) , lung disease ( 25 % ) , and cancer ( 16 % ) . The primary outcome occurred in 268 patients [ 50 % ; 106 deaths ( 20 % ) and 162 HF hospitalizations ( 30 % ) ] . Important independent predictors of the primary and /or secondary outcomes were age , history of non-cardiovascular syncope , valve disease , anaemia , lower sodium , and higher potassium , but no cardiovascular co-morbidities . Renin-angiotensin system antagonist and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use predicted improved prognosis . CONCLUSION HFPEF was associated with higher age , female gender , hypertension , atrial fibrillation/flutter , and numerous non-cardiovascular co-morbidities . Prognosis was determined by non-cardiovascular co-morbidities , but use of conventional heart failure medications may still be associated with improved outcomes","answer":"In this meta- analysis and systematic review , our results demonstrated that heart failure may increase the risk of incident cancer and that HF associated with cancer increases the risk of mortality"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

This idea has gained popularity in recent years in particular through the selection-based supramolecular methodology of dynamic combinatorial chemistry. 4 By connecting building blocks via reversible chemical bonds and allowing these to self-assemble in the presence of the template strong receptors for the given template are preferentially synthesised. 5 The curcurbit[n]uril series of macrocycles has gained signicant popularity in the past years due to their ability to form strong host-guest complexes with a wide range of cationic guest molecules in water (Fig. 1a). 6 Hemicucurbit[n] uril macrocycles (Fig. 1b) have been explored and they tend to bind anions rather than cations. 7 The syntheses of cucurbit[n] urils and hemicucurbit[n]urils are acid mediated condensation reactions between a cyclic N,N 0 -dialkylurea and formaldehyde.</p>Results and discussion<p>The resemblance between the structure of the starting ureas for the synthesis of cucurbit[n]urils and hemicucurbit[n]urils and the structure of D-biotin (1) inspired us to study the macrocyclisation reaction between D-biotin and formaldehyde (Fig. 1c). D-Biotin possesses a cyclic ve-membered N,N 0dialkylurea that enables the oligomerisation reaction to form structures of the hemicucurbit[n]uril type. D-Biotin is known to form strong supramolecular complexes in water with the class of proteins called avidins, 8 it has three chiral centers and the carboxylic acid functionality gives solubility in water.</p><p>The acid-mediated reaction between D-biotin and formaldehyde in semi-concentrated hydrochloric acid at 60 C resulted in the selective formation of a 6 + 6 macrocycle (biotin [6]uril, 2, Fig. 1c). 9 In this macrocycle the six D-biotin units are connected through six methylene bridges. Aer optimisation of the reaction conditions in hydrochloric acid with respect to reaction times, temperature, and acid concentration, the product was isolated in 48% yield. We suspected that the choice of acid was important for the outcome of reaction. Similar to aqueous HCl, the use of aqueous HBr and HI gave rise to the 6 + 6 macrocycle as the main product aer 2 days of reaction at 60 C (Fig. 2), whereas the use of sulfuric acid and otherwise similar reaction conditions resulted in the formation of a mixture of smaller non-cyclic oligomers. When chloride, bromide, or iodide salts were added to the sulfuric acid reaction mixture, the hexameric structure was again observed as the main product suggesting that a templating effect from the halide anions was the driving force for hexamer formation (Fig. 2). Using further optimised reaction conditions (3.5 M H 2 SO 4 containing 5 M NaBr) 2 could be isolated in 63% yield on a multigram scale.</p><p>The HPLC chromatogram of the isolated compound showed a single peak and the mass spectrum of the peak corresponded to a 6 + 6 macrocycle. Due to the non-equivalence of the two urea nitrogen atoms in D-biotin there are 9 different possible regioisomeric cyclic 6 + 6 hexamers (ESI, Fig. S11 †). Analysis by 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy revealed the exclusive formation of a single species. In the NMR spectra of 2 (Fig. 3) only a single set of signals originating from D-biotin was observed. However, two signals resulting from two different aminal methylene bridges were present (between 4 and 4.5 ppm), as conrmed in the HSQC spectrum. The facts that there are two different methylene bridges, and that all six D-biotin units are identical enable us to unambiguously assign the structure as the C 3 -symmetrical isomer (Fig. 3).</p><p>Elemental analysis of the product obtained when performing the macrocyclisation reaction in 7 M HCl (analysis for H, C, N and Cl) showed that 2 had precipitated as an HCl adduct. To investigate if the chloride anion was also encapsulated in the cavity of 2 in solution the complexation was investigated using NMR spectroscopy in aqueous carbonate buffer (as carbonate did not interact with 2). A series of 1 H-NMR spectra were recorded at various concentrations of the 2-chloride complex. Upon dilution the C-H proton signals in the 1 H-NMR spectrum of 2, which point towards the cavity in the crystal structure (see Fig. 4) were shied signicantly upeld. This exchange process between the bound and the unbound states were fast on the NMR chemical shi time scale. This suggests that the chloride anion was indeed interacting with the cavity of 2 in solution. When additional NaCl was added to the solution the same signals shied in the opposite direction (downeld) (ESI, Fig. S10 †).</p><p>The biotin [6]uril (2) was obtained chloride-free by treating the chloride inclusion complex with TlNO 3 in alkaline solution followed by ltration and precipitation with sulfuric acid (the sulfate anion does not interact with the cavity of the macrocycle). The removal of the chloride anion was conrmed by dilution experiments, elemental analysis, and by obtaining the single crystal X-ray structure of the guest-free 2. The single crystal X-ray structure showed that the isolated product contained a solvent molecule (ethanol) in the cavity (Fig. 4a and b).</p><p>The structure of 2 has the D-biotin units situated in an alternating manner, with the uriedo moieties pointing in opposite directions with respect to the C 3 symmetry axis of the macrocycle. The macrocycle has six side chains terminated with carboxylic acid groups, and in the crystal structure three side chains point in each direction as compared to the equator of the macrocycle. Each D-biotin moiety has a concave and a convex  side, and in 2 all D-biotin units have the convex side with the two CH groups (protons b and f, Fig. 3) pointing into the centre of the macrocycle, giving an interior with twelve C-H groups.</p><p>We also succeeded growing crystals of an iodide inclusion complex suitable for single crystal X-ray analysis by co-crystallising 2 with NaI. Analysis of the crystal structure showed 2 with an iodide ion encapsulated in the cavity of the macrocycle and with the sodium ion sitting at the rim of the macrocycle coordinating to the carbonyl oxygen of one of the urea functionalities (Fig. 4c and d). The iodide-CH distances are slightly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals distances (shortest H-I distance in the crystal structure is 3.032 Å). This indicates a favourable interaction. The circumference of the cavity (measured via the six urea and the six methylene moieties) changes only from 33.541 Å with EtOH in the cavity to 33.693 Å with iodide in the cavity. The iodide thus ts well inside the cavity without altering the conformation signicantly. The binding properties of 2 towards the anions chloride, bromide and iodide were investigated in carbonate buffer (Fig. 5). Analysis of the binding stoichiometries using the continuous variation method (Job's method) for all the three halides indicated 1 : 1 binding stoichiometries (see ESI †). The binding affinities were determined by titration experiments using 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). When analysing the data from the 1 H-NMR titrations it was convenient to monitor the chemical shi change of the C-H protons of the D-biotin units (protons b and f in Fig. 3), as these protons point towards the centre of the macrocyclic cavity, and experience a signicant downeld shi upon halide binding.</p><p>The binding strengths were in the order iodide > bromide > chloride, and we observed no binding to uoride. The ITC data (Fig. 5b) showed the same order of binding constants as observed by the NMR titrations (Table 1) and furthermore gave a full picture of the thermodynamics of the binding events. The binding of the three halides have an unfavorable entropic (DS) contribution, but a favorable enthalpic (DH) contribution.</p><p>In order to examine the mode of formation, and thereby rationalise the high regioselectivity of the macrocyclisation reaction, we followed the progress of the reaction by LC/MS analysis. We performed a series of identical experiments in 7 M HCl at 60 C (82 mM D-biotin, 5 equiv. formaldehyde). The reactions were stopped aer different reaction times by quenching with base. In the early stages of the reaction D-biotin (1) and a linear dimer consisting of two D-biotins connected by one formaldehyde-based methylene bridge (3, Fig. 6) were the most abundant species. Aer 2-4 hours 2 began to form, and aer 2-4 days it was the main product.</p><p>This led us to the hypothesis that the hexamer was formed by a trimerisation of the linear dimer 3 with three additional equivalents of formaldehyde (Fig. 6). We found that the linear dimer (3) could be isolated by condensing two equivalents of Dbiotin and one equivalent of formaldehyde in dilute H 2 SO 4 . We only observe the linear dimer (3) where the nitrogen positioned on the unsubstituted side of the D-biotin had reacted with the formaldehyde. When this dimer was subjected to the reaction conditions developed for the macrocyclisation reaction (7 M HCl, 5 equiv. formaldehyde), we also observe the formation of 2 in a similar yield.

The macrocycle (biotin[6]uril) is water-soluble, chiral and binds halide anions (iodide, bromide and chloride) with selectivity for iodide in water, and it can be isolated on a gram scale in a one-pot reaction in 63% yield."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

A major advantage of such drone small cells is that the operators can quickly provide cellular services in areas of urgent demand without having to pre-install any infrastructure. Since the base station is attached to the drone, technically it is feasible for the base station to dynamic reposition itself in response to the changing locations of users for reducing the communication distance, decreasing the probability of signal blocking, and ultimately increasing the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we first propose distributed algorithms for autonomous control of drone movements, and then model and analyse the spectral efficiency performance of a drone small cell to shed new light on the fundamental benefits of dynamic repositioning. We show that, with dynamic repositioning, the spectral efficiency of drone small cells can be increased by nearly 100 for realistic drone speed, height, and user traffic model and without incurring any major increase in drone energy consumption.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Intelligent collaborative environments, where heterogenous entities operate together in achieving common mission objectives have been increasingly adopted for monitoring and surveillance of interest areas and physical infrastructures. They can be assembled from multiple existing technologies ranging from wireless sensor networks (WSN), terrestrial remote operated vehicles (ROV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). In this context, we first introduce a multi-level system framework for multi-sensory robotic surveillance of critical infrastructure protection through communication, data acquisition and processing - MUROS. Leveraging a cognitive radio (CR) scheme is discussed as key point of the paper, arguing that by exploiting in an opportunistic fashion the time, frequency and spatial stream of the wireless environment, increased communication reliability can be achieved with positive impact on the availability and service level at each hierarchical level. The application of CR, given the heterogeneous nature of the application across multiple radio interfaces and protocols, stand outs as a novel and feasible research direction. We argument the advantages of this scheme within the constraints of a working scenario and define a simulation-based approach in order to validate our solution.[2]: [3]: Recent technological advances in electronics, sen- sors, and communications devices have facilitated the prolifer- ation of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)-aided applications. However, the UAS-aided communications networks are yet to receive sufficient research endeavor. In this paper, we address one of the most important research challenges pertaining to UAS-aided networks comprising adaptive modulation-capable nodes, namely how to fairly maximize the energy efficiency (throughput per energy). For the mobility pattern innate to the UAS, we demonstrate how the adaptive modulation behaves. Furthermore, we formulate the problem as a potential game that is played between the UAS and the network-nodes, and prove its stability, optimality, and convergence. Based upon the potential game, a data collection method is envisioned to maximize the energy efficiency with the fairness constraint. Additionally, we analyze the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of our proposed game. Extensive simulations exhibit the effectiveness of our proposal under varying environments. sensor nodes require only capabilities to communicate with the CHs. The mobility pattern of the UAS causes the distance between a CH and the UAS to vary. The distance between the CH and the UAS affects the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which in turn affects the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the CH transmissions. Both SNR and BER affect the modulation scheme. This is because modulation schemes that transmit more bits per symbol require higher values of SNR for a given BER requirement (9). Moreover, if high levels of BER are acceptable, the achievable number of bits per symbol that a modulation scheme transmits can be increased.","answer":"Drones have been considered both in the context of data gathering in wireless sensor networks [3] [2] [1] , and more recently in the context of delivering data to mobile users in cellular networks.

Along with effects on positive and negative stimuli , acute effects on neutral stimuli may also relate to antidepressant efficacy , yet these effects are still to be investigated . The present study therefore examined the impact of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram ( 20 mg ) on positive , negative and neutral stimuli using pharmaco-fMRI . METHODS Within a double-blind , r and omized , placebo-controlled crossover design , healthy women completed 2 sessions of treatment administration and fMRI scanning separated by a 1-week washout period . RESULTS We enrolled 36 women in our study . When participants were administered escitalopram relative to placebo , left amygdala activity was increased and right inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) activity was decreased during presentation of positive pictures ( potentiation of positive emotion processing ) . In contrast , escitalopram was associated with decreased left amygdala and increased right IFG activity during presentation of negative pictures ( attenuation of negative emotion processing ) . In addition , escitalopram decreased right IFG activity during the processing of neutral stimuli , akin to the effects on positive stimuli ( decrease in negative appraisal ) . LIMITATIONS Although we used a women-only sample to reduce heterogeneity , our results may not generalize to men . Potential unblinding , which was related to the subjective occurrence of side effects , occurred in the study ; however , manipulation check analyses demonstrated that results were not impacted . CONCLUSION These novel findings demonstrate that a single dose of the commonly prescribed escitalopram facilitates a positive information processing bias . These findings provide an important lead for better underst and ing effects of antidepressant medicationTitle 2:Directed forgetting of trauma cues in adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse with and without posttraumatic stress disorder.Abstract 2:The authors used a directed-forgetting task to investigate whether psychiatrically impaired adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse exhibit an avoidant encoding style and impaired memory for trauma cues . The authors tested women with abuse histories , either with or without posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and women with neither abuse histories nor PTSD . The women saw intermixed trauma words ( e.g. , molested ) , positive words ( e.g. , confident ) , and categorized neutral words ( e.g. , mailbox ) on a computer screen and were instructed either to remember or to forget each word . Relative to the other groups , the PTSD group did not exhibit recall deficits for trauma-related to-be-remembered words , nor did they recall fewer trauma-related to-be-forgotten words than other words . Instead , they exhibited recall deficits for positive and neutral words they were supposed to remember . These data are inconsistent with the hypothesis that impaired survivors exhibit avoidant encoding and impaired memory for traumatic informationTitle 3:Stimulation of the noradrenergic system enhances and blockade reduces memory for emotional material in man.Abstract 3:BACKGROUND It is clearly established that emotional events tend to be remembered particularly vividly . The neurobiological substrates of this phenomenon are poorly understood . Recently , the noradrenergic system has been implicated in that beta blockade has been shown to reduce significantly the delayed recall of emotional material with matched neutral material being unaffected . METHODS In the present study , 36 healthy young adults were r and omly allocated to receive either yohimbine , which stimulates central noradrenergic activity , metoprolol which blocks noradrenergic activity , or matched placebo . The three groups were well matched . All capsules were taken orally , prior to viewing a narrated 11 slide show described a boy being involved in an accident . RESULTS Yohimbine significantly elevated , and metoprolol reduced mean heart rate during the slide show relative to placebo , thus confirming the efficacy of the pharmacological manipulation . One week later , in a surprise ' test , memory for the slide show was tested . As predicted , yohimbine-treated subjects recalled significantly more and metoprolol subjects fewer slides relative to placebo . This result was confirmed via analysis of multiple-choice recognition memory scores . CONCLUSIONS We conclude that stimulation of the noradrenergic system results in the enhancement and blockade in a reduction of recall and recognition of emotional material in manTitle 4:Attentional bias in post-traumatic stress disorder diminishes after symptom amelioration.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND Avoidance and hypervigilance to reminders of a traumatic event are among the main characteristics of post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Attentional bias toward aversive cues in PTSD has been hypothesized as being part of the dysfunction causing etiology and maintenance of PTSD . The aim of the present study was to investigate the cognitive strategy underlying attentional bias in PTSD and whether normal cognitive processing is restored after a treatment suppressing core PTSD symptoms . METHODS Nineteen healthy controls were matched for age , sex and education to 19 PTSD patients . We used the  emotional stroop and detection of target tasks , before and after an average of 4.1 sessions of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing ( EMDR ) therapy . RESULTS We found that on both tasks , patients were slower than controls in responding in the presence of emotionally negative words compared to neutral ones . After symptoms removal , patients no longer had attentional bias , and responded similarly to controls . CONCLUSION These results support the existence of an attentional bias in PTSD patients due to a disengagement difficulty . There was also preliminary evidence that the disengagement was linked to PTSD symptomatology . It should be further explored whether attentional bias and PTSD involve common brain mechanismsTitle 5:Attention and memory dysfunction in posttraumatic stress disorder.Abstract 5:Attention and memory performances were studied in Persian Gulf War veterans with and without posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) diagnoses . Veterans diagnosed with PTSD showed relative performance deficiencies on  tasks of sustained attention , mental manipulation , initial acquisition of information , and retroactive interference .  Their performances were also characterized by errors of commission and intrusion . The tendency toward response disinhibition and intrusion on cognitive tasks was correlated positively with reexperiencing symptoms and negatively with avoidance-numbing symptoms . These cognitive deficit patterns are consistent with models of PTSD that emphasize the role of hyperarousal and implicate dysfunction of frontal-subcortical systems . Results suggest that intrusion of traumatic memories in PTSD may not be limited to trauma-related cognitions but instead reflects a more general pattern of disinhibitionTitle 6:Non-serotonergic pharmacological profiles and associated cognitive effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitorsAbstract 6:The current study was carried out to investigate the cognitive effects of two serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , sertraline and paroxetine , with special reference to differences in their affinity for other neurotransmitter systems , i.e. anticholinergic activity of paroxetine and putative dopamine reuptake activity of sertraline . The study was conducted according to a double-blind , three-way cross-over design . During three treatment periods of 2 weeks , 24 healthy middle-aged ( aged 30–50 years ) subjects of both sexes received sertraline ( 50 mg on days 1–7 , 100 mg on days 8–14 ) , paroxetine ( 20 mg on days 1–7 , 40 mg on days 8–14 ) and placebo . Paroxetine specifically impaired delayed recall in a word learning test at a dose of 20 and 40 mg . Sertraline did not affect word learning but improved performance on a verbal fluency task at a dose of 50 and 100 mg . Neither drug affected performance on a short-term memory scanning task . These subtle but significant changes in cognitive performance can be explained by subtle differences in pharmacological profiles of these SSRIs . The additional anticholinergic effects of paroxetine could account for its induction of long-term memory impairment . Similarly , the additional dopaminergic effects of sertraline could account for its induction of slightly improved verbal fluency . The impairing and facilitating cognitive effects of paroxetine and sertraline , respectively , may be more pronounced in the elderly depressed patient","answer":"In addition , attentional and inhibition processing seem to play an important role in emotional memory in PTSD sufferers .Furthermore , other studies that did not find behavioral differences between PTSD and control groups nevertheless showed differences in both specific cerebral activities and neurohormone levels during emotional memory tasks .Nevertheless , the results of this systematic review provide interesting information on emotional memory for clinicians and research ers , as they seem to highlight facilitated memory processing for negative information in PTSD patients ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

A phase II study was conducted in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in order to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the combination chemotherapy regimen of mitomycin C, vinorelbine, and cisplatin (MVrP).  Materials And Methods Between June 1996 and December 2000, fifty-nine patients with unresectable stage IIIB to IV, pathologically documented NSCLC were enrolled in this study. One cycle consisted of mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 i.v. days 1 & 15, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 i.v day 1 and the next cycle consisted of vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 i.v. days 29 & 43, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 i.v day 29. Each cycle was alternated and treatments were repeated every 8 weeks.  results We were able to evaluate fifty-three of 59 patients. Objective responses were seen in 22 (41.5%) patients (CR 0%, PR 41.5%). The median duration of response was 13.7 weeks and the median time to progression was 17.7 weeks. The median overall survival was 45.6 weeks. There was a significantly longer survival seen in responders (p=0.041). The toxicities of this regimen were acceptable without treatment related toxic death.  conclusion This study suggests that a combination regimen of mitomycin C, vinorelbine, and cisplatin is relatively effective and well tolerated for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.sentence: Combination Chemotherapy with Mitomycin C , Vinorelbine , and Cisplatin ( MVrP ) in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer .","answer":"[[\\"Mitomycin\\", \\"Vinorelbine\\", \\"Cisplatin\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

We investigated whether anaemia correction with epoetin beta could improve outcome of curative radiotherapy among patients with head and neck cancer.                We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 351 patients (haemoglobin <120 g/L in women or <130 g/L in men) with carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Patients received curative radiotherapy at 60 Gy for completely (R0) and histologically incomplete (R1) resected disease, or 70 Gy for macroscopically incompletely resected (R2) advanced disease (T3, T4, or nodal involvement) or for primary definitive treatment. All patients were assigned to subcutaneous placebo (n=171) or epoetin beta 300 IU/kg (n=180) three times weekly, from 10-14 days before and continuing throughout radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was locoregional progression-free survival. We assessed also time to locoregional progression and survival. Analysis was by intention to treat.                148 (82%) patients given epoetin beta achieved haemoglobin concentrations higher than 140 g/L (women) or 150 g/L (men) compared with 26 (15%) given placebo. However, locoregional progression-free survival was poorer with epoetin beta than with placebo (adjusted relative risk 1.62 [95% CI 1.22-2.14]; p=0.0008). For locoregional progression the relative risk was 1.69 (1.16-2.47, p=0.007) and for survival was 1.39 (1.05-1.84, p=0.02).                Epoetin beta corrects anaemia but does not improve cancer control or survival. Disease control might even be impaired. Patients receiving curative cancer treatment and given erythropoietin should be studied in carefully controlled trials.Title 2:Multicenter randomized Phase II study of paclitaxel (1-hour infusion), fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and concomitant twice daily radiation with or without erythropoietin for advanced head and neck cancer.Abstract 2:To expand on our experience with the combination of paclitaxel, fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and twice daily irradiation (T-FHX) and to assess the impact of weekly administration of erythropoietin (r-HuEpo) on transfusion requirements, we conducted a Phase II multi-institutional trial with a simplified 1-h paclitaxel infusion schedule and randomized patients to receive weekly doses of r-HuEpo.                A total of 90 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers (stage IV, 96%; N(2)/N(3), 66%) were treated on a regimen of 1-h infusion of paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2)/day, day 1), 120-h infusion of 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m(2)/day, days 0-5); hydroxyurea 500 mg p.o. every 12 h for 11 doses; and radiation 150cGy bid, days 1-5 of each 14-day cycle repeated for five cycles over 10 weeks (7200-7500 cGy). Before initiating therapy, patients were randomized to receive r-HuEpo 40,000 IU s.c. once weekly.                At median follow-up of 40 months, 3-year progression-free survival is 62%, locoregional control is 84%, and systemic control is 79%. Overall survival is 59%. Anemia, leucopenia, dermatitis, and mucositis were the most frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Patients randomized to erythropoietin experienced less grade 2/3 anemia (52 versus 77%; P = 0.02), but transfusion requirements were not significantly different.                T-FHX is an active and tolerable regimen inducing local tumor control and promising survival with organ preservation in high-risk patients. One h infusion of paclitaxel simplified the regimen without compromising efficacy. Addition of erythropoietin does not reduce the need for transfusion with this nonplatinum-containing regimen. T-FHX should be advanced to a randomized trial and compared with a cisplatin-based concomitant regimen.","answer":"There are strong suggestions that RT plus EPO has a negative influence on outcome as opposed to RT alone. However, the target haemoglobin concentration, which was higher than recommended in four of the five included RCTs, may have had a significant role. Nevertheless, based on these findings EPO should not be administered as an addition to RT outside the experimental setting for patients with head and neck cancer."},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  This paper examines the influence of the Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP) on the Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) signalling pathway [5] through modelling in a Markovian process algebra, PEPA [11]. Two models of the system are presented, a reagent-centric view and a pathway-centric view. The models capture functionality at the level of subpathway, rather than at a molecular level. Each model affords a different perspective of the pathway and analysis. We demonstrate the two models to be formally equivalent using the timing-aware bisimulation defined over PEPA models and discuss the biological significance. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We present an application of stochastic Concurrent Constraint Programming (sCCP) for modeling biological systems. We provide a library of sCCP processes that can be used to describe straightforwardly biological networks. In the meanwhile, we show that sCCP proves to be a general and extensible framework, allowing to describe a wide class of dynamical behaviours and kinetic laws. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  In this work we present Bio-PEPA, a process algebra for the modelling and the analysis of biochemical networks. It is a modification of PEPA, originally defined for the performance analysis of computer systems, in order to handle some features of biological models, such as stoichiometry and the use of general kinetic laws. Bio-PEPA may be seen as an intermediate, formal, compositional representation of biological systems, on which different kinds of analyses can be carried out. Bio-PEPA is enriched with some notions of equivalence. Specifically, the isomorphism and strong bisimulation for PEPA have been considered and extended to our language. Finally, we show the translation of a biological model into the new language and we report some analysis results. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  A variant of Rate Transition Systems (RTS), proposed by Klin and Sassone, is introduced and used as the basic model for defining stochastic behaviour of processes. The transition relation used in our variant associates to each process, for each action, the set of possible futures paired with a measure indicating their rates. We show how RTS can be used for providing the operational semantics of stochastic extensions of classical formalisms, namely CSP and CCS. We also show that our semantics for stochastic CCS guarantees associativity of parallel composition. Similarly, in contrast with the original definition by Priami, we argue that a semantics for stochastic * -calculus can be provided that guarantees associativity of parallel composition. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  We present an implementation of model checking for probabilistic and stochastic extensions of the pi-calculus, a process algebra which supports modelling of concurrency and mobility. Formal verification techniques for such extensions have clear applications in several domains, including mobile ad-hoc network protocols, probabilistic security protocols and biological pathways. Despite this, no implementation of automated verification exists. Building upon the pi-calculus model checker MMC, we first show an automated procedure for constructing the underlying semantic model of a probabilistic or stochastic pi-calculus process. This can then be verified using existing probabilistic model checkers such as PRISM. Secondly, we demonstrate how for processes of a specific structure a more efficient, compositional approach is applicable, which uses our extension of MMC on each parallel component of the system and then translates the results into a high-level modular description for the PRISM tool. The feasibility of our techniques is demonstrated through a number of case studies from the pi-calculus literature. 6. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB006):  Many models have been defined in order to describe the evolution of a disease in a population. The modelling of diseases is helpful to understand the mechanisms for their spread and to predict their future evolution. Most of the models in the literature are defined in terms of systems of differential equations and only a few of them propose stochastic simulation for the analysis. The main aim of this work is to apply the process algebra Bio-PEPA for the modelling and analysis of epidemiological models. As Bio-PEPA has been originally defined for biochemical networks, we define a variant of it suitable for representing epidemiological models. Some features of Bio-PEPA are useful in the context of epidemiology as well: location can abstract spatial structure and event can describe the introduction of prophylaxis in a population infected by a disease at a given day. Concerning the analysis, we can take advantage of the various kinds of analysis supported by Bio-PEPA, such as, for instance, stochastic simulation, model checking and ODE-based analyses. In particular, the modeller can select the most appropriate approach for the study of the model and analysis techniques can be used together for a better understanding of the behaviour of the system. In this paper we apply Bio-PEPA to the study of epidemiological models of avian influenza, based on different assumptions about the spatial structure and the possible kind of treatment. These models demonstrate that Bio-PEPA has several features that facilitate epidemiological modelling. 7. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB007):  We demonstrate the use of the process algebra PEPA for realistic models of epidemiology. The results of stochastic simulation of the model are shown, and ease of modelling is compared to that of Bio-PEPA. PEPA is shown to be capable of capturing the complex disease dynamics of the historic data for measles epidemics in the UK from 1944–1964, including persistent fluctuations due to seasonal effects. 8. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB008):  We develop a version of stochastic Pi-calculus with a semantics based on measure theory. We define the behaviour of a process in a rate environment using measures over the measurable space of processes induced by structural congruence. We extend the stochastic bisimulation to include the concept of rate environment and prove that this equivalence is a congruence which extends the structural congruence.Literature Review:","answer":"Stochastic process algebras aim to combine two successful approaches of modelling: labeled transition systems and continuous-time Markov chains BIB005 . Indeed, they argued that labeled transition systems are a very convenient framework to provide compositional semantics of concurrent languages and to prove qualitative properties. Markov chains, instead, have been used in performance evaluation and quantitative properties. The common feature of most stochastic process calculi is that their actions are enriched with rates of exponentially distributed random variables characterizing their mean duration. Continuous Pi-Calculus. Ever since the invention of the pi-calculus, there has been an interest to use it to model ecosystems. A successful development on this direction is an extension of the pi-calculus with continuous time. The continuous pi-calculus  is an extension of the pi-calculus in which the processes evolve in continuous time. It can be seen as modular way to generate ordinary differential equations for a system behavior over time. The continuous pi-calculus has been used to model biochemical systems  . Stochastic CCS. In stochastic CCS (stoCCS), output actions are equipped with a parameter characterizing a random variable with a negative exponential distribution, modelling the duration of the action BIB005 . Input actions are denoted with a weight, a positive integer used to determine the probability that the specific input is selected when a complementary action is executed BIB005 . There are no tools available for their simulation nor verification up to our knowledge. This calculus has not been used to model ecosystems, but the definition of rate-based transition systems has inspired many other modelling languages BIB005 . As argued by Cardelli et al. in BIB009 , one cannot guarantee associativity of parallel composition operator up to stochastic bisimilarity when the synchronization paradigm of CCSis used in combination with the synchronization rate computation based on apparent rates. This is a problem, specially, in presence of dynamic process creation. Stochastic pi-calculus. The stochastic pi-calculus is an extension of the picalculus with rates associated to the actions, developed by Corrado Priami in 1995. Recently, Cardelli et al. developed new semantics with replication and fresh name quantification BIB009 . Cardelli et al. argued that parallel composition failed to be associative up to stochastic bisimilarity with previous semantics. With the new semantics it is now possible to capture associativity, which will lead to new applications and simulation tools. In fact, there is already a simulation tool for the stochastic pi-calculus named the stochastic pi machine (Spim) 2 ; Spim uses the probabilistic model checker PRISM. Another approach for model checking has been developed by Norman et al. BIB006 . Stochastic pi-calculus has been used in system biology to model regulating gene expression by positive feedback  . PEPA. The properties that may be checked for concurrent systems modeled by an algebraic description include freedom from deadlock and algebraic equivalence under observation BIB001 . Hillston et al. argue that there are further properties of interest for process calculi models such as steady-state probabilities and rewards for performance measures. Performance evaluation process algebra (PEPA) BIB001 was defined by BIB001 , to allow the specification and verification of such properties. Every activity in PEPA has an associated duration which is a random variable with an exponential distribution, determined by a single real-number parameter. A PEPA process can be translated into a continuous-time Markov process BIB001 . PEPA has been used in system biology to model the raf kinase inhibitor protein on the extracellular signal regulated kinase signalling pathway BIB002 and to model measles epidemics in the UK from 1944-1964 BIB008 . Bio-PEPA. Bio-PEPA BIB004 is a process calculus for modelling and analyzing biochemical networks. Bio-PEPA is a modification of PEPA adding some features such as support for stoichiometry and general kinetic laws. Kinetic laws are functions which allow us to derive the rate of reactions from varying parameters such as the rate coefficients and concentration of the reactants  . According to Hillston et al., the main difficulty with PEPA is the definition of stoichiometric coefficients BIB004 : These coefficients are used to show the quantitative relationships of the reactants and products in a biochemical reactions. A major feature of Bio-PEPA is the possibility to represent explicitly some features of biochemical models such as stoichiometry and the role of species in a given reaction. Bio-PEPA is also enriched with some notions of equivalence such as isomorphism and bisimulation, extended from PEPA. Bio-PEPA has been used in epidemiology to model the H5N1 avian influenza BIB007 . Stochastic CCP. Stochastic CCP (sCCP) was developed by Bortolussi  , in 2006. sCCP is an extension of CCP by adding a stochastic duration to all instructions interacting with the constraint store. In sCCP, each instruction has an associated random variable, exponentially distributed  . Bortolussi et al. also proposed an approximation of sCCP semantics into ordinary differential equations  . Bortolussi et al. have used sCCP to model bio-mechanical reactions such as an enzymatic reaction  . sCCP has also been in system biology BIB003 and to model prey-predator dynamics  ."},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

The aim of this randomized controlled pilot study was to determine whether acupuncture holds promise as a treatment for depression during pregnancy.                Sixty-one pregnant women with major depressive disorder and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17) score >or=14 were randomly assigned to one of three treatments, delivered over 8 weeks: an active acupuncture (SPEC, N=20), an active control acupuncture (NSPEC, N=21), and massage (MSSG, N=20). Acupuncture treatments were standardized, but individually tailored, and were provided in a double-blind fashion. Responders to acute phase treatment (HRSD17 score<14 and >or=50% reduction from baseline) continued the treatment they were initially randomized to until 10 weeks postpartum.                Response rates at the end of the acute phase were statistically significantly higher for SPEC (69%) than for MSSG (32%), with an intermediate NSPEC response rate (47%). The SPEC group also exhibited a significantly higher average rate of reduction in BDI scores from baseline to the end of the first month of treatment than the MSSG group. Responders to the acute phase of all treatments combined had significantly lower depression scores at 10 weeks postpartum than nonresponders.

In contrast, the secondary mutation of the gatekeeper residue, T790M, reportedly confers inhibitor resistance on the oncogenic EGFR mutants. In this study, our biochemical analyses revealed that the introduction of the T790M mutation confers gefitinib resistance on the G719S mutant. The G719S/T790M double mutant has enhanced activity and retains high gefitinib-binding affinity. The T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the G719S mutant, explaining the acquired drug resistance of the double mutant. Structural analyses of the G719S/T790M double mutant, as well as the wild type and the G719S and L858R mutants, revealed that the T790M mutation stabilizes the hydrophobic spine of the active EGFR-TK conformation. The Met790 side chain of the G719S/T790M double mutant, in the apo form and gefitinib- and AMPPNP-bound forms, adopts different conformations that explain the accommodation of these ligands. In the L858R mutant structure, the active-site cleft is expanded by the repositioning of Phe723 within the P-loop. Notably, the introduction of the F723A mutation greatly enhanced the gefitinib sensitivity of the wild-type EGFR in vivo, supporting our hypothesis that the expansion of the active-site cleft results in enhanced gefitinib sensitivity. Taken together, our results provide a structural basis for the altered drug sensitivities caused by distinct NSCLC-associated EGFR mutations.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"gefitinib\\", \\"ATP\\", \\"tyrosine\\", \\"Phe\\", \\"erlotinib\\", \\"Met\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"tyrosine kinase (TK) domain\\", \\"human epidermal growth factor receptor\\", \\"F723A\\", \\"epidermal growth factor receptor\\", \\"G719S\\", \\"TK\\", \\"T790M\\", \\"L858R\\", \\"EGFR\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of different variations of massage in preventing pressure ulcers . METHODS A r and omized , double-blind cross-over design , in which patients of nursing homes who are prone to PU underwent two of the three possible interventions ; ' position changes only ' , ' massaging with an indifferent cream ' and ' massaging with a dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) cream ' . RESULTS The results of three interventions did not differ significantly . DMSO did not fulfil the expectations raised by literature and a previous pilot- studyTitle 2:Massage therapy is associated with enhancement of the immune system's cytotoxic capacity.Abstract 2:Twenty-nine gay men ( 20 HIV+ , 9 HIV- ) received daily massages for one month . A subset of 11 of the HIV+ subjects served as a within subject control group ( one month with and without massages ) . Major immune findings for the effects of the month of massage included a significant increase in Natural Killer Cell number , Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxicity , soluble CD8 , and the cytotoxic subset of CD8 cells . There were no changes in HIV disease progression markers ( CD4 , CD4/CD8 ratio , Beta-2 microglobulin , neopterin ) . Major neuroendocrine findings , measured via 24 hour urines included a significant decrease in cortisol , and nonsignificant trends toward decrease of catecholamines . There were also significant decreases in anxiety and increases in relaxation which were significantly correlated with increases in NK cell number . Thus , there appears to be an increase in cytotoxic capacity associated with massage . Implication s for HIV+ men as those with other illnesses , particularly cancer , are discussedTitle 3:A clinical trial of the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk.Abstract 3:The purpose of this article was to describe the protocol by which predictive instruments can be tested for validity and to evaluate the usefulness of an instrument for predicting pressure sore risk in an AICU . The Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk was described . Methods for measuring predictive validity and for calculating sensitivity , specificity , and per cent predictive value of positive and negative tests were discussed . Sixty consecutively admitted AICU patients who were pressure sore free were rated for pressure sore risk within 24 to 72 hours after admission . The skin condition of each patient was systematic ally assessed every 2 days . Twenty-four subjects developed pressure sores during the study period . The critical cut-off point at which the patient could be judged to be at risk for pressure sore formation was a  Braden Scale score equal to or less than 16 . The sensitivity and specificity of the scale at this score were 83 to 64 per cent , respectively . The per cent predictive value of a positive and negative test were 61 and 85 per cent , respectively . The  Braden Scale  compared favorably with the Norton Scale  in respect to sensitivity . The specificity , or the tendency of a scale to overpredict , was greater for the Norton than for the Braden Scale . The Norton Scale overpredicted by 64 per cent , whereas the Braden Scale overpredicted by 36 per cent . This difference may be important clinical ly if all patients who were judged to be at risk received additional nursing care or protective devices . A greater number of patients may receive unnecessary and expensive treatments using the Norton ScaleTitle 4:Effects of massage for prevention of pressure ulcers.Abstract 4:The purpose of this study was to determine whether st and ard massage ( 30 seconds ) and extended massage ( 60 seconds ) affected skin temperature of patients who had undergone fractured hip surgery . A convenience sample of 20 patients between 66 and 97 years of age who had fractured hip surgery were r and omly assigned to one of the two treatment groups . Evaluation of the effects of massage were made through measures of daily skin temperatures taken at the sacral site of each patient postoperatively for four days . A repeated measures analysis of variance showed a main effect for day ( F [ 3 , 53 ] = 7.26 , p = .01 ) , location ( F [ 1 , 53 ] = 8.83 , p = .01 ) , and an interaction between group and day ( F [ 3 , 53 ] = 5.83 , p less than .01 ) . Orthogonal contrasts of means showed that skin temperature on day 1 was significantly higher than days 2 , 3 , and 4 ( T = [ J , J ( n-1 ) ] = 4.21 , p less than .001 ) . Subjects who received extended massage had a significant decrease in skin temperature as opposed to those who received st and ard massage","answer":"It is , therefore , unclear whether massage therapy can prevent pressure ulcers"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Escitalopram oxalate (S-citalopram, Lexapro), a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor antidepressant which is the S-enantiomer of citalopram, is in clinical development worldwide for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Preclinical studies demonstrate that the therapeutic activity of citalopram resides in the S-isomer and that escitalopram binds with high affinity to the human serotonin transporter. Conversely, R-citalopram is approximately 30-fold less potent than escitalopram at this transporter. Escitalopram has linear pharmacokinetics, so that plasma levels increase proportionately and predictably with increased doses and its half-life of 27-32 h is consistent with once-daily dosing. In addition, escitalopram has negligible effects on cytochrome P450 drug-metabolising enzymes in vitro, suggesting a low potential for drug-drug interactions. The efficacy of escitalopram in patients with major depressive disorder has been demonstrated in multiple short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials, three of which included citalopram as an active control, as well as in a 36-week study evaluating efficacy in the prevention of depression relapse. In these studies, escitalopram was shown to have robust efficacy in the treatment of depression and associated symptoms of anxiety relative to placebo. Efficacy has also been shown in treating generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. Results also suggest that, at comparable doses, escitalopram demonstrates clinically relevant and statistically significant superiority to placebo treatment earlier than citalopram. Analysis of the safety database shows a low rate of discontinuation due to adverse events, and there was no statistically significant difference between escitalopram 10 mg/day and placebo in the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment early because of adverse events. The most common adverse events associated with escitalopram which occurred at a rate greater than placebo include nausea, insomnia, ejaculation disorder, diarrhoea, dry mouth and somnolence. Only nausea occurred in > 10% of escitalopram-treated patients.","answer":"[[\\"escitalopram\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"cytochrome P450\\"], [\\"escitalopram\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"human serotonin transporter\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

A major method ological concern is the design of the \\" sham \\" control for TMS . An ideal sham would produce negligible cortical stimulation in conjunction with a scalp sensation akin to real treatment . Strategies employed so far include alterations in the position of the stimulating coil , but there has been little systematic study of their validity . In this study , we investigated the effects of different coil positions on cortical activation and scalp sensation . METHODS In nine normal subjects , single TMS pulses were administered at a range of intensities with a \\" figure eight \\" coil held in various positions over the left primary motor cortex . Responses were measured as motor-evoked potentials in the right first dorsal interosseus muscle . Scalp sensation to TMS  with the coil in various positions over the prefrontal area was also assessed . RESULTS None of the coil positions studied met the criteria for an ideal sham . Arrangements associated with a higher likelihood of scalp sensation were also more likely to stimulate the cortex . CONCLUSIONS The choice of a sham for TMS involves a trade-off between effective blinding and truly inactive \\" stimulation . \\" Further research is needed to develop the best sham condition for a range of applicationsTitle 2:Electrical stimulation of motor cortex for pain control: a combined PET-scan and electrophysiological studyAbstract 2:Although electrical stimulation of the pre central gyrus ( MCS ) is emerging as a promising technique for pain control , its mechanisms of action remain obscure , and its application largely empirical . Using positron emission tomography ( PET ) we studied regional changes in cerebral flood flow ( rCBF ) in 10 patients undergoing motor cortex stimulation for pain control , seven of whom also underwent somatosensory evoked potentials and nociceptive spinal reflex recordings .  The most significant MCS-related increase in rCBF concerned the ventral-lateral thalamus , probably reflecting cortico-thalamic connections from motor areas . CBF increases were also observed in medial thalamus , anterior cingulate/orbitofrontal cortex , anterior insula and upper brainstem ; conversely , no significant CBF changes appeared in motor areas beneath the stimulating electrode . Somatosensory evoked potentials from SI remained stable during MCS , and no rCBF changes were observed in somatosensory cortex during the procedure . Our results suggest that descending axons , rather than apical dendrites , are primarily activated by MCS , and highlight the thalamus as the key structure mediating functional MCS effects . A model of MCS action is proposed , whereby activation of thalamic nuclei directly connected with motor and premotor cortices would entail a cascade of synaptic events in pain-related structures receiving afferents from these nuclei , including the medial thalamus , anterior cingulate and upper brainstem . MCS could influence the affective-emotional component of chronic pain by way of cingulate/orbitofrontal activation , and lead to descending inhibition of pain impulses by activation of the brainstem , also suggested by attenuation of spinal flexion reflexes . In contrast , the hypothesis of somatosensory cortex activation by MCS could not be confirmed by our resultsTitle 3:A real electro-magnetic placebo (REMP) device for sham transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)Abstract 3:OBJECTIVE There is growing interest in neuropsychiatry for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) as a neuromodulatory treatment . However , there are limitations in interpreting rTMS effects as a real consequence of physiological brain changes or as placebo-mediated unspecific effects , which may be particularly strong in psychiatric patients . This is due to the fact that existing sham rTMS procedures are less than optimal . A new placebo tool is introduced here , called real electro-magnetic placebo ( REMP ) device , which can simulate the scalp sensation induced by the real TMS , while leaving both the visual impact and acoustic sensation of real TMS unaltered . METHODS Physical , neurophysiological and behavioural variables of monophasic and biphasic single-pulse TMS and biphasic 1Hz and 20Hz rTMS procedures ( at different intensities ) were tested in subjects who were expert or naïve of TMS . Results of the real TMS were compared with those induced by the REMP device and with two other currently used sham procedures , namely the commercially available Magstim sham coil and tilting the real coil by 90 degrees . RESULTS The REMP device , besides producing scalp sensations similar to the real TMS , attenuated the TMS-induced electric field ( as measured by a dipole probe ) to a biologically inactive level . Behaviourally , neither expert nor naïve TMS subjects identified the \\" coil at 90 degrees \\" or the \\" Magstim sham coil \\" as a real TMS intervention , whilst naïve subjects were significantly more likely to identify the REMP-attenuated TMS as real . CONCLUSIONS The \\" goodness of sham \\" of the REMP device is demonstrated by physical , neurophysiological , and behavioural results . SIGNIFICANCE Such placebo TMS is superior to the available sham procedures when applied on subjects naïve to TMS , as in case of patients undergoing a clinical rTMS trialTitle 4:Rethinking Clinical Trials of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation: Participant and Assessor Blinding Is Inadequate at Intensities of 2mAAbstract 4:Background Many double-blind clinical trials of transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) use stimulus intensities of 2 mA despite the fact that blinding has not been formally vali date d under these conditions . The aim of this study was to test the assumption that sham 2 mA tDCS achieves effective blinding . Methods A r and omised double blind crossover trial . 100 tDCS-naïve healthy volunteers were incorrectly advised that they there were taking part in a trial of tDCS  on word memory . Participants attended for two separate sessions . In each session , they completed a word memory task , then received active or sham tDCS ( order r and omised ) at 2 mA stimulation intensity for 20 minutes and then repeated the word memory task . They then judged whether they believed they had received active stimulation and rated their confidence in that judgement . The blinded assessor noted when red marks were observed at the electrode sites post-stimulation . Results tDCS at 2 mA was not effectively blinded . That is , participants correctly judged the stimulation condition greater than would be expected to by chance at both the first session ( kappa level of agreement ( κ ) 0.28 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.09 to 0.47 p = 0.005 ) and the second session ( κ = 0.77 , 95%CI 0.64 to 0.90 ) , p = < 0.001 ) indicating inadequate participant blinding . Redness at the reference electrode site was noticeable following active stimulation more than sham stimulation ( session one , κ = 0.512 , 95%CI 0.363 to 0.66 , p<0.001 ; session two , κ = 0.677 , 95%CI 0.534 to 0.82 ) indicating inadequate assessor blinding . Conclusions Our results suggest that blinding in studies using tDCS at intensities of 2 mA is inadequate . Positive results from such studies should be interpreted with cautionTitle 5:Transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS): A tool for double-blind sham-controlled clinical studies in brain stimulationAbstract 5:OBJECTIVE Brain polarization in the form of transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , which influences motor function and learning processes , has been proposed as an adjuvant strategy to enhance training effects in Neurorehabilitation . Proper testing in Neurorehabilitation requires double-blind sham-controlled study design s. Here , we evaluated the effects of tDCS and sham stimulation ( SHAM ) on healthy subjects and stroke patients ' self-report measures of attention , fatigue , duration of elicited sensations and discomfort . METHODS tDCS or SHAM was in all cases applied over the motor cortex . Attention , fatigue , and discomfort were self rated by study participants using visual analog scales . Duration of perceived sensations and the ability to distinguish tDCS from Sham sessions were determined . Investigators question ing the patients were blind to the intervention type . RESULTS tDCS and SHAM elicited comparably minimal discomfort and duration of sensations in the absence of differences in attention or fatigue , and could not be distinguished from SHAM by study participants nor investigators . CONCLUSIONS Successful blinding of subjects and investigators and ease of application simultaneously with training protocol s supports the feasibility of using tDCS in double-blind , sham-controlled r and omized trials in clinical Neurorehabilitation .

Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone, recognized as a critical mediator of the balance between food intake and energy expenditure by signalling through its functional receptor (Ob-Rb) in the hypothalamus. Structurally, leptin belongs to the long-chain helical cytokine family, and is now known to have pleiotropic functions in both innate and adaptive immunity. The presence of the functional leptin receptor in the lung together with evidence of increased airspace leptin levels arising during pulmonary inflammation, suggests an important role for leptin in lung development, respiratory immune responses and eventually pathogenesis of inflammatory respiratory diseases. The purpose of this article is to review our current understanding of leptin and its functional role on the different resident cell types of the lung in health as well as in the context of three major respiratory conditions being chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and pneumonia.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: It took more than two decades until the etiologic agent, Hantaan virus (HTNV), was isolated from the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius,  detected in part by the binding of antibodies from patient serum samples to the lung tissues of healthy, wild-caught field mice [17, 18] . The virus was later found to represent the type species of a new genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae, although it was later apparent that the first hantavirus to be isolated was the shrew-borne Thottapalayam virus [19] . The categorization of hantaviruses as belonging to the family Bunyaviridae is due in part to the consistent presence of three RNA genomes that are circularized in vivo as a result of the presence of terminal complementary nucleotides that help fold the genome into a -hairpin‖ morphology, first described for the Uukuniemi phlebovirus [19, 20] . Table 1 is a list of the predominant, serologically distinct pathogenic hantaviruses. Many other named genotypes are described, but such other pathogenic forms are generally closely related to Andes or, in some cases, Sin Nombre virus. During virus maturation, the precursor form GPC is processed using a membrane -bound protease into Gn and Gc, a cleavage that occurs, and appears to be signaled, after the conserved peptide signal WAASA at the C-terminal of Gn [24] . Although the two proteins can be expressed independently through transfection, they can be retained in the wrong cellular compartment (ER or aggresome); they thus must be co-expressed to allow them stability so that the two can be assembled correctly in the Golgi [25, [27] [28] [29] . A number of activities and properties have been identified for the hantavirus envelope glycoproteins, including some features that are suspected to be involved in the pathogenicity of the disease-causing serotypes, a possibility that has engendered experimental attention. The glycoproteins are the known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors, the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor, or DAF [30, 31] ; with gC1qR/p32 also identified as another potential entry receptor [32] . Comparisons with the tick-borne encephalitis virus E protein, led Tischler et al. to consider the Gc glycoprotein as a potential class II fusion protein, perhaps imparting fusion activity to the virion, and this hypothesis has gained support in other studies [33, 34] . Additional activities have been identified with, or claimed to be related to, Gn. For many of these studies, an underlying premise has held that there are differences between the glycoproteins of -pathogenic‖ hantaviruses relative to viruses in the genus that are dubbed to be -non-pathogenic‖. While it is true that it has not yet been possible to link Prospect Hill virus (PHV) to human disease, the absence of evidence for its pathogenicity should perhaps not be equated with the evidence of its absence. One might only consider that the level of disease (e.g., lethargy, fever, proteinuria, and azotemia) associated with infection of nonhuman primates by PHV is not significantly different from that recorded for nonhuman primate models using the known-pathogen Puumala virus (PUUV) [35, 36] . For the purpose of this discussion we will presume that apathogenic hantaviruses are indeed apathogenic. While some studies have suggested that Gn glycoproteins are directed more rapidly into the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway than are apathogenic forms, others have interpreted differences in the handling of Gn glycoproteins across hantavirus species by the ubiquitin-proteosomal system as independent of pathogenicity [37] [38] [39] . Some investigators have directed their efforts toward identifying a differential capacity, either kinetic or in absolute magnitude, in the ability of pathogenic and apathogenic hantaviruses to elicit an interferon response in cells. One premise that emerges is that apathogenic forms would tend to induce an earlier innate response that would render it more likely that the virus would be quickly cleared or rendered less competent in its replication so as to blunt any pathological response in the host [40] [41] [42] . The anti-hantavirus innate response can in some cases be attributed to viral interaction as a ligand of TLR-3, but not in others, and in endothelial cells, it appears not to require more than the viral particle itself, even when introduced in replication-incompetent form [43, 44] . Proteins and mRNAs prominently induced by hantaviruses include MxA and IFIT-1 (ISG-56) and others including some with known or suspected anti-viral activity. Those hantaviruses, often highly pathogenic strains, that fail to induce a potent antiviral response, are suspected or presumed to have a (more) potent interferon-pathway antagonism mechanism relative to other viruses, a mechanism that acts positively to prevent an effective innate response from forming, at least early in infection [42, 45] . Yet some instances are reported wherein highly pathogenic hantaviruses, such as SNV, are also able to induce expression of interferon-stimulated gene mRNAs, even very early in infection, with ISG proteins, as expected, taking longer to appear in the cell [44] . Anti-interferon activities have also been attributed to the NSs protein that may be elaborated in cells infected by serotypes that encode this protein [46] . Other investigators have examined the activities of hantavirus glycoproteins and other proteins that might themselves directly affect some aspects of the pathogenic progression associated with hantavirus infection of humans, such as vascular permeability changes. While early attempts to directly cause increases in permeability of endothelial monolayers with viral particles or viral infection were largely disappointing, hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating VEG-F-induced endothelial permeability [47, 48] . The shorter (50-kD) nucleocapsid or N protein is a structural component of the viral nucleocapsid, along with the genomic viral RNA segments. As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments with high affinity [49, 50] , it limits the access of the RNA to host nucleases and helps to render viral replication a closed process within the cytoplasm. It also acts as a peripheral membrane protein, as does the L protein [51] , an activity that could play a role in its presumed, but not yet demonstrated function as matrix [52] . Until recently, it had not been appreciated that N has a wide variety of other activities, some of which can be linked, not only to fundamental requirements of replication, but also to the interference with an array of the intracellular processes of the normal cell. Thus, an interaction between the amino terminus of the hantavirus N protein and the cellular protein Daxx has been proposed, with the suggestion of potential pro-apoptotic consequences [51] . N is also reported to interact with actin microfilaments, and the SUMO-1 protein [53, 54] . Using reporter-gene based assays, Connie Schmaljohn and her colleagues have reported that Hantaan virus' nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B). The effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS [55] . In the cytoplasm of infected cells, N protein can be found in cellular P bodies where it sequesters and protects 5' caps. It may locate the caps through its interaction with DCP1, a key constituent of P bodies. During hantavirus infection, the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies, through their interaction with N and DCP1. The N protein demonstrates preferential protection of mRNAs engineered to prematurely terminate their encoded protein in comparison to native mRNAs [56] . N protein has been increasingly linked to viral replication and translation, sometimes in previously unanticipated ways. It is among a growing family of diverse viral proteins that can serve as a nonspecific -RNA chaperone‖, an activity that should facilitate the L polymerase's access to vRNA for transcription and replication, in that it can transiently dissociate misfolded RNA structures [57] . Some of N protein's effects on translation might not immediately be recognized to be adaptive in nature. It can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex, simultaneously presenting the ribosome with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eIF 4E, binding to the 43S pre-initiation complex as does eIF 4G, while replacing the helicase activity of eIF 4A, which is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure [56, 58] . These three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation. In P bodies, N protein's ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides, along with its activity in protecting capped RNAs from degradation likely facilitates the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation by L polymerase (-cap snatching‖). Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi [27] . The N proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions, and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that N tracks along microtubules but not with actin filaments [52] . The ultimate destination for N, for its assembly into viral particles is the Golgi, and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), also known as vesicular-tubular cluster [52] . A dominant negative inhibitor, dynamitin, associated with dynein-mediated transport, reduced N's accumulation in the Golgi. Later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to Old World hantaviruses such as HTNV, but that the New World hantavirus ANDV is instead associated with actin filaments [59] . However, recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the New World hantavirus SNV [60] . Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression ( Table 2 ). The pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is the topic of a continuously-updated review in the series UpToDate [61] . By the time symptoms appear in HCPS, both strong antiviral responses, and, for the more virulent viral genotypes, viral RNA can be detected in blood plasma or nucleated blood cells respectively [63, 64] . At least three studies have correlated plasma viral RNA with disease severity for HCPS and HFRS, suggesting that the replication of the virus plays an ongoing and real-time role in viral pathogenesis [65] [66] [67] . Several hallmark pathologic changes have been identified that occur in both HFRS and HCPS. A critical feature of both is a transient (~ 1-5 days) capillary leak involving the kidney and retroperitoneal space in HFRS and the lungs in HCPS. The resulting leakage is exudative in character, with chemical composition high in protein and resembling plasma. The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses. It is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. The virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia, a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections [62, 63] . By the time that secondary viremia emerges, the agents of the more severe forms of HFRS and HCPS have begun to achieve sufficient mass as to induce, through PAMP-PRR interactions and other means, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [64] . For HCPS, that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs, yet, for unknown reasons, spares the retroperitoneum and, in general, the kidney. In HFRS the situation is reversed, and yet it is often not appreciated that the expected preferential tissue tropism of HFRS-associated viruses and their HCPS-associated counterparts for the renal and pulmonary beds, respectively, is not as one would predict through the manifestations of the two diseases. Local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms, with those abnormalities sometimes culminating in shock and death. Yet it is not hypoxemia, due to the prominent pulmonary edema, that leads to death in most fatal cases of HCPS, but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators that leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome [64, 65] . It is tempting to speculate that mediators produced in the lung in connection with the inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in HCPS, a disadvantageous consequence of the close anatomic juxtaposition of the two organs. Thus, at least three classes of potential mechanisms, some overlapping and all certainly nonexclusive of the others, could be presumed to underlie the pathogenesis of HCPS. These include:(1) Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) with the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 [43] . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells [66] and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells [67] . (2) Direct viral effects. The observed correlation between viral load and disease severity leaves the possibility open that hantavirus particles or RNA can themselves have toxic effects on cells or on signaling. Some investigators have favored direct viral toxicity, acting through the inhibition of endothelial cell barrier function, as an explanation for much of the capillary leak, although there is widespread agreement that multiple mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis likely operate simultaneously in the affected patient [68] .Question: Where was HTNV isolated from?","answer":"from the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius,"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Virulence factors produced by S. pneumoniae have been known to contribute significantly to the disease process. ClpP protease (ClpP) which is essential for virulence and survival under stress conditions in S. pneumonia was examined for the ability to induce apoptosis and the mechanism of the induction of apoptosis in human neuron-like cells, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. ClpP inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells. Treatment with ClpP resulted in hypodiploid DNA contents, increased Bax/ Bcl-2 ratio and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, which is an initiator of the activation of caspase cascades, was not observed in ClpP-treated cells. In addition, pretreatment with Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), a broad spectrum of caspase inhibitor, could not rescue apoptotic cells from ClpP toxicity. Coincidently, caspase-3 and -8 activation and cleavage of PARP were not detected. Moreover, caspase independent apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was released from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus in response to ClpP. We also found that ClpP treatment resulted in the increase of p53 activity and cytoplasmic p53 levels were increased by ClpP, suggesting that functional activation of p53 is intact despite increased cytoplasmic accumulation. Taken together, these data suggest that ClpP contributes to neuronal damage in meningitis and provide further insight into the mechanisms underlying action of pneumococcal virulence factors during bacterial pathogenesis.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"oxygen\\", \\"Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone\\", \\"Z-VAD-fmk\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Bcl-2\\", \\"protease\\", \\"Streptococcus pneumoniae ClpP\\", \\"apoptosis-inducing factor\\", \\"ClpP\\", \\"p53\\", \\"caspase-3 and -8\\", \\"cytochrome c\\", \\"caspase\\", \\"AIF\\", \\"Bax\\", \\"PARP\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify changes in protein phosphorylation that occurred during recovery from arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle caused by DNA damage. We identified 154 proteins that were differentially phosphorylated, and systematic depletion of each of these differentially phosphorylated proteins by small interfering RNA (siRNA) identified at least 10 potential regulators of recovery. Astrin, a protein associated with the mitotic spindle, was among the potential regulators of recovery. We found that astrin controlled the abundance of the cell cycle regulator p53 during DNA damage-induced arrest. Cells in which astrin was depleted had decreased murine double minute 2 (MDM2) abundance and increased p53 at the later stages of the DNA damage response. Astrin was required for continued expression of genes encoding proteins that promote cell cycle progression in arrested cells. Thus, by controlling p53 abundance in cells recovering from DNA damage, astrin maintains the cells in a state competent to resume the cell cycle.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Astrin\\", \\"astrin\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"MDM2\\", \\"murine double minute 2\\", \\"p53\\", \\"astrin\\", \\"Astrin\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Recent genetic studies have suggested that PAX4, a member of the paired box (PAX) gene family, is involved in the mechanism regulating the fate of pancreatic islet endocrine progenitor cells. Murine PAX4 was originally identified by genomic screening and, to date, only a partial sequence of PAX4 has been reported. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of mouse PAX4 by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using RNA from MIN6 cells, a mouse insulinoma cell line. The full length of cDNA was 1.38 kb, consistent with the estimated size of the transcript by Northern blot. The deduced mouse PAX4 protein was 349 amino acids and had the predicted molecular weight of 38 kDa. Two DNA binding motifs, a 128-amino acid paired domain and a 61-amino acid paired-type homeodomain exhibit the highest amino acid homology with PAX6 (71.2%, 65.0%, respectively), another member of the PAX gene family. However, the sequence of the C-terminal segment of PAX4 diverged and showed no significant homology with any other known PAX genes. As to the genomic DNA, the coding region of the mouse PAX4 gene spanned approximately 5.5 kb and was composed of 10 exons. In the public DNA database, a human cosmid (g1572c264), which was localized on human chromosome 7q31.3, was found to contain a gene homologous to PAX4. The nucleotide and protein sequence homologies between mouse PAX4 and its human homologue were 83.1% and 80.0%, respectively. Interestingly, the ARP5 (ADP-ribosylation factor 5) gene was also found in the same cosmid g1572c264, suggesting the ARP5 gene to be adjacent to the human PAX4 homologue. The human cosmid g1572c264 contains at least four SSRPs (simple sequence repeat polymorphism), which could be used for genetic linkage studies of the locus. The results of this study, i.e. isolation of the full-length cDNA sequence of PAX4 and identification of the homologous human gene, will facilitate further functional and genetic studies of the PAX4 gene.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"DNA binding motifs\\", \\"PAX4\\", \\"PAX\\", \\"ADP-ribosylation factor 5\\", \\"PAX6\\", \\"paired box\\", \\"ARP5\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

We have developed and applied Dynamic Organellar Maps, a proteomic method that allows global mapping of protein translocation events. We initially used maps statically to generate a database with localization and absolute copy number information for over 8700 proteins from HeLa cells, approaching comprehensive coverage. All major organelles were resolved, with exceptional prediction accuracy( estimated at >92%). Combining spatial and abundance information yielded an unprecedented quantitative view of HeLa cell anatomy and organellar composition, at the protein level. We subsequently demonstrated the dynamic capabilities of the approach by capturing translocation events following EGF stimulation, which we integrated into a quantitative model. Dynamic Organellar Maps enable the proteome-wide analysis of physiological protein movements, without requiring any reagents specific to the investigated process, and will thus be widely applicable in cell biology.Introduction:The hallmark of eukaryotic cells is their compartmentalization into distinct membrane-bound organelles. Protein function is critically determined by subcellular localization, as organelles offer different chemical environments and interaction partners. In order to regulate protein activity, many biological processes involve changes in protein subcellular localization. Prominent examples include the endocytic uptake of activated plasma membrane signalling receptors, to terminate the signalling process( Jones and Rappoport, 2014), and the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of many transcription factors, to regulate their access to DNA( Plotnikov et al., 2011). The ability to monitor changes in organellar composition would provide a powerful tool to investigate cell biological processes at the systems level. While transcriptomic( Curtis et al., 2012) and proteomic abundance profiling approaches( Deeb et al., 2015) have yielded valuable insights into changes in gene or protein expression, they lack the important spatial dimension. Microscopy-based approaches can provide spatial information on individual proteins( Uhlen et al., 2015), but are limited by the availability of specific antibodies, and are very labour-intensive for analysing complete proteomes( Marx, 2015). Genome-wide GFP-tagging in yeast circumvents the need for antibodies( Huh et al., 2003), but tags may inadvertently alter protein subcellular localisation, which is difficult to control for; in addition, serial imaging of cells for comparative purposes remains experimentally challenging( Breker et al., 2013). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has much enhanced our understanding of cellular composition( Larance and Lamond, 2015). Although sophisticated approaches for organellar proteomics have been available for over a decade( Andersen et al., 2003; Christoforou et al., 2016; Dunkley et al., 2004; Foster et al., 2006; Gilchrist et al., 2006; Smirle et al., 2013), there is currently no proteomic method that allows global dynamic mapping of protein subcellular localization. The main reason for this deficiency is the high variability between spatial proteomics experiments, which renders the identification of genuine organellar transitions very difficult( Gatto et al., 2014). Here, we have developed a rapid proteomic profiling workflow for the generation of highly reproducible organellar maps. We use the method to assemble a comprehensive database of protein subcellular localization and abundance information from HeLa cells, allowing us to build a quantitative model of cellular anatomy. We then apply organellar maps to capture the protein translocation events triggered by EGF stimulation, demonstrating the dynamic capabilities of our approach.Discussion:Here, we provide localization information for 8710 proteins in HeLa cells. The database is accessible via an Excel file( Supplementary file 4) and a website( www. MapOfTheCell. org), which provide complementary features for analysing the data. Both contain information on protein abundance( copy numbers per cell), global cellular distributions( eg cytosolic vs membrane pools), and predicted organellar associations. In addition, the website offers visualization and interactive exploration of the maps. Supplementary file 4 provides an extra local ‘neighbourhood analysis’ identifying proteins with highly similar fractionation profiles( useful for identifying potential protein complexes), and also allows easy annotation of whole protein families via its batch submission option. The complexity of the HeLa proteome has been estimated at around 10, 000 proteins( Beck et al., 2011; Nagaraj et al., 2011); a substantial proportion of this is covered by our database. Importantly, it accounts for the vast majority of protein cell mass( as can for example be seen from the cumulative mass plots in Figure 3B, which all reach a stable plateau); further identifications would mostly correspond to low abundance proteins, with minimal contributions to organellar composition. In this respect, our database approaches comprehensive coverage, and offers a quantitative view of cellular architecture( Figure 3). The relative sizes of organelles differ significantly between cell types; the approach presented here allows a comparatively rapid characterization at a level previously only achievable through extensive morphological studies. A future comparison of different cell types will substantially enhance our understanding of cellular identity, by uncovering universal features and specific adaptations. In addition to the organellar level, it will also give new insights for individual proteins, by revealing cell- or species-specific localization differences, and thus potentially new regulatory or functional aspects. The profiling approach presented here maximizes speed and simplicity of the subcellular fractionation procedure. This ensures reproducibility, and at the same time keeps organelles as intact as possible. Since the preparative aspects are straightforward, several fractionations can be carried out in parallel on the same day, allowing multiplexing and complex experimental designs. Relative to the previous LOPIT approach( localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging; Christoforou et al., 2016), our fractionation protocol is five times faster( 4 hr vs ~20 hr), and requires an order of magnitude less starting material( 107 cells vs 108 cells). Most importantly, our method can be used comparatively, and also offers quantitative data on protein abundance; a comparative application of LOPIT has yet to be demonstrated. The peptide labelling strategy allows very flexible use of LOPIT; our method requires metabolic labelling( SILAC), currently rendering it most suitable for dividing cells in culture. However, an application of fractionation profiling to mammalian tissues is possible, since mice can be kept on a SILAC diet( Zanivan et al., 2012); alternatively, a representative mix of SILAC-labelled cell lines may be used to generate the reference fraction( SuperSILAC approach[Geiger et al., 2010]). In addition, mass tagging is in principle compatible with our approach, too, and may thus extend its range of applications in future. A detailed comparison of the methods’ relative advantages and requirements is presented in Supplementary file 8. Our organellar assignments are in excellent agreement with independent external data( Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 3). Furthermore, we made a direct comparison with a recent analysis of the mouse stem cell spatial proteome using LOPIT( Christoforou et al., 2016). 2397 homologous proteins were classified in both studies, of which 2196 had identical compartment predictions( 91. 6%; Supplementary file 3). This exceptionally high level of agreement, across species and cell types, reciprocally supports the very high accuracy of predictions in both datasets. Organellar maps based on subcellular fractionation profiles reflect protein steady state localizations. Proteins predominantly associated with a single organelle have closely matching profiles, and can be assigned unambiguously. In contrast, proteins equally split over two( or more) compartments have mixed profiles, which may be difficult to interpret( Gatto et al., 2014). Here, we assign each protein to the most likely compartment, but potential secondary assignments are also indicated( Supplementary file 4). Furthermore, our two-tiered profiling approach considerably alleviates the dual-localization problem, by separating organellar predictions from quantifying a protein’s nuclear, cytosolic and membrane pools. This allows, for example, the accurate characterization of nuclear-cytosolic shuttling proteins: instead of showing an ambiguous ‘in between’ state, our approach precisely determines how these proteins are distributed over the two compartments. Similarly, for proteins with a cytosolic and an organellar pool, it allows quantification of the distribution, in addition to identification of the membrane compartment. Of note, our dynamic implementation of maps is generally unaffected by multiple localization difficulties, since we uncouple the detection of protein translocations from organellar assignments( Figure 4). Thus, our approach allows the identification of translocation events, even if they only involve partial organellar transitions. Here, we have used organellar maps to analyse cellular events following EGF stimulation. We correctly captured the endosomal transition of EGF receptor, and recruitment of signalling adaptors. Remarkably, the translocations were detected with extremely stringent FDR control, using cut-offs where we expect no false positives. This supports that our approach is capable of identifying translocation events de novo, without having to filter results based on prior knowledge. Furthermore, in combining the translocation data with protein copy number estimations, we provide a genuine systems-biology approach to EGF signalling at the protein level( Figure 5). Unlike transcriptomic or proteomic profiling, our approach allows detection of cellular rearrangements at very early time points after stimulation, long before changes in protein abundance occur. The entire experiment( triplicate comparisons, six maps) required only five days of mass spectrometry measuring time. In total, our analysis identified 40 translocation events, including numerous previously unreported movements. Among them are ten major regulators of actin dynamics, such as the kinases ROCK2, PKN2, PIK3C2B, and their downstream targets ADD1 and CTNN1, as well as PALLD, LASP1, and UTRN, suggesting that re-arrangement of the cytoskeleton is one of the major immediate effects of EGF signalling in HeLa cells. For several of these proteins, this study provides the first experimental evidence that they are targets of the EGF pathway( Supplementary file 7). Our data also reveal an unexpected cross-talk with other signalling pathways; Vasorin-shedding, AHNK and PDCD4 rerouting are all likely to counteract anti-proliferative TGFB signalling, and may serve to enhance EGF activity. Strikingly, we observed several transcriptional regulators leaving the nucleus. While nuclear import of proteins, such as ERK2/MAPK1, is a common downstream effect of signalling, nuclear protein export has been reported comparatively rarely. A possible explanation is that this type of movement is more difficult to detect with conventional approaches, such as microscopy: protein import concentrates the signal in the nucleus, whereas export diffuses it. Taken together, these observations highlight the power of the holistic proteomic approach, which identifies the co-ordinated behaviour of functionally linked groups of proteins, and thus uncovers cellular response modules. This study demonstrates that dynamic organellar maps can shed new light even on relatively well-studied processes, such as EGF uptake. We propose that they will be similarly suitable in the fields of autophagy, membrane trafficking and cellular differentiation, providing a powerful complement to imaging-based techniques. Since they offer an unbiased approach to studying cellular dynamics that does not require prior knowledge, they will also be an effective tool for exploratory investigations of poorly characterized processes. The possibility to combine maps with high-throughput phosphoproteomics data( Humphrey et al., 2015) promises to provide unprecedented views of signalling, by linking the movement of substrates to their phosphorylation status. Moreover, as we have shown here, organellar maps will pave the way for quantitative process modelling in cell biology.","answer":"The interior of every cell is highly organised , and contains many compartments , called organelles , that are dedicated to specific roles .

But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated moral bias was restricted to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass? In this paper, we discuss and show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language representations also improve the representation of the underlying ethical and moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic representation of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral Choice Machine (MCM) to extract more accurate imprints of moral choices and ethical values.Assumptions and BackgroundIn this section, we review our assumptions, in particular what we mean by moral choices, and the required background, following closely BIBREF0.Moral Choices. Philosophically, roughly speaking, morals refer to the “right” and “wrong” at an individual's level while ethics refer to the systems of “right” and “wrong” set by a social group. Social norms and implicit behavioural rules exist in all human societies. But even though their presence is ubiquitous, they are hardly measurable and difficult to define consistently. The underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Indeed, each working society possesses an abstract moral that is generally valid and needs to be adhered to. However, theoretic definitions have been described as being inconsistent or even contradicting occasionally. Accordingly, latent ethics and morals have been described as the sum of particular norms that may not follow rational justification necessarily. Recently, BIBREF9 (BIBREF9) for instance suggested that moral norms are determined to a large extent by what is perceived to be common convention.With regards to complexity and intangibility of ethics and morals, we restrict ourselves to a rather basic implementation of this construct, following the theories of deontological ethics. These ask which choices are morally required, forbidden, or permitted instead of asking which kind of a person we should be or which consequences of our actions are to be preferred. Thus, norms are understood as universal rules of what to do and what not to do. Therefore, we focus on the valuation of social acceptance in single verbs and single verbs with surrounding context information —e.g. trust my friend or trust a machine— to figure out which of them represent a Do and which tend to be a Don't. Because we specifically chose templates in the first person, i.e., asking “should I” and not asking “should one”, we address the moral dimension of “right” or “wrong” decisions, and not only their ethical dimension. This is the reason why we will often use the term “moral”, although we actually touch upon “ethics” and “moral”. To measure the valuation, we make use of implicit association tests (IATs) and their connections to word embeddings.Word and Sentence Embeddings. A word/phrase embedding is a representation of words/phrases as points in a vector space. All approaches have in common that more related or even similar text entities lie close to each other in the vector space, whereas distinct words/phrases can be found in distant regions BIBREF10. This enables determining semantic similarities in a language.Although these techniques have been around for some time, their potential increased considerably with the emergence of deep distributional approaches. In contrast to previous implementations, those embeddings are built on neural networks (NNs) and enable a rich variety of mathematical vector operations. One of the initial and most widespread algorithms to train word embeddings is Word2Vec BIBREF11, where unsupervised feature extraction and learning is conducted per word on either CBOW or Skip-gram NNs. This can be extended to full sentences BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF12.Bias in Text Embeddings. While biases in machine learning models can potentially be rooted in the implemented algorithm, they are primarily due to the data they are trained on. BIBREF5 (BIBREF5) empirically showed that human language reflects our stereotypical biases. Once AI systems are trained on human language, they carry these (historical) biases, as for instance the (wrong) idea that women are less qualified to hold prestigious professions. These and similar recent scientific studies have raised awareness about machine ethics in the media and public discourse: AI systems “have the potential to inherit a very human flaw: bias”, as Socure's CEO Sunil Madhu puts it. Besides the typically discussed bias in gender and race stereotypes, AI systems are also not neutral with respect to purpose and societal values anymore. Ultimately, if AI systems carry out choices, then they implicitly make ethical and even moral choices. Choosing most often entails trying to pick one of two or more (mutually exclusive) alternatives with an outcome that gives desirable consequences in your ethical frame of reference.Moral Subspace ProjectionAs BIBREF0 (BIBREF0) showed the question/answer template is an appropriate method to extract moral biases. However as BIBREF13 (BIBREF13) showed, one is also able to even adapt the model's bias, e.g. debias the model's gender bias. They describe that the first step for debiasing word embeddings is to identify a direction (or, more generally, a subspace) of the embedding that captures the bias.To identify the gender subspace, e.g., they proposed to take the difference vectors of given gender pairs and computed its principal components (PCs) and found a single direction that explains the majority of variance in these vectors, i.e. the first eigenvalue is significantly larger than the rest. Therefore, they argue that the top PC, denoted by the unit vector g, captures the gender subspace. Subsequently, they debias the embedding based on this subspace. Please note that the gender pairs are labelled beforehand.Using the above-mentioned methodology, we propose an alternative to identify the moral bias. Inspired by BIBREF13, we first compute the moral subspace of the text embedding. Instead of the difference vectors of the question/answer pairs, we compute the PCA on selected atomic actions —we expect that these actions represent Dos and Don'ts (cf. Appendix). We formulate the actions as questions, i.e. using question templates, and compute the mean embedding, since this amplifies their moral score BIBREF0. Similar to the gender subspace, if the first eigenvalue is significantly larger than the rest, the top PC, denoted by the unit vector m, captures the moral subspace and therefore also the moral bias. Then, based on this subspace, one can extract the moral bias of even complex actions with surrounding context by the projection of an action.Appendix ::: Moral Choice MachineBIBREF0 (BIBREF0) developed Moral Choice Machine computes the cosine similarity in a sentence embedding space of an arbitrary action embedded in question/answer pairs. This is illustrated in Fig. FIGREF16 for the moral bias of the action murder. Since murdering is a quite destructive and generally refused behaviour, the questions are expected to lie closer to the denying response and thus to yield a negative bias. To create a more meaningful and comprehensive statistic, several question/answer prompts were conflated to a question/answer template (cf. Tab. TABREF15). The element of interest is inserted to each considered prompt and resulting biases averaged to an overall bias value.Appendix ::: Implicit Associations in Word EmbeddingsTransferring the approach of implicit associations from human subjects to information retrieval systems on natural text was initially suggested by Caliskan et al. (BIBREF5), who reported some basic effects of the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). Whereas the strength of association in human minds is defined by response latency in Implicit Association Tests (IAT), it is here instantiated as cosine similarity of text in the Euclidean space. Similar to the IAT, complex concepts are defined by word sets. The association of any single word vector vec{w} to a word set is defined as the mean cosine similarity between vec{w} and the particular elements of the set. Now, let there be two sets of target words X and Y. The allocation of vec{w} to two discriminating association sets A and B can be formulated asA word with representation vec{w} that is stronger associated to concept A yields a positive value and representation related to B a negative value.Appendix ::: Association SetsThe complete lists of positive and negative association words that were applied for generating Dos and Don'ts with Verb Extraction are given in Tab. TABREF20. The words were collected from four different literature sources that provide unspecific association sets to define pleasant and unpleasant associations BIBREF14, BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF15.Appendix ::: Dos and Don’ts for the Moral Choice MachineTab. TABREF22 lists the most positive associated verbs (in decreasing order).Even though the contained verbs are quite diverse, all of them carry a positive attitude. Some of the verbs are related to celebration or travelling, others to love matters or physical closeness. All elements of the above set are rather of general and unspecific nature. Analogously, Tab. TABREF23 presents the most negative associated verbs (in decreasing order) we found in our vocabulary.Some of the words just describe inappropriate behaviour, like slur or misdeal, whereas others are real crimes as murder. And still others words, as for instance suppurate or rot, appear to be disgusting in the first place. Exculpate is not a bad behaviour per se. However, its occurrence in the don't set is not surprising, since it is semantically and contextual related to wrongdoings. Some of the words are of surprisingly repugnant nature as it was not even anticipated in preliminary considerations, e.g. depopulate or dehumanise. Undoubtedly, the listed words can be accepted as commonly agreed Don'ts. Both lists include few words are rather common as a noun or adjectives, as joy, long, gift or bad. Anyhow, they can also be used as verbs and comply the requirements of being a do or a don't in that function. The allocation of verbs into Dos and Don'ts was confirmed by the affective lexicon AFINN BIBREF16. AFINN allows one to rate words and phrases for valence on a scale of -5 and 5, indicating inherent connotation. Elements with no ratings are treated as neutral (0.0).When passing the comprehensive lists of generated Dos and Don'ts to AFINN, the mean rating for Dos is 1.12 (std=1.24) and for Don'ts -0.90 (std=1.22). The t-test statistic yielded values of t = 8.12 with p < .0001^{*}. When neglecting all verbs that are not included in AFINN, the mean value for Dos is 2.34 (std=0.62, n = 24) and the mean for Don'ts -2.37 (std = 0.67, n=19), with again highly significant statistics (t = 23.28, p<.0001^{*}). Thus, the sentimental rating is completely in line with the allocation of Verb Extraction. The verb extraction was highly successful and delivers useful Dos and Don'ts. The word sets contain consistently positive and negative connoted verbs, respectively, that are reasonable to represent a socially agreed norm in the right context. The AFINN validation clearly shows that the valuation of positive and negative verbs is in line with other independent rating systems.Appendix ::: Moral Bias of USE and BERTThe following results were computed with the MCM version of BIBREF0 (BIBREF0) using both USE and BERT as sentence embedding. Specifically, to investigate whether the sentiments of the extracted Dos and Don'ts also hold for more complex sentence level, we inserted them into the question/answer templates of Moral Choice Machine BIBREF0. The resulting moral biases scores/choices are summarized in Tab. TABREF28. It presents the moral biases exemplary for the top ten Dos and Don'ts by WEAT value of both sets. The threshold between the groups is not 0, but slightly shifted negatively (Using USE further shifted than Using BERT). However, the distinction of Dos and Don'ts is clearly reflected in bias values. Using USE the mean bias of all considered elements is -0.018 (std=0.025), whereat the mean of Dos is -0.001 (std=0.190, n=50) and the mean of Don'ts -0.037 (std=0.017, n=50). Using BERT the mean bias of all considered elements is -0.054 (std=0.11), whereat the mean of Dos is 0.041 (std=0.064, n=50) and the mean of Don'ts -0.163 (std=0.053, n=50).Furthermore Tab. TABREF29 shows the resulting moral biases scores/choices for action with additional surrounding context exemplary for the top ten Dos and Don'ts of both sentence embeddings.Figure 4: Context-based actions projected —based on PCA computed by selected atomic actions— along two axes: x (top PC) defines the moral direction m (Left: Dos and right: Don’ts). Compare Tab. 9(Appendix) for detailed moral bias scores.Table 6: The context-based actions to extract the bias from a moral subspaceTable 7: Comparison of MCM with the two different text embeddings USE and BERT on atomic actions.

All tested atomic and context based actions are listed. m < 0 corresponds to a positive moral score and m > 0 corresponds to a negative moral score.

To investigate the underlying causes of chemoresistance in malignant pleural mesothelioma, we have studied mesothelioma cell lines as 3D spheroids, which acquire increased chemoresistance compared to 2D monolayers. We asked whether the gene expression of 3D spheroids would reveal mechanisms of resistance. To address this, we measured gene expression of three mesothelioma cell lines, M28, REN and VAMT, grown as 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids. A total of 209 genes were differentially expressed in common by the three cell lines in 3D (138 upregulated and 71 downregulated), although a clear resistance pathway was not apparent. We then compared the list of 3D genes with two publicly available datasets of gene expression of 56 pleural mesotheliomas compared to normal tissues. Interestingly, only three genes were increased in both 3D spheroids and human tumors: argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), annexin A4 (ANXA4) and major vault protein (MVP); of these, ASS1 was the only consistently upregulated of the three genes by qRT-PCR. To measure ASS1 protein expression, we stained 2 sets of tissue microarrays (TMA): one with 88 pleural mesothelioma samples and the other with additional 88 pleural mesotheliomas paired with matched normal tissues. Of the 176 tumors represented on the two TMAs, ASS1 was expressed in 87 (50%; staining greater than 1 up to 3+). For the paired samples, ASS1 expression in mesothelioma was significantly greater than in the normal tissues. Reduction of ASS1 expression by siRNA significantly sensitized mesothelioma spheroids to the pro-apoptotic effects of bortezomib and of cisplatin plus pemetrexed . Although mesothelioma is considered by many to be an ASS1-deficient tumor, our results show that ASS1 is elevated at the mRNA and protein levels in mesothelioma 3D spheroids and in human pleural mesotheliomas. We also have uncovered a survival role for ASS1, which may be amenable to targeting to undermine mesothelioma multicellular resistance. sentence: Reduction of ASS1 expression by siRNA significantly sensitized mesothelioma spheroids to the pro-apoptotic effects of bortezomib and of cisplatin plus pemetrexed .","answer":"[[\\"pemetrexed\\", \\"cisplatin\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Insulin receptor substrates (IRS) serine phosphorylation is a time-controlled physiological feedback mechanism in insulin signaling that is hijacked by metabolic and inflammatory stresses to promote insulin resistance. Kinases, including IKKbeta, JNK, ERK, mTOR, and S6 K, activated by the inducers of insulin resistance induce uncontrolled IRS serine phosphorylation. Studies with genetically modified mice reveal that these kinases integrate signals from metabolic and inflammatory stresses in adipose tissue, liver, and hypothalamus leading to peripheral and central insulin resistance. Moreover, IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and JNK1 pathways in myeloid cells represent a core mechanism involved in inflammation linked to obesity. These kinases are thus potential drug targets against insulin resistance and the targeting of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB or the JNK pathway may evolve into future diabetes medication.","answer":"[[\\"serine\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"Insulin receptor substrates\\"], [\\"serine\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"IRS\\"], [\\"serine\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"insulin receptor substrates\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

For suchapplications, one has to perform the approximate inference -predominantly by either sampling from the posterior with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or approximating the posterior with variational inference (VI) methods.MCMC methods provide the unbiased (in the limit) estimate but require careful hyperparameter tuning especially for big datasets and high dimensional problems. The largedataset problem has been addressed for different MCMC algorithms: stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics BID28 , stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo , minibatch MetropolisHastings algorithms BID15 BID1 . One way toaddress the problem of high dimension is the design of a proposal distribution. For example, for the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm there exists a theoretical guideline for scaling the variance of a Gaussian proposal BID24 BID25 . More complexproposal designs include adaptive updates of the proposal distribution during iterations of the MH algorithm BID12 BID7 . Another wayto adapt the MH algorithm for high dimensions is combination of adaptive direction sampling and the multiple-try Metropolis algorithm as proposed in BID17 . Thorough overviewof different extensions of the MH algorithm is presented in BID18 .Variational inferenceis extremely scalable but provides a biased estimate of the target distribution. Using the doubly stochasticprocedure BID27 BID11 VI can be applied to extremely large datasets and high dimensional spaces, such as a space of neural network weights BID14 BID5 . The bias introduced by variationalapproximation can be mitigated by using flexible approximations BID22 and resampling BID9 .Generative Adversarial Networks BID8) (GANs) is a different approach to learn samplers. Under the framework of adversarial trainingdifferent optimization problems could be solved efficiently BID0 BID21 . The shared goal of \\"learning to sample\\" inspiredthe connection of GANs with VI BID19 and MCMC BID26 .In this paper, we propose a novel perspective onlearning to sample from a target distribution by optimizing parameters of either explicit or implicit probabilistic model. Our objective is inspired by the view on the acceptancerate of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a quality measure of the sampler. We derive a lower bound on the acceptance rate and maximizeit with respect to parameters of the sampler, treating the sampler as a proposal distribution in the Metropolis-Hastings scheme.We consider two possible forms of the target distribution: unnormalized density (density-based setting) and a set of samples (sample-based setting). Each of these settings reveals a unifying property of the proposedperspective and the derived lower bound. In the density-based setting, the lower bound is the sum of forwardand reverse KL-divergences between the true posterior and its approximation, connecting our approach to VI. In the sample-based setting, the lower bound admit a form of an adversarialgame between the sampler and a discriminator, connecting our approach to GANs.The closest work to ours is of BID26 . In contrast to their paper our approach (1) is free from hyperparameters; (2) is able to optimize the acceptance rate directly; (3) avoids minimax problem in the density based setting.Our main contributions are as follows:1. We introduce a novel perspective on learning to sample from the target distributionby treating the acceptance rate in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a measure of sampler quality. 2. We derive the lower bound on the acceptance rate allowing for doubly stochasticoptimization of the proposal distribution in case when the target distribution factorizes (i.e. over data points). 3. For sample-based and density-based forms of target distribution we show the connectionof the proposed algorithm to variational inference and GANs.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the lower bound on the AR. Special forms of target distributionare addressed in Section 3. We validate our approachon the problems of approximate Bayesian inference in the spaceof high dimensional neural network weights and generative modeling in the space of images in Section 4. We discuss results and directions of the future work in Section 5.This paper proposes to use the acceptance rate of the MH algorithm as the universal objective for learning to sample from some target distribution.We also propose the lower bound on the acceptance rate that should be preferred over the direct maximization of the acceptance rate in many cases.The proposed approach provides many ways of improvement by the combination with techniques from the recent developments in the field of MCMC, GANs, variational inference.For example• The proposed loss function can be combined with the loss function from BID16 , thus allowing to learn the Markov chain proposal in the density-based setting.•We can use stochastic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for the loss estimation in Algorithm 1. •In sample-based setting one can use more advanced techniques of density ratio estimation.Application of the MH algorithm to improve the quality of generative models also requires exhaustive further exploration and rigorous treatment.","answer":"Learning to sample via lower bounding the acceptance rate of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

In addition, Alice and Bob can use local operations and authenticated public classical communication. Their goal is to establish a key which is unknown to Eve. We initiate the study of this scenario as a unification of two standard scenarios: (i) key distillation (agreement) from classical correlations and (ii) key distillation from pure tripartite quantum states. Firstly, we obtain generalisations of fundamental results related to scenarios (i) and (ii), including upper bounds on the key rate. Moreover, based on an embedding of classical distributions into quantum states, we are able to find new connections between protocols and quantities in the standard scenarios (i) and (ii). Secondly, we study specific properties of key distillation protocols. In particular, we show that every protocol that makes use of pre-shared key can be transformed into an equally efficient protocol which needs no pre-shared key. This result is of practical significance as it applies to quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, but it also implies that the key rate cannot be locked with information on Eve's side. Finally, we exhibit an arbitrarily large separation between the key rate in the standard setting where Eve is equipped with quantum memory and the key rate in a setting where Eve is only given classical memory. This shows that assumptions on the nature of Eve's memory are important in order to determine the correct security threshold in QKD.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: After carrying out a protocol for quantum key agreement over a noisy quantum channel, the parties Alice and Bob must process the raw key in order to end up with identical keys about which the adversary has virtually no information. In principle, both classical and quantum protocols can be used for this processing. It is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful. We show that the limits of tolerable noise are identical for classical and quantum protocols in many cases. More specifically, we prove that a quantum state between two parties is entangled if and only if the classical random variables resulting from optimal measurements provide some mutual classical information between the parties. In addition, we present evidence which strongly suggests that the potentials of classical and of quantum protocols are equal in every situation. An important consequence, in the purely classical regime, of such a correspondence would be the existence of a classical counterpart of so-called bound entanglement, namely \\"bound information\\" that cannot be used for generating a secret key by any protocol. This stands in sharp contrast to what was previously believed.","answer":"The first to spot a relation between the classical and the quantum development were Gisin and Wolf; in analogy to in quantum information theory, they conjectured the existence of , namely classical correlation that can only be created from key but from which no key can be distilled [1] .

The bihelical apolipoprotein mimetic peptide 5A effluxes cholesterol from cells and reduces inflammation and atherosclerosis in animal models. We investigated how hydrophobic residues in the hinge region between the two helices are important in the structure and function of this peptide. By simulated annealing analysis and molecular dynamics modeling, two hydrophobic amino acids, F-18 and W-21, in the hinge region were predicted to be relatively surface-exposed and to interact with the aqueous solvent. Using a series of 5A peptide analogs in which F-18 or W-21 was changed to either F, W, A, or E, only peptides with hydrophobic amino acids in these two positions were able to readily bind and solubilize phospholipid vesicles. Compared with active peptides containing F or W, peptides containing E in either of these two positions were more than 10-fold less effective in effluxing cholesterol by the ABCA1 transporter. Intravenous injection of 5A in C57BL/6 mice increased plasma-free cholesterol (5A: 89.9 ± 13.6 mg/dl; control: 38.7 ± 4.3 mg/dl (mean ± S.D.); P < 0.05) and triglycerides (5A: 887.0 ± 172.0 mg/dl; control: 108.9 ± 9.9 mg/dl; P < 0.05), whereas the EE peptide containing E in both positions had no effect. Finally, 5A increased cholesterol efflux approximately 2.5-fold in vivo from radiolabeled macrophages, whereas the EE peptide was inactive. These results provide a rationale for future design of therapeutic apolipoprotein mimetic peptides and provide new insights into the interaction of hydrophobic residues on apolipoproteins with phospholipids in the lipid microdomain created by the ABCA1 transporter during the cholesterol efflux process.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"triglycerides\\", \\"cholesterol\\", \\"amino acids\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

However, how do we evaluate percepts generated in the absence of direct input that are, therefore, completely unreliable? Here, we utilize the phenomenon of filling-in occurring at the physiological blind-spots to compare partially inferred and veridical percepts. Subjects chose between stimuli that elicit filling-in, and perceptually equivalent ones presented outside the blind-spots, looking for a Gabor stimulus without a small orthogonal inset. In ambiguous conditions, when the stimuli were physically identical and the inset was absent in both, subjects behaved opposite to optimal, preferring the blind-spot stimulus as the better example of a collinear stimulus, even though no relevant veridical information was available. Thus, a percept that is partially inferred is paradoxically considered more reliable than a percept based on external input. In other words: Humans treat filled-in inferred percepts as more real than veridical ones.Introduction:In order to make optimal and adaptive decisions, animals integrate multiple sources of sensory information across time and space. One of the prime examples of this is observed when animals are confronted with coherently-moving stimuli during random-dot motion experiments. In such experiments, performance and the corresponding neural activity vary proportionally to signal strength in a way that is consistent with the progressive integration of evidence over time( Shadlen et al., 1996; Shadlen and Newsome, 2001). Besides temporal accumulation, sensory integration is also possible by combining the information from multiple sensory sources( Quigley et al., 2008; Schall et al., 2009; Hollensteiner et al., 2015; Wahn and König, 2015a, 2015b, 2016). In the case of multisensory perception, several experiments have shown that integration often occurs in a statistically optimal way. This has been best demonstrated in cue-integration tasks in which humans perform as if they were weighting the different sources of information according to their respective reliabilities( Ernst and Banks, 2002; Alais and Burr, 2004; Körding and Wolpert, 2004; Tickle et al., 2016). This form of statistical inference has also been demonstrated for cortical neurons of the monkey brain, with patterns of activity at the population level that are consistent with the implementation of a probabilistic population code( Gu et al., 2008; Fetsch et al., 2011). In most of these sensory integration experiments, the perceptual reliability of different inputs is probed through quantitative manipulations of the inputs’ signal-to-noise ratios( Heekeren et al., 2004; Tassinari et al., 2006; Bankó et al., 2011). However, some percepts are unreliable not because they are corrupted by noise but because they are inferred only from the context and thus intrinsically uncertain. This occurs naturally in monocular vision at the physiological blind spot, where content is ‘filled-in’ based on information from the surroundings. In this case, no veridical percept is possible at the blind spot location. Even though changes in reliability due to noise directly result in behavioral consequences, the effects of the qualitative difference between veridical and inferred percepts, that are otherwise apparently identical, are unknown. We recently reported differences in the processing of veridical and inferred information at the level of EEG responses( Ehinger et al., 2015). We demonstrated that a qualitative assessment of differences in reliability exists at the neural level in the form of low- and high-level trans-saccadic predictions of visual content. Notably, active predictions of visual content differed between inferred and veridical visual information presented inside or outside the blind spot. Although no difference was found between low-level error signals, high-level error signals differed markedly between predictions based on inferred or veridical information. We concluded that the inferred content is processed as if it were veridical for the visual system, but knowledge of its reduced precision is nevertheless preserved for later processing stages. In the present experiment, we address whether such an assessment of a dichotomous, qualitative difference in reliability is available for perceptual decision-making. Using 3D shutter glasses, we presented one stimulus partially in the participant’s blind spot to elicit filling-in and a second stimulus at the same eccentricity in the nasal field of view outside of the blind spot. The subject’s task was to indicate which of the two stimuli was continuously striped and did not present a small orthogonal inset( see Figure 1a). Crucially, stimuli within the blind spot are filled-in and thus perceived as continuous, even when they present an inset. In the diagnostic trials, both stimuli were physically identical and continuous, and subjects were confronted with an ambiguous decision between veridical and partially inferred stimuli. 10. 7554/eLife. 21761. 003Figure 1. Stimuli and stimulation.( a) Striped stimuli used in the study. The inset was set to ~50% of the average blind spot size. The global orientation of both stimuli was the same, but in different trials it could be either vertical( as shown here) or horizontal( not shown).( b) Each stimulus was displayed individually either( partially) inside or( completely) outside the blind spot. This example presents an inset stimulus inside the subject’s left blind spot. However, due to filling-in, it is perceived as continuous( right column). The task required subjects to select the continuous stimulus, and it was designed to differentiate between two mutually exclusive predictions: First, subjects cannot differentiate between the two different types of stimuli and thus answer randomly. Alternatively, subjects have implicit or explicit knowledge about the difference between inferred( filled-in) and veridical contents and consequently select the stimulus outside the blind spot in ambiguous trials.( c) Two stimuli were displayed using shutter glasses. Each stimulus was presented to one eye only, and it is possible that both are presented to the same eye( as in the example depicted here). That is, the left stimulus could be shown either in the temporal field of view( nasal retina) of the left eye( as in the plot) or in the nasal field of view( temporal retina) of the right eye( not shown). In this case, the trial was unambiguous: The stimulus with an inset was presented outside the blind spot and could be veridically observed, therefore, the correct answer was to select the left stimulus.( d) The locations of stimulus presentation in the five experiments. All stimuli were presented relative to the blind spot location of each subject. All five experiments included the blind spot location( green). In the second and fifth experiment, effects at the blind spot were contrasted with a location above it( purple). In the third experiment, the contrasts were in positions located to the left or the right of the blind spot. Note that both stimuli were always presented at symmetrical positions in a given trial, the position of the stimuli differed only across trials.

Each row is one condition in one experiment( depicted in the left most column). The graph is split in a physical stimulation( what is shown, left) and a perception column( what do subjects perceive due to fill-in in the blind spot, right). The dark-blue fields depict trials where an inset stimulus( dark-blue) was shown but partially inside the blind spot. On the right side( perception) we added these trials to the respective continuous( blue) cases. We mark with red the columns that indicate trials where an inset was shown in the temporal field. Note that perceptually these trials only exist in the locations above/inward/outward the blind spot, but are impossible inside the blind spot( due to fill-in). Because the resulting statistical distribution might influence decisions by the subjects( see results of experiment 5, probability matching), experiment 5 was a repetition of experiment 2 without these trials. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 21761. 004 We evaluated two mutually exclusive hypotheses on how perceptual decision-making could proceed when confronted with an ambiguous decision between veridical and inferred percepts. In the first case, we hypothesized that subjects are unable to make perceptual decisions based on an assessment of differences in reliability between veridical and inferred stimuli. Therefore, subjects would have an equal chance of selecting stimuli presented inside or outside the blind spot. Alternatively, it might be possible to use the information about the reduced reliability of filled-in information. In this case, we expect subjects to follow an optimal strategy and trust a stimulus presented outside the blind spot, where the complete stimulus is seen, more often than when the stimulus is presented inside the blind spot, where it is impossible to know the actual content within the filled-in part.Discussion:When confronted with identical physical stimulation, subjects showed a consistent bias for blind spot inferred percepts which was stronger than the bias at any other location in the temporal visual field. Why do subjects choose the blind spot location when it is objectively the least reliable? Our interpretation takes the results at face value: subjects must possess at least implicit information about whether a percept originates from the blind spot in order to show a bias for or against it. At the same time, the veridical information from the other stimulus is also available. This indicates that perceptual decision-making can rely more on inferred than veridical information, even when there is some knowledge about the reduced reliability of the inferred input available in the brain( Ehinger et al., 2015). This is also supported by the results of the reaction time analyses that indicated a faster evidence accumulation for the inferred percepts. In other words, the implicit knowledge that a filled-in stimulus is objectively less reliable does not seem to be used for perceptual decision-making. This suboptimal decision between qualitatively different veridical and inferred inputs is in contrast to properties of standard sensory integration. There, reduced reliability derived from noisy but veridical signals results in a corresponding weighting of inputs and consequently in optimal decisions( Körding et al., 2007). In the following, we discuss two potential explanations of this discrepancy of processing filled-in information and standard sensory integration. The first explanation focuses on physiological properties of neuronal and small circuits’ response properties at and around the blind spot region. The second explanation addresses the conceptual level and uses the general notion of predictive coding. First, although the filled-in percept is by definition independent of the stimulus within the blind spot, it is nevertheless based on the information sensed by the region around the blind spot in the nasal retina. We might assume that an area, e. g. in the nasal retina around the blind spot region, that has a lower contrast threshold also shows stronger neuronal signals for super-threshold stimuli. This could in principle lead to a filled-in stimulus with increased salience as compared to the veridical stimulus. Effectively, this explanation proposes that differences in physiological properties of nasal and temporal retinae are transferred to the filling-in process making it the ‘better’ candidate stimulus in an ambiguous condition. Above we already introduced some evidence for psychophysical differences between the nasal and temporal visual field( Fahle and Schmid, 1988). There is also some evidence for the superiority of the blind spot in a Vernier task( Crossland and Bex, 2009). The areas around the blind spot showed greater performance compared to areas at similar eccentric locations in the nasal visual field. It is still unclear whether this goes over and beyond the aforementioned temporal/nasal bias. Unfortunately, this explanation runs into the problem that the sensitivity in the region corresponding to the blind spot in the other eye is also enhanced compared to regions at similar eccentricities( Wolf and Morandi, 1962; Midgley, 1998). This suggests that differences between the eyes in the area around the blind spot should be the smallest within the contrast between temporal and nasal retina. Moreover, we explicitly controlled for temporal-nasal differences in experiments 2 and 3, and found that it is not enough to explain the effect specific to the blind spot. Thus, an explanation of the observed effects based on known differences in retinal properties is currently tentative at best. An alternative explanation is based on the framework of predictive coding( Friston et al., 2006, 2012; Summerfield and de Lange, 2014). Specifically, context information of static stimuli would be used to predict local stimulus properties leading to the phenomenon of filling-in. The predicted sensory input would then be compared to the incoming sensory input, and an error signal representing the mismatch would be returned. In the absence of veridical information, no deviation and thus no error signal would occur. Effectively, the filled-in signal might have less noise. Reduced noise, in turn, results in a smaller prediction error and higher credibility at later stages. A faster reaction time to the filled-in stimulus compared to the veridical stimulus could suggest that the integration process is indeed biased with less noise. In summary, although the results reported here seem compatible with the predictive coding framework, this explanation presently remains vague and speculative. In conclusion, we find a new behavioral effect where subjects prefer a partially inferred stimulus to a veridical one. Though both appear to be continuous, the filled-in one could hide an inset and is, therefore, less reliable. In this perceptual decision-making task, subjects do not make use of high-level assessments about the reliability of the filled-in stimulus. Even more so, they prefer the unreliable percept.","answer":"To make sense of the world around us , we must combine information from multiple sources while taking into account how reliable they are . When crossing the street , for example , we usually rely more on input from our eyes than our ears . However , we can reassess the reliability of the information: on a foggy day with poor visibility , we might prioritize listening for traffic instead . But how do we assess the reliability of information generated within the brain itself ? We are able to see because the brain constructs an image based on the patterns of activity of light-sensitive proteins in a part of the eye called the retina . However , there is a point on the retina where the presence of the optic nerve leaves no space for light-sensitive receptors . This means there is a corresponding point in our visual field where the brain receives no visual input from the outside world . To prevent us from perceiving this gap , known as the visual blind spot , the brain fills in the blank space based on the contents of the surrounding areas . While this is usually accurate enough , it means that our perception in the blind spot is objectively unreliable . To find out whether we are aware of the unreliable nature of stimuli in the blind spot , Ehinger et al . presented volunteers with two striped stimuli , one on each side of the screen . The center of some of the stimuli were covered by a patch that broke up the stripes . The volunteers’ task was to select the stimulus with uninterrupted stripes . The key to the experiment is that if the central patch appears in the blind spot , the brain will fill in the stripes so that they appear to be continuous . This means that the volunteers will have to choose between two stimuli that both appear to have continuous stripes . If they have no awareness of their blind spot , we might expect them to simply guess . Alternatively , if they are subconsciously aware that the stimulus in the blind spot is unreliable , they should choose the other one . In reality , exactly the opposite happened: the volunteers chose the blind spot stimulus more often than not . This suggests that information generated by the brain itself is sometimes treated as more reliable than sensory information from the outside world . Future experiments should examine whether the tendency to favor information generated within the brain over external sensory inputs is unique to the visual blind spot , or whether it also occurs elsewhere ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

METHODS Adult patients with brain metastases received WBRT  and were r and omized to receive placebo or memantine ( 20 mg/d ) , within 3 days of initiating radiotherapy for 24 weeks . Serial st and ardized tests of cognitive function were performed . RESULTS Of 554 patients who were accrued , 508 were eligible . Grade 3 or 4 toxicities and study compliance were similar in the 2 arms . There was less decline in delayed recall in the memantine arm at 24 weeks ( P = .059 ) , but the difference was not statistically significant , possibly because there were only 149 analyzable patients at 24 weeks , result ing in only 35 % statistical power . The memantine arm had significantly longer time to cognitive decline ( hazard ratio 0.78 , 95 % confidence interval 0.62 - 0.99 , P = .01 ) ; the probability of cognitive function failure at 24 weeks was 53.8 % in the memantine arm and 64.9 % in the placebo arm . Superior results were seen in the memantine arm for executive function at 8 ( P = .008 ) and 16 weeks ( P = .0041 ) and for processing speed ( P = .0137 ) and delayed recognition ( P = .0149 ) at 24 weeks . CONCLUSIONS Memantine was well tolerated and had a toxicity profile very similar to placebo . Although there was less decline in the primary endpoint of delayed recall at 24 weeks , this lacked statistical significance possibly due to significant patient loss . Overall , patients treated with memantine had better cognitive function over time ; specifically , memantine delayed time to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory , executive function , and processing speed in patients receiving WBRT .

Krüppel-like Factor 3 (KLF3) is a transcriptional regulator that we have shown to be involved in the regulation of adipogenesis in vitro. Here we report that KLF3 null mice are lean and protected from diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. On a chow diet, plasma levels of leptin are decreased, and adiponectin is increased. Despite significant reductions in body weight and adiposity, wildtype and knockout animals show equivalent energy intake, expenditure and excretion. To investigate the molecular events underlying these observations, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression in Klf3 (+/+) and Klf3 (-/-) tissues. We found that mRNA expression of Fam132a, which encodes a newly identified insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adipolin, is significantly upregulated in the absence of KLF3. We confirmed that KLF3 binds the Fam132a promoter in vitro and in vivo and that this leads to repression of promoter activity. Further, plasma adipolin levels were significantly increased in Klf3 (-/-) mice compared to wild-type littermates. Boosting levels of adipolin via targeting of KLF3 offers a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Angiogenesis is a critical process in solid tumor growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a recently identified growth factor with significant angiogenic properties, may be a major tumor angiogenesis regulator. Few studies have investigated the association between p53 and VEGF expressions and prognosis in esophageal carcinoma. Forty-seven specimens resected from patients with stage II and III squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were studied using immunohistochemical staining. VEGF and p53 expressions were observed in 40% and 53% of the tumors, respectively. The p53 and VEGF staining statuses were coincident in only 21% of the tumors, and no significant correlation was found between p53 and VEGF statuses. No clinicopathologic factors were significantly correlated with p53 or VEGF expression. No significant association between p53 and VEGF expressions and poor prognosis was found. In conclusion, p53 and VEGF were not correlated with prognosis in patients with stage II and III SCC of the esophagus.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"squamous cell carcinoma\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"cancers\\", \\"cell\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"esophagus\\", \\"nuclear\\", \\"SCC\\", \\"specimens\\", \\"solid tumor\\", \\"esophageal carcinoma\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

The purpose of this randomised trial was to compare the value of fetal scalp blood lactate and pH management in cases of abnormal intrapartum fetal heart rate tracings.                Of 341 cases of ominous fetal heart rate patterns, 169 were randomly assigned to pH analysis, and 172 to lactate measurements. Lactate was measured using a lactate card requiring 5 microL of blood and yielding the result within 60 seconds. pH analysis was performed with an ABL 510 acid-base analyser requiring 35 microL of blood and yielding the results within 47 seconds.                Unsuccessful fetal blood sampling procedures (no result or an unreliable result) occurred significantly more often in the pH subgroup than in the lactate subgroup (OR 16.1 with 95% CI 5.8-44.7). In the pH subgroup the failure rate was inversely related to the degree of cervical dilatation. Compared with the pH subgroup, the lactate subgroup was characterised by fewer fetal scalp incisions per blood sampling attempt (median 1.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 1-1] vs 2.0 [IQR 1-2]), and significantly less time required for the sampling procedure (median 120 s [IQR 90-147] vs 230 s [IQR 180-300]). The groups did not differ in mode of delivery, neonatal outcome and umbilical artery acid-base balance and lactate levels.                This trial showed the levels of lactate and pH in fetal scalp blood to be comparable in predicting perinatal outcome, but the procedure to measuring lactate was more successful than that for pH. Owing to its simplicity of performance, lactate analysis is an attractive alternative for intrapartum fetal monitoring.Title 2:Determination of pH or lactate in fetal scalp blood in management of intrapartum fetal distress: randomised controlled multicentre trial.Abstract 2:To examine the effectiveness of pH analysis of fetal scalp blood compared with lactate analysis in identifying hypoxia in labour to prevent acidaemia at birth.                Randomised controlled multicentre trial.                Labour wards.                Women with a singleton pregnancy, cephalic presentation, gestational age >or=34 weeks, and clinical indication for fetal scalp blood sampling.                Standard pH analysis (n=1496) or lactate analysis (n=1496) with an electrochemical microvolume (5 mul) test strip device. The cut-off levels for intervention were pH <7.21 and lactate >4.8 mmol/l, respectively.                Metabolic acidaemia (pH <7.05 and base deficit >12 mmol/l) or pH <7.00 in cord artery blood.                Metabolic acidaemia occurred in 3.2% in the lactate group and in 3.6% in the pH group (relative risk 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.36). pH <7.00 occurred in 1.5% in the lactate group and in 1.8% in the pH group (0.84, 0.47 to 1.50). There was no significant difference in Apgar scores <7 at 5 minutes (1.15, 0.76 to 1.75) or operative deliveries for fetal distress (1.02, 0.93 to 1.11).                There were no significant differences in rate of acidaemia at birth after use of lactate analysis or pH analysis of fetal scalp blood samples to determine hypoxia during labour.

We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection. The donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor. Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. Reported medications included bumetanide, pravastatin, and paroxetine. Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany. Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated, and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia. Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia. We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity. Laboratory measurement of pre-procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance. The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"pravastatin\\", \\"calcium gluconate\\", \\"calcium\\", \\"loop diuretic\\", \\"bumetanide\\", \\"sodium citrate\\", \\"paroxetine\\", \\"citrate\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"tetany\\", \\"hyperlipidemia\\", \\"muscle contractions\\", \\"hypertension\\", \\"toxicity\\", \\"depression\\", \\"hypocalcemia\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Diabetes is a serious health problem. Searching for alternative natural antioxidants is considered important strategy to manage diabetes. This study evaluated the effect of Riceberry bran oil (RBBO) supplementation on oxidative stress and organ histology in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats fed a high fat (HF) diet. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with hyperglycemia were divided into four groups: DM group fed a HF diet alone; DMRL group fed a HF diet and 5% RBBO; DMRM group fed a HF diet and 7.5% RBBO; DMRH group fed a HF diet and 15% RBBO. Normal rats were used as normal control and were divided into NC and NR group fed a normal diet containing either 5% corn oil or 5% RBBO, respectively. After 12 weeks, RBBO significantly decreased malondialdehyde and restored superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, coenzyme Q(10) and ORAC levels in diabetic rats. RBBO additionally improved the regenerative changes of the pancreas, kidneys, heart and liver. These findings indicate that pigmented RBBO could provide beneficial effect on diabetes by decreasing oxidative stress and recovering organ histology.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"glutathione\\", \\"streptozotocin\\", \\"malondialdehyde\\", \\"superoxide\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating appropriate spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess our algorithms performance. Our study shows that it is feasible to achieve genome-wide reconstruction of the 3D DNA path based on super-resolution microscopy images.Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes.We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences.We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences.Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes.Our method, ChromoTrace, uses a computer science data structure, suffix trees, that allow one to simultaneous search the entire genome for specific sub-sequences.ChromoTrace can robustly and accurately reconstruct 3D paths in our simulations.","answer":"Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells.

Extract of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f (TWHf) has immunosuppressive activity and has been used as anti-inflammatory agent in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Recent studies have demonstrated that triptolide is the major active component in the extract that inhibits antigen or mitogen-induced T cell proliferation. In attempting to investigate its effect on activation of T lymphocytes, we found triptolide induces apoptotic death of T cell hybridomas and peripheral T cells but not that of thymocytes. The triptolide-induced apoptosis is accompanied by increase of DEVD-cleavable caspases activity and degradation of caspase substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). A specific inhibitor of caspases, zVAD-FMK, prevents triptolide-induced PARP degradation and DNA fragmentation but not growth arrest. Furthermore, enforced expression of Bcl-2 inhibited triptolide-induced degradation of PARP and apoptosis. These results indicate that triptolide induces T cell apoptosis through activating caspases, and suggest the growth arrest and apoptotic effect of triptolide may contribute to the immunosuppressive activity of TWHf extract","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"T cell hybridomas\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"T lymphocytes\\", \\"thymocytes\\", \\"peripheral T cells\\", \\"T lymphocyte\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"caspase substrate poly (ADP - ribose) polymerase\\", \\"Bcl - 2\\", \\"mitogen\\", \\"caspases\\", \\"PARP\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

The chemokine receptor, BLR1, is a major regulator of the microenvironmental homing of B cells in lymphoid organs. In vitro studies identify three essential elements of the TATA-less blr1 core promoter that confer cell type-and differentiation-specific expression in the B cells of both humans and mice, a functional promoter region (-36 with respect to the transcription start site), a NF-kappaB motif (+ 44), and a noncanonical octamer motif (+ 157). The importance of these sites was confirmed by in vivo studies in gene-targeted mice deficient of either Oct-2, Bob1, or both NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p52. In all of these animals, the expression of BLR1 was reduced or absent. In mice deficient only of p52 / NF-kappaB, BLR1 expression was unaffected. Thus our data demonstrate that BLR1 is a target gene for Oct-2, Bob1, and members of the NF-kappaB / Rel family and provides a link to the impaired B cell functions in mice deficient for these factors.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"mature B cells\\", \\"B cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"NF - kappaB motif\\", \\"functional promoter region\\", \\"noncanonical octamer motif\\", \\"TATA - less promoter\\", \\"TATA - less blr1 core promoter\\", \\"transcription start site\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"Bob1\\", \\"p52 / NF - kappaB\\", \\"BLR1\\", \\"chemokine receptor\\", \\"NF - kappaB / Rel family\\", \\"homing receptor BLR1\\", \\"Oct - 2\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

One study reported Ca(OH)2 to be more efficient for DPC than EMD. One study reported no difference in the efficacies between EMD and Ca(OH)2 for DPC. All animal studies reported EMD to be more effective in reparative dentine formation in comparison with Ca(OH)2 . EMD can provide favourable results in DPC proceduresEMD increased the osteogenic potential of hDPCsthe expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes, such as ALP, DSPP, BMP, and OPN were also upregulated. In addition, the expression levels of odontogenesis-related transcription factors Osterix and Runx2 were upregulatedEMD could enhance the mineralization of hDPSCs upregulated the expression of markers for odontoblast/osteoblast-like cells. Further studies are required to determine if EMD can improve pulp tissue repair and regenerationIn both the scaffold groups, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein-1, and osteopontin messenger RNA was up-regulated significantly in EMD-treated hDPCs when compared with the nontreated cellsProliferated pulp tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by EMDgel and DSP-stained hard tissue was observed alongside exposed dentine surfaces as well as in isolated masses within the proliferated pulp tissue, although the new hard tissue did not cover the pulp exposureIn the EMD-treated teeth, large amounts of newly formed dentin-like hard tissue with associated formative cells outlined the pulpal wound separating the cavity area from the remaining pulp tissueInflammatory cells were present in the wound area but not subjacent to the newly formed hard tissue. Morphometric analysis showed that the amount of hard tissue formed in EMD-treated teeth was more than twice that of the calcium-hydroxide-treated control teeth (p < 0.001), suggesting that EMD is capable of promoting reparative processes in the wounded pulp more strongly than is calcium hydroxide","answer":"increase of the osteogenic potential of hDPCs"},{"question":"You will be shown biomedical passages and your task is to the answer the provided question.

up .  primary care settings are the locale where up to 70% of patients are diagnosed and treated for the most prevalent mental health conditions including anxiety , mood , and substance abuse disorders .furthermore , medical comorbidity is the rule for this population in which the majority have at least 1 co - occurring chronic medical illness . because many acute and chronic medical conditions ( eg , chronic pain , copd , obesity ) involve health behaviors or psychosocial issues with the potential to exacerbate symptoms or undermine treatment outcomes , primary care is well suited as the medical home for provision of essential behavioral health care .there is a growing amount of research , which shows that integrated behavioral care produces significant positive results , including decreases in depression levels , improvement in quality of life , decreased stress , and lower rates of psychiatric hospitalization .analysis of national ambulatory medical care surveys from 2003 to 2006 revealed that , despite the high prevalence of depression in primary care , screening is extremely low at 2% to 4% . per the 2013 study by mcgoeyet al , the average annual frequency of documented depression screening was 1.3% . for visits to primary care providers specifically , the rate of screening was 1.8% , for internists it was 2.8% , and for pediatricians it was 1.8% .  there are many standardized depression screening tools that can be used by primary care medical providers , but the study shows that an overwhelming 65% are using the patient health questionnaire 2/9 ( phq-2/9 ) screening tools .the phq-2 inquires about the frequency of a patient s depressed mood and anhedonia ( lack of interest or pleasure in doing things ) over the past 2 weeks .it is not used to establish a diagnosis , but it is the first step in identifying possible depressive symptoms .a study by arroll et al in 2010 reported that a phq-2 score of 2 or higher has a sensitivity of 0.86 , meaning that 86% of those with a major depression will be found to be positive on the phq-2 screening test .patients who test positive are further evaluated with phq-9 and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder criteria to determine whether they meet the criteria for a depressive disorder .  the purpose of this study is to examine the rate of depression screening among patients , aged 19 and older , seen at a community health center while referencing to uspstf screening recommendations .the purpose of this study is to examine the rate of depression screening among patients , aged 19 and older , seen at a community health center while referencing to uspstf screening recommendations .a random sample of 500 patients , aged 19 and older , were extracted from the total number of patients who have been seen at the community health center , between december 1 , 2013 , and april 30 , 2014 , using electronic medical records ( emrs ) . using the emr software ,the patients who were previously diagnosed with depression were excluded from the total screened for depression .the data was then broken down by gender , race , and ethnicity to see whether there are any significant trends that can be compared to national averages .of the 500 patients in the sample , 49 of them were excluded due to being previously diagnosed with depression .subsequently , data examined by gender showed the rate of screening of males was 8.4% , and for females , it was 17.5% ( table 1 ) .depression screening data by gender . additionally , the race with the highest rate of screening was asian , with 23.2% of patients being screened , and the race screened at the lowest rate was white , at 12.8% .then looking at the data - based ethnicity showed that a slightly higher percentage of hispanics were screened ( 15.3% ) than non - hispanics ( 14.8% ) , and those patients who did not report their ethnicity ( 8.7% ) ( tables 2 and 3 ) .compared to available data on depression screening , for example , the study by cherry and mcgoey et al ( 1.8% and 4% respectively ) ,   the rate of screening at the community health center was significantly better .primary care providers then either treat depression in primary care setting or use appropriate referral pathways to address depression , since offering treatment after depression screening improves outcomes .several studies have shown that major depression is more frequent among members of minority groups than among whites . a 2005 study by rioloet al examined racial / ethnic differences among middle - aged women and found that depressive symptoms among hispanic and african american women were higher compared to other ethnicities .also , a 2010 study by gonzlez et al showed that african americans and hispanics exhibited elevated rates of major depression relative to whites .previous research has also shown that socioeconomic indicators , such as education , income , and marital status , are associated with depressive symptoms and , in some cases , may explain racial / ethnic differences in rates of depression .there is also clear evidence that females are more likely to have depressive symptoms compared to males .our study findings seem to mirror current differences in race , ethnicity , and gender .community health centers aid the underserved , with a significant portion of the population belonging to the lower socioeconomic strata and minority race or ethnicities .screening and treatment of depression in the community health centers setting deserve special focus . however , behavioral health is not currently fully integrated into general internal medicine at primary care practices , including community health centers .current health care policy makes it difficult for most primary care practices to integrate mental health staff because of insufficient reimbursement , mental health insurance carve outs , and difficulty in supporting collocated mental health professionals , to name a few .the particular health center , at the time of the survey , did not offer on - site behavioral health services , that is , there were no psychologists , case workers , or psychiatrists on staff .furthermore , physicians , physician assistants , and nurse practitioners often lack the time or training to effectively address mental health needs .primary care providers also continue to encounter barriers to referring patients to specialty mental health settings , while patient uptake to these offsite referrals remains low .finally , patients might be reluctant to talk about mental health problems such as depression . per the study by psych central in 2011 , 43% were hesitant to talk to their primary care physician about their depressive symptoms .the most common reason was they did nt want to be put on medications , such as antidepressants .also , 16% of patients said they did nt think talking about emotional issues were a part of their physician s job , while others stated that they did nt want to be  branded  as being a psychiatric patient with a mental disorder .  our study was designed to survey the screening rates and provide evidence of its lack .therefore , future studies should be designed to look not only into the rates but also to determine the underlying factor for why almost 85% of patients were unfortunately not screened . in summary , although mental health wellness has drawn more public attention in recent years , there continues to be barriers surrounding mental health , including depression .improving screening and treatment for depression in primary care will require better mental health care integration . enhanced coordinated financial support for the integration of mental health care into primary care could improve identification and treatment of depression .there is an urgent need for quality improvement initiatives that look into the current practices and potentials for innovations and integrations .the studied community health center had the rate of depression screening at 14.6% , while the current recommendation is universal screening of depression , per the uspstf .since evidence shows that mental health can coexist with medical illness and integration of mental health services to primary care improves overall outcomes , there is an overarching need to improve the screening rates .mass screening in primary care will help clinicians identify missed depression cases and initiate appropriate treatment earlier in their course of depression .addressing barriers to screening , including patient education , provider education , system practices , and provision of screening and treatment resources could help address this important health care gap .","answer":"purpose : the purpose of this study is to examine the rate of depression screening among patients , aged 19 and older , seen at a community health center , while referencing to us preventive services task force ( uspstf ) screening recommendations.methods:a random sample of 500 patients , aged 19 and older , were extracted from the total number of patients seen at the community health center , between december 1 , 2013 , and april 30 , 2014 .  the rate of depression screening was calculated by analyzing the completed standardized screening questionnaires ( patient health questionnaire 2).results : on analysis , it was found that 14.6% of patients were screened for depression .  the rate of screening for males was 8.4% and for females it was 17.5% .  the race with the highest rate of screening was asian at 23.2% , and the lowest rate was white at 12.8%.conclusion : the studied community health center had a suboptimal rate of depression screening at 14.6% .  the uspstf recommends depression screening on all adults .  addressing barriers to screening including patient education , provider education , system practices , and provision of resources may help improve the rate of depression screening , leading to early treatment and better health outcomes ."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Our improved, hyper-hygienic way of life in the fear of transmission has conveniently shifted our behavioral patterns like the use of PPE (Personal protective equipment), increased demand for plastic-packaged food and groceries, and the use of disposable utensils. The inadequacies and inefficiencies of our current waste management system to deal with the increased dependence on plastic could aggravate its mismanagement and leakage into the environment, thus triggering a new environmental crisis. Mandating scientific sterilization and the use of sealed bags for safe disposal of contaminated plastic wastes should be an immediate priority to reduce the risk of transmission to sanitation workers. Investments in circular technologies like feedstock recycling, improving the infrastructure and environmental viability of existing techniques could be the key to dealing with the plastic waste fluxes during such a crisis. Transition towards environmentally friendly materials like bioplastics and harboring new sustainable technologies would be crucial to fighting future pandemics. Although the rollbacks and relaxation of single-use plastic bans may be temporary, their likely implications on the consumer perception could hinder our long-term goals of transitioning towards a circular economy. Likewise, any delay in building international willingness and participation to curb any form of pollution through summits and agendas may also delay its implementation. Reduction in plastic pollution and at the same time promoting sustainable plastic waste management technologies can be achieved by prioritizing our policies to instill individual behavioral as well as social, institutional changes. Incentivizing measures that encourage circularity and sustainable practices, and public-private investments in research, infrastructure and marketing would help in bringing the aforementioned changes. Individual responsibility, corporate action, and government policy are all necessary to keep us from transitioning from one disaster to another.","answer":"[\\"Prevention\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

old individual with pd who underwent three exercises ( penguin slide , table tilt and balance bubble ) with nintendo wii fit twice a week for eight weeks , and observed improvement in functional performance and higher gait speed .analyzed the effect of multi - step training with rhythmic auditory stimulation , step aerobic activity ( similar to that of this study ) , in the functional performance of individuals with pd , showing that the combination of step training with rhythmic auditory stimulation offers benefit for functional improvement of gait and balance in pd patients .in addition to the activities performed by the nintendo wii fit plus , there are other non - virtual therapeutic strategies for the treatment of motor disorders of gait in pd that resemble the proposed study . among these , there are activities that involve sensorimotor combinations with external auditory rhythm and visual stimulation , as well as coordination physical exercises , dexterity , gait initiation , quick changes in direction , walking with long strides overcoming obstacles and sensorimotor agility . in the present study ,in addition to the increase in the average linear speed and length of patients steps , there was a reduction in motor impairment , especially in the items of rigidity and flexibility of the lower limbs evaluated by updrs iii , and greater functional independence , as evidenced in the se and fim scales , with improvements in items related to locomotion and stair climbing .this improvement was observed in the initial months and then progressively decreased , especially in individuals who did not continue the activities ; this underlines the importance of maintaining physical exercise . a randomized study comparing two groups of pd performing different gait training exercises , with visual tracks or physical therapy , showed improvement in both groups .it showed greater functional independence , increased speed and step length in the gait of those participants undergoing sensorial training than those who underwent conventional physiotherapy .this led us to conclude that this difference may have been facilitated by the greater visual attention needed to complete the tasks , similar to what happens in virtual exercises .the use of motion exercises and cognitive abilities in nitendo wii fit showed that , after training , the ability of those with parkinson s disease to learn , retain and transfer performance improvements was totally dependent on the cognitive demands of the games involved , reaffirming the importance for rehabilitation purposes , the need for the selection of the games to be used in activities .some studies suggest physical exercises as therapeutic strategies in mesencephalic lesions in the substancia nigro ( sn ) .yoon et al . , in experiments with rats submittted to physical exercise on a treadmill for 14 consecutive days after sn injury , demonstrated improvement in functional activity and found high levels of brain neurotrophic factors in glial cells .the same was found by tajiri et al . in an experimental parkinsonian model where rats received infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine in the striatum andthese rats showed elevated levels of neurotrophic factor , glial derived , greater proliferation of neuron progenitor cells , and a significant reduction in neuronal death , as well as better performance of animals in a cylinder behavioral test when compared to sedentary animals .experimental models of pd have been useful to investigate the influence of physical exercises , neurotrophic factors and glial cells as mediators of neuroplasticity in the central nervous system .such exercises performed later in the sn lesions may improve motor symptoms and preserve striatal dopaminergic terminals , although it is not very clear whether prior physical exercise or its intensity are able to provide protection against 6-hydroxydopamine .given this , the possible neuroprotection through physical exercises and neurotrophic factors may be important in addressing neurodegenerative diseases and thus improve the response to drug treatment .the physical exercise proposed in this study using the nintendo wii fit plus may represent a non - invasive practice to achieve neuroprotection .gait motor training in pd using the nintendo wii fit plus platform was effective and efficient in a short time period .this activity program was shown to be useful for motor recovery of neurodegenerative diseases , showing improvement in motor performance and functional independence in individuals with pd .","answer":"the use of the nintendo wii has been considered a good alternative in the motor rehabilitation of individuals with parkinson s disease ( pd ) , requiring simultaneous interaction to develop strategies for physical , visual , auditory , cognitive , psychological and social activities in the performing of virtual activities , resulting in improvement in functional performance and gait .  the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of virtual sensorimotor activity on gait disorders in people with pd .  fifteen subjects with a clinical diagnosis of pd were submitted to the unified parkinson s disease rating scale ( updrs iii ) , schwab and england activities of daily living scale ( se ) , functional independence measure ( fim ) , and biomechanical gait analysis using digital images taken with a video camera before and after the treatment program .  the activities with the nintendo wii virtual platform were standardized into three categories : aerobics , balance and wii plus exercises .  participants carried out separate virtual exercises for 40 min , twice a week , for a total of 14 sessions .  the program improved sensorimotor performance in pd gait , with an increase in stride length and gait speed , in addition to a reduction in motor impairment , especially in items of rigidity and flexibility of the lower limbs evaluated by updrs iii , and greater functional independence , as evidenced in the se and fim scales .  improvements in items related to locomotion and stair climbing were also observed .  the training was effective in motor recovery in chronic neurodegenerative diseases , showing improvement in motor performance and functional independence in individuals with pd ."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

Long-term injury rate levels, changes, and trends for 14 Swedish WHO-designated Safe Communities.Abstract 1:This study investigates the injury rate levels, changes, and trends between 1987 and 2002 for the 14 Swedish municipalities designated as WHO Safe Communities. The injury rate was defined as the number of injured patients discharged from hospital per 1000 persons. Injury rates were age standardised. Each municipality was compared with its respective municipality group, according to a classification of Sweden's 288 municipalities into nine groups based on numerous structural parameters. The average injury rate levels for the 14 WHO-designated Safe Community municipalities ranged from 11.54 to 19.09 per 1000 population during the study period, which was defined as the time period during which a municipality's injury prevention program has been operational. Eleven of 14 municipalities had higher levels than their corresponding municipality groups. Five of the 14 municipalities \\"outperformed\\" their respective municipality groups and achieved a greater relative injury rate decrease during the study period. The trends for the 14 municipalities in relation to their municipality groups showed an inconsistent pattern, with only four municipalities exhibiting overall favourable trends for the study period.Title 2:Harstad injury prevention study: prevention of burns in young children by community based intervention.Abstract 2:To describe the long term effectiveness of a community based program targeting prevention of burns in young children.                Quasiexperimental.                The Norwegian city of Harstad (main intervention), six surrounding municipalities (intervention diffusion), and Trondheim (reference).                Children under age 5 years in the three study populations.                Outpatient and inpatient hospital data were coded according to the Nordic system, and collected as part of a national injury surveillance system. Burn data collection started in May 1985. The first 19.5 months of the study provided baseline data, while the last 10 years involved community based intervention, using a mix of passive and active interventions.                The mean burn injury rate decreased by 51.5% after the implementation of the intervention in Harstad (p < 0.05) and by 40.1% in the six municipalities (not significant). Rates in the reference city, Trondheim, increased 18.1% (not significant). In Harstad and the six surrounding municipalities there was a considerable reduction in hospital admissions, operations, and bed days. Interventions with passive strategies were more effective, stove and tap water burns being eliminated in the last four years, while active strategies were less effective.                A program targeting burns in children can be effective and sustainable. Local injury data provided the stimulus for community action.Title 3:Impact of social standing on injury prevention in a World Health Organization Safe Community--intervention outcome by household employment contract.Abstract 3:Although social inequality in health has been an argument for community-based injury prevention programmes, intervention outcomes with regard to differences in social standing have not been analysed. The objective of this study was to investigate rates of injuries treated in health-care among members of households at different levels of labour market integration before and after the implementation of a WHO Safe Community programme.                A quasi-experimental design was used with pre- and post-implementation data collection covering the total populations <65 years of age during one year in the programme implementation municipality (population 41 000) and in a control municipality (population 26 000). Changes in injury rates were studied using prospective registration of all acute care episodes with regard to social standing in both areas during the study periods.                Male members of households categorized as not vocationally active displayed the highest pre-intervention injury rates. Also after the intervention, males in households classified as not vocationally active displayed notably elevated injury rates in both the control and study areas. Households in the study area in which the significant member was employed showed a post-intervention decrease in injury rate among both men (P < 0.001) and women (P < 0.01). No statistically significant change was observed in households in which the significant member was self-employed or not vocationally active. In the control area, only an aggregate-level decrease (P < 0.05) among members of households in which the significant member was employed was observed.                The study displayed areas for improvement in the civic network-based WHO Safe Community model. Even though members of non-vocationally active households, in particular men, were at higher pre-intervention injury risk, they were not affected by the interventions. This fact has to be addressed when planning future community-based injury prevention programmes.Title 4:The Lidköping Accident Prevention Programme--a community approach to preventing childhood injuries in Sweden.Abstract 4:In Sweden about 100 children 0-14 years die from accidental injuries every year, roughly 40 girls and 60 boys. To reduce this burden the Safe Community concept was developed in Falköping, Sweden in 1975. Several years later a second programme was initiated in Lidköping. The objectives of this paper are to describe the programme in Lidköping and to relate it to changes in injury occurrence.                The Lidköping Accident Prevention Programme (LAPP) was compared with four bordering municipalities and to the whole of Skaraborg County.                The programme included five elements: surveillance, provision of information, training, supervision, and environmental improvements. Process evaluation was based mainly on notes and reports made by the health planners, combined with newspaper clippings and interviews with key people. Outcome evaluation was based on information from the hospital discharge registry.                In Lidköping there was an on average annual decrease in injuries leading to hospital admissions from 1983 to 1991 of 2.4% for boys and 2.1% for girls compared with a smaller decline in one comparison area and an increase in the other.                Because the yearly injury numbers are small there is a great variation from year to year. However, comparisons over the nine year study period with the four border municipalities and the whole of Skaraborg County strengthen the impression that the programme has had a positive effect. The findings support the proposition that the decrease in the incidence of childhood injuries after 1984 could be attributed to the intervention of the LAPP. Nevertheless, several difficulties in drawing firm conclusions from community based studies are acknowledged and discussed.Title 5:Controlled evaluation of a community based injury prevention program in Australia.Abstract 5:To evaluate the effects of a community based, all age, all injury prevention program, the Safe Living Program, on injury risk and injury rates.                A quasiexperimental population based evaluation using an intervention and comparison community design.                The intervention community (Shire of Bulla, n = 37,257) is an outer metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia. The demographically matched comparison community (Shire of Melton, n=33,592) is located nearby.                The Safe Living Program in the Shire of Bulla targeted injury reduction in all settings with a focus on high risk groups. Strategies included program publicity, education and training, injury hazard reduction, and environmental change. Baseline and follow up measures of program reach, risk factors, and injury rates in both communities were used to evaluate program process, impact, and outcome.                Increase in program awareness was moderate and similar to other community based programs. The program achieved injury hazard reduction on the road, in schools, and, to a more limited extent, in the home. Other changes in injury risk factors could not necessarily be attributed to the program as similar changes were observed in the comparison community. No significant changes were found in rates of injury deaths, hospitalisations, or emergency department presentations in the Shire of Bulla after six years. Self reported household injuries, mostly minor, were reduced in the intervention community, but had been higher at program launch than in the comparison community.                The Safe Living Program was unable to replicate the significant reductions in injuries reported in other community based interventions. Replication of apparently successful community based injury prevention programs in different settings and populations requires evidence based interventions, sustained and effective program penetration, reliable data systems to measure change, at least one control community, and sufficient budget and time for effects to be observable.Title 6:Differences in child injury hospitalizations in Sweden: the use of time-trend analysis to compare various community injury-prevention approaches.Abstract 6:Sweden's child injury fatality rates are among the lowest in the world. The country has engaged in a number of community injury-prevention programmes. The purpose of this study was to compare child injury hospitalization rates from the Skaraborg District with the rest of Sweden. Our study hypothesis was that municipalities that offered comprehensive child injury-prevention programmes would see significant decreases in their child injury hospitalization rates, compared with other areas.                The study areas comprised three groups, consisting of municipalities in Skaraborg that had adapted the Safe Communities approach to injury prevention programmes, other municipalities in the District, and the rest of Sweden. The aim of the analysis was twofold: (1) to fit time trends for children's injuries in various areas in an integrated manner; and (2) to compare time trends across locations between community safety-promotion programmes as well as with the control areas. Panel data models and parametric splines were used.                There were differences between incidence rates in the study areas and with regard to gender. There was a steep decrease in injury rates in one of the Safe Communities study areas for both genders.                The methods applied in this analysis reveal more detailed and sophisticated time trends than the usual simple linear regression approach. The model provided a clearer view of the interactions of gender, area, and time as they impacted on children's injuries, and allowed for better insight into the impact of safety programmes.","answer":"There is marked inconsistency in the results of the studies included in this systematic review. While the frequency of injury in some study communities did reduce following their designation as a WHO Safe Community, there remains insufficient evidence from which to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the model.The lack of consistency in results may be due to the heterogeneity of the approaches to implementing the model, varying efficacy of activities and strategies, varying intensity of implementation and methodological limitations in evaluations. While all communities included in the review fulfilled the WHO Safe Community criteria, these criteria were too general to prescribe a standardised programme of activity or evaluation methodology.Adequate documentation describing how various Safe Communities implemented the model was limited, making it unclear which factors affected success. Where a reduction in injury rates was not reported, lack of information makes it difficult to distinguish whether this was due to problems with the model or with the way in which it was implemented."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

This allows systems to \\"cheat\\" by employing simple heuristics to answer questions, e.g. by relying on semantic type consistency. This means that current datasets are not well-suited to evaluate RC systems. To address this issue, we introduce RC-QED, a new RC task that requires giving not only the correct answer to a question, but also the reasoning employed for arriving at this answer. For this, we release a large benchmark dataset consisting of 12,000 answers and corresponding reasoning in form of natural language derivations. Experiments show that our benchmark is robust to simple heuristics and challenging for state-of-the-art neural path ranking approaches.Task formulation: RC-QED ::: Input, output, and evaluation metricsWe formally define RC-QED as follows:Given: (i) a question Q, and (ii) a set S of supporting documents relevant to Q;Find: (i) answerability s in lbrace textsf {Answerable}, textsf {Unanswerable} rbrace , (ii) an answer a, and (iii) a sequence R of derivation steps.We evaluate each prediction with the following evaluation metrics:Answerability: Correctness of model's decision on answerability (i.e. binary classification task) evaluated by Precision/Recall/F1.Answer precision: Correctness of predicted answers (for Answerable predictions only). We follow the standard practice of RC community for evaluation (e.g. an accuracy in the case of multiple choice QA).Derivation precision: Correctness of generated NLDs evaluated by ROUGE-L BIBREF6 (RG-L) and BLEU-4 (BL-4) BIBREF7. We follow the standard practice of evaluation for natural language generation BIBREF1. Derivation steps might be subjective, so we resort to multiple reference answers.Task formulation: RC-QED ::: RC-QED@!START@^{rm E}@!END@This paper instantiates RC-QED by employing multiple choice, entity-based multi-hop QA BIBREF0 as a testbed (henceforth, RC-QED^{rm E}). In entity-based multi-hop QA, machines need to combine relational facts between entities to derive an answer. For example, in Figure FIGREF1, understanding the facts about Barracuda, Little Queen, and Portrait Records stated in each article is required. This design choice restricts a problem domain, but it provides interesting challenges as discussed in Section SECREF46. In addition, such entity-based chaining is known to account for the majority of reasoning types required for multi-hop reasoning BIBREF2.More formally, given (i) a question Q=(r, q) represented by a binary relation r and an entity q (question entity), (ii) relevant articles S, and (iii) a set C of candidate entities, systems are required to output (i) an answerability s in lbrace textsf {Answerable}, textsf {Unanswerable} rbrace , (ii) an entity e in C (answer entity) that (q, r, e) holds, and (iii) a sequence R of derivation steps as to why e is believed to be an answer. We define derivation steps as an m chain of relational facts to derive an answer, i.e. (q, r_1, e_1), (e_1, r_2, e_2), ..., (e_{m-1}, r_{m-1}, e_m), (e_m, r_m, e_{m+1})). Although we restrict the form of knowledge to entity relations, we use a natural language form to represent r_i rather than a closed vocabulary (see Figure FIGREF1 for an example).Data collection for RC-QED@!START@^{rm E}@!END@ ::: Crowdsourcing interfaceTo acquire a large-scale corpus of NLDs, we use crowdsourcing (CS). Although CS is a powerful tool for large-scale dataset creation BIBREF2, BIBREF8, quality control for complex tasks is still challenging. We thus carefully design an incentive structure for crowdworkers, following Yang2018HotpotQA:Answering.Initially, we provide crowdworkers with an instruction with example annotations, where we emphasize that they judge the truth of statements solely based on given articles, not based on their own knowledge.Data collection for RC-QED@!START@^{rm E}@!END@ ::: Crowdsourcing interface ::: Judgement task (Figure @!START@UID13@!END@).Given a statement and articles, workers are asked to judge whether the statement can be derived from the articles at three grades: True, Likely (i.e. Answerable), or Unsure (i.e. Unanswerable). If a worker selects Unsure, we ask workers to tell us why they are unsure from two choices (“Not stated in the article” or “Other”).Data collection for RC-QED@!START@^{rm E}@!END@ ::: DatasetOur study uses WikiHop BIBREF0, as it is an entity-based multi-hop QA dataset and has been actively used. We randomly sampled 10,000 instances from 43,738 training instances and 2,000 instances from 5,129 validation instances (i.e. 36,000 annotation tasks were published on AMT). We manually converted structured WikiHop question-answer pairs (e.g. locatedIn(Macchu Picchu, Peru)) into natural language statements (Macchu Picchu is located in Peru) using a simple conversion dictionary.We use supporting documents provided by WikiHop. WikiHop collects supporting documents by finding Wikipedia articles that bridges a question entity e_i and an answer entity e_j, where the link between articles is given by a hyperlink.Data collection for RC-QED@!START@^{rm E}@!END@ ::: Results ::: AgreementFor agreement on the number of NLDs, we obtained a Krippendorff's alpha  of 0.223, indicating a fair agreement BIBREF9.Our manual inspection of the 10 worst disagreements revealed that majority (7/10) come from Unsure v.s. non-Unsure. It also revealed that crowdworkers who labeled non-Unsure are reliable—6 out 7 non-Unsure annotations can be judged as correct. This partially confirms the effectiveness of our incentive structure.Baseline RC-QED@!START@^{rm E}@!END@ modelTo highlight the challenges and nature of RC-QED^{rm E}, we create a simple, transparent, and interpretable baseline model.Recent studies on knowledge graph completion (KGC) explore compositional inferences to combat with the sparsity of knowledge bases BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12. Given a query triplet (h, r, t) (e.g. (Macchu Picchu, locatedIn, Peru)), a path ranking-based approach for KGC explicitly samples paths between h and t in a knowledge base (e.g. Macchu Picchu—locatedIn—Andes Mountain—countryOf—Peru), and construct a feature vector of these paths. This feature vector is then used to calculate the compatibility between the query triplet and the sampled paths.RC-QED^{rm E} can be naturally solved by path ranking-based KGC (PRKGC), where the query triplet and the sampled paths correspond to a question and derivation steps, respectively. PRKGC meets our purposes because of its glassboxness: we can trace the derivation steps of the model easily.Baseline RC-QED@!START@^{rm E}@!END@ model ::: TrainingLet mathcal {K}^+ be a set of question-answer pairs, where each instance consists of a triplet (a query entity q_i, a relation r_i, an answer entity a_i). Similarly, let mathcal {K}^- be a set of question-non-answer pairs. We minimize the following binary cross-entropy loss:From the NLD point of view, this is unsupervised training. The model is expected to learn the score function {rm sc(cdot )} to give higher scores to paths (i.e. NLD steps) that are useful for discriminating correct answers from wrong answers by its own. Highly scored NLDs might be useful for answer classification, but these are not guaranteed to be interpretable to humans.Experiments ::: Settings ::: HyperparametersWe used 100-dimensional vectors for entities, relations, and textual relation representations. We initialize these representations with 100-dimensional Glove Embeddings BIBREF14 and fine-tuned them during training. We retain only top-100,000 frequent words as a model vocabulary. We used Bi-LSTM with 50 dimensional hidden state as a textual relation encoder, and an LSTM with 100-dimensional hidden state as an entity encoder. We used the Adam optimizer (default parameters) BIBREF15 with a batch size of 32. We set the answerability threshold epsilon _k = 0.5.Experiments ::: Settings ::: BaselineTo check the integrity of the PRKGC model, we created a simple baseline model (shortest path model). It outputs a candidate entity with the shortest path length from a query entity on G(S) as an answer. Similarly to the PRKGC model, it traverses the path to generate NLDs. It outputs Unanswerable if (i) a query entity is not reachable to any candidate entities on G(S) or (ii) the shortest path length is more than 3.Related work ::: RC datasets with explanationsThere exists few RC datasets annotated with explanations (Table TABREF50). The most similar work to ours is Science QA dataset BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF23, which provides a small set of NLDs annotated for analysis purposes. By developing the scalable crowdsourcing framework, our work provides one order-of-magnitude larger NLDs which can be used as a benchmark more reliably. In addition, it provides the community with new types of challenges not included in HotpotQA.Related work ::: Analysis of RC models and datasetsThere is a large body of work on analyzing the nature of RC datasets, motivated by the question to what degree RC models understand natural language BIBREF3, BIBREF4. Several studies suggest that current RC datasets have unintended bias, which enables RC systems to rely on a cheap heuristics to answer questions. For instance, Sugawara2018 show that some of these RC datasets contain a large number of “easy” questions that can be solved by a cheap heuristics (e.g. by looking at a first few tokens of questions). Responding to their findings, we take a step further and explore the new task of RC that requires RC systems to give introspective explanations as well as answers. In addition, recent studies show that current RC models and NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial examples BIBREF29, BIBREF30, BIBREF31. Explicit modeling of NLDs is expected to reguralize RC models, which could prevent RC models' strong dependence on unintended bias in training data (e.g. annotation artifact) BIBREF32, BIBREF8, BIBREF2, BIBREF5, as partially confirmed in Section SECREF46.Related work ::: Other NLP corpora annotated with explanationsThere are existing NLP tasks that require models to output explanations (Table TABREF50). FEVER BIBREF25 requires a system to judge the “factness” of a claim as well as to identify justification sentences. As discussed earlier, we take a step further from justification explanations to provide new challenges for NLU.Several datasets are annotated with introspective explanations, ranging from textual entailments BIBREF8 to argumentative texts BIBREF26, BIBREF27, BIBREF33. All these datasets offer the classification task of single sentences or sentence pairs. The uniqueness of our dataset is that it measures a machine's ability to extract relevant information from a set of documents and to build coherent logical reasoning steps.Question: What dataset was used in the experiment?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"WikiHop\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"Our study uses WikiHop BIBREF0, as it is an entity-based multi-hop QA dataset and has been actively used.

Although exercise may be used by some to decrease distress , little is known about how it may contribute to stress management ( SM ) among patients receiving chemotherapy .

One advantage of this test is the use of paraffin-embedded blocks instead of previous methods, which required fresh frozen tissue.We used paraffin-embedded core biopsies from a completed phase II trial to identify genes that correlate with response to primary chemotherapy.In addition to the individual genes, the correlation of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score with pCR was examinedRNA was extracted from paraffin blocksto develop the 21-gene Recurrence Score assay (Oncotype DX)","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Tax corresponds to a 40-kDa transforming protein from the pathogenic retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) that activates nuclear expression of the NF-kappaB / Rel family of transcription factors by an unknown mechanism. Tax expression promotes N-terminal phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB alpha, a principal cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Our studies now demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax activates the recently identified cellular kinases IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and IKKbeta, which normally phosphorylate IkappaB alpha on both of its N-terminal regulatory serines in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation. In contrast, a mutant of Tax termed M22, which does not induce NF-kappaB, fails to activate either IKKalpha or IKKbeta. Furthermore, endogenous IKK enzymatic activity was significantly elevated in HTLV-1-infected and Tax-expressing T-cell lines. Transfection of kinase-deficient mutants of IKKalpha and IKKbeta into either human Jurkat T or 293 cells also inhibits NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression induced by Tax. Similarly, a kinase-deficient mutant of NIK (NF-kappaB-inducing kinase), which represents an upstream kinase in the TNF-alpha and IL-1 signaling pathways leading to IKKalpha and IKKbeta activation, blocks Tax induction of NF-kappaB. However, plasma membrane-proximal elements in these proinflammatory cytokine pathways are apparently not involved since dominant negative mutants of the TRAF2 and TRAF6 adaptors, which effectively block signaling through the cytoplasmic tails of the TNF-alpha and IL-1 receptors, respectively, do not inhibit Tax induction of NF-kappaB. Together, these studies demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax exploits a distal part of the proinflammatory cytokine signaling cascade leading to induction of NF-kappaB. The pathological alteration of this cytokine pathway leading to NF-kappaB activation by Tax may play a central role in HTLV-1-mediated transformation of human T cells, clinically manifested as the adult T-cell leukemia","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"human Jurkat T or 293 cells\\", \\"HTLV - 1 - infected and Tax - expressing T - cell lines\\", \\"Tax\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"plasma membrane - proximal elements\\", \\"reporter gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"M22\\", \\"40 - kDa transforming protein\\", \\"TNF - alpha\\", \\"IkappaB kinase alpha\\", \\"tumor necrosis factor alpha\\", \\"proinflammatory cytokine\\", \\"IKKalpha\\", \\"NF - kappaB - inducing kinase\\", \\"IkappaB alpha\\", \\"kinase - deficient mutant\\", \\"TRAF2 and TRAF6 adaptors\\", \\"cytoplasmic tails\\", \\"IL - 1\\", \\"NF - kappaB / Rel family\\", \\"transcription factors\\", \\"interleukin - 1\\", \\"NF - kappaB\\", \\"NIK\\", \\"IKKbeta\\", \\"Tax\\", \\"cellular kinases\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Physically cross-linked beta-lactoglobulin ( BLG ) protein gels containing theophylline and sulfamethoxazole low molecular weight drugs were prepared in 50 % ethanol solution at pH 8 and two protein concentrations ( 6 and 7 % ( w/v ) ) . Swelling behavior of cylindrical gels showed that, irrespective of the hydrated or dehydrated state of the gel, the rate of swelling was the highest in water. When the gels were exposed to water, they first showed a swelling phase in which their weight increased 3 and 30 times for hydrated and dehydrated gels, respectively, due to absorption of water, followed by a dissolution phase. The absorption of solvent was however considerably reduced when the gels were exposed to aqueous buffer solutions. The release behavior of both theophylline and sulfamethoxazole drugs from BLG gels was achieved in a time window ranging from 6 to 24 h. The drug release depended mainly on the solubility of the drugs and the physical state of the gel (hydrated or dry form). Analysis of drug release profiles using the model of Peppas showed that diffusion through hydrated gels was governed by a Fickian process whereas diffusion through dehydrated gels was governed partly by the swelling capacities of the gel but also by the structural rearrangements inside the network occurring during dehydration step. By a judicious selection of protein concentration, hydrated or dehydrated gel state, drug release may be modulated to be engineered suitable for pharmaceutical as well as cosmetics and food applications.sentence: Physically cross-linked beta-lactoglobulin ( BLG ) protein gels containing theophylline and sulfamethoxazole low molecular weight drugs were prepared in 50 % ethanol solution at pH 8 and two protein concentrations ( 6 and 7 % ( w/v ) ) .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Here we present an overview of the generated data. With the instruction-generated instruction data, we conduct instruction tuning for the GPT3 model itself (the “davinci” engine).

The virus was later found to represent the type species of a new genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae, although it was later apparent that the first hantavirus to be isolated was the shrew-borne Thottapalayam virus [19] . The categorization of hantaviruses as belonging to the family Bunyaviridae is due in part to the consistent presence of three RNA genomes that are circularized in vivo as a result of the presence of terminal complementary nucleotides that help fold the genome into a -hairpin‖ morphology, first described for the Uukuniemi phlebovirus [19, 20] . Table 1 is a list of the predominant, serologically distinct pathogenic hantaviruses. Many other named genotypes are described, but such other pathogenic forms are generally closely related to Andes or, in some cases, Sin Nombre virus. During virus maturation, the precursor form GPC is processed using a membrane -bound protease into Gn and Gc, a cleavage that occurs, and appears to be signaled, after the conserved peptide signal WAASA at the C-terminal of Gn [24] . Although the two proteins can be expressed independently through transfection, they can be retained in the wrong cellular compartment (ER or aggresome); they thus must be co-expressed to allow them stability so that the two can be assembled correctly in the Golgi [25, [27] [28] [29] . A number of activities and properties have been identified for the hantavirus envelope glycoproteins, including some features that are suspected to be involved in the pathogenicity of the disease-causing serotypes, a possibility that has engendered experimental attention. The glycoproteins are the known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors, the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor, or DAF [30, 31] ; with gC1qR/p32 also identified as another potential entry receptor [32] . Comparisons with the tick-borne encephalitis virus E protein, led Tischler et al. to consider the Gc glycoprotein as a potential class II fusion protein, perhaps imparting fusion activity to the virion, and this hypothesis has gained support in other studies [33, 34] . Additional activities have been identified with, or claimed to be related to, Gn. For many of these studies, an underlying premise has held that there are differences between the glycoproteins of -pathogenic‖ hantaviruses relative to viruses in the genus that are dubbed to be -non-pathogenic‖. While it is true that it has not yet been possible to link Prospect Hill virus (PHV) to human disease, the absence of evidence for its pathogenicity should perhaps not be equated with the evidence of its absence. One might only consider that the level of disease (e.g., lethargy, fever, proteinuria, and azotemia) associated with infection of nonhuman primates by PHV is not significantly different from that recorded for nonhuman primate models using the known-pathogen Puumala virus (PUUV) [35, 36] . For the purpose of this discussion we will presume that apathogenic hantaviruses are indeed apathogenic. While some studies have suggested that Gn glycoproteins are directed more rapidly into the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway than are apathogenic forms, others have interpreted differences in the handling of Gn glycoproteins across hantavirus species by the ubiquitin-proteosomal system as independent of pathogenicity [37] [38] [39] . Some investigators have directed their efforts toward identifying a differential capacity, either kinetic or in absolute magnitude, in the ability of pathogenic and apathogenic hantaviruses to elicit an interferon response in cells. One premise that emerges is that apathogenic forms would tend to induce an earlier innate response that would render it more likely that the virus would be quickly cleared or rendered less competent in its replication so as to blunt any pathological response in the host [40] [41] [42] . The anti-hantavirus innate response can in some cases be attributed to viral interaction as a ligand of TLR-3, but not in others, and in endothelial cells, it appears not to require more than the viral particle itself, even when introduced in replication-incompetent form [43, 44] . Proteins and mRNAs prominently induced by hantaviruses include MxA and IFIT-1 (ISG-56) and others including some with known or suspected anti-viral activity. Those hantaviruses, often highly pathogenic strains, that fail to induce a potent antiviral response, are suspected or presumed to have a (more) potent interferon-pathway antagonism mechanism relative to other viruses, a mechanism that acts positively to prevent an effective innate response from forming, at least early in infection [42, 45] . Yet some instances are reported wherein highly pathogenic hantaviruses, such as SNV, are also able to induce expression of interferon-stimulated gene mRNAs, even very early in infection, with ISG proteins, as expected, taking longer to appear in the cell [44] . Anti-interferon activities have also been attributed to the NSs protein that may be elaborated in cells infected by serotypes that encode this protein [46] . Other investigators have examined the activities of hantavirus glycoproteins and other proteins that might themselves directly affect some aspects of the pathogenic progression associated with hantavirus infection of humans, such as vascular permeability changes. While early attempts to directly cause increases in permeability of endothelial monolayers with viral particles or viral infection were largely disappointing, hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating VEG-F-induced endothelial permeability [47, 48] . The shorter (50-kD) nucleocapsid or N protein is a structural component of the viral nucleocapsid, along with the genomic viral RNA segments. As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments with high affinity [49, 50] , it limits the access of the RNA to host nucleases and helps to render viral replication a closed process within the cytoplasm. It also acts as a peripheral membrane protein, as does the L protein [51] , an activity that could play a role in its presumed, but not yet demonstrated function as matrix [52] . Until recently, it had not been appreciated that N has a wide variety of other activities, some of which can be linked, not only to fundamental requirements of replication, but also to the interference with an array of the intracellular processes of the normal cell. Thus, an interaction between the amino terminus of the hantavirus N protein and the cellular protein Daxx has been proposed, with the suggestion of potential pro-apoptotic consequences [51] . N is also reported to interact with actin microfilaments, and the SUMO-1 protein [53, 54] . Using reporter-gene based assays, Connie Schmaljohn and her colleagues have reported that Hantaan virus' nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B). The effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS [55] . In the cytoplasm of infected cells, N protein can be found in cellular P bodies where it sequesters and protects 5' caps. It may locate the caps through its interaction with DCP1, a key constituent of P bodies. During hantavirus infection, the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies, through their interaction with N and DCP1. The N protein demonstrates preferential protection of mRNAs engineered to prematurely terminate their encoded protein in comparison to native mRNAs [56] . N protein has been increasingly linked to viral replication and translation, sometimes in previously unanticipated ways. It is among a growing family of diverse viral proteins that can serve as a nonspecific -RNA chaperone‖, an activity that should facilitate the L polymerase's access to vRNA for transcription and replication, in that it can transiently dissociate misfolded RNA structures [57] . Some of N protein's effects on translation might not immediately be recognized to be adaptive in nature. It can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex, simultaneously presenting the ribosome with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eIF 4E, binding to the 43S pre-initiation complex as does eIF 4G, while replacing the helicase activity of eIF 4A, which is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure [56, 58] . These three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation. In P bodies, N protein's ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides, along with its activity in protecting capped RNAs from degradation likely facilitates the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation by L polymerase (-cap snatching‖). Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi [27] . The N proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions, and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that N tracks along microtubules  but not with actin filaments [52] . The ultimate destination for N, for its assembly into viral particles is the Golgi, and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), also known as vesicular-tubular cluster [52] . A dominant negative inhibitor, dynamitin, associated with dynein-mediated transport, reduced N's accumulation in the Golgi. Later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to Old World hantaviruses such as HTNV, but that the New World hantavirus ANDV is instead associated with actin filaments [59] . However, recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the New World hantavirus SNV [60] . Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression ( Table 2 ). The pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is the topic of a continuously-updated review in the series UpToDate [61] . By the time symptoms appear in HCPS, both strong antiviral responses, and, for the more virulent viral genotypes, viral RNA can be detected in blood plasma or nucleated blood cells respectively [63, 64] . At least three studies have correlated plasma viral RNA with disease severity for HCPS and HFRS, suggesting that the replication of the virus plays an ongoing and real-time role in viral pathogenesis [65] [66] [67] . Several hallmark pathologic changes have been identified that occur in both HFRS and HCPS. A critical feature of both is a transient (~ 1-5 days) capillary leak involving the kidney and retroperitoneal space in HFRS and the lungs in HCPS. The resulting leakage is exudative in character, with chemical composition high in protein and resembling plasma. The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses. It is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. The virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia, a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections [62, 63] . By the time that secondary viremia emerges, the agents of the more severe forms of HFRS and HCPS have begun to achieve sufficient mass as to induce, through PAMP-PRR interactions and other means, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [64] . For HCPS, that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs, yet, for unknown reasons, spares the retroperitoneum and, in general, the kidney. In HFRS the situation is reversed, and yet it is often not appreciated that the expected preferential tissue tropism of HFRS-associated viruses and their HCPS-associated counterparts for the renal and pulmonary beds, respectively, is not as one would predict through the manifestations of the two diseases. Local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms, with those abnormalities sometimes culminating in shock and death. Yet it is not hypoxemia, due to the prominent pulmonary edema, that leads to death in most fatal cases of HCPS, but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators that leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome [64, 65] . It is tempting to speculate that mediators produced in the lung in connection with the inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in HCPS, a disadvantageous consequence of the close anatomic juxtaposition of the two organs. Thus, at least three classes of potential mechanisms, some overlapping and all certainly nonexclusive of the others, could be presumed to underlie the pathogenesis of HCPS. These include:(1) Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) with the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 [43] . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells [66] and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells [67] . (2) Direct viral effects. The observed correlation between viral load and disease severity leaves the possibility open that hantavirus particles or RNA can themselves have toxic effects on cells or on signaling. Some investigators have favored direct viral toxicity, acting through the inhibition of endothelial cell barrier function, as an explanation for much of the capillary leak, although there is widespread agreement that multiple mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis likely operate simultaneously in the affected patient [68] .Question: What have confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies shown?","answer":"that N tracks along microtubules"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

By targeting a constitutive exon of the AGO1 gene, we demonstrate homozygous mutation in up to 82% of cells, thereby allowing the study of genetic knockouts in a Drosophila cell line for the first time. We have shown that homologous gene targeting is possible at 1-4% efficiency using this system, allowing for the construction of defined insertions and deletions.This technology enables controlled genetic manipulation in Drosophila cell lines, and its simplicity offers the opportunity to study cellular phenotypes genome-wide.The prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas9 type II genome editing system has recently been applied in cell lines and vertebrates.We now demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish is highly efficient, reaching up to 86.0%, and is heritable.

In this review, we underscore the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and discuss the alterations and distinct phenotypes of immune cells at the different stages of disease.Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells.The immune system has been found to be involved with positive and negative effects in the nervous system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. In general, T cells, B cells, NK cells, mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, antibodies, complement and cytokines participate in limiting damage.Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells.We propose the following mechanism for the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) administered intrathecally in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): MSCs increase infiltration of peripheral immune cells into CNS and skew the infiltrated immune cells toward regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ) and Th2 lymphocytes.Immune cell infiltration to the brain&apos;s territory was considered for decades to reflect a pathological process in which immune cells attack the central nervous system (CNS); such a process is observed in the inflammatory autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis (MS).","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

Two groups received linoleic acid, one alone as a spread and one with gamma-linolenic acid in capsules (Naudicelle); and two control groups received oleic acid, one as a spread and one in capsules. Rates of clinical deterioration and frequencies of attacks were not significantly different between treated and control groups. Exacerbations were shorter and less severe in patients receiving a high dose of linoleic acid than in controls, but those receiving a lower dose--that is, Naudicelle--showed no such difference. Thus supplementing the diet with 20 g linoleic acid marginally affected the duration and severity of relapses of MS but had no effect on overall disability. The dose of Naudicelle used provided insufficient supplementation.Title 2:A double-blind controlled trial of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.Abstract 2:A trial of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of multiple sclerosis has been conducted over a 5 year period. Ambulant patients (312) with acute remitting disease were randomly allocated to treatment or placebo. Both groups were given dietary advice to increase the intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the treatment group in addition received capsules containing n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Analysis of clinical outcome at the end of 2 years of treatment was made in terms of the duration, frequency and severity of relapses and the number of patients who had improved or remained unchanged. The results showed no significant difference at the usual 95% confidence limits but there was a trend in favour of the group treated with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in all parameters examined.Title 3:Linoleic acid in multiple sclerosis: failure to show any therapeutic benefit.Abstract 3:We have studied the effect of a dietary supplement with linoleic acid (LA) in 76 patients with MS. We could detect no effect of this supplement on the progression of neurological findings, the relapse rate, or the severity of relapses. We were also able to show that oral supplementation with a linoleic acid preparation would raise the blood level of LA in these patients. We were unable to show that there was any reduction in the linoleic acid blood levels associated with acute relapses of MS during this study.Title 4:Double-blind trial of linoleate supplementation of the diet in multiple sclerosis.Abstract 4:Seventy-five patients in London and Belfast with multiple sclerosis were given daily supplements of a vegetable oil mixture containing either linoleate or oleate for two years in a double-blind control trial. Relapses tended to be less frequent and were significantly less severe and of shorter duration in the linoleate-supplemented group than in those receiving the oleate mixture, but clear evidence that treatment affected the overall rate of clinical deterioration was not obtained.Title 5:Low fat dietary intervention with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in multiple sclerosis patients.Abstract 5:To determine whether a low fat diet supplemented with omega-3 positively affects quality of life (QOL) in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. In this 1-year long double-blind, randomized trial, patients were randomized to two dietary interventions: the \\"Fish Oil\\" (FO) group received a low fat diet (15% fat) with omega-3 FOs and the \\"Olive Oil\\" (OO) group received the AHA Step I diet (fat 30%) with OO supplements. The primary outcome measure was the Physical Components Summary Scale (PCS) of the Short Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36). Additional measures using MS specific QOL questionnaires, neurological status and relapse rate were obtained.                31 RRMS patients were enrolled, with mean follow up over 11 +/- SD 2.9 months. Clinical benefits favoring the FO group were observed on PCS/SF-36 (P = 0.050) and MHI (P = 0.050) at 6 months. Reduced fatigue was seen on the OO diet at 6 months (P = 0.035). The relapse rate decreased in both groups relative to the rates during the 1 year preceding the study: mean change in relapse rate in the FO group: -0.79 +/- SD 1.12 relapses/year (P = 0.021) vs. -0.69 +/- SD 1.11 (P = 0.044) in the OO group. This study suggests that a low fat diet supplemented with omega-3 PUFA can have moderate benefits in RRMS patients on concurrent disease modifying therapies.","answer":"PUFAs seem to have no major effect on the main clinical outcome in MS (disease progression), but they may tend to reduce the frequency of relapses over two years. However, the data that are available are insufficient to assess a real benefit or harm from PUFA supplementation because of their uncertain quality.Evidence on the possible benefits and risks of vitamin supplementation and antioxidant supplements in MS is lacking.

Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a disorder of lymphocyte homeostasis and immunological tolerance. Most patients have a heterozygous mutation in the APT1 gene, which encodes Fas (CD95, APO-1), mediator of an apoptotic pathway crucial to lymphocyte homeostasis. Of 17 unique APT1 mutations in unrelated ALPS probands, 12 (71%) occurred in exons 7-9, which encode the intracellular portion of Fas. In vitro, activated lymphocytes from all 17 patients showed apoptotic defects when exposed to an anti-Fas agonist monoclonal antibody. Similar defects were found in a Fas-negative cell line transfected with cDNAs bearing each of the mutations. In cotransfection experiments, Fas constructs with either intra- or extracellular mutations caused dominant inhibition of apoptosis mediated by wild-type Fas. Two missense Fas variants, not restricted to patients with ALPS, were identified. Variant A (-1) T at the Fas signal-sequence cleavage site, which mediates apoptosis less well than wild-type Fas and is partially inhibitory, was present in 13% of African American alleles. Among the ALPS-associated Fas mutants, dominant inhibition of apoptosis was much more pronounced in mutants affecting the intracellular, versus extracellular, portion of the Fas receptor. Mutations causing disruption of the intracellular Fas death domain also showed a higher penetrance of ALPS phenotype features in mutation-bearing relatives. Significant ALPS-related morbidity occurred in 44% of relatives with intracellular mutations, versus 0% of relatives with extracellular mutations. Thus, the location of mutations within APT1 strongly influences the development and the severity of ALPS.","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"ALPS\\", \\"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome\\", \\"disorder of lymphocyte homeostasis and immunological tolerance\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of esmolol, an ultra-short-acting beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, to control the sinus tachycardia and increase in arterial blood pressures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Each of 20 patients, ASA physical status I-III, participated in a double-blind, randomized study, involving four match-pair trials (placebo versus esmolol) during ECT. Each patient acted as his or her own control (total number of ECT procedures, 160). We administered a 4-min infusion of either placebo or esmolol at the rate of 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. We then induced anesthesia with methohexital and succinylcholine. After administration of electrical stimulation for ECT, the rate of infusion decreased to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for three additional minutes and was then discontinued. Statistically significant reductions in mean heart rate from minute 2 until minute 15 and in maximum heart rate (the mean of each patient 's maximum heart rate after seizure changed from 152 + /- 23 to 115 + /- 24 beats/min) occurred in patients given esmolol. During and immediately after infusion, arterial blood pressure also decreased. Finally, the length of seizures decreased, as manifested clinically from 48 + /- 18 to 39 + /- 14 s and on electroencephalogram from 86 + /- 41 to 67 + /- 28 s.

Inhalation treatment with nanoparticle containing aerosols appears a promising new therapeutic option but new formulations have to be assessed for efficacy and toxicity. We evaluated the utility of a VITROCELL®6 PT-CF+PARI LC SPRINT® Baby Nebulizer (PARI BOY) system compared with a conventional MicroSprayer. A549 cells were cultured in the air-liquid interface, exposed to nanoparticle aerosols and characterized by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance and staining for tight junction proteins. Deposition and distribution rates of polystyrene particles and of carbon nanotubes on the cells were assessed. In addition, cytotoxicity of aerosols containing polystyrene particles was compared with cytotoxicity of polystyrene particles in suspension tested in submersed cultures. Exposure by itself in both exposure systems did not damage the cells. Deposition rates of aerosolized polystyrene particles were about 700 times and that of carbon nanotubes about 4 times higher in the MicroSprayer than in the VITROCELL®6 PT-CF system. Cytotoxicity of amine-functionalized polystyrene nanoparticles was significantly higher when applied as an aerosol on cell cultured in air-liquid interface culture compared with nanoparticle suspensions tested in submersed culture.

Enhancer regions are also enriched with long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts, which are typically spliced and substantially more stable. In order to explore the relationship between these two classes of RNAs, we analyzed DNase hypersensitive sites with evidence of bidirectional transcription, which we termed eRNA-producing centers (EPCs). EPCs found very close to transcription start sites of lncRNAs exhibit attributes of both enhancers and promoters, including distinctive DNA motifs and a characteristic chromatin landscape. These EPCs are associated with higher enhancer activity, driven at least in part by the presence of conserved, directional splicing signals that promote lncRNA production, pointing at a causal role of lncRNA processing in enhancer activity. Together, our results suggest that the conserved ability of some enhancers to produce lncRNAs augments their activity in a manner likely mediated through lncRNA maturation.In order to explore the relationship between these two classes of RNAs, we analyzed DNase hypersensitive sites with evidence of bidirectional transcription, which we termed eRNA-producing centers (EPCs).In order to explore the relationship between these two classes of RNAs , we analyzed DNase hypersensitive sites with evidence of bidirectional transcription , which we termed eRNA-producing centers ( EPCsIn order to explore the relationship between these two classes of RNAs, we analyzed DNase hypersensitive sites with evidence of bidirectional transcription, which we termed eRNA-producing centers (EPCs).","answer":"Active enhancers in mammals produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that are bidirectionally transcribed, unspliced, and unstable.

METHODS: A multicentre observational study was performed from 22 February through 30 June 2020. We included consecutive adult patients with severe COVID-19, defined as respiratory rate >/=30 breath per minute, oxygen saturation </=93% on ambient air or arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen </=300 mm Hg. We excluded patients being treated with other immunomodulant drugs, receiving low-dose corticosteroids and receiving corticosteroids 72 hours after admission. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality from hospital admission. The main exposure variable was corticosteroid therapy at a dose of >/=0.5 mg/kg of prednisone equivalents. It was introduced as binomial covariate in a logistic regression model for the primary endpoint and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1717 patients with COVID-19 evaluated, 513 were included in the study, and of these, 170 (33%) were treated with corticosteroids. During hospitalization, 166 patients (34%) met the criteria of the primary outcome (60/170, 35% in the corticosteroid group and 106/343, 31% in the noncorticosteroid group). At multivariable analysis corticosteroid treatment was not associated with lower 30-day mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-1.74; p 0.33). After inverse probability of treatment weighting, corticosteroids were not associated with lower 30-day mortality (average treatment effect, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.09; p 0.12). However, subgroup analysis revealed that in patients with PO2/FiO2 < 200 mm Hg at admission (135 patients, 52 (38%) treated with corticosteroids), corticosteroid treatment was associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality (23/52, 44% vs. 45/83, 54%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.04-0.90; p 0.036).

Evaluation is also crucial to assessing competing claims and identifying promising technical approaches. While work in speech recognition (SR) has a history of evaluation methodologies that permit comparison among various systems, until recently no methodology existed for either developers of natural language (NL) interfaces or researchers in speech understanding (SU) to evaluate and compare the systems they developed. Recently considerable progress has been made by a number of groups involved in the DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) program to agree on a methodology for comparative evaluation of SLS systems, and that methodology has been put into practice several times in comparative tests of several SLS systems. These evaluations are probably the only NL evaluations other than the series of Message Understanding Conferences (Sundheim, 1989; Sundheim, 1991) to have been developed and used by a group of researchers at different sites, although several excellent workshops have been held to study some of these problems (Palmer et al., 1989; Neal et al., 1991). This paper describes a practical'black-box' methodology for automatic evaluation of question-answering NL systems. While each new application domain will require some development of special resources, the heart of the methodology is domain-independent, and it can be used with either speech or text input. The particular characteristics of the approach are described in the following section: subsequent sections present its implementation in the DARPA SLS community, and some problems and directions for future development.","answer":"[[\\"evaluation of SLS systems\\", \\"Message Understanding Conferences\\", \\"CONJUNCTION\\"], [\\"speech or text input\\", \\"u0027black-boxu0027 methodology\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"u0027black-boxu0027 methodology\\", \\"SLS systems\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"evaluation of SLS systems\\", \\"NL evaluations\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"evaluation methodology\\", \\"approaches\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"u0027black-boxu0027 methodology\\", \\"automatic evaluation of question-answering NL systems\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"u0027black-boxu0027 methodology\\", \\"evaluation of SLS systems\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A family in which two male siblings were affected with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) was studied using G-6-PD isoenzymes as an X-linked marker in order to investigate the nature of cellular abnormalities. Isolated peripheral blood cell types from the doubly heterozygous mother of the affected males seemingly failed to express the G-6-PD allele in cis position with the WAS allele while her cultured skin fibroblasts expressed both G-6-PD alleles. Additionally, a histogram analysis of platelet size revealed a single population of abnormally small platelets in the affected propositus, whereas the heterozygous mother had no appreciable small platelet subpopulation. In vitro culture of hemopoietic progenitor cells of the heterozygous mother showed that the majority of progenitor cells did not express the WAS allele. However, a small number of cells expressing the G-6-PD type linked with the WAS allele were detected. The proportion of the latter progenitors was significantly higher among more primitive progenitors (those giving rise to later appearing colonies). This observation suggests that selection against cells expressing the Wiskott-Aldrich defect takes place in the hemopoietic system of the heterozygous female and offers a possible means of carrier detection in some women. Linkage studies in this family revealed one example of probable recombination between the loci for WAS and G-6-PD among three informative subjects, suggesting that these two loci may not be closely linked on the X-chromosome..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"Wiskott-Aldrich defect\\", \\"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome\\", \\"WAS\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  This paper presents a grammar-induction based approach to partitioning a Web page into several small pages while each small page fits not only spatially but also logically for mobile browsing. Our approach proceeds in three steps: (1) using the grammar induction technique to generate a graph grammar, which formalizes design policies for presenting information in a clear and logic structure; (2) based on the graph grammar, a graph parser parses a Web page to recover the hierarchical logic structure underlying that Web page; (3) the extracted logic structure models the content organization in the Web page, and is used to partition the Web page into several small pages for mobile displays. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  A graph grammar is a generative description of a graph language (a possibly infinite set of graphs). In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for inducing a graph grammar from a given set of 'positive' and 'negative' graphs. The algorithm is guaranteed to produce a grammar that can generate all of the positive and none of the negative input graphs. Driven by a heuristic specific-to-general search process, the algorithm tries to find a small grammar that generalizes beyond the positive input set. During the search, the algorithm employs a graph grammar parser to eliminate the candidate grammars that can generate at least one negative input graph. We validate our method by inducing grammars for chemical structural formulas and flowcharts and thereby show its potential applicability to chemical engineering and visual programming.Literature Review:","answer":"Unlike one-dimensional strings whose elements are connected linearly, visual languages and graphs are connected in two or more dimensions allowing for arbitrary proximity between elements. Graph grammars define a language of valid graphs by a set of production rules with subgraphs instead of strings on the right-hand side. Fürst et al. propose a graph grammar inference algorithm based on positive and negative graph samples BIB003 . The algorithm starts with a grammar that produces exactly the set of positive samples then incrementally generalizes towards a smaller grammar representation, a strategy similar to typical DFA inference algorithms which build a prefix tree acceptor then generalize by merging states. The authors demonstrate their inference algorithm with a flowchart example and a hydrocarbon example, making a convincing case for its applicability to software engineering tasks such as metamodel inference and reverse engineering visual languages. Another graph grammar inference algorithm is proposed by Ates et al. which repeatedly finds and compresses overlapping identical subgraphs to a single nonterminal node BIB001 . This system uses only positive samples during the inference process, but validates the resulting grammar by ensuring all the graphs in the training set are parsable and other graphs which are close to but distinct from the training graphs are not parsable. Ates et al. demonstrate their algorithm with two practical inferences: one for the structure of a programming language and one for the structure of an XML data source. Kong et al. use graph grammar induction to automatically translate a webpage designed for desktop displays into a webpage designed for mobile displays BIB002 . The inference performed is similar to the aforementioned proposed by Ates et al. BIB001 because they both use the Spatial Graph Grammar (SGG) formalism and subgraph compression. The induction algorithm consumes webpages, or more accurately their DOM trees, to produce a graph grammar. After a human has verfied this grammar it is used to parse a webpage, and the resulting parse is used to segment the webpage into semantically related subpages suitable for display on mobile devices. Graph grammar inference algorithms are less common than their text-based counterparts, but provide a powerful mechanism to infer patterns in complex structures. Parsing graphs is NP-hard in general, causing these algorithms to be more computationally expensive than inference from text. Most graph grammar learners overcome this complexity by restricting their graph expressiveness or employing search and parse heuristics to achieve a polynomial runtime."},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Natural bear hybrids and studies of few nuclear genes indicate that gene flow among bears may be more common than expected and not limited to polar and brown bears. Here we present a genome analysis of the bear family with representatives of all living species. Phylogenomic analyses of 869 mega base pairs divided into 18,621 genome fragments yielded a well-resolved coalescent species tree despite signals for extensive gene flow across species. However, genome analyses using different statistical methods show that gene flow is not limited to closely related species pairs. Strong ancestral gene flow between the Asiatic black bear and the ancestor to polar, brown and American black bear explains uncertainties in reconstructing the bear phylogeny. Gene flow across the bear clade may be mediated by intermediate species such as the geographically wide-spread brown bears leading to large amounts of phylogenetic conflict. Genome-scale analyses lead to a more complete understanding of complex evolutionary processes. Evidence for extensive inter-specific gene flow, found also in other animal species, necessitates shifting the attention from speciation processes achieving genome -wide reproductive isolation to the selective processes that maintain species divergence in the face of gene flow.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"nuclear genes\\", \\"genome\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"gene flow\\", \\"pairs\\", \\"mega base pairs\\", \\"Gene flow\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"fragments\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"brown bears\\", \\"American black bear\\", \\"Bears\\", \\"bear family\\", \\"polar\\", \\"bear clade\\", \\"brown\\", \\"Asiatic black bear\\", \\"bears\\", \\"mammals\\", \\"bear\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"uncertainties\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"Genome-scale analyses\\", \\"genome analysis\\", \\"genome analyses\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"species\\", \\"animal species\\", \\"living species\\", \\"species tree\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"studies\\", \\"Phylogenomic analyses\\", \\"statistical methods\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"intermediate\\", \\"divergence\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Cocrystal structures of PDE5 catalytic (C) domain with inhibitors reveal a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with Tyr-612, hydrogen bonds with Gln-817, a hydrophobic clamp formed by Phe-820 and Val-782, and contacts with His-613, Leu-765, and Phe-786 [Sung et al. (2003) Nature 425, 98-102; Huai et al. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 13095-13101]. Present results of point mutations of full-length PDE5 showed that maximum catalysis was decreased 2650-fold in H613A and 55-fold in F820A. Catalytic-site affinities for cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) were respectively weakened 14-, 123-, 30-, 51-, and 43-fold for Y612A; 63-, 511-, 43-, 95- and 61-fold for Q817A; and 59-, 448-, 71-, 137-, and 93-fold for F820A. The data indicate that these three amino acids are major determinants of affinity for cGMP and potency of selective and nonselective inhibitors, and that higher vardenafil potency over sildenafil and tadalafil results from stronger contacts with Tyr-612, Gln-817, and Phe-820.

We tested the hypothesis that the frequency of the minor Ser482 allele at the PPARGC1A locus is lower in World-class Spanish male endurance athletes ( cases ) [ n = 104 ; mean ( SD ) age : 26.8 ( 3.8 ) yr ] than in unfit United Kingdom ( UK ) Caucasian male controls [ n = 100 ; mean ( SD ) age : 49.3 ( 8.1 ) yr ] . In cases and controls , the Gly482Ser genotype met Hardy-Weinberg expectations ( P > 0.05 in both groups tested separately ) . Cases had significantly higher V(O2 max ) [ 73.4 ( 5.7 ) vs. 29.4 ml x kg(-1 ) x min(-1 ) ( 3.8 ) ; P < 0.0001 ] and were leaner [ body mass index : 20.6 ( 1.5 ) vs. 27.6 kg/m2 ( 3.9 ) ; P < 0.0001 ] than controls . In unadjusted chi2 analyses , the frequency of the minor Ser482 allele was significantly lower in cases than in controls ( 29.1 vs. 40.0 % ; P = 0.01 ) . To assess the possibility that genetic stratification could confound these observations , we also compared Gly482Ser genotype frequencies  in Spanish ( n = 164 ) and UK Caucasian men ( n = 381 ) who were unselected for their level of fitness . In these analyses , Ser482 allele frequencies were very similar ( 36.9 % in Spanish vs. 37.5 % in UK Caucasians , P = 0.83 ) , suggesting that confounding by genetic stratification is unlikely to explain the association between Gly482Ser genotype and endurance capacity . In summary , our data indicate a role for the Gly482Ser genotype in determining aerobic fitness . This finding has relevance from the perspective of physical performance , but it may also be informative for the targeted prevention of diseases associated with low fitness such as Type 2 diabetes","answer":"PPARs can be used for estimating the potential to achieve elite status in human physical performance in strength and power , team , and aerobic sports disciplines .Carrying specific PPAR alleles can provide a partial benefit to achieving elite sports status , but does not preclude achieving elite status if they are absent"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

BACKGROUND Biotin deficiency is teratogenic in several mammalian species . Approximately 50 % of pregnant women have an abnormally increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid ( 3-HIA ) , which probably reflects decreased activity of the biotin-dependent enzyme methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase . However , increased 3-HIA excretion could result from pregnancy per se ( eg , from an effect of pregnancy on renal handling of organic acids ) . OBJECTIVE We tested the hypothesis that biotin supplementation significantly decreases 3-HIA excretion in pregnant women with abnormally increased 3-HIA excretion . DESIGN Twenty-six pregnant women with increased 3-HIA excretion were studied in a randomized , placebo-controlled trial ; 10 women were studied during early pregnancy ( 6-17 wk gestation ) and 16 women during late pregnancy ( 21-37 wk gestation ) . Urine samples were collected before and after 14 d of supplementation with 300 microg ( 1.2 micromol ) biotin/d or placebo . RESULTS In the early-pregnancy group , 3-HIA excretion decreased ( P < 0.006 ) by 11.7 +/- 3.6 mmol/mol creatinine ( mean +/- SEM ) in the 5 women who received biotin supplements , whereas 3-HIA excretion increased by 1.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/mol creatinine in the 5 women who received placebo . In the late-pregnancy group , 3-HIA excretion decreased ( P < 0.002 ) by 7.1 +/- 1.2 mmol/mol creatinine in the 8 women who received biotin supplements , whereas 3-HIA excretion increased by 0.9 +/- 1.8 mmol/mol creatinine in the 8 women who received placebo . CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that the increased excretion of 3-HIA seen frequently in normal pregnancy reflects reduced biotin status . The conclusion that marginal biotin deficiency occurs frequently in the first trimester further raises concern about potential human teratogenicity .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"300 microg ( 1.2 micromol ) biotin/d\\", \\"placebo\\", \\"placebo-controlled\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"biotin status .\\", \\"3-hydroxyisovaleric acid ( 3-HIA )\\", \\"excretion of 3-HIA\\", \\"Urine samples\\", \\"3-HIA excretion\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"women\\", \\"Twenty-six\\", \\"pregnant\\", \\"normal pregnancy\\", \\"increased 3-HIA excretion\\"]}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Results 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  We demonstrate a plasmonic Mach-Zehnder-modulator with a record-small length of 10 μm. The modulator is fully integrated into a single silicon waveguide and operates at 72 Gbit s-1. A voltage-length product as low as VπL=50 ±5 Vpm is found. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  The authors demonstrate a 70 GHz modulator in a 10-μm-long two-dimensionally localized gap-plasmon waveguide system. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Complementing plasmonic slot waveguides with highly nonlinear organic materials has rendered a new generation of ultracompact active nanophotonic components that are redefining the state of the art. In this paper, we review the fundamentals of this so-called plasmonic–organic–hybrid (POH) platform. Starting from simple phase shifters to the most compact IQ modulators, we introduce key devices of high-speed data communications. For instance, all-plasmonic Mach–Zehnder modulators (MZMs) are reviewed and long-term prospects are discussed. This kind of modulator already features unique properties such as a small footprint (  20 mu m ^{2} ), a large electro–optic bandwidth ( > 110 GHz), a small energy consumption ( sim 25 fJ/b), a large extinction ratio ( > 25 dB) in combination with a record small voltage-length product of 40 V mu m. Finally, as an example for seamless integration we introduce novel plasmonic IQ modulators. With such modulators we show the generation of advanced modulation formats (QPSK, 16-QAM) on footprints as small as 10 mu{hbox {m}}times {hbox {75}} mu{hbox {m}} . This demonstration ultimately shows how plasmonics can be used to control both phase and amplitude of an optical carrier on the microscale with reasonably low losses. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  We demonstrate driver-less 100 GBd operation of a plasmonic intensity modulator. Drive voltages below 1V lead to low power consumption of 2.84 fJ/bit for 100 Gbit/s with a direct detected BER below the HD-FEC limit.Literature Review:","answer":"The graphs in Figures 13-15 , show minimum and maximum energy efficiency values, for each interconnect device module (laser sources, modulators and detectors) separately, specifying their implementation technology as well. Minimum and maximum values can be seen in labels on each column in fJ/bit unit, though they are represented in axes in logarithmic scale for better value fitting. Concerning directly modulated sources, as can be seen from Figure 13 , the best energy performance comes from InP based photonic crystal nanocavity, or LEAP lasers with energies from a few fJ up to 10 fJ/bit, hence capable of meeting future energy requirements. Their energy performance can almost compete with plasmonic nano-LED structures with energies of just a few fJ. VCSELs and hybrid III-V on Si laser structures, are far less energy efficient with energies more or less a few hundred fJ, with the best performance lying at sub hundred fJ and hence they cannot be considered capable of meeting future on-chip energy requirements, though they are state of the art transmitters for board to board interconnections nowadays. Regarding modulators, as can be seen from Figure 14 , the best energy performance comes from nanoscale silicon photonics based modulators with energy performance ranging from a sub-fJ up to 10 fJ. However, this is not always the case, since, other photonic modulator structure energies usually vary from a few hundred of fJs up to sub hundred fJs, such as hybrid InP on silicon, Ge on silicon, or silicon organic polymer modulator structures. Plasmonic modulators BIB003 , BIB005 , BIB004 , BIB001 , BIB002 really stand a good energy performance lying from 2.84 to a few tens of fJs, slightly above the best performance of photonic modulators. Concerning the receiver side, as one can see from Figure 15 , energy performance superiority of a plasmonic photodetectors (integrated Ge, or nanoantenna structures), is crystal clear, compared with a typical Ge photodetector on Si or even enhanced with avalanche mechanism. Plasmonic integrated Ge photodetector total parasitic capacitance lies between 10 and Table VI). 100 aF, thus giving energies between 10 and 100 aJ, respectively, considering an 1V typical drive swing voltage, which are orders of magnitude less than the aforementioned energies of a typical Ge on Si photodetector. As can be deducted from Figures 13-15 , the bottom line is that, with the exception of photodetector energy performance comparison, photonic based chip interconnect modules are considered to be comparable to plasmonic based ones in terms of energy efficiency. However, plasmonic based devices strong point is actually their relatively ultra-small dimensions leading to high integration densities, and with their low device capacitance allowing for ultra-high bandwidth operation. It is then worth it, comparing chip module bandwidth density versus energy efficiency, to observe another point of comparison view among the aforementioned technologies. Figures 16-18, show energy efficiency versus bandwidth density values, for each interconnect device module (laser sources, modulators and detectors) respectively, specifying their implementation technology as well. We observe that by reducing the active area, we can effectively reduce the energy cost. Concerning directly modulated sources, as can be seen from Figure 16 , the best combined performance comes from InP based photonic crystal nanocavity, and plasmonic nano LED structures. Concerning modulators, as can be seen from Figure 17 , the best energy efficiency comes from nano scale silicon photonics. Finally, in Figure 18 it is clearly shown that plasmonic photodetectors are by far the most energy-efficient solution."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

AIM To evaluate the shear bond strength of brackets bonded with resin-modified glass-ionomer cement ( RMGIC ) using various methods of enamel conditioning . METHODS Forty-five human premolars were randomly divided into five groups . The roots of these teeth were fixed in acrylic resin cylinders , and brackets were bonded to the teeth 's crowns using the following material combinations : RMGIC only ; RMGIC and corresponding primer ; RMGIC , acid etching , and Scotchbond Multipurpose ; RMGIC and two-step self-etching primer ; and RMGIC and one-step primer . All specimens were submitted to pH cycling for 14 days before shear bond strength was assessed in a universal test machine . RESULTS The medians and standard deviations ( in MPa ) were RMGIC only = 8.34 ± 1.11 ; RMGIC and corresponding primer = 7.05 ± 2.24 ; RMGIC , acid etching , and Scotchbond Multipurpose = 7.00 ± 4.79 ; RMGIC and two-step self-etching primer = 0.54 ± 0.30 ; and RMGIC and one-step primer = 10.61 ± 4.58 . The value for RMGIC and two-step self-etching primer was significantly lower than all other values . CONCLUSION It can be concluded that the tested RMGIC is suitable for bonding orthodontic brackets , even when used by itself . Different enamel preparations do not improve its performance .

Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to be important in esophageal tumorigenesis. We have shown that COX-2 mediates acid-induced PGE2 production. The prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) responsible for acid-induced PGE2 production in BE, however, is not known. We found that microsomal PGES1 (mPGES1), mPGES2, and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) were present in FLO EA cells. Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased mPGES1 mRNA and protein levels but had little or no effect on mPGES2 or cPGES mRNA. Knockdown of mPGES1 by mPGES1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and thymidine incorporation. Knockdown of NADPH oxidase, NOX5-S, a variant lacking calcium-binding domains, by NOX5 siRNA significantly inhibited acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Overexpression of NOX5-S significantly increased the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in vivo activation reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc. Knockdown of NF-κB1 p50 by p50 siRNA significantly decreased acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Two novel NF-κB binding elements, GGAGTCTCCC and CGGGACACCC, were identified in the mPGES1 gene promoter. We conclude that mPGES1 mediates acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and cell proliferation. Acid-induced mPGES1 expression depends on activation of NOX5-S and NF-κB1 p50. Microsomal PGES1 may be a potential target to prevent or treat EA.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"NADPH\\", \\"thymidine\\", \\"calcium\\", \\"PGE2\\", \\"Prostaglandin E\\", \\"prostaglandin E2\\", \\"prostaglandin E\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"NADPH Oxidase NOX5-S\\", \\"CGGGACACCC\\", \\"NOX5-S\\", \\"NF-u03baB1\\", \\"p50\\", \\"COX-2\\", \\"NADPH oxidase\\", \\"PGES\\", \\"mPGES1\\", \\"prostaglandin E synthase\\", \\"nuclear factor u03baB\\", \\"NOX5\\", \\"Microsomal PGES1\\", \\"Nuclear Factor u03baB1\\", \\"calcium-binding domains\\", \\"NF-u03baB\\", \\"Cycloxygenase-2\\", \\"Microsomal Prostaglandin E Synthase-1\\", \\"cytosolic PGES\\", \\"NF-u03baB binding elements\\", \\"GGAGTCTCCC\\", \\"cPGES\\", \\"mPGES2\\", \\"microsomal PGES1\\", \\"mPGES1 gene promoter\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB pathway has been shown to be a major regulator in cell survival. However, the mechanisms through which IKK mediates cell death are not clear. In this study, we showed that IKK-β contributed to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced cell death independent of the NF-κB pathway. Our results demonstrated that the pro-death function of IKK-β under oxidative stress was mediated by p85 S6K1 (S6 kinase 1), but not p70 S6K1 through a rapamycin-insensitive and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 kinase-independent mechanism. We found that IKK-β associated with p85, but not p70 S6K1, which was required for H(2)O(2)-induced activation of p85 S6K1. IKK-β and p85 S6K1 contributed to H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 (S166) and p53 accumulation. p85 S6K1 is critical for IKK-β-mediated cell death.

We show that Sal inhibits RNA synthesis in cells and that mutations that confer Sal-resistance map to RNAP genes. We show that Sal interacts with the RNAP active-center ‘bridge-helix cap’ comprising the ‘bridge-helix N-terminal hinge’, ‘F-loop’, and ‘link region’. We show that Sal inhibits nucleotide addition in transcription initiation and elongation. We present a crystal structure that defines interactions between Sal and RNAP and effects of Sal on RNAP conformation. We propose that Sal functions by binding to the RNAP bridge-helix cap and preventing conformational changes of the bridge-helix N-terminal hinge necessary for nucleotide addition. The results provide a target for antibacterial drug discovery and a reagent to probe conformation and function of the bridge-helix N-terminal hinge.Introduction:Salinamide A( Sal; SalA) and salinamide B( SalB) are structurally related bicyclic depsipeptide antibiotics, each consisting of seven amino acids and two non-amino-acid residues( Trischman et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1999; Figure 1A). SalA and SalB are produced by Streptomyces sp. CNB-091, a marine bacterium isolated from the surface of the jellyfish Cassiopeia xamachana( Trischman et al., 1994; Moore and Seng, 1998; Moore et al., 1999), and SalA also is produced by Streptomyces sp. NRRL 21611, a soil bacterium( Miao et al., 1997). SalA and SalB exhibit antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, particularly Enterobacter cloacae and Haemophilus influenzae, but do not exhibit cytotoxicity against mammalian cells( Trischman et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1999; Figure 1B). SalA and SalB inhibit both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial RNA polymerase( RNAP) in vitro, but do not inhibit human RNAP I, II, or III in vitro( Miao et al., 1997; Figure 1C). A total synthesis of SalA has been reported( Tan and Ma, 2008). 10. 7554/eLife. 02451. 003Figure 1. Sal.( A) Structures of SalA and SalB( Moore et al., 1999).( B) Growth-inhibitory activity of SalA and SalB.( C) RNAP-inhibitory activity of SalA and SalB. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02451. 003 Although previous work had established that Sal exhibits RNAP-inhibitory activity in a purified system in vitro and antibacterial activity in culture( Trischman et al., 1994; Miao et al., 1997; Moore et al., 1999), previous work had not established a causal relationship between the RNAP-inhibitory activity of Sal and the antibacterial activity of Sal( i. e., had not established that RNAP is the functional cellular target of Sal). In addition, previous work had not provided information regarding the binding site, mechanism, and structural basis of inhibition of RNAP by Sal. In this work, we show that RNAP is the functional cellular target of Sal, we show that Sal inhibits RNAP through a novel binding site and novel mechanism, we determine crystal structures that define RNAP–Sal interactions, and we set the stage for structure-based design and semi-synthesis of Sal analogs with improved properties.Discussion:The results in Figure 2 show that Sal inhibits RNAP in bacterial cells in culture, and that Sal-resistant mutations occur in RNAP subunit genes. The results establish that the RNAP is the functional cellular target of Sal, confirming the hypothesis that the RNAP-inhibitory activity of Sal is responsible for the antibacterial activity of Sal. The results in Figure 3 establish that transcription inhibition by Sal requires a determinant located within the RNAP active-center bridge-helix cap and comprising residues of the RNAP BH-HN, the RNAP F-loop, and the RNAP link region( ‘Sal target’). The results in Figure 4 establish that the Sal target is different from, and does not overlap, the targets of the previously characterized RNAP inhibitors Rif, Stl, CBR703, Myx, and Lpm. Consistent with the absence of overlap, mutants resistant to Sal are not cross-resistant with these other RNAP inhibitors, and, reciprocally, mutants resistant to these other RNAP inhibitors are not cross-resistant with Sal. Consistent with the absence of cross-resistance, co-administration of Sal and Rif, or of Sal and Myx, suppresses the emergence of spontaneous resistance, a finding that is significant since emergence of resistance limits the clinical application of Rif( Floss and Yu, 2005) and has been cited as a potential obstacle to the clinical development of Myx( Moy et al., 2011). The results in Figure 5 establish that Sal inhibits nucleotide addition in both transcription initiation and transcription elongation, interfering with one or more of the bond-formation, pyrophosphate-release, or translocation sub-reactions of the nucleotide-addition cycle. The results in Figure 5 show that the mechanism of inhibition by Sal is different from the mechanisms of inhibition by the previously characterized RNAP inhibitors Rif, Stl, Myx, and Lpm; and further results in Figure 4B suggest, although do not prove, that the mechanism of Sal also is different from the mechanism of the previously characterized RNAP inhibitor CBR703. The crystal structures of RNAP–Sal and RNAP–Sal–Br complexes in Figures 6–8 confirm that Sal binds within the RNAP bridge–helix cap, making interactions with residues of the BH-HN, the F-loop, and the link region. The structures establish that Sal does not contact, or clash with, the RNAP active-center catalytic Mg2+ ion or the RNAP residues that interact with the DNA template, the RNA product, or the NTP substrate, indicating that Sal interferes with nucleotide addition allosterically. The structures further reveal that Sal interacts with an open( unbent) state of the BH-HN( Figure 8A). We propose that Sal allosterically inhibits nucleotide addition by interacting with and stabilizing the open( unbent) state of the BH-HN. Sal is the first RNAP inhibitor that has been proposed to function through effects on conformational dynamics of the BH-HN. We suggest that Sal will find use as a research tool for dissection of mechanistic and structural aspects of BH-HN conformational dynamics. The semi-synthesis of Sal–Br from SalA( Figure 7A) shows that the SalA epoxide moiety provides a chemical reactivity that can be exploited for semi-synthesis of novel Sal analogs. The retention of RNAP inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity by Sal–Br( Figure 7B) shows that semi-synthetic modifications at the SalA epoxide moiety can be tolerated without loss of potency. The crystal structures of RNAP–Sal and RNAP–Sal–Br( Figures 6–8) show that the SalA epoxide moiety makes no or limited interactions with RNAP and is located at the entrance to the Sal-binding pocket, directed towards the RNAP secondary channel and RNAP active-center i+1 nucleotide binding site( Figure 8B, C; Figure 8—figure supplement 1). These findings, together with the published total synthesis of SalA( Tan and Ma, 2008), set the stage for rational, structure-based design of novel semi-synthetic and fully synthetic Sal analogs with increased potency. Introduction at the SalA epoxide moiety of a sidechain with negatively-charged functionality should enable new, energetically favorable, electrostatic interactions with positively-charged ‘basic-rim’ residues in the RNAP secondary channel. Introduction at the Sal epoxide moiety of a nucleotide or nucleoside analog, should enable new, energetically favorable, interactions with the RNAP active-center i+1 nucleotide binding site. Covalently linking Sal to a nucleotide or nucleoside analog is expected to yield a bipartite inhibitor that interacts simultaneously with the Sal binding pocket and the active-center i+1 nucleotide binding site, and therefore, that potentially exhibits a very high affinity of binding and a very high potency of inhibition. Reciprocally, equipping a nucleoside-analog RNAP inhibitor with chemical functionality able to interact with the Sal pocket should provide a means both to increase potency of the nucleoside-analog inhibitor and to introduce selectivity for inhibition of bacterial RNAP vs inhibition of human RNAP.","answer":"The need for new antibiotics is becoming increasingly critical , as more and more bacteria become resistant to existing drugs .

Understanding structural stability is one of the key factors for determining optimal nanoparticle design and applications. It is well known that high-pressure compression is a powerful method for characterizing the phase stability and transformation of materials, and prior high-pressure experiments on nanoparticles have revealed their unique pressure-dependent properties. For example, greater phase transition pressure has been observed for nanoparticles, relative to the bulk.12,13 Additionally, the phase transition pressure has been reported to shift with particle size for CdSe quantum dots14-16 and iron oxide nanoparticles.17 Besides crystal structural changes, high pressure has recently been applied as a controlled and effective means to alter nanomaterial morphologies at the mesoscale, leading to observations of new nanostructures that are difficult to obtain through solution synthesis methods.18-28</p><p>At ambient pressure, CdS can crystallize in either wurtzite (WZ) or zinc blende (ZB) structures. Bulk CdS undergoes phase transition from WZ to rocksalt (RS) at 2.6 GPa.29 Previous studies on pressure-tuned phase transition of CdS nanoparticles have revealed that both nanoparticle size30,31 and doping32,33 can affect the phase transition behaviors, but the effect of particle shape has not yet been systematically studied. In fact, how the shape of the particle influences the phase transition has been rarely scrutinized. Lee et al.34 theoretically predicted that the phase transition pressure of CdSe nanorods decreased with rod length. Park et al.35 studied the shape-dependent compressibility in rice-shaped and rod-shaped TiO2 nanoparticles. To more thoroughly understand the shape effects on high-pressure phase transition of nanoparticles, detailed experimental studies on different kinds of nanoparticles are still needed. Here a systematic high-pressure study of CdS particles possessing various particle shapes was carried out by using in situ synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and TEM.</p><p>CdS nanoparticles were synthesized in three distinct shapes as previously reported.36-38 All three types of CdS nanoparticles are monodisperse in size and uniform in shape (Figure 1). The average particle size and surface-to-volume ratio of different nanoparticles are summarized in Table 1. The average sizes were obtained by sampling at least 100 individual nanoparticles. It should be noted that the long CdSe/CdS core/shell nanorods are comparable with the other two samples in the current studies because the contribution of CdSe core to the overall pressure-induced behaviors can be neglected due to its relatively small volume ratio.39,40</p><p>These CdS nanoparticles were then drop casted onto Si wafers to form uniform films, and small pieces of the resulting films were scratched off and loaded into diamond anvil cells (DACs) for high-pressure experiments. The DAC was compressed quasi-hydrostatically up to 15 GPa using silicon oil as pressure-transmitting medium, and WAXS experiments were performed after each pressure point was reached and stabilized. The resulting X-ray scattering patterns of different samples at different pressures are compiled in Figure 2. At ambient pressure before compression, the WAXS patterns of all three CdS nanoparticles can be indexed according to the hexagonal WZ crystal structure (wurtzite CdS, JCPDS card number 75-1545). With increasing pressures, all WAXS peaks shifted to higher q values, corresponding to smaller d spacings resulting from shrinkage of the nanoparticle atomic lattice under applied pressures. Clear phase transitions, as indicated by appearances of new scattering peaks, were then observed at higher pressures. The onsets of such phase transitions occur at ca. 6.0 GPa for nanospheres, ca. 6.9 GPa for short nanorods, and 8.0 GPa for long nanorods. These observed new peaks correspond to the cubic RS crystal structure (cubic CdS, JCPDS card number 21-829) in all three cases, and RS structures were stable up to the highest pressure applied, i.e., 15 GPa. When the pressure was released back to ambient, some of the WZ peaks reappeared in both cases of the nanorod samples (Figure 2(b) and (c)), indicating a partially reversible phase transition process. On the other hand, the high-pressure RS phase is maintained at ambient pressure for the nanospheres (Figure 2(a)), representing an irreversible phase transition behavior. Compared with bulk materials, WZ-to-RS phase transitions have been found to take place at higher pressures for spherical nanoparticles, which is commonly explained by the increased surface energy with reducing particle size or increasing surface to volume ratio.12 In the cases of our present studies, the nanospheres, short nanorods, and long nanorods possess surface-to-volume ratios at ca. 1.1 nm−1, 0.7 nm−1, and 1.5 nm−1, respectively. It is thus expected that the long nanorods show the highest phase transition pressure due to its highest surface-to-volume ratio. However, the short nanorods, having lower surface-to-volume ratio than that of the nanospheres, display relatively higher phase transition pressure. Furthermore, the WZ-to-RS phase transition was found to be irreversible in nanospheres, while such transitions appear to be partially reversible in both nanorods with different aspect ratios. Our results suggest that, besides considering nanoparticle surface energies, the shape of nanoparticles also plays an important role in determining the pressure and reversibility of phase transitions. More precise determination and quantification of such shape-dependent phase transition effects will require more detailed and comprehensive studies on larger sets of nanoparticles with varying shapes, which is currently underway.</p><p>After the high-pressure experiments, residues from the DAC cells were dissolved in a small amount of toluene and drop cast onto TEM grids, and representative TEM images are shown in Figure 3. CdS nanospheres showed insignificant size changes after compression. Interestingly, some of the nanospheres were observed to sinter into continuous wires that have a width comparable to that of individual nanospheres (Figure 3a), and a high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Figure 3d) reveals that the crystal lattice belongs to the RS phase, consistent with the WAXS results. The connection between sintered nanospheres appears to be nonepitaxial since the lattice fringes do not match one another in adjacent spheres as observed in HR-TEM images (Figure S1, Supporting Information). As for the nanorods, the general shapes remain unchanged as seen in Figure 3b,c and Figure S2. However, the lengths of both nanorods have become shorter and less uniform. The average length of the short CdS nanorods decreases from ca. 20.1 ± 5.1 nm to ca. 16.3 ± 4.5 nm, while that of the core/shell long nanorods reduces from ca. 34.9 ± 5.6 nm to ca. 18.5 ± 5.2 nm. Since the widths of these nanorods remain unchanged, we suspect that the observed shortening of nanorods resulted from pressure-induced breakage, which is more severe in the case of the long nanorods. HR-TEM (Figure 3(d-f)) reveals the presence of both the RS (d111 = 0.31 nm) and WZ (d100 = 0.35 nm) crystal structures, consistent with the WAXS data, and confirms that the phase transitions of nanorods are partly reversible.</p><p>Evolution of the unit cell volumes as a function of pressure is shown in Figure 4. It can be seen that there is ca. 17% volume reduction from the WZ to the RS crystal structure, which is in good agreement with previous studies.41 The volume change versus pressure data were then fitted into the second-order Birch–Murnaghan equation of state to calculate the bulk moduli of different samples:42-44(1)P=(3∕2)B0[(V0∕V)7∕3−(V0∕V)5∕3]where B0 is the bulk modulus. V0 is the volume at zero applied pressure and can be calculated from the zero-pressure WAXS data. The as-calculated bulk moduli of different samples at both WZ and RS phases are summarized in Table 2.</p><p>Materials that show higher bulk modulus values are less compressible. The CdS bulk material was reported to have a bulk modulus of 54.0 GPa for the WZ phase and 68.0 GPa for the RS phase.45 The bulk moduli of all three samples in both WZ and RS phases are higher than that of the bulk CdS, which is in agreement with earlier studies.46,47 In addition, WZ particles are found to be more compressible than RS particles. Bulk moduli of nanoparticles in the WZ phase also show shape-dependent features, with nanorods being less compressible than spherical nanoparticles, while the RS phase behaves similarly for all shapes. A similar trend has been observed for ZnO nanowires and nanobelts.48,49 But opposite behavior was also observed for rice-shaped TiO2 nanoparticles.35 Therefore, there is still no agreement on how the shape of the particle affects the value of the bulk modulus, and more research on other types of particles is necessary to fully understand this phenomenon.</p><p>In summary, we have employed high-pressure synchrotron WAXS to investigate the effects of particle shape on the phase transition behaviors of nanoparticles by applying CdS nanoparticles with three different shapes: CdS nanospheres, short CdS nanorods, and long CdSe/CdS core/shell nanorods. The results show that the WZ to RS phase transition pressure and the process reversibility are both closely associated with the particles' sizes and shapes. Spherical nanoparticles were found to possess the lowest phase transition pressure and showed sintering phenomena after the high-pressure studies. Both nanorods showed higher phase transition pressures despite the fact that the short nanorods have smaller surface-to-volume ratio than that of the nanospheres. On the other hand, both nanorods display similar bulk moduli in both WZ and RS phases, but differ significantly in phase transition pressures. Furthermore, the WZ-to-RS phase changes were found to be irreversible in nanospheres but partially reversible in both nanorods. These observations clearly demonstrate that the shape plays an important role in phase changes of nanoparticles under pressure. Our study provides a rudimentary understanding of nanoparticle shape-dependent mechanical and phase properties, which will contribute to the design and development of novel functional nanomaterials.50-52</p>","answer":"Understanding structural stability and phase transformation of nanoparticles under high pressure is of great scientific interest, as it is one of the crucial factors for design, synthesis, and application of materials. Even though high-pressure research on nanomaterials has been widely conducted, their shape-dependent phase transition behavior still remains unclear. Examples of phase transitions of CdS nanoparticles are very limited, despite the fact that it is one of the most studied wide band gap semiconductors. Here we have employed in situ synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the high-pressure behaviors of CdS nanoparticles as a function of particle shapes. We observed that CdS nanoparticles transform from wurtzite to rocksalt phase at elevated pressure in comparison to their bulk counterpart. Phase transitions also vary with particle shape: rod-shaped particles show a partially reversible phase transition and the onset of the structural phase transition pressure decreases with decreasing surface-to-volume ratios, while spherical particles undergo irreversible phase transition with relatively low phase transition pressure. Additionally, TEM images of spherical particles exhibited sintering-induced morphology change after high-pressure compression. Calculations of the bulk modulus reveal that spheres are more compressible than rods in the wurtzite phase. These results indicate that the shape of the particle plays an important role in determining their high-pressure properties.

From these data, as well as earlier evidence demonstrating that the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) shuttle in these cells requires a transaminase step and is thus identified as the malate-aspartate shuttle (W.V.V. Greenhouse and A.L. Lehninger, Cancer Res., 36: 1392-1396, 1976), metabolic flux diagrams were constructed for the five cell lines. These diagrams show the relative rates of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport, and the malate-aspartate shuttle in these tumors. Large amounts of cytosolic NADH were oxidized by the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the NADH shuttle, comprising anywhere from about 20 to 80% of the total flow of reducing equivalents to oxygen in these tumors. Calculations of the sources of energy for adenosine triphosphate synthesis indicated that on the average about one-third of the respiratory adenosine triphosphate is generated by electron flow originating from cytosolic NADH via the malate-aspartate shuttle.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"tumor cells\\", \\"tumors\\", \\"mitochondrial\\", \\"cytosolic\\", \\"cells\\", \\"L1210 cells\\", \\"cell lines\\", \\"Ehrlich ascites tumor cells\\", \\"strains\\", \\"AS-30D carcinoma\\", \\"Krebs II carcinoma\\", \\"ascites tumor cells\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

The assessment tools were BPRS, CGI, and the Simpson-Angus scale for the extrapyramidal disturbances, and a free report on side effects. No differences between the groups were found in respect of efficacy. According to the Simpson-Angus scale, the patients who had been treated with zotepine achieved better values, this being a general trend. There were significant differences according to the free report on side effects. Especially at onset of treatment, the patients treated with zotepine complained of tiredness. Partly marked extrapyramidal disturbances were seen in the patients who had been treated with haloperidol.","answer":"The evidence base around zotepine is insufficient to provide firm conclusions on its absolute or relative effects.

effective alternative in light of the fact that an early , tailored intervention has been shown to prevent deaths and improve functional recovery .telemedicine is defined by the american telemedicine association as  the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications for health and education of the patient or healthcare provider and for the purpose of patient care  .telemonitoring enables transmission of data , pertaining to diagnostic investigations , to a remote site for medical consultation [ 8 , 1012 ] .there is considerable evidence that the utility of telemonitoring as a diagnostic tool is equivalent to that of traditional hospital examination [ 1317 ] .tele - ecg is a convenient tool to distinguish individuals with suspected heart diseases that may require urgent referral to a hospital or even emergency medical services .it utilizes m - health technology , which involves the use of mobile phones for data transmission , so as to provide health care services to remote areas .the aim of the study was to report the design and implementation strategy of handheld tele - ecg as well as its use in the periphery and impact of telemedicine in the delivery of health care services .four hundred and fifty individuals ( 10% dropout rate ) from different villages in the outskirts of chandigarh were enrolled for this study during the period from april 2011 to march 2013 ( table 1 ) . a complete history and physical examination were performed and written informed consent was obtained .the ethics committee of postgraduate institute of medical education and research approved this study ( pgi / iec/2011/725 - 26 ) .the individuals were included who ( patient / caretaker ) were agreed for the home visits by the monitoring team , suitable social circumstances for home care , appropriate degree of home support if living alone and reside in the project catchment area . the individuals were excluded if they had hemoptysis ( spitting up blood from the respiratory tract ) , pneumothorax ( free air or gas in the pleural cavity ) , history of recent heart attack , unstable angina , aneurysm ( cranial , thoracic , or abdominal ) , thrombotic condition ( such as clotting within a blood vessel ) , and recent thoracic or abdominal surgery and those who refused to give consent .the ecg is a noninvasive test that is used to reflect underlying heart conditions by measuring the electrical activity of the heart .a handheld tele - ecg instrument developed by barc , operated with the help of a mobile phone via bluetooth , was used for performing tele - ecg ( figure 1 ) .ecg leads were attached to the body while the patient lied flat on a bed .these leads were attached to each extremity ( four in total ) and to six predefined positions in front of the chest . a small amount of gel was applied to the skin , which allowed the electrical impulses of the heart to be more easily transmitted tothe leads were attached by electrodes or by small adhesive patches attached loosely to the skin .the handheld tele - ecg has a unique feature of recording ecg of the subject and displaying the same on the mobile screen .after complete recording , the ecg could be sent to an expert 's mobile through multimedia messaging service ( mms ) for his opinion .the handheld tele - ecg is a low cost , portable , and compact screening tool .it provides acquisition , processing , storing , and visualization of ecg in real time by using a secure gprs connection for transfer of ecg data .four hundred and fifty individuals with mean age in years ( 31.49  20.05 ) in the community setting were recruited for the study ( table 2 ) .this technology has been developed at the electronic division of barc and has been validated in a pilot project at pgimer , chandigarh , in 2009 . in the above - mentioned pilot study ,our aim , in the present study , was to validate the handheld tele - ecg in the community health setting as a screening tool for a plethora of cardiac conditions .we observed transmission rate from the tele - ecg to mobile phone was 100% , although the quality was graded to be either moderate or good ( figure 2 ) .moderate quality transmission due to noise or baseline artifacts was noted in twenty percent of individuals ( 90/450 ) while the rest showed good quality transmission ( 360/450 ) .an expert at the tertiary care centre , pgimer , read the transmitted electrocardiograms from the remote centres . the rate , rhythm , axis , intervals , p wave , qrs complex , st segment , and t wave changes , if any , were noted .a myriad of abnormalities were noted in the remaining 30% individuals ( figure 3 , table 3 ) . of these, the majority was left ventricular hypertrophy ( 9.3% ) followed by old myocardial infarction ( 5.3% ) .sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia were reported in a similar proportion of individuals ( 3.1% and 3.7% , resp . ) .ecg findings matched with the history of the patient except three individuals who showed acute myocardial infraction .interpretation of ecg did not reveal any individuals with abnormalities , namely , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes , or wolff - parkinson - white syndrome . individuals with abnormal results were referred to pgimer .outcomes were noted to be similar for both handheld tele - ecg and standard ecg which is outlining the reliability and accuracy of handheld tele - ecg .telemonitoring enhances the health care delivery in underserved communities by facilitating access to diagnostic tests as well as increasing communication between primary care practitioners and specialists in tertiary care centres [ 20 , 21 ] .tele - ecg is a convenient , sustainable , and reliable means of monitoring cardiac function .it ensures timely physician - patient contact in emergency situations while avoiding unnecessary hospital visits [ 2227 ] .hence , the field of emergency medicine can be revolutionized by scientific evaluation and implementation of telemedicine systems .the present study demonstrates the applicability of a remote care model that ensures improved availability of health care resources to populations residing in distant areas .the handheld tele - ecg is an indigenous design that shows immense potential in replacing conventional ecg , especially for screening purposes in the remote areas .this is in light of the fact that the pilot study showed 99% correlation between tele - ecg and conventional ecg .moreover , a previous studyreported 76% consistently normal ecgs , similar to 70% outlined in our study .our study had 80% good quality ecg and only 20% were of moderate quality that is comparable to existing literature , both of which had 77% good quality transmission [ 29 , 30 ] but lesser than alte et al . who reported 94% good ecgs .the transmission rate in our study is 100% , only reported in one other study that showed no technical difficulties or transmission failures .ecg transmission failure occurred in 14% individuals in the study by terkelsen et al .   whereas the time - ne study reported failure in 44% patients .tele - ecg can bring a revolution to screening large populations for a variety of cardiac conditions and can be potentially lifesaving. early detection of acute myocardial infarction by tele - ecg and transmission of information to the attending emergency physician can accelerate management of the patient [ 35 , 36 ] . patients with preexisting coronary artery disease and chronic heart failurecan be managed safely and effectively with concomitant telemedicine , as it shows potential to enhance quality of life and improve prognosis .these services have shown to meet the patient 's expectations as judged by high acceptance and patient satisfaction .this model can also be used for self - monitoring of individuals suffering from heart conditions residing in urban areas .furthermore , a home - based cardiac consultation for chronic heart disease patients might even be possible in the future . even though the above - mentioned model has several advantages ,physician acceptance is low due to the shift from in - house to telephonic consultations .a study linked ecg to a person only by two link tables , thus ensuring data privacy .there is a possibility of erroneous diagnosis as well as subjective differences in interpretation of tele - ecg by different medical readers .thus , it is preferable to obtain a computer - based analysis , for example , using the means algorithm for the 12-lead ecg [ 37 , 38 ] , but even that is associated with false negative results , requiring additional reading by medical personnel .thus , our study concludes that tele - ecg is an excellent model to curb morbidity and mortality resulting from cardiovascular diseases .epidemiologically , it can have a significant impact on the policy decisions of a nation [ 40 , 41 ] , as it has a vast untapped potential of improving the quality of health care in rural areas , increasing access to specialists in referral centres , reducing transportation of patients to doctors , supporting primary care physicians , and overcoming shortage of doctors , especially in remote areas .further use of this technology can be utilized to build similar devices , for epidemiological diseases of epic proportions , which can provide support and build infrastructure in areas where resources are scarce .transmission of the data gathered from such devices to referral centres for an expert opinion is an effective , economically viable , and technically feasible model of health care delivery in far - flung areas .a previous study compared the transmission of a 12-lead ecg which recorded and transmitted to a cardiac centre versus standard ecg recorded at the same time from the same patient .further enhancement of this prototype to develop autotransmission of data to predestined centres can initiate the process of activating health care professionals in tertiary centres to screen high risk population and guide further management plan .these systems can pave the way for a new era of medicine where health care delivery to each and every individual , even in remote areas , is a realistic possibility .","answer":"telemonitoring is a medical practice that involves remotely monitoring patients who are not at the same location as the health care provider .  the purpose of our study was to use handheld tele - electrocardiogram ( ecg ) developed by bhabha atomic research center ( barc ) to identify heart conditions in the rural underserved population where the doctor - patient ratio is low and access to health care is difficult .  the objective of our study was clinical validation of handheld tele -

They are also a much safer option than traditional attenuated vaccines in children and immunecompromised people. As this review discusses the effects of pre-existing immune responses to attenuated vaccines, further discussion of LAB and E. coli as potential vectors will not be undertaken; however, the reader is directed to several interesting reviews (Bermú dez-Humarán et al., 2011; Wells & Mercenier, 2008) . Intracellular bacteria from the genera Mycobacterium (Guleria et al., 1996) , Listeria (Gentschev et al., 2001) , Shigella (Levine et al., 1997) and Salmonella (Dougan et al., 1987) are considered to be suitable candidates for the delivery of vaccine antigens due to their capability to induce robust T cell immune responses (Alderton et al., 1991; Lo et al., 1999; Mastroeni et al., 2001; Mittrücker & Kaufmann, 2000; Nauciel, 1990) . Salmonella is one genus that has been well examined as a vector, building on the extensive research available on the micro-organism's physiology and pathogenesis (Basso et al., 2000; Killeen & DiRita, 2000; Sirard et al., 1999; Ward et al., 1999) . There exist several commercial vaccines that are used as anti-Salmonella vaccines in humans and animals (e.g. Ty21a for typhoid fever in humans, several Salmonella serovars against salmonellosis in chickens and other animals ). The general strategy for vectoring heterologous antigen is depicted in Fig. 1 . The first clinical trial of a recombinant, which was conducted over 20 years ago using an attenuated Salmonella as a delivery vector, led to the widespread testing of this bacterium as a mucosal delivery system for antigens from non-Salmonella pathogens (Dougan et al., 1987) . These studies have demonstrated the utility of live bacteria to deliver expressed antigens and DNA vaccines to the host immune system (Atkins et al., 2006; Husseiny & Hensel, 2008; Jiang et al., 2004; Kirby et al., 2004) . Since then several other intracellular bacterial vectors have been successfully tested for their capability to deliver a variety of antigens from various pathogens, as well as vaccination against cancer. One genus which has been widely tested as vector is Listeria. Listeria species are Gram-positive intracellular food-borne pathogens. The advantages of Listeria are that it can invade a variety of cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs). After invading the host cell, Listeria resides inside the phagosome; however, it can escape the phagosome with the help of listeriolysin O (LLO; Hly) and reside in the cytoplasm of the cells, thereby efficiently presenting antigen to both CD8 and CD4 T cells (Cossart & Mengaud, 1989; Kaufmann, 1993; Pamer et al., 1997) . Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and ease of using Listeria monocytogenes to deliver heterologous vaccine antigens and DNA vaccines Jensen et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2011; Peters et al., 2003; Shen et al., 1995; Yin et al., 2011) . Similarly, various viral vectors have been successfully tested for their capability to deliver heterologous vaccine antigens, and this generally results in the induction of strong CTL immune responses. In the veterinary field, there are numerous viral vector vaccines that are currently licensed for use in livestock and domesticated animals. These recombinant vaccines are based on both DNA viruses (such as fowlpox virus-based vaccines which target avian influenza virus and fowlpox virus, or vaccinia virusbased vectors against the rabies virus in wildlife) and RNA viruses [such as Newcastle disease virus-based vaccines to be used in poultry or yellow fever virus (YFV)-based vaccines to be used in horses against West Nile virus] (Draper & Heeney, 2010) . Based on the safety record in the veterinary field, many viruses have been studied for human use as a vector in vaccine development (Beukema et al., 2006; Esteban, 2009; Schirrmacher & Fournier, 2009; Stoyanov et al., 2010; Weli & Tryland, 2011) . Amongst them, YFV (YF-17D strain) was the first to be licensed for use in humans, where the cDNAs encoding the envelope proteins of YFV were replaced with the corresponding genes of an attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus strain, SA14-14-2 (Appaiahgari & Vrati, 2010; Rollier et al., 2011) . Poxviruses are also studied extensively as candidate vectors for human use, among which attenuated derivatives of vaccinia virus [such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and New York attenuated vaccinia virus NYVAC strains] are the most promising vectors (Esteban, 2009; Gó mez et al., 2008; Rimmelzwaan & Sutter, 2009 ). They are ideal candidate vectors due to their large DNA-packing capacity and their thermal and genetic stability (Minke et al., 2004) . The NYVAC vector has been shown to induce CD4 + T cell-dominant responses, and MVA induces both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses (Mooij et al., 2008) . The adenovirus (Ad) vector is another of the most widely evaluated vectors to date to express heterologous antigens, due to ease of production, safety profile, genetic stability, the ease of DNA genome manipulation, and the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both T and B cell responses (Alexander et al., 2012; Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Gabitzsch & Jones, 2011; Lasaro & Ertl, 2009; Vemula & Mittal, 2010; Weyer et al., 2009) . They have been extensively examined as a delivery vector in several preclinical and clinical studies for infectious diseases such as anthrax, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza, measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), malaria and tuberculosis M. Saxena and others (Chengalvala et al., 1994; Gao et al., 2006; Hashimoto et al., 2005; Hsu et al., 1992; Limbach & Richie, 2009; Radosevic et al., 2007; Shiver et al., 2002) . However, before vectored vaccines can be used in the human population they need to satisfy several important criteria. Safety is a major concern, as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable (of course the minor discomfort that accompanies many vaccinations is normal). Secondly, a vaccine should be inexpensive, so that it can be administered to a large population at minimal cost, and this is particularly important in resource-poor countries (Killeen & DiRita, 2000) . Similar constraints apply to veterinary vaccines, with cost often an even more important consideration. Finally, long-lasting cellular and (where appropriate) humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines, preferably with a single dose (Atkins et al., 2006) . As some of the vectors in use will have been seen by the host immune system prior to vaccination, whether the presence of pre-existing immune responses is detrimental for the further development of a vector-based vaccine scheme, or can augment responses to the vectored antigen, needs to be considered in detail. This is the subject of this review. In discussing the possible effects on pre-existing immunity, the natural immunity to the vector needs to be considered. Therefore, considering a vector such as Salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the Salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response). This will theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared. Surprisingly, as will be seen in some of the examples given below, this can have results that differ depending on the magnitude of the response to the vectored antigen. Similarly, for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen. Again, this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen. In the case of bacterial vectors, the effect of pre-existing immune responses has only been tested using Salmonella serovars and Listeria spp. Concern that prior immunological experience of the host with either the homologous Salmonella vector strain or a related strain might compromise its ability to deliver heterologous vaccine antigen was first raised in 1987 (Dougan et al., 1987) . Bao and Clements subsequently reported experimental evidence of the consequences of prior exposure of animals to the vector strain (Bao & Clements, 1991) . This work showed that both serum and mucosal antibody responses against the foreign antigen were in fact upregulated in animals with prior exposure to the vector strain. Whittle & Verma (1997) reported similar findings. Mice immunized via the intra-peritoneal route with a Salmonella dublin aroA mutant expressing heterologous antigen after being exposed to the same vector showed a higher immune response to the vectored antigen in comparison to mice without any immunological memory against the vector. Subsequently, several studies have been conducted to examine the effect of pre-existing immunity in the host against Salmonella. These results are summarized in Table 1 . The various reports are contradictory in their findings and seem to paint a rather confusing picture. Some studies concluded that pre-existing immunity against the Salmonella vector leads to stronger immune responses against the delivered antigen (Bao & Clements, 1991; Jespersgaard et al., 2001; Kohler et al., 2000a, b; Metzger et al., 2004; Saxena et al., 2009; Sevil Domènech et al., 2008; Whittle & Verma, 1997) , with others considering pre-existing immunity to be a limiting factor in the long-term use of Salmonella as an efficient vector for antigen delivery (Attridge et al., 1997; Gahan et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 1999; Sevil Domènech et al., 2007; Vindurampulle & Attridge, 2003a, b) . A slight majority of the studies listed in Table 1 (10 versus eight) indicate the upregulation of immune responses after animals have been exposed to either homologous or related strains before the delivery of heterologous antigen using a Salmonella vector. A study by Metzger and co-workers on human volunteers using Salmonella Typhi as a vector suggested that there was no change in the T cell immune response against the heterologous antigen in human volunteers who were exposed to empty vector in comparison with volunteers who were immunologically naive of the vector strain (Metzger et al., 2004) . In these subjects, humoral responses were moderately elevated in preexposed individuals. Similarly, Saxena et al. (2009) indicated higher humoral and T cell responses in mice pre-exposed to homologous or heterologous Salmonella strains. The interleukin 4 (IL4) response was significantly higher when the animal host was exposed to the homologous strain, whereas pre-exposure to a related species did not have such an impact on IL4 responses. Conversely interferon (IFN)-c responses were higher, irrespective of the strain to which mice were pre-exposed. This study also indicated that the presence of homologous or heterologous opsonizing antibodies leads to a higher uptake of Salmonella by macrophages in vitro, which may explain the higher immune responses in exposed mice. As may be expected, uptake was higher when homologous sera were used as the opsonin rather than heterologous sera. This is depicted in Fig. 2 . Conversely, there are reports that indicate that pre-existing immunity against the bacterial vector downregulates immune responses against the delivered heterologous antigen using similar or related vectors. Attridge and coworkers reported that the presence of immunity against the bacterial vector prior to the delivery of vectored antigenic Microbiology 159 protein can downregulate immune responses in mice against the delivered antigen (Attridge et al., 1997) . Similar results were reported by Roberts et al. (1999) and Vindurampulle & Attridge (2003a, b) . However, the latter authors found that the hypo-responsiveness could be largely eliminated by exposing animals to the foreign antigen prior to vectorpriming (Vindurampulle & Attridge, 2003b) . Unfortunately, this would appear to be impractical for an immunization regimen! A study presented by Gahan et al. (2008) immunized mice with S. Typhimurium expressing C fragment of tetanus toxin antigen from an expression plasmid or as a DNA vaccine. Vaccinated mice developed humoral responses to LPS and tetC (for the plasmid-bearing vaccines). Animals from all groups (including a previously unvaccinated group) were immunized on day 182 with Salmonella expressing tetC. At this time, the anti-LPS and tetC titres were beginning to wane. Fourteen days after the second immunization, the colonization of various mouse organs was assessed. The ability to colonize was found to be significantly reduced in groups that had been previously vaccinated with Salmonella. In view of this finding, it was perhaps not surprising that at day 210 the LPS titres were not significantly different between groups receiving one or two vaccinations.Question: What are examples of delivery vectors for commercial anti-Salmonella vaccines?","answer":"Ty21a for typhoid fever in humans, several Salmonella serovars against salmonellosis in chickens and other animals"},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

METHODS Participants ( n = 120 ) were r and omized to a promotion , prevention , or an attention-control text message group  after completion of a weight loss program .  Participants completed baseline assessment s , and reported their weight at 1 and 3 months postbaseline . RESULTS Participants found the message content and intervention acceptable and valuable . A minimum of one message per day delivered at approximately 8:00 am was deemed the optimal delivery time and frequency . The sustained weight loss rate at month 3 for the control , promotion , and prevention groups was 90 % , 95 % , and 100 % , respectively . Medium-to-large effects were observed for the promotion and prevention groups at month 1 and for prevention at month 3 relative to controls . The mean weight loss for promotion and prevention was 15 pounds , compared with 10 in the controls at month 3 . CONCLUSION A clinical ly significant decrease in mean weight , higher rate of sustained weight loss , and medium-to-large effects on sustained weight loss occurred in the promotion and prevention interventions .

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:We study the precise mechanisms which allow autoencoders to encode and decode a simple geometric shape, the disk.In this carefully controlled setting, we are able to describe the specific form of the optimal solution to the minimisation problem of the training step.We show that the autoencoder indeed approximates this solution during training.Secondly, we identify a clear failure in the generalisation capacity of the autoencoder, namely its inability to interpolate data.Finally, we explore several regularisation schemes to resolve the generalisation problem.Given the great attention that has been recently given to the generative capacity of neural networks, we believe that studying in depth simple geometric cases sheds some light on the generation process and can provide a minimal requirement experimental setup for more complex architectures. Autoencoders are neural networks, often convolutional neural networks, whose purpose is twofold.Firstly, to compress some input data by transforming it from the input domain to another space, known as the latent, or code, space.The second goal of the autoencoder is to take this latent representation and transform it back to the original space, such that the output is similar, with respect to some criterion, to the input.One of the main objectives of this learning process being to reveal important structure in the data via the latent space, and therefore to represent this data in a more meaningful fashion or one that is easier to model.Autoencoders have been proven to be extremely useful in many tasks ranging from image compression to synthesis.Many variants on the basic idea of autoencoders have been proposed, the common theme being how to impose useful properties on the learned latent space.However, very little is known about the actual inner workings and mechanisms of the autoencoder.The goal of this work is to investigate these mechanisms and describe how the autoencoder functions.Many applications of autoencoders or similar networks consider relatively high-level input objects, ranging from the MNIST handwritten digits to abstract sketches of conceptual objects BID18 ; BID7 ).Here, we take a radically different approach.We consider, in depth, the encoding/decoding processes of a simple geometric shape, the disk, and investigate how the autoencoder functions in this case.There are several important advantages to such an approach.Firstly, since the class of objects we consider has an explicit parametrisation, it is possible to describe the \\"optimal\\" performance of the autoencoder, ie.can it compress and uncompress a disk to and from a code space of dimensionality 1 ?Secondly, the setting of this study fixes certain architecture characteristics of the network, such as the number of layers, leaving fewer free parameters to tune.This means that the conclusions which we obtain are more likely to be robust than in the case of more high-level applications.Finally, it is easier to identify the roles of different components of the network, which enables us to carry out an instructive ablation study.Using this approach, we show that the autoencoder approximates the theoretical solution of the training problem when no biases are involved in the network.Secondly, we identify certain limitations in the generalisation capacity of autoencoders when the training database is incomplete with respect to the underlying manifold.We observe the same limitation using the architecture of BID18 , which is considerably more complex and is proposed to encode natural images.Finally, we analyse several regularisation schemes and identify one in particular which greatly aids in overcoming this generalisation problem.We have investigated in detail the specific mechanisms which allow autoencoders to encode image information in an optimal manner in the specific case of disks.We have shown that, in this case, the encoder functions by integrating over disk, and so the code z represents the area of the disk.In the case where the autoencoder is trained with no bias, the decoder learns a single function which is multiplied by scalar depending on the input.We have shown that this function corresponds to the optimal function.The bias is then used to induce a thresholding process applied to ensure the disk is correctly decoded.We have also illustrated certain limitations of the autoencoder with respect to generalisation when datapoints are missing in the training set.This is especially problematic for higher-level applications, whose data have higher intrinsic dimensionality and therefore are more likely to include such \\"holes\\".Finally, we identify a regularisation approach which is able to overcome this problem particularly well.This regularisation is asymmetrical as it consists of regularizing the encoder while leaving more freedom to the decoder.An important future goal is to extend the theoretical analyses obtained to increasingly complex visual objects, in order to understand whether the same mechanisms remain in place.We have experimented with other simple geometric objects such as squares and ellipses, with similar results in an optimal code size.Another question is how the decoder functions with the biases included.This requires a careful study of the different non-linearity activations as the radius increases.Finally, the ultimate goal of these studies is to determine the capacity of autoencoders to encode and generate images representing more complex objects or scenes.As we have seen, the proposed framework can help identifying some limitations of complex networks such as the one from BID18 and future works should investigate whether this framework can help developing the right regularization scheme or architecture.Value of < f, 1 Br >, plotted against z Figure 7 : Verification of the hypothesis that y(t, r) = h(r)f (t) for decoding in the case where the autoencoder contains no bias..We have determined the average profile of the output of the autoencoder when no biases are involved. On the left, we have divided several random experimental profiles y by the function h, and plotted the result, which is close to constant (spatially) for a fixed radius of the input disk. On the right, we plot z against the theoretically optimal value of h (C f, 1 Br , where C is some constant accounting for the arbitrary normalization of f ). This experimental sanity check confirms our theoretical derivations.","answer":"We study the functioning of autoencoders in a simple setting and advise new strategies for their regularisation in order to obtain bettre generalisation with latent interpolation in mind for image sythesis."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: Since 2012, MERS-CoV has caused 2494 reported cases and 858 deaths (case-fatality rate, 34%) in 27 countries. MERS-CoV has also caused some rapid outbreaks, mainly in hospitals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and South Korea, but estimates of MERS-CoV R0 are less than 1, and thus far it has been contained.5Can a respiratory virus that is both transmissible and severe be contained? In preparation for an influenza pandemic, the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Pandemic Influenza Plan included a combination of nonpharmaceutical (border and school closing, infection control measures) and pharmaceutical (antiviral prophylaxis, vaccines) interventions meant to be used in combination to interrupt or slow influenza transmission. Despite implementation of some of these interventions, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 spread to 120 countries in 3 months. With the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Middle East, a preparedness plan was developed that included a surveillance plan, laboratory testing, and contact tracing guidance. Infection control guidance was developed for use in health care settings and traveler guidance was developed for the public.6 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction test kits to state health departments. Two cases were imported into the United States. Contacts were traced, including household, hospital, and airline contacts. No secondary cases were identified in the United States. MERS-CoV was thought to be severe and control measures relied on recognition of suspect cases. However, during a hospital outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, among hospitalized patients only 5 of 53 (9%) health care–associated cases had documented presence in the same room as a patient with MERS.5 Despite the high case-fatality rate (an important measure of severity), MERS cases can be asymptomatic and mild (25% in one outbreak). Although it is not known how often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients transmit MERS, initiating comprehensive measures such as isolating patients suspected of having or having been exposed to the virus and using personal protective equipment when caring for them may be extremely difficult because so many patients have mild and nonspecific symptoms. Is the world ready for a respiratory virus with high transmissibility and severity? After a new influenza virus (H7N9) was identified in China in 2013, a series of modeling articles described the effect of, and level of preparedness for, a severe, single-wave pandemic in the United States.7 In scenarios that used clinical attack rates (the proportion of individuals who become ill with or die from a disease in a population initially uninfected) of 20%  to 30% (for comparison the clinical attack rate was   in the first year of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic), depending on severity there would be an estimated 669 000 to 4.3 million hospitalizations and an estimated 54 000 to 538 000 deaths without any interventions in the United States. The models suggested that without a vaccine, school closures would be unlikely to affect the pandemic, an estimated 35 000 to 60 000 ventilators would be needed, up to an estimated 7.3 billion surgical masks or respirators would be required, and perhaps most important, if vaccine development did not start before the virus was introduced, it was unlikely that a significant number of hospitalizations and deaths could be averted due to the time it takes to develop, test, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine. It is impossible to know what will happen so early in this novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The scope, morbidity, and mortality will depend on the combination of severity and transmissibility. Numerous experts have “nowcasted” how many cases have occurred and forecasted how many cases will likely occur. A recent study suggests rapid person to person transmission can occur.8 Disease modelers have estimated R0 to be 2.2.9 The University of Hong Kong estimates the outbreak could infect more than 150 000 persons per day in China at its peak. Is 2019-nCoV infection severe? To date approximately 14% of cases of 2019-nCoV have been described as severe by WHO, with a case-fatality rate of 2.1%.10 Estimates of severity are usually higher in the beginning of an epidemic due to the identification of the most severely affected cases and decline as the epidemic progresses. However, because many infected persons have not yet recovered and may still die, the case-fatality rate and severity could be underestimated. On January 30, 2020, WHO officially declared the 2019-nCoV epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, indicating its concern that countries aside from China could be affected by 2019-nCoV. In preparing for possible sustained transmission of 2019-nCoV beyond China, applicable lessons from previous experiences with epidemics/pandemics of respiratory viruses should be carefully considered to better control and mitigate potential consequences. Influenza preparedness plans have been developed that aim to stop, slow, or limit the spread of an influenza pandemic to the United States. These plans address limiting domestic spread and mitigating disease but also sustaining infrastructure and reducing the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy and society. These plans would be useful to enact during the 2019-nCoV epidemic should the United States experience sustained transmission. Countries have been successful in the past and there is nothing yet to predict that this time it is likely to be worse. Effective prevention and control will not be easy if there is sustained transmission and will require the full attention of public health, federal and local governments, the private sector, and every citizen.

Comment2 Comments for this articleEXPAND ALLFebruary 12, 2020Understanding R and Disease ControlOz Mansoor | Public Health Physician, WellingtonThe message, that we need to prepare for a pandemic is vital. But the article misreports some key ideas. Firstly, SARS was not controlled \\"because a high proportion of cases were severe.\\" While that helped , it was because cases were not infectious before some days after symptom onset (usually in the second week of illness). This gave more time for case identification and isolation. And most cases did not pass on infection to anybody, but a few spread to many. When all such individuals were identified and isolated, spread stopped. Unfortunately, the new virusappears to be spreading from people much earlier in the course of illness, and even with mild symptoms - which was never documented for SARS. However, it is not clear that it is any different or better at spread between people, and perhaps with the same pattern of most cases not causing further spread. Secondly, the R0, the basic reproduction number, is correctly described as the average number of infections each case causes. But it lacks two key ideas: 1) the 0 after the R implies the native state, which is a fully susceptible population and without any control measures. R is the effectiive number and can include the impact of control measures. To claim that it was the lack of transmissibility, rather than the control measures that ended SARS, is not based on any evidence. And it ignores the heroic efforts of affected countries. Elimination of SARS demonstrated the potential of globally coordinated collective action, as well as the damage caused by ignorance and prejudice. Most seem to have already forgotten the lessons of SARS.CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Worked for WHO/WPRO in SARS responseREAD MOREFebruary 24, 2020COVID 19: a global presence and not only a new pathogen? Giuliano Ramadori, Professor of Medicine | University Clinic, Göttingen, GermanyIn the winter season there comes the time of upper and lower respiratory tract infections characterised by cough, dyspnea and eventually fever (influenza-like illness).Some of the patients, especially older people living alone affected by the disease ,may need hospitalization and eventually intensive care. In many of the cases who are hospitalized nasal and/or tracheal fluid are examined for viral or bacterial agents. Only in less than 50% of the cases influenza viruses are considered to be the cause of the disease.In the rest of the cases diagnostic procedure for human coronaviruses is not performed routinely. One of the fourdifferent Human Coronaviruses (HuCoV: 229E,NL 63,0C43 and HKU1) can however be found in up to 30% ofpatients negative for influenza viruses (1). Chinese scientists in Wuhan, who had to deal with an increasing number of acute respiratory tract diseases resembling viral pneumonia, performed deep sequencing analysis from samples taken from the lower respiratory tract and found a \\"novel\\" coronavirus. The sequence of the complete genome was made public. At the same time, however, the notice from Wuhan brought to mind the SARS- and MERS-epidemics. The measures taken by the Chinese- and WHO-authorities are now well known. Recently about 150 new cases have been identified in northern Italy and health authorities are still looking for case 0 (the source). Is it possible that COVID-19 was already existent in Italy -- and not only in Italy but possibly everywhere in the world -- and that newly available nucleotide sequence allows now to find the cause of previously undefined influenza-like illness?

Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes.Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.","answer":"no"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

The population of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis  are not only subject to the traditional risk factors for heart disease , but also to certain uremia-associated risk factors that are unique in this population . In the dialysis population , data regarding the effectiveness of routine pharmacologic and procedural interventions on cardiovascular outcomes are limited . Most dialysis patients are excluded from clinical trials , and so data from r and omized controlled trials investigating outcomes in patients undergoing  peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis are almost absent . In this review , we discuss some of the major cardiovascular problems in the dialysis population , the impact of those problems on survival , and when data are available , the impact of therapeutic strategiesTitle 2:The impact of quotidian hemodialysis on nutrition.Abstract 2:BACKGROUND Malnutrition is a common problem in hemodialysis ( HD ) patients and one of the most important factors influencing morbidity and mortality . More frequent HD has been shown to improve nutritional status in HD patients . METHODS The London Daily/Nocturnal Hemodialysis Study compared the nutritional status of patients receiving quotidian HD , either short daily HD ( n = 11 ) or long nocturnal HD ( n = 12 ) , with that of 22 matched control patients receiving conventional thrice-weekly HD .  A number of biochemical parameters indicative of nutritional status were measured , including protein equivalent of total nitrogen appearance ( nPNA ) , serum albumin , serum prealbumin , dietary calcium , serum lipids , and water-soluble vitamin levels . RESULTS nPNA tended to increase throughout the study for both quotidian HD groups and remained unchanged in the control group , which had the lowest values ( 1 to 1.1 g/kg/d ) . Daily HD patients showed a significant increase in mean serum albumin levels at 3 , 12 , and 18 months . The nocturnal HD group showed a significant decrease in albumin levels at month 9 , and control patients maintained relatively stable albumin levels throughout the study . Serum prealbumin levels averaged 0.04 g/dL for daily HD patients , whereas serum prealbumin levels decreased in nocturnal HD patients during the study period . Half the nocturnal HD patients had vitamin C levels lower than the reference range . Body composition data showed increased arm muscle area and maintenance of 100 % to 110 % of relative body weight ( RBW ) after several months of daily HD , whereas patients on nocturnal HD therapy showed a significant decline in RBW . There were no significant differences in lean body mass , percentage of body fat , or body mass index among the 3 study groups . CONCLUSION Increased nPNA , serum albumin levels , and arm muscle area suggest that daily HD patients experienced improved nutritional statusTitle 3:Survival analysis of patients on maintenance hemodialysisAbstract 3:Despite the continuous improvement of dialysis technology and pharmacological treatment , mortality rates for dialysis patients are still high . A 2-year prospect i ve study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital to determine the factors influencing survival among patients on maintenance hemodialysis . 96 patients with end-stage renal disease surviving more than 3 months on hemodialysis ( 8 - 12 h/week ) were studied . Follow-up was censored at the time of death or at the end of 2-year study period , whichever occurred first . Of the 96 patients studied ( mean age 49.74 ± 14.55 years , 75 % male and 44.7 % diabetics ) , 19 died with an estimated mortality rate of 19.8 % . On an age-adjusted multivariate analysis , female gender and hypokalemia independently predicted mortality . In Cox analyses , patient survival was associated with delivered dialysis dose ( single pool Kt/V , hazard ratio [ HR ] = 0.01 , P = 0.016 ) , frequency of hemodialysis ( HR = 3.81 , P = 0.05 ) and serum albumin ( HR = 0.24 , P = 0.005 ) . There was no significant difference between diabetes and non-diabetes in relation to death ( Relative Risk = 1.109 ; 95 % CI = 0.49 - 2.48 , P = 0.803 ) . This study revealed that mortality  among hemodialysis patients remained high , mostly due to sepsis and ischemic heart disease . Patient survival was better with higher dialysis dose , increased frequency of dialysis and adequate serum albumin level . Efforts at minimizing infectious complications , preventing cardiovascular events and improving nutrition should increase survival among hemodialysis patientsTitle 4:An operating cost comparison between conventional and home quotidian hemodialysis.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND Although several studies have shown that simulated annual direct health care costs are substantially lower for patients undergoing more frequent hemodialysis ( HD ) , there is limited information about the economics of daily HD and nocturnal HD . METHODS The London Daily/Nocturnal Hemodialysis Study compared the economics of  short daily HD ( n = 10 ) , long nocturnal HD ( n = 12 ) , and conventional thrice-weekly HD ( n = 22 ) in patients over 18 months . A retrospective analysis of patients '  conventional HD  costs during the 12 months before study entry was conducted to measure the change in cost after switching to quotidian HD . RESULTS As the data show , annual costs ( in Canadian dollars ) for daily HD are substantially lower than for both nocturnal HD and conventional HD : approximately 67,300 Can dollars , 74,400 Can dollars , and 72,700 Can dollars per patient , respectively . Moreover , marginal changes in operating cost per patient year were - 9,800 Can dollars , -17,400 Can dollars , and + 3,100 Can dollars for the daily HD , nocturnal HD , and conventional HD groups . Because of the increase in number of treatments , treatment supply costs per patient for the daily HD and nocturnal HD study groups were approximately twice those for conventional HD patients . However , average costs for consults , hospitalization days , emergency room visits , and laboratory tests for quotidian HD patients tended to decline after study entry . The major cost saving in home quotidian HD derived from the reduction in direct nursing time , excluding patient training . Total annualized cost per quality -adjusted life-year for the daily HD and nocturnal HD groups were 85,442 Can dollars and 120,903 Can dollars , which represented a marginal change of - 15,090 Can dollars and - 21,651 Can dollars , respectively , reflecting both improved quality of life and reduced costs for quotidian HD patients . CONCLUSION Substantial clinical benefits of home quotidian HD , combined with the economic advantage shown by this study , clearly justify its expansionTitle 5:Volume control and blood pressure management in patients undergoing quotidian hemodialysis.Abstract 5:BACKGROUND Hypertension and interdialytic weight gain are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) , an important predictor of cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis ( HD ) patients . METHODS In the London Daily/Nocturnal Hemodialysis Study , a group of patients receiving quotidian HD , either short daily ( n = 11 ) or long nocturnal ( n = 12 ) , were followed for up to 18 months . Patients were assessed for effects of quotidian HD therapy on blood pressure , interdialytic weight gain , extracellular fluid volume ( ECFV ) , intensity of antihypertensive therapy , and homocysteine levels . RESULTS Significant reductions in predialysis mean arterial blood pressure were observed in the daily HD group at 6 months ( P < 0.04 ) and in the nocturnal HD group at 9 months ( P < 0.03 ) ; these improvements persisted throughout the study period . The daily HD group had a 60 % reduction in mean number of antihypertensive tablets per day at 1 month and an 8.8-fold reduction by 18 months . Nocturnal HD patients experienced a 3.3-fold reduction , and control patients , a 1.4-fold increase in mean number of tablets per day by 18 months . By 3 months , the daily HD group showed a significant decrease in interdialytic weight gain ( P < 0.0005 ) and lower ECFV than controls ( P < 0.05 ) . The nocturnal HD group had a transient , but significant , increase in interdialytic weight gain at 6 and 15 months ( P < 0.05 ) and no difference in ECFV compared with controls , suggesting a different mechanism of blood pressure control . Homocysteine levels were significantly lower for both quotidian HD groups compared with conventional HD patients . CONCLUSION Quotidian HD is a promising therapy with potent antihypertensive effects , result ing in improved blood pressure control . This , together with improved homocysteine levels , may be beneficial in the long term with regard to cardiovascular mortalityTitle 6:End Stage Renal Disease and MedicareAbstract 6:Since 1972 all persons with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) eligible for Social Security are entitled to all Medicare benefits , regardless of age . ESRD patients need continual renal replacement therapy to survive . Although only 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries suffer from ESRD , they account for roughly 9 percent of all Medicare payments . ESRD patients tend to be economically disadvantaged and belong to ethnic and racial minorities . CMS has developed many programs and regulations specifically for ESRD patients design ed to improve care , pay providers fairly , and minimize government expenditures . Currently , most ESRD patients are covered through a mix of mechanisms within the traditional fee-for-service ( FFS ) payment system , including : The composite rate covers services generally part of a single in-center hemodialysis treatment . The monthly capitation payment , which reimburses the physician , such as a nephrologist , who prescribes and monitors the patient 's dialysis . The payment amount for erythropoietin ( EPO ) to treat anemia is set by Congress at an allowed charge of  10 per thous and units . The first two methods act as prospect i ve payment systems ( PPSs ) for the services covered by the payments . Hospitalizations for ESRD patients are paid through the same PPS as all Medicare patients . Dialysis , hospitalizations , and physicians ' dialysis services comprise over 80 percent of Medicare expenditures for the care of dialysis patients . The traditional FFS system for dialysis patients is , in effect , a system of partial capitation . Medicare is the primary insurer for dialysis patients . Providers , patients , and nonprofit organizations take an active interest in any changes or potential changes to CMS payment or coverage policies . Other insurers and State Medicaid Programs often base their own procedures on those developed by CMS . Research into the efficient care of dialysis and transplant patients is of great interest to Medicare policymakers . Therefore , many people in and out of the government follow and contribute to research issues related to ESRD policy . This issue of the Review contains seven articles reporting findings from policy-relevant research . The first four articles derive from the independent evaluation of the ESRD managed care demonstration conducted by a team from The Lewin Group and the University Renal Research and Education Association . These articles are a subset of the topics covered in the joint final evaluation report ( The Lewin Group and the University Renal Research and Education Association , 2002 ) and the Secretary 's Report to Congress ( Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , 2002 ) . Next , the Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center at the University of Michigan presents initial results suggesting that data of adequate quality exist to develop a risk-adjustment system for an exp and ed composite rate bundle . The last two articles deal with long-term issues important to ESRD patients :  improving the quality of care for dialysis patients  and increasing the number of kidneys donated and recovered for transplantation","answer":"A greater reduction of volume ( salt and water ) with higher frequency can improve patient quality of life ( QOL ) .Overall , the studies showed that EHD result ed in improved blood pressure management ; therefore , we concluded that there will be a decrease in cardiovascular disease risk , stroke , and morbidity and mortality rate .There will be also an improvement in patient QOL due to beneficial effects of the EHD"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

velocities of the initial and final mesons .the latter decay channel has the experimental advantage of a larger branching ratio and less background .even more profitable is the fact that this decay does not suffer from helicity suppression near @xmath4 , the point where the charmed meson is produced at rest . at this pointthe theoretical description is well controlled by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite and @xmath0 can be determined with higher accuracy .however , measurements of @xmath0 through @xmath1 decays , although more difficult to perform , are also important to check the consistency of the theory .the differential decay width of the @xmath5 process can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a phase space function and @xmath8 is the form factor describing the @xmath9 transition .the shape of the form factor can not be predicted by the theory but it can be constrained by using dispersion relations  @xcite .hqet gives the normalization of @xmath8 at zero recoil ( @xmath4 ) , where the @xmath10 and @xmath11 wave functions are completely overlapped , to be unity . taking into account @xmath12 and qcd corrections to the heavy quark limit , the normalization yields  @xcite : @xmath13 if @xmath7 was not zero at @xmath4 , @xmath0 could be directly extracted from the measured differential decay width at this point .as the phase space vanishes in this region , the differential decay width has to be extrapolated , the quality of the extrapolation depending on the quality of the reconstruction efficiency near to the zero recoil point .measurements of @xmath0 by reconstructing @xmath14 decays have been performed by aleph  @xcite , delphi [ 5,6 ] and opal  @xcite collaborations from @xmath15 decays , and by cleo  @xcite and belle  @xcite collaborations , from @xmath16 pairs coming from @xmath17 decays .when the b meson is coming from a z decay , a large boost is given to the b and to its decay products .secondary vertices can be better determined than in case of a @xmath17 decay where the two b mesons are produced practically at rest .on the contrary , the energy of a b coming from a z can not be so well determined as if it was coming from a @xmath17 decay , and the resolution on the @xmath3 variable deteriorates . to measure the @xmath14 differential decay width , leptons and @xmath11 candidatesare selected .the @xmath11 meson is reconstructed by its decay into a d meson and a soft pion , the latter is produced almost at rest in the @xmath11 rest frame .the d meson can be reconstructed using several decay channels . in case of experiments working at the z ,the good vertex separation allows the @xmath11 to be inclusively reconstructed by mainly detecting the soft pion and few particles from the @xmath18 , thus increasing the available statistics .when the b is produced at rest , the soft pion can not be so well detected and the efficiency for charged pions decreases as @xmath3 goes to 1 .this does not happen for @xmath19 decays where the soft @xmath20 is identified by its decay into two photons .the cleo collaboration analyzes this channel in addition to the @xmath21 one .the most difficult source of background in @xmath22 decays , is due to @xmath11 s coming from excited @xmath23 states .decay properties of resonant and non - resonant @xmath23 decays are not well established yet and these decays introduce an important uncertainty in the determination of @xmath0 . at the @xmath17 energy ,kinematic variables such as the cosine between the b and the @xmath24lepton system , which are obtained making use of the missing energy measurement and the beam energy as a constraint , can be used to eliminate @xmath23 decays .the contamination from @xmath23 is larger at the z energy and it is more difficult to separate .experiments use topological variables based on vertex separation and charge correlation to identify this source of background .the shape of the form factor @xmath8 entering in @xmath25 is usually expressed in terms of the form factor slope @xmath26 and of the form factor ratios @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xcite .a parameterization of @xmath8 , constrained by dispersion relations has been proposed in  @xcite .the @xmath27 and @xmath28 form factor ratios have been measured by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .experiments use these values and fit @xmath25 to extract @xmath29 and the form factor slope @xmath26 .figure  [ fig : belle ] shows the fit of the unfolded distribution of @xmath30 measured by the belle collaboration  @xcite using the form factor of expression given in  @xcite or a linear parameterization .    to    averaging the results of the different experiments , the values of @xmath31 and @xmath26 have been found to be  @xcite :    l f_d^*(1)|v_cb|=(38.80.5(stat)0.9(sys))10 ^ -3 + _d^*^2=1.490.05(stat)0.14(sys ) .    figure  [ fig : average ] and  [ fig : elipses ] shows the results and the world average of the different analyses , scaled to common inputs . using the value of @xmath32 given in eq .( [ eq : f1 ] ) , it yields :    @xmath33 .    to    to      the dominant uncertainty on @xmath0 is coming from theory .it is expected that lattice computations will improve the accuracy of the @xmath32 value during the next years .the statistical error will also decrease below 1@xmath34 as soon as babar and belle analyze their total available statistics .the other systematic uncertainties are coming from different sources .the most important contribution originates from errors correlated between the different experiments . for @xmath0these are the measurements of @xmath35 and @xmath36 rates , the @xmath23 contribution and the branching fractions of the d decay channels , whereas for @xmath26 the measurements of @xmath27 and @xmath28 form factor ratios are the dominant error source .@xmath0 can also be extracted from the differential width :    @xmath38    where , analogously to the @xmath2 case , @xmath39 is a phase space function and @xmath40 is the form factor for the @xmath41 transition .the experimental difficulty in measuring @xmath0 from this decay is coming from the large @xmath42 contribution , from @xmath43 decays , to the background , especially at @xmath44 , where the @xmath1 decay rate is helicity suppressed .in addition , up to now , the theoretical control on @xmath45 is weaker than on @xmath46 since the uncertainties coming from lattice computations have not been completely determined .calculations using sum rules or the quark model find that @xmath45 , unlike @xmath46 which benefits from the luke s theorem  @xcite , is affected by the first order @xmath12 corrections .averaging the aleph  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and belle  @xcite measurements , gives  @xcite :    l g_d(1)|v_cb|=(42.43.7)10 ^ -3 ;  _ d^2=1.140.16 .the contribution of each experiment , scaled to common inputs , can be seen in figures [ fig : averaged ] and [ fig : elipsesd ] .    using @xmath47  @xcite ,it yields :    @xmath48 .    to    to    whichis compatible with the value obtained from @xmath49 decays .@xmath0 has been exclusively measured by different experiments using @xmath50 and @xmath49 decays .the averaged value obtained from @xmath49 decays is :    @xmath51    and from @xmath50 :    @xmath48 .the dominant uncertainty is coming from the theoretical determination of the form factors at zero recoil , @xmath46 and @xmath45 , which are expected to be improved by lattice calculations during the next few years .the experimental uncertainty is limited by systematics due to input parameters such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 rates , the @xmath23 contribution and the branching fractions of the d decay channels .these quantities have to be better determined to improve the @xmath0 accuracy measured from exclusive decays .i would like to thank e. barberio and u. langenegger for computing the averages , and p. roudeau for his invaluable comments .    9 m.  neubert , phys .* 245 * ( 1994 ) 259 .boyd , b.  grinstein and r.f .lebed , phys . rev . *d 56 * ( 1997 ) 6895 ; i.  caprini _ et al _ , nucl .* b 530 * ( 1998 ) 153 .m.  battaglia , aj .buras , p.  gambino and a.  stocchi , eds . proceedings of the _ first workshop on the ckm unitarity triangle _ , cern , feb 2002 , hep -

The subtle changes in the voice of the speaker that are indicative of positive or negative emotional states are often\\"overshadowed\\"by voice characteristics relating to emotional intensity or emotional activation. In this work we explore a representation learning approach that automatically derives discriminative representations of emotional speech. In particular, we investigate two machine learning strategies to improve classifier performance: (1) utilization of unlabeled data using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), and (2) multitask learning. Within our extensive experiments we leverage a multitask annotated emotional corpus as well as a large unlabeled meeting corpus (around 100 hours). Our speaker-independent classification experiments show that in particular the use of unlabeled data in our investigations improves performance of the classifiers and both fully supervised baseline approaches are outperformed considerably. We improve the classification of emotional valence on a discrete 5-point scale to 43.88% and on a 3-point scale to 49.80%, which is competitive to state-of-the-art performance.IntroductionMachine Learning, in general, and affective computing, in particular, rely on good data representations or features that have a good discriminatory faculty in classification and regression experiments, such as emotion recognition from speech. To derive efficient representations of data, researchers have adopted two main strategies: (1) carefully crafted and tailored feature extractors designed for a particular task BIBREF0 and (2) algorithms that learn representations automatically from the data itself BIBREF1 . The latter approach is called Representation Learning (RL), and has received growing attention in the past few years and is highly reliant on large quantities of data. Most approaches for emotion recognition from speech still rely on the extraction of standard acoustic features such as pitch, shimmer, jitter and MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), with a few notable exceptions BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . In this work we leverage RL strategies and automatically learn representations of emotional speech from the spectrogram directly using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.To learn strong representations of speech we seek to leverage as much data as possible. However, emotion annotations are difficult to obtain and scarce BIBREF6 . We leverage the USC-IEMOCAP dataset, which comprises of around 12 hours of highly emotional and partly acted data from 10 speakers BIBREF7 . However, we aim to improve the learned representations of emotional speech with unlabeled speech data from an unrelated meeting corpus, which consists of about 100 hours of data BIBREF8 . While the meeting corpus is qualitatively quite different from the highly emotional USC-IEMOCAP data, we believe that the learned representations will improve through the use of these additional data. This combination of two separate data sources leads to a semi-supervised machine learning task and we extend the CNN architecture to a deep convolutional generative neural network (DCGAN) that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion BIBREF9 .Within this work, we particularly target emotional valence as the primary task, as it has been shown to be the most challenging emotional dimension for acoustic analyses in a number of studies BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . Apart from solely targeting valence classification, we further investigate the principle of multitask learning. In multitask learning, a set of related tasks are learned (e.g., emotional activation), along with a primary task (e.g., emotional valence); both tasks share parts of the network topology and are hence jointly trained, as depicted in Figure FIGREF4 . It is expected that data for the secondary task models information, which would also be discriminative in learning the primary task. In fact, this approach has been shown to improve generalizability across corpora BIBREF12 .The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: First we introduce the DCGAN model and discuss prior work, in Section SECREF2 . Then we describe our specific multitask DCGAN model in Section SECREF3 , introduce the datasets in Section SECREF4 , and describe our experimental design in Section SECREF5 . Finally, we report our results in Section SECREF6 and discuss our findings in Section SECREF7 .Multitask Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial NetworkThe investigated multitask model is based upon the DCGAN architecture described in Section SECREF2 and is implemented in TensorFlow. For emotion classification a fully connected layer is attached to the final convolutional layer of the DCGAN's discriminator. The output of this layer is then fed to two separate fully connected layers, one of which outputs a valence label and the other of which outputs an activation label. This setup is shown visually in Figure FIGREF4 . Through this setup, the model is able to take advantage of unlabeled data during training by feeding it through the DCGAN layers in the model, and is also able to take advantage of multitask learning and train the valence and activation outputs simultaneously.In particular, the model is trained by iteratively running the generator, discriminator, valence classifier, and activation classifier, and back-propagating the error for each component through the network. The loss functions for the generator and discriminator are unaltered, and remain as shown in Section SECREF2 . Both the valence classifier and activation classifier use cross entropy loss as in Equation EQREF2 .Since the valence and activation classifiers share layers with the discriminator the model learns features and convolutional filters that are effective for the tasks of valence classification, activation classification, and discriminating between real and generated samples.Data CorpusDue to the semi-supervised nature of the proposed Multitask DCGAN model, we utilize both labeled and unlabeled data. For the unlabeled data, we use audio from the AMI BIBREF8 and IEMOCAP BIBREF7 datasets. For the labeled data, we use audio from the IEMOCAP dataset, which comes with labels for activation and valence, both measured on a 5-point Likert scale from three distinct annotators. Although IEMOCAP provides per-word activation and valence labels, in practice these labels do not generally change over time in a given audio file, and so for simplicity we label each audio clip with the average valence and activation. Since valence and activation are both measured on a 5-point scale, the labels are encoded in 5-element one-hot vectors. For instance, a valence of 5 is represented with the vector INLINEFORM0 . The one-hot encoding can be thought of as a probability distribution representing the likelihood of the correct label being some particular value. Thus, in cases where the annotators disagree on the valence or activation label, this can be represented by assigning probabilities to multiple positions in the label vector. For instance, a label of 4.5 conceptually means that the “correct” valence is either 4 or 5 with equal probability, so the corresponding vector would be INLINEFORM1 . These “fuzzy labels” have been shown to improve classification performance in a number of applications BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . It should be noted here that we had generally greater success with this fuzzy label method than training the neural network model on the valence label directly, i.e. classification task vs. regression.Pre-processing. Audio data is fed to the network models in the form of spectrograms. The spectrograms are computed using a short time Fourier transform with window size of 1024 samples, which at the 16 kHz sampling rate is equivalent to 64 ms. Each spectrogram is 128 pixels high, representing the frequency range 0-11 kHz. Due to the varying lengths of the IEMOCAP audio files, the spectrograms vary in width, which poses a problem for the batching process of the neural network training. To compensate for this, the model randomly crops a region of each input spectrogram. The crop width is determined in advance. To ensure that the selected crop region contains at least some data (i.e. is not entirely silence), cropping occurs using the following procedure: a random word in the transcript of the audio file is selected, and the corresponding time range is looked up. A random point within this time range is selected, which is then treated as the center line of the crop. The crop is then made using the region defined by the center line and crop width.Early on, we found that there is a noticeable imbalance in the valence labels for the IEMOCAP data, in that the labels skew heavily towards the neutral (2-3) range. In order to prevent the model from overfitting to this distribution during training, we normalize the training data by oversampling underrepresented valence data, such that the overall distribution of valence labels is more even.ResultsTable TABREF10 shows the unweighted per-class accuracies and Pearson correlation coeffecients ( INLINEFORM0 values) between actual and predicted labels for each model. All values shown are average values across the test sets for all 5 folds.Results indicate that the use of unsupervised learning yields a clear improvement in performance. Both BasicDCGAN and MultitaskDCGAN have considerably better accuracies and linear correlations compared to the fully supervised CNN models. This is a strong indication that the use of large quantities of task-unrelated speech data improved the filter learning in the CNN layers of the DCGAN discriminator.Multitask learning, on the other hand, does not appear to have any positive impact on performance. Comparing the two CNN models, the addition of multitask learning actually appears to impair performance, with MultitaskCNN doing worse than BasicCNN in all three metrics. The difference is smaller when comparing BasicDCGAN and MultitaskDCGAN, and may not be enough to decidedly conclude that the use of multitask learning has a net negative impact there, but certainly there is no indication of a net positive impact. The observed performance of both the BasicDCGAN and MultitaskDCGAN using 3-classes is comparable to the state-of-the-art, with 49.80% compared to 49.99% reported in BIBREF16 . It needs to be noted that in BIBREF16 data from the test speaker's session partner was utilized in the training of the model. Our models in contrast are trained on only four of the five sessions as discussed in SECREF5 . Further, the here presented models are trained on the raw spectrograms of the audio and no feature extraction was employed whatsoever. This representation learning approach is employed in order to allow the DCGAN component of the model to train on vast amounts of unsupervised speech data.We further report the confusion matrix of the best performing model BasicDCGAN in Table TABREF11 . It is noted that the “negative” class (i.e., the second row) is classified the best. However, it appears that this class is picked more frequently by the model resulting in high recall = 0.7701 and low precision = 0.3502. The class with the highest F1 score is “very positive” (i.e., the last row) with INLINEFORM0 . The confusion of “very negative” valence with “very positive” valence in the top right corner is interesting and has been previously observed BIBREF4 .Table 2. Evaluation metrics for all four models, averaged across 5 test folds. Speaker-independent unweighted accuracies in % for both 5-class and 3-class valence performance as well as Pearson correlation ρ are reported.Table 3.

With its widespread use, measuring the similarity of emoji has become an important problem for contemporary text processing since it lies at the heart of sentiment analysis, search, and interface design tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the semantic similarity of emoji through embedding models that are learned over machine-readable emoji meanings in the EmojiNet knowledge base. Using emoji descriptions, emoji sense labels and emoji sense definitions, and with different training corpora obtained from Twitter and Google News, we develop and test multiple embedding models to measure emoji similarity. To evaluate our work, we create a new dataset called EmoSim508, which assigns human-annotated semantic similarity scores to a set of 508 carefully selected emoji pairs. After validation with EmoSim508, we present a real-world use-case of our emoji embedding models using a sentiment analysis task and show that our models outperform the previous best-performing emoji embedding model on this task. The EmoSim508 dataset and our emoji embedding models are publicly released with this paper and can be downloaded from http: emojinet.knoesis.org .Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Emojis are a quickly spreading and rather unknown communication phenomenon which occasionally receives attention in the mainstream press, but lacks the scientific exploration it deserves. This paper is a first attempt at investigating the global distribution of emojis. We perform our analysis of the spatial distribution of emojis on a dataset of ∼17 million (and growing) geo-encoded tweets containing emojis by running a cluster analysis over countries represented as emoji distributions and performing correlation analysis of emoji distributions and World Development Indicators. We show that emoji usage tends to draw quite a realistic picture of the living conditions in various parts of our world.[2]: Emoji are commonly used in modern text communication. However, as graphics with nuanced details, emoji may be open to interpretation. Emoji also render differently on different viewing platforms (e.g., Apple’s iPhone vs. Google’s Nexus phone), potentially leading to communication errors. We explore whether emoji renderings or differences across platforms give rise to diverse interpretations of emoji. Through an online survey, we solicit people’s interpretations of a sample of the most popular emoji characters, each rendered for multiple platforms. Both in terms of sentiment and semantics, we analyze the variance in interpretation of the emoji, quantifying which emoji are most (and least) likely to be misinterpreted. In cases in which participants rated the same emoji rendering, they disagreed on whether the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative 25 of the time. When considering renderings across platforms, these disagreements only increase. Overall, we find significant potential for miscommunication, both for individual emoji renderings and for different emoji renderings across platforms.[3]: User generated content on Twitter (produced at an enormous rate of 340 million tweets per day) provides a rich source for gleaning people's emotions, which is necessary for deeper understanding of people's behaviors and actions. Extant studies on emotion identification lack comprehensive coverage of \\"emotional situations\\" because they use relatively small training datasets. To overcome this bottleneck, we have automatically created a large emotion-labeled dataset (of about 2.5 million tweets) by harnessing emotion-related hash tags available in the tweets. We have applied two different machine learning algorithms for emotion identification, to study the effectiveness of various feature combinations as well as the effect of the size of the training data on the emotion identification task. Our experiments demonstrate that a combination of unigrams, big rams, sentiment emotion-bearing words, and parts-of-speech information is most effective for gleaning emotions. The highest accuracy (65.57 ) is achieved with a training data containing about 2 million tweets.[4]: This technical demo presents Emoji2Video, a query-by-emoji interface for exploring video collections. Ideogram-based video search and representation presents an opportunity for an intuitive, visual interface and concise non-textual summary of video contents, in a form factor that is ideal for small screens. The demo allows users to build search strings comprised of ideograms which are used to query a large dataset of YouTube videos. The system returns a list of the top-ranking videos for the user query along with an emoji summary of the video contents so that users may make an informed decision whether to view a video or refine their search terms. The ranking of the videos is done in a zero-shot, multi-modal manner that employs an embedding space to exploit semantic relationships between user-selected ideograms and the video's visual and textual content.[5]: Emoji provide a way to express nonverbal conversational cues in computer-mediated communication. However, people need to share the same understanding of what each emoji symbolises, otherwise communication can breakdown. We surveyed 436 people about their use of emoji and ran an interactive study using a two-dimensional emotion space to investigate (1) the variation in people's interpretation of emoji and (2) their interpretation of corresponding Android and iOS emoji. Our results show variations between people's ratings within and across platforms. We outline our solution to reduce misunderstandings that arise from different interpretations of emoji.[6]: There is a new generation of emoticons, called emojis, that is increasingly being used in mobile communications and social media. In the past two years, over ten billion emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic symbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to the small number of well-known emoticons that carry clear emotional contents, there are hundreds of emojis. But what are their emotional contents? We provide the first emoji sentiment lexicon, called the Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a sentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of the emojis is computed from the sentiment of the tweets in which they occur. We engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4 of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of the emojis allows us to draw several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different. The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance. We observe no significant differences in the emoji rankings between the 13 languages and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Consequently, we propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource for automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization of sentiment and a novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar.[7]: Choosing the right emoji to visually complement or condense the meaning of a message has become part of our daily life. Emojis are pictures, which are naturally combined with plain text, thus creating a new form of language. These pictures are the same independently of where we live, but they can be interpreted and used in different ways. In this paper we compare the meaning and the usage of emojis across different languages. Our results suggest that the overall semantics of the subset of the emojis we studied is preserved across all the languages we analysed. However, some emojis are interpreted in a different way from language to language, and this could be related to socio-geographical differences.[8]: [9]: Emojis are an extremely common occurrence in mobile communications, but their meaning is open to interpretation. We investigate motivations for their usage in mobile messaging in the US. This study asked 228 participants for the last time that they used one or more emojis in a conversational message, and collected that message, along with a description of the emojis' intended meaning and function. We discuss functional distinctions between: adding additional emotional or situational meaning, adjusting tone, making a message more engaging to the recipient, conversation management, and relationship maintenance. We discuss lexical placement within messages, as well as social practices. We show that the social and linguistic function of emojis are complex and varied, and that supporting emojis can facilitate important conversational functions.[10]: Gang affiliates have joined the masses who use social media to share thoughts and actions publicly. Interestingly, they use this public medium to express recent illegal actions, to intimidate others, and to share outrageous images and statements. Agencies able to unearth these profiles may thus be able to anticipate, stop, or hasten the investigation of gang-related crimes. This paper investigates the use of word embeddings to help identify gang members on Twitter. Building on our previous work, we generate word embeddings that translate what Twitter users post in their profile descriptions, tweets, profile images, and linked YouTube content to a real vector format amenable for machine learning classification. Our experimental results show that pre-trained word embeddings can boost the accuracy of supervised learning algorithms trained over gang members social media posts.[11]: Emoji are a contemporary and extremely popular way to enhance electronic communication. Without rigid semantics attached to them, emoji symbols take on different meanings based on the context of a message. Thus, like the word sense disambiguation task in natural language processing, machines also need to disambiguate the meaning or ‘sense’ of an emoji. In a first step toward achieving this goal, this paper presents EmojiNet, the first machine readable sense inventory for emoji. EmojiNet is a resource enabling systems to link emoji with their context-specific meaning. It is automatically constructed by integrating multiple emoji resources with BabelNet, which is the most comprehensive multilingual sense inventory available to date. The paper discusses its construction, evaluates the automatic resource creation process, and presents a use case where EmojiNet disambiguates emoji usage in tweets. EmojiNet is available online for use at http: emojinet.knoesis.org.[12]: Emoji are two-dimensional pictographs that were originally designed to convey emotion between participants in text-based conversation. This paper draws on interview data to identify ways in which emoji have been appropriated in pursuit of relationally meaningful behaviours in contemporary messaging applications. We suggest that the presence of appropriable tools like emoji might influence the selection of a communication channel for particular types of mediated conversation.[13]: Many non-standard elements of ‘netspeak’ writing can be viewed as efforts to replicate the linguistic role played by nonverbal modalities in speech, conveying contextual information such as affect and interpersonal stance. Recently, a new non-standard communicative tool has emerged in online writing: emojis. These unicode characters contain a standardized set of pictographs, some of which are visually similar to well-known emoticons. Do emojis play the same linguistic role as emoticons and other ASCII-based writing innovations? If so, might the introduction of emojis eventually displace the earlier, user-created forms of contextual expression? Using a matching approach to causal statistical inference, we show that as social media users adopt emojis, they dramatically reduce their use of emoticons, suggesting that these linguistic resources compete for the same communicative function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the adoption of emojis leads to a corresponding increase in the use of standard spellings, suggesting that all forms of non-standard writing are losing out in a competition with emojis. Finally, we identify specific textual features that make some emoticons especially likely to be replaced by emojis.[14]: Most street gang members use Twitter to intimidate others, to present outrageous images and statements to the world, and to share recent illegal activities. Their tweets may thus be useful to law enforcement agencies to discover clues about recent crimes or to anticipate ones that may occur. Finding these posts, however, requires a method to discover gang member Twitter profiles. This is a challenging task since gang members represent a very small population of the 320 million Twitter users. This paper studies the problem of automatically finding gang members on Twitter. It outlines a process to curate one of the largest sets of verifiable gang member profiles that have ever been studied. A review of these profiles establishes differences in the language, images, YouTube links, and emojis gang members use compared to the rest of the Twitter population. Features from this review are used to train a series of supervised classifiers. Our classifier achieves a promising F1 score with a low false positive rate.","answer":"While emoji were introduced in the late 1990s, their use and popularity was limited until the Unicode Consortium started to standardize emoji symbols in 2009 [11] .

This study investigated the efficacy and toxicity associated with consolidation chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin after concurrent chemoradiation ( CCR ) in cervical cancer patients .  Materials And Methods From a total of 37 patients, 19 with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB1-IIA cervical cancer (group 1) underwent surgery followed by consolidation chemotherapy after CCR, and 18 with stage IIB-IVA disease (group 2) received consolidation chemotherapy after primary CCR. Three cycles of chemotherapy using paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC 5.0) were administered every 3 weeks for CCR therapy, and three cycles of consolidation chemotherapy using paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC 5.0) were used every 3 weeks after CCR.  results The complete and partial response rates were 77.8% and 22.2% in group 2. Moreover, the 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 62.7% and 90.9% in group 1, and 51.9% and 60% in group 2, respectively. The most common grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities observed were leukopenia (group 1, 10.5%; group 2, 13.0%) and neutropenia (group 1, 7.0%; group 2, 14.8%), and grade 3 or 4 diarrhea (group 1, 1.8%) and febrile illness (group 2, 1.9%) were the most frequently observed non-hematologic toxicities. When we compared these results with previous reports, consolidation chemotherapy after CCR using paclitaxel and carboplatin revealed a relatively lower complete response rate (77.8% vs. 87-100%, respectively) and shorter progression-free survival (51.9-62.7% vs. 81-86%, respectively) and overall survival (60-90.9% vs. 81-95%, respectively) in spite of similar toxicity findings.  conclusion Due to low efficacy results, consolidation chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin after CCR is not a feasible treatment regimen for high-risk early-stage or locally advanced cervical cancer.sentence: This study investigated the efficacy and toxicity associated with consolidation chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin after concurrent chemoradiation ( CCR ) in cervical cancer patients .","answer":"[[\\"paclitaxel\\", \\"carboplatin\\", \\"NEG\\"]]"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

chain triglycerides .chylothorax is a serious complication of cardiac surgery and is associated with increased mortality . because the thoracic duct enters the venous system at angulus venosus , central venous obstruction in the upper body and/or high central venous pressure inevitably causes resistance to the flow of the lymph into the venous system , which leads to congestion of the lymph thus resulting in chylous drainage into the pleural space.8,9 this pathophysiology is directly linked to the well - recognized clinical finding that central venous obstruction and/or high central venous pressure is often associated with prolonged high volume of chylous drainage and is a significant risk factor for treatment failure.47,10 central venous catheterization required for administration of medication or parenteral nutrition after cardiac surgery is known to be an important cause of central venous thrombosis.2,3,11 once chylothorax develops , prolonged chylous drainage , in turn , necessitates the use of a central venous catheter for a prolonged period for parenteral nutrition , which potentially leads to a viscous cycle of thrombosis formation and chylous drainage .antithrombin lost in chyle2,12 and/or vascular inflammation induced by hyperalimentation solution2 may also contribute to increased susceptibility for the development of thrombosis in patients with chylothorax . in our patient , chylothorax developed soon after surgery , which suggested that operative injury to the thoracic duct was the primary cause of chylothorax.1 elevated central venous pressure possibly associated with an underdeveloped right ventricle could have further accelerated and prolonged the chylous drainage .formation of venous thrombosis was also believed to have contributed significantly to the refractory chylous drainage observed even after thoracic duct ligation , because chylothorax resolved after the venous obstruction was relieved by stent implantation .nath et al reported an important finding that although the overall outcome of surgical thoracic duct ligation for chylothorax refractory to conservative medical therapy is excellent , patients with upper body venous thrombosis were at a high risk of treatment failure and mortality.7 considering the clinical course and the huge size of the thrombus formed in our patient , it might be assumed that the process of thrombus formation might have started much earlier than we recognized it .thus , the findings in our patient and those in previous reports indicate the importance of high index of suspicion for central venous thrombosis and obstruction , especially in patients with refractory chylothorax . a decrease in platelet count ,as observed in our patient , and possibly an increase in the level of d - dimers may provide useful information for this purpose . conventionally , surgical intervention is indicated when conservative therapy fails to control the lymphatic leak ; however , specific and precise criteria for abandoning conservative therapy remain to be standardized.1,6,11 a consensus for treatment of chylothorax with central venous stenosis / occlusion remains to be established . to our knowledge , this is the first report on stent implantation for stenosis of the svc due to thrombosis for effective treatment of otherwise uncontrollable chylothorax after congenital cardiac surgery .our findings are in line with those reported in an infant born with congenital svc obstruction in whom successful placement of an intravascular stent led to the resolution of the chylothorax with rapid clinical improvement.13 balloon angioplasty can be an alternative to stent implantation , but in our patient , the treatment efficacy of stenting was greater than that of balloon dilation .administration of anticoagulants or thrombolytics may be effective in some patients with chylothorax associated with thrombosis,3,11 but these drugs were ineffective in our patient .central venous thrombosis and resultant venous stenosis / occlusion can cause a life - threatening refractory chylothorax after congenital heart surgery .stent implantation can effectively relieve the venous obstruction and thus be a life - saving treatment option for this difficult condition .thus , physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for venous obstruction when chylothorax is diagnosed and is resistant to conservative therapy .","answer":"chylothorax is a serious complication of congenital cardiac surgery and is significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality .  central venous obstruction , which is often related to the insertion of central venous catheters for postoperative management , is known to be an important risk factor for treatment failure and mortality associated with this condition .  we present the case of a 6-month -

We consider a formulation of Mahalanobis metric learning as an optimization problem,where the objective is to minimize the number of violated similarity/dissimilarity constraints.  We show that for any fixed ambient dimension, there exists a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) with nearly-linear running time.This result is obtained using tools from the theory of linear programming in low dimensions.We also discuss improvements of the algorithm in practice, and present experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets.Our algorithm is fully parallelizable and performs favorably in the presence of adversarial noise.Learning metric spaces is a fundamental computational primitive that has found numerous applications and has received significant attention in the literature.We refer the reader to Kulis et al. (2013) ; Li and Tian (2018) for detailed exposition and discussion of previous work.At the high level, the input to a metric learning problem consists of some universe of objects X, together with some similarity information on subsets of these objects.Here, we focus on pairwise similarity and dissimilarity constraints.Specifically, we are given S, D Ă\`X 2˘, which are sets of pairs of objects that are labeled as similar and dissimilar respectively.We are also given some u, ą 0, and we seek to find a mapping f : X Ñ Y , into some target metric space pY, ρq, such that for all x, y P S, ρpf pxq, f pyqq ď u, and for all x, y P D, ρpf pxq, f pyqq ě .In the case of Mahalanobis metric learning, we have X Ă R d , with |X| \\" n, for some d P N, and the mapping f : R d Ñ R d is linear.Specifically, we seek to find a matrix G P R dˆd , such that for all tp, qu P S, we haveand for all tp, qu P D, we have1.1 OUR CONTRIBUTIONIn general, there might not exist any G that satisfies all constraints of type 1 and 2.We are thus interested in finding a solution that minimizes the fraction of violated constraints, which corresponds to maximizing the accuracy of the mapping.We develop a p1\`εq-approximation algorithm for optimization problem of computing a Mahalanobis metric space of maximum accuracy, that runs in near-linear time for any fixed ambient dimension d P N. This algorithm is obtained using tools from geometric approximation algorithms and the theory of linear programming in small dimension.The following summarizes our result.Theorem 1.1.For any d P N, ε ą 0, there exists a randomized algorithm for learning d-dimensional Mahalanobis metric spaces, which given an instance that admits a mapping with accuracy r˚, computes a mapping with accuracy at least r˚´ε, in time d Op1q nplog n{εq Opdq , with high probability.The above algorithm can be extended to handle various forms of regularization.We also propose several modifications of our algorithm that lead to significant performance improvements in practice.The final algorithm is evaluated experimentally on both synthetic and real-world data sets, and is compared against the currently best-known algorithms for the problem.","answer":"Fully parallelizable and adversarial-noise resistant metric learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Hepatic arteries of donors and recipients were assessed carefully with spiral CT angiography and DSA before ALDLT. All patients underwent reconstruction of hepatic artery between right lobe liver grafts of donor and recipient which included the anastomosis between right hepatic artery of donors and recipients; the reconstruction of right hepatic artery between donor grafts and left hepatic artery of recipients; interpositional bypass using autogenous saphenous vein and cryopreserved iliac artery between right hepatic artery of donors and hepatic artery, common hepatic artery and abdominal aorta of recipients. The microsurgical technique was employed under the magnification of 3.5 times and operative microscope of 5-10 times.RESULTS:In these series, HAT occurred in 2 recipients at Days 1 and 7 post-ALDLT (1.9%). Both were revascularized with autogenous saphenous vein between right hepatic artery of donor and abdominal aorta of recipient. HAT occurred in 1 recipient at Days 90 post-ALDLT, but no symptom was presented. There was no severe complication and mortality related to hepatic artery reconstruction in recipients. No HAT, hepatic artery stenosis and aneurysm occurred during the follow-up period of 2-60 months. The 1, 2 and 3-year survival rates were 89.3%, 76.0% and 69.3% respectively.CONCLUSION:Careful evaluation of hepatic artery condition and using microsurgical techniques are important for safer arterial reconstruction and a long-term patency of hepatic artery in living donor liver transplantation in adults using right lobe liver grafts.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"Hepatic arteries\\", \\"right hepatic artery\\", \\"hepatic artery\\", \\"right lobe grafts\\", \\"left hepatic artery\\", \\"right lobe liver grafts\\", \\"arterial\\", \\"saphenous vein\\", \\"aneurysm\\", \\"abdominal aorta\\", \\"grafts\\", \\"iliac artery\\", \\"liver\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

This so-called \\"July Effect\\" has long been thought to increase LOS, and potentially contribute to hospital overcrowding and increased waiting time for patients.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The July effect is the hypothetical increase in morbidity and mortality thought to be associated with the influx of new (or newly promoted) trainees during the first portion of the academic year.Studies of whether inpatient mortality in US teaching hospitals rises in July as a result of organizational disruption and relative inexperience of new physicians (July effect) find small and mixed results, perhaps because study populations primarily include low-risk inpatients whose mortality outcomes are unlikely to exhibit a July effect.Elderly hip fracture patients treated at teaching hospitals had 12% greater relative risk of mortality in July/August (ie, experience a \\"July effect\\") compared with nonteaching hospitals during that time period (1998-2003).Many have suggested that these new medical residents may produce errors and worsen patient outcomes-the so-called \\"July Effect;\\" however, we have found no U.S. evidence documenting this effect.A &quot;July effect&quot; of increased complications when new trainees begin residency has been reported widely by the media.The July Effect thus contributed to only a 2.4% higher FTOR in teaching hospitals compared to 19% in non teaching hospitals. The July Effect is reflective of an overall increase in morbidity in all hospitals at the beginning of the academic cycle and it had a pronounced effect in non-teaching hospitals.Studies of whether inpatient mortality in US teaching hospitals rises in July as a result of organizational disruption and relative inexperience of new physicians (July effect) find small and mixed results, perhaps because study populations primarily include low-risk inpatients whose mortality outcomes are unlikely to exhibit a July effect.","answer":"The July effect is the hypothetical increase in morbidity and mortality thought to be associated with the influx of new (or newly promoted) trainees during the first portion of the academic year (in July)."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.
