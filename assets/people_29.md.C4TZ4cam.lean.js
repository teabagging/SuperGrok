In Fanning's first year, he played 20 games and scored an average of 15 points per game. Over the next four seasons, he improved his average by 3 points per game each year. How many total points did Fanning score over these five seasons?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to find the total points scored by Fanning over five seasons, given the information about his scoring average and improvement each year. Step-by-Step Solution:1. Year 1:   - Fanning played 20 games.   - His average score was 15 points per game.   - Total points in Year 1 = 20 games * 15 points/game = 300 points.2. Year 2:   - His average increased by 3 points, so new average = 15 + 3 = 18 points/game.   - Total points in Year 2 = 20 games * 18 points/game = 360 points.3. Year 3:   - His average increased by another 3 points, so new average = 18 + 3 = 21 points/game.   - Total points in Year 3 = 20 games * 21 points/game = 420 points.4. Year 4:   - His average increased by another 3 points, so new average = 21 + 3 = 24 points/game.   - Total points in Year 4 = 20 games * 24 points/game = 480 points.5. Year 5:   - His average increased by another 3 points, so new average = 24 + 3 = 27 points/game.   - Total points in Year 5 = 20 games * 27 points/game = 540 points.6.

Assuming there are 30 days in the month, how many times will Jack's sister use each bottle of nail polish during the month?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Jack's sister will use each bottle of nail polish during a 30-day month if she has 36 different bottles and uses a different one each day in a cycle.1. Understand the Cycle of Use:   - Jack's sister has 36 bottles.   - She uses one bottle per day.   - She uses a different bottle each day until she has used all 36 bottles, then starts over with the first bottle.2. Calculate Full Cycles in 30 Days:   - A full cycle consists of using each of the 36 bottles once.   - We need to determine how many full cycles she completes in 30 days.3. Number of Full Cycles:   - She can complete (leftlfloor frac{30}{36} rightrfloor = 0) full cycles because 30 is less than 36. This means she cannot complete a full cycle in 30 days.4. Usage of Bottles:   - Since she cannot complete a full cycle, she will use each of the first 30 bottles once.   - Thus, the first 30 bottles are used once each, and the remaining 6 bottles are not used.5. Determine Usage for Each Bottle:   - The first 30 bottles are used once each in the 30 days.   - The last 6 bottles are not used at all in these 30 days.In conclusion, each of the first 30 bottles will be used exactly 1 time, while the remaining 6 bottles will not be used at all during the 30-day month.# 1"},{"question":"Jamie lives on a farm in the countryside and loves helping out with the animals.

After these changes, how many hours per week does the team now spend on administrative tasks, and what is the total percentage increase in productivity?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate two things: the new number of hours spent on administrative tasks per week after the software implementation, and the total percentage increase in productivity after Jamie's changes.Step 1: Calculate the new hours spent on administrative tasks.1. Original time spent on administrative tasks = 50 hours per week.2. The software reduces this time by 20%.3. Reduction in hours = 20% of 50 hours = 0.20 * 50 = 10 hours.4. New hours spent on administrative tasks = 50 hours - 10 hours = 40 hours.Step 2: Calculate the total percentage increase in productivity.1. The software implementation reduces the time spent on administrative tasks by 20%, which means the team has 10 more hours (out of the original 50 hours) to spend on other productive activities.2. The initial productivity gain from the software is therefore 20%.3. Jamie increases productivity by an additional 30% on top of this time saved.4. The 30% increase is relative to the time saved by the software, not on the original time. The new productive time (after software implementation) is considered to be 40 hours (since 10 hours were saved).5. Additional productivity gain from reorganization = 30% of the remaining 40 hours = 0.30 * 40 = 12 hours.6. Total new productive time = 40 hours (post-software) + 12 hours = 52 hours.7.

How many liters of water the new drought-resistant crops need per day.2. How many total liters of water Carlos will save this year compared to last year.Let's break down the solution step-by-step: Step 1: Determine the daily water requirement for the new crops.The original crops required 150 liters of water per day. The new drought-resistant crops require 30% less water. To find the new daily water requirement:- Calculate 30% of the original water requirement:    ( 0.30 times 150 = 45 ) liters- Subtract this from the original water requirement to find the new requirement:    ( 150 - 45 = 105 ) litersThus, the new drought-resistant crops need 105 liters of water per day. Step 2: Calculate the total water requirement for last year and this year.- Last year's total water requirement:  Last year, the farm received 120 days of rain. Each day required 150 liters of water for the original crops:  ( 120 times 150 = 18,000 ) liters- This year's total water requirement:  This year, the farm received 85 days of rain. Each day requires 105 liters of water for the new crops:  ( 85 times 105 = 8,925 ) liters Step 3: Calculate the total water savings this year compared to last year.Subtract this year's total water requirement from last year's total water requirement to find the savings:( 18,000 - 8,925 = 9,075 ) litersThus, Carlos will save 9,075 liters of water this year compared to last year.

On a new project, Alex wants to survey a rectangular plot of land using a drone. The plot has a length of 120 meters and a width of 80 meters. Alex's drone can capture and process 3D maps at a rate of 10 square meters per minute. If Alex starts the drone at 9:00 AM, how many minutes will it take to complete the 3D mapping of the entire plot, and what time will it be when the mapping is finished?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:1. Calculate the area of the rectangular plot:   The plot has a length of 120 meters and a width of 80 meters. The area ( A ) of a rectangle is given by the formula:   [   A = text{length} times text{width}   ]   Substituting the given values:   [   A = 120 , text{meters} times 80 , text{meters} = 9600 , text{square meters}   ]2. Determine the time required to map the entire area:   The drone covers 10 square meters per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take to map the entire 9600 square meters, we divide the total area by the rate of the drone:   [   text{Time} = frac{text{Total area}}{text{Rate per minute}} = frac{9600 , text{square meters}}{10 , text{square meters per minute}} = 960 , text{minutes}   ]3. Calculate the finishing time:   Alex starts the drone at 9:00 AM.

They have a collection of 120 vinyl records, 75 cassette tapes, and 50 reel-to-reel tapes. Alex decides to dedicate one weekend to digitizing part of their collection. If Alex can digitize 5 vinyl records, 8 cassette tapes, and 3 reel-to-reel tapes each day, how many days will it take Alex to digitize half of their entire collection?","answer":"To determine how many days it will take Alex to digitize half of their entire collection, we will follow these steps:1. Calculate the Total Number of Items in the Collection:   - Vinyl records: 120   - Cassette tapes: 75   - Reel-to-reel tapes: 50   Total collection = 120 (vinyl records) + 75 (cassette tapes) + 50 (reel-to-reel tapes) = 245 items2. Determine Half of the Total Collection:   - Half of the collection = 245 / 2 = 122.5   Since Alex cannot digitize half an item, they will need to digitize at least 123 items to cover half of the collection.3. Calculate the Number of Items Alex Can Digitize Per Day:   - Vinyl records per day: 5   - Cassette tapes per day: 8   - Reel-to-reel tapes per day: 3   Total items digitized per day = 5 (vinyl records) + 8 (cassette tapes) + 3 (reel-to-reel tapes) = 16 items4. Calculate the Number of Days Needed:   - To find the number of days required to digitize at least 123 items, we divide the number of items by the number of items Alex can digitize per day.   Days needed = 123 items / 16 items per day ≈ 7.6875   Since Alex cannot work a fraction of a day, they will need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Alex's special education teacher designed a fun project that involves creating a beautiful mosaic using colored tiles. They plan to create a mosaic on a square board that is 4 tiles wide and 4 tiles long. Alex has 3 different colors of tiles: blue, green, and red. They decide to use the same number of each color tile. How many tiles of each color does Alex need to complete the mosaic?","answer":"To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:1. Determine the Total Number of Tiles:   The mosaic board is a square that is 4 tiles wide and 4 tiles long. Therefore, the total number of tiles required to cover the entire board is:   [   4 times 4 = 16 text{ tiles}   ]2. Determine the Number of Each Color Tile:   Alex has 3 different colors of tiles: blue, green, and red. The problem states that Alex wants to use the same number of each color tile. 3. Calculate the Number of Tiles per Color:   Since there are 3 colors and a total of 16 tiles, we need to divide the total number of tiles equally among the 3 colors. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of tiles by the number of colors:   [   frac{16 text{ tiles}}{3} approx 5.33   ]   However, since the number of tiles per color must be a whole number, we need to adjust the distribution. The closest whole number that allows the total to remain 16 is to use 5 tiles of each color for two of the colors and 6 tiles for the third color. This is because:   [   5 + 5 + 6 = 16   ]   However, since the problem implies using the same number of each color, a strict equal distribution isn't possible without exceeding the total of 16 tiles. Thus, the closest practical solution is to use approximately 5 tiles of each color, but this doesn't fit the 16 tile requirement perfectly under the constraint of using the exact same number for each color.4. Reconsider with Equal Distribution:   Since the problem asks for the same number of each tile, technically, the constraint might suggest a mistake in the problem statement if it requires an exact total of 16 tiles. If we relax the number of tiles to fit an equal distribution:   [   text{3 colors} times text{5 tiles each} = 15 text{ tiles}   ]   However, we can't meet the total of 16 exactly without breaking equality under integer constraints. The problem might expect a slightly uneven distribution, or maybe an equal distribution with slightly fewer tiles than filling the entire board.Considering the constraint to use the exact same number of each color, the closest feasible integer solution is not strictly possible under standard interpretation without relaxing one condition (either using fewer total tiles or not strictly keeping colors equal).Given the problem's constraints and typical interpretation, an approximate equal distribution is usually what might be expected:5. Final Conclusion:   With the constraints, Alex can use the following:   - 5 blue tiles   - 5 green tiles   - 5 red tiles   Total = 15 tiles, which doesn't perfectly fill the board under strict conditions but applies practical equal distribution. Under exact equal numbers to fill 16, the constraint is infeasible without altering one condition.# 5 tiles of each color"},{"question":"Alex, a tech-savvy 14-year-old who loves playing video games, decides to spend the weekend at his grandmother's house.

If a student answers all the questions, what is the student's total score as a percentage?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total score a student would achieve if they answered all the questions, given the percentages for multiple-choice and essay questions.Step 1: Calculate the number of multiple-choice questions.- Total number of questions = 200- Percentage of multiple-choice questions = 60%- Number of multiple-choice questions = 60% of 200 = 0.60 * 200 = 120 questionsStep 2: Calculate the number of essay questions.- Since the remaining questions are essay-based, we subtract the number of multiple-choice questions from the total.- Number of essay questions = 200 - 120 = 80 questionsStep 3: Calculate the score from the multiple-choice questions.- The average score on multiple-choice questions is 75%.- Total possible points from multiple-choice questions = 120- Score from multiple-choice = 75% of 120 = 0.75 * 120 = 90 pointsStep 4: Calculate the score from the essay questions.- The average score on essay questions is 50%.- Total possible points from essay questions = 80- Score from essay questions = 50% of 80 = 0.50 * 80 = 40 pointsStep 5: Calculate the total score.- Total score = Score from multiple-choice + Score from essay questions = 90 + 40 = 130 pointsStep 6: Calculate the total score as a percentage of the total possible score.- Total possible points from all questions = 200- Total score as a percentage = (Total score / Total possible points) * 100- Total score as a percentage = (130 / 200) * 100 = 65%The student's total score as a percentage is:# 65%"},{"question":"An old-school music critic, who loves collecting vinyl records and has a deep appreciation for classic Afrobeat, decides to organize his collection. He has 120 records in total. He finds that 1/3 of his collection consists of classic Afrobeat albums. He also has twice as many jazz records as he has rock records. If there are 15 more rock records than Afrobeat albums, how many jazz records does the critic have in his collection?","answer":"To solve the problem, we'll start by defining some variables and use the information given in the problem to set up equations.Let's define:- ( A ) as the number of Afrobeat albums.- ( R ) as the number of rock records.- ( J ) as the number of jazz records.From the problem, we have the following information:1. The total number of records is 120.   [   A + R + J = 120   ]2. One-third of the collection consists of Afrobeat albums.   [   A = frac{1}{3} times 120 = 40   ]   So, ( A = 40 ).3. There are 15 more rock records than Afrobeat albums.   [   R = A + 15 = 40 + 15 = 55   ]   So, ( R = 55 ).4. The number of jazz records is twice the number of rock records.   [   J = 2R = 2 times 55 = 110   ]   So, ( J = 110 ).Now, let's verify our solution by checking if the sum of all records equals 120:[A + R + J = 40 + 55 + 110 = 205]We find that there is an inconsistency because the sum (205) exceeds the total given (120). The error lies in our interpretation of the conditions. Let's reconsider the equations:1. Use ( A = 40 ) (correctly found).2. Use ( R = A + 15 = 55 ) (correctly found).3. Since ( J = 2R ) is not consistent with the total, let's recalculate:   [   J = 2R = 2 times 55 = 110   ]   Clearly, this is incorrect, as it does not match the total of 120 records. We need to find the correct solution:Since ( A = 40 ), and ( R = 55 ), the third condition ( J = 2R ) must be wrong in our earlier interpretation. Let's calculate based on the given total constraint:Given the total number of records: [A + R + J = 120]Substitute known values:[40 + 55 + J = 120][95 + J = 120]Solving for ( J ):[J = 120 - 95 = 25]Thus, the correct number of jazz records is 25.# 25"},{"question":"A skilled therapist, Ms. Martinez, is helping her student, Alex, develop fine motor skills to use assistive technology more effectively.

During a town meeting, Alex presents some statistics to encourage local businesses to consider environmentally friendly investments. Alex mentions that last year, the town invested 500,000 in fossil fuels and 300,000 in tobacco. The town agreed to reduce these investments by 40% each this year. Alex also suggests reinvesting the total amount divested into renewable energy projects, which cost 25,000 each. How many renewable energy projects can the town fund with the divested money?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:1. Calculate the amount divested from fossil fuels:   - The initial investment in fossil fuels is 500,000.   - The town agreed to reduce this by 40%.   - Amount divested from fossil fuels = 40% of 500,000.[text{Amount divested from fossil fuels} = 0.40 times 500,000 = 200,000]2. Calculate the amount divested from tobacco:   - The initial investment in tobacco is 300,000.   - The town agreed to reduce this by 40%.   - Amount divested from tobacco = 40% of 300,000.[text{Amount divested from tobacco} = 0.40 times 300,000 = 120,000]3. Calculate the total amount divested:   - Total amount divested = Amount divested from fossil fuels + Amount divested from tobacco.[text{Total amount divested} = 200,000 + 120,000 = 320,000]4. Determine how many renewable energy projects can be funded:   - Each renewable energy project costs 25,000.   - Number of projects that can be funded = Total amount divested / Cost per renewable energy project.[text{Number of projects} = frac{320,000}{25,000} = 12.8]Since the number of projects must be a whole number, the town can fund 12 complete renewable energy projects.# 12"},{"question":"Jess, an enthusiastic fan of \\"One Mississippi,\\" decides to spend her weekend binge-watching her favorite episodes.

Each day, she relies on Sam, the materials coordinator, to deliver the raw materials needed for her work. Jenna can assemble 15 gadgets per hour when she has enough materials. One day, Sam delivers 120 gadgets' worth of materials in the morning and another 90 gadgets' worth in the afternoon. If Jenna works for 8 hours that day, how many more gadgets could she have assembled if Sam had delivered all the materials in the morning?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to compare two scenarios: one where the materials are delivered in two separate batches, and another where all materials are delivered in the morning. Scenario 1: Staggered Delivery1. Morning Delivery: Sam delivers materials for 120 gadgets.2. Afternoon Delivery: Sam delivers materials for another 90 gadgets.3. Total Available Materials: 120 gadgets' worth in the morning + 90 gadgets' worth in the afternoon = 210 gadgets' worth in total.Working Hours: Jenna works for 8 hours.- Hours without materials constraint:   - In the morning, Jenna can work for as many hours as it takes to use up the 120 gadgets' worth of materials.   - Gadgets per hour: 15   - Time to use 120 gadgets' worth of materials: ( frac{120}{15} = 8 ) hours.   Since Jenna works for 8 hours and she receives the materials for 120 gadgets in the morning, she can continue working without stopping until she runs out of materials.- Afternoon Work:   - Since Jenna used all 8 hours to assemble 120 gadgets, she never uses the 90 gadgets' worth of materials delivered in the afternoon.Total Gadgets Assembled: 120 gadgets Scenario 2: All Materials Delivered in the Morning1. Total Available Materials in the Morning: 120 + 90 = 210 gadgets' worth.2. Total Working Hours: 8 hours.- Gadgets per hour: 15- Total Gadgets Jenna can assemble in 8 hours: ( 15 times 8 = 120 ) gadgets.Since Jenna can assemble a maximum of 120 gadgets in an 8-hour workday, even if she had all 210 gadgets' worth of materials in the morning, she would still only be able to assemble 120 gadgets. ConclusionThe number of gadgets Jenna could have assembled wouldn't change whether Sam delivered all materials in the morning or in two separate batches. Thus, Jenna would not have been able to assemble any more gadgets than she did with the staggered delivery.# 0"},{"question":"A reporter is investigating the environmental impact of a new construction project that plans to build 150 houses.

The software is designed to streamline operations by optimizing the delivery routes for the company's fleet of trucks. Each truck delivers packages to various locations throughout the city.On a typical day, the software helps reduce the total delivery time by 20%. Originally, the delivery time for all trucks combined was 50 hours. Due to the efficiency of the software, the company can now schedule an additional 10 deliveries that each take 30 minutes. If there are 5 trucks in the fleet, and each truck is assigned an equal number of additional deliveries, how many hours in total will each truck spend on delivering packages after the software optimization and the additional deliveries are accounted for?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total delivery time after optimization, account for the additional deliveries, and then determine how much time each truck spends on delivering packages.Step 1: Calculate the reduced delivery time after software optimization.The original total delivery time for all trucks combined was 50 hours. The software reduces this time by 20%.Reduction in time = 20% of 50 hours = 0.20 × 50 = 10 hours.So, the new total delivery time after optimization = 50 hours - 10 hours = 40 hours.Step 2: Calculate the total time for the additional deliveries.There are 10 additional deliveries, and each takes 30 minutes.Total time for additional deliveries = 10 deliveries × 30 minutes = 300 minutes.Convert 300 minutes to hours: 300 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.Step 3: Calculate the total delivery time including additional deliveries.Total delivery time including additional deliveries = 40 hours (optimized time) + 5 hours (additional delivery time) = 45 hours.Step 4: Calculate the time spent by each truck.There are 5 trucks, and the total delivery time of 45 hours is equally distributed among them.Time spent by each truck = Total delivery time ÷ Number of trucks = 45 hours ÷ 5 trucks = 9 hours.So, each truck will spend a total of 9 hours on delivering packages after the optimization and additional deliveries are accounted for.# 9 hours"},{"question":"Jordan is an ambitious basketball player who sees the recent injury of the star player on his team as a golden opportunity to shine.
