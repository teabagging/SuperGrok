She discovers a fascinating pattern related to currency issued in the 18th century. In her research, she finds that in the year 1700, a kingdom issued 1,200 coins. Each subsequent year, the number of coins issued increased by a fixed amount. By the year 1710, the kingdom had issued a total of 1,650 coins.Dr. Fathom wants to calculate the yearly increase in the number of coins issued. Can you help her determine how many more coins were issued each year?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the yearly increase in the number of coins issued by the kingdom.1. Understand the given information:   - In the year 1700, the kingdom issued 1,200 coins.   - By the year 1710, the kingdom issued 1,650 coins.   - The number of coins issued each year increases by a fixed amount.2. Identify the pattern:   Let ( a ) be the number of coins issued in the year 1700, so ( a = 1200 ).   Let ( d ) be the yearly increase in the number of coins issued.   The number of coins issued in the year 1710 can be expressed as:   [   a_{1710} = a + 10d   ]   where ( a_{1710} = 1650 ).3. Set up the equation:   Given:   [   1650 = 1200 + 10d   ]4. Solve for ( d ):   Subtract 1200 from both sides:   [   1650 - 1200 = 10d   ]   Simplify the left side:   [   450 = 10d   ]   Divide both sides by 10 to solve for ( d ):   [   d = frac{450}{10} = 45   ]Therefore, the yearly increase in the number of coins issued is 45 coins.# 45"},{"question":"Colonel Davis, a retired Marine Corps officer, is planning a road trip to visit military museums and memorials across five states.

The site is estimated to produce 500 tons of ore per month, and the company sells the ore for 150 per ton. However, due to a clash with the safety inspector, the company must invest an additional 20,000 in safety equipment before starting operations. The monthly operational costs, including labor and equipment, are 50,000. How many months will it take for the company to recover the initial safety equipment investment and start making a profit?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many months it will take for the company to recover its initial investment in safety equipment and start making a profit from the new mining site.Step-by-step Solution:1. Calculate Monthly Revenue:   The company produces 500 tons of ore per month and sells it for 150 per ton.   [   text{Monthly Revenue} = 500 , text{tons} times 150/text{ton} = 75,000   ]2. Calculate Monthly Costs:   The monthly operational costs are 50,000.3. Calculate Monthly Profit (Excluding Initial Investment):   The monthly profit is the revenue minus the operational costs.   [   text{Monthly Profit} = 75,000 - 50,000 = 25,000   ]4. Determine Initial Investment Recovery:   The company needs to recover the initial 20,000 investment in safety equipment.5. Calculate Number of Months to Recover Investment:   We need to find how many months it will take for the monthly profit to cover the 20,000 initial investment.   [   text{Number of Months} = frac{text{Initial Investment}}{text{Monthly Profit}} = frac{20,000}{25,000} = 0.8   ]6. Conclusion:   Since the number of months calculated (0.8) is less than 1, it means that the company will cover the initial investment within the first month.

We'll use algebra to set up and solve the equations based on the information given.1. Define Variables:   - Let ( V ) be the number of Victorian artifacts.   - The number of Renaissance artifacts is twice the number of Victorian artifacts, so it is ( 2V ).   - The number of Modern artifacts is 10 more than the number of Victorian artifacts, so it is ( V + 10 ).2. Set up the Equation:   - We know the total number of artifacts is 180. Therefore, we can write the equation:     [     V + 2V + (V + 10) = 180     ]3. Simplify and Solve the Equation:   - Combine like terms:     [     V + 2V + V + 10 = 180     ]     [     4V + 10 = 180     ]   - Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate terms with ( V ):     [     4V = 170     ]   - Divide both sides by 4 to solve for ( V ):     [     V = frac{170}{4} = 42.5     ]However, since the number of artifacts should be a whole number, we must have made a miscalculation.

How many fish in total has Dr. Taylor counted in that section of the reef?","answer":"To find the total number of fish Dr. Taylor has counted, we need to consider the number of fish from each species.1. Count the fish from the given species:   - Parrotfish: 4 fish   - Clownfish: 3 fish   - Angelfish: 5 fish2. Calculate the number of remaining species:   Dr. Taylor discovered 12 different species in total. We know the counts for 3 of these species, so the number of remaining species is:   [   12 - 3 = 9 text{ species}   ]3. Count the fish for the remaining species:   Each of the remaining 9 species has 2 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish from these species is:   [   9 times 2 = 18 text{ fish}   ]4. Calculate the total number of fish:   Add the number of fish from each counted species and the remaining species:   [   4 text{ (parrotfish)} + 3 text{ (clownfish)} + 5 text{ (angelfish)} + 18 text{ (remaining species)} = 30 text{ fish}   ]Thus, the total number of fish Dr. Taylor has counted in that section of the reef is 30.# 30"},{"question":"Jamie is a homeowner who recently discovered a water leak in one of the pipes in their basement.

Calculate the time for relaxation techniques:   - There are 5 relaxation techniques.   - Each technique takes 12 minutes to learn.   - Total time for relaxation techniques = 5 techniques * 12 minutes/technique = 60 minutes.2. Calculate the time for discussing foods:   - There are 3 foods.   - Discussing each food takes 6 minutes.   - Total time for discussing foods = 3 foods * 6 minutes/food = 18 minutes.3.

Over the years, Alex has performed in numerous concerts and recorded several albums. By the age of 18, Alex had played in 24 concerts. In each of the following 5 years, Alex played in 6 more concerts per year than the previous year. How many concerts in total did Alex play by the age of 23?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of concerts Alex played by the age of 23. We are given the following information:1. By the age of 18, Alex had played in 24 concerts.2. In each of the following 5 years (ages 19 to 23), Alex played in 6 more concerts per year than the previous year.Let's break down the solution step by step:1. Age 18 Concerts: By age 18, Alex had already played in 24 concerts.2. Concerts from Ages 19 to 23:   - We need to calculate the number of concerts Alex played each year from ages 19 to 23.   - We are told that each year, Alex played 6 more concerts than the previous year. We will assume that in the year Alex turned 19, they played a certain number of concerts, and we will denote this number as ( x ).3. Calculation of Concerts Each Year:    - At age 19, Alex played ( x ) concerts.   - At age 20, Alex played ( x + 6 ) concerts.   - At age 21, Alex played ( x + 12 ) concerts.   - At age 22, Alex played ( x + 18 ) concerts.   - At age 23, Alex played ( x + 24 ) concerts.4. Number of Concerts in Each Year:   - To find the specific number of concerts, we need additional information. However, with the problem as stated, it seems we need to determine the pattern based on ( x ) as the starting point for age 19.5. Calculate Total Concerts from Ages 19 to 23:   - The total number of concerts from ages 19 to 23 is given by the sum of the concerts played in each year:   [   text{Total from 19 to 23} = x + (x + 6) + (x + 12) + (x + 18) + (x + 24)   ]   - Simplifying the expression:   [   = 5x + (6 + 12 + 18 + 24)   ]   [   = 5x + 60   ]6. Determine Starting Value ( x ):   - We need to determine the starting value ( x ) for age 19. Without explicit information, the next step is to rely on the structure of the problem: since the total from prior years is given (24 concerts by age 18), we interpret ( x ) as the concerts in the first year after 18.7. Total Concerts Calculation:   - Alex played 24 concerts by age 18. Now, we find the total from 19 to 23 and add to 24:   [   text{Total concerts by age 23} = 24 + (x + (x + 6) + (x + 12) + (x + 18) + (x + 24))   ]8. Assuming a Linear Increase:   - If ( x = 6 ) (assuming starting at 6 at age 19 due to a linear progression), then:   [   text{Concerts from 19 to 23} = 5(6) + 60 = 30 + 60 = 90   ]9. Final Total:   - Adding up all concerts by age 23:   [   text{Total concerts} = 24 + 90 = 114   ]Therefore, the total number of concerts Alex played by the age of 23 is:# 114"},{"question":"A dedicated Kurt Vonnegut fan decides to watch a documentary about him, not for the cinematic experience, but to gather interesting facts and stories about Kurt's life.

Calculate the total number of facts the fan notes down by the end of the film.","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many facts the fan notes down in total by the end of the documentary.1. Total Duration of Documentary: The documentary runs for 120 minutes.2. Facts Presented: The documentary reveals 3 facts every 10 minutes.3. Total Number of Facts:     - Since 3 facts are revealed every 10 minutes, over 120 minutes, the total number of facts is:     [     frac{120 text{ minutes}}{10 text{ minutes}} times 3 text{ facts} = 12 times 3 = 36 text{ facts}     ]4. Facts Noted in the First 40 Minutes:     - In the first 40 minutes, the fan notes down every fact.   - The number of 10-minute intervals in the first 40 minutes is:     [     frac{40 text{ minutes}}{10 text{ minutes}} = 4 text{ intervals}     ]   - Therefore, during these 4 intervals, the fan notes down:     [     4 times 3 text{ facts} = 12 text{ facts}     ]5.

If her shift lasts 4 hours and she managed to see 2 more patients in the final hour than in the first hour, how many patients did Emily see in total during her entire shift?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many patients Emily attended to during each hour of her shift and then sum these numbers to find the total.1. First Hour:   - Emily attended to 5 patients.2. Second Hour:   - Emily attended to 3 times as many patients as in the first hour.   - Therefore, she attended to (3 times 5 = 15) patients.3. Third Hour:   - Emily attended to half as many patients as in the second hour.   - Therefore, she attended to (frac{15}{2} = 7.5) patients.   - Since the number of patients must be a whole number, we assume she attended to 7 patients (as attending half a patient doesn't make practical sense).4. Fourth Hour:   - Emily attended to 2 more patients than in the first hour.   - Therefore, she attended to (5 + 2 = 7) patients.5. Total Patients During the Shift:   - Now, we add up all the patients she attended to during her entire shift:   [   5 text{ (first hour)} + 15 text{ (second hour)} + 7 text{ (third hour)} + 7 text{ (fourth hour)} = 34   ]Thus, the total number of patients Emily attended to during her entire shift is 34.# 34"},{"question":"Alex is a nature enthusiast who loves collecting fallen branches and discarded wood for their art projects.

Let's break this down step by step:1. From Bribie Island to the Sunshine Coast:   - Distance = 70 kilometers.2. From the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane:   To calculate this distance, we need to consider the travel from the Sunshine Coast to Bribie Island and then to Brisbane. However, we are given only the direct distances from Bribie Island to both locations:   - Distance from Bribie Island to Sunshine Coast = 70 kilometers,   - Distance from Bribie Island to Brisbane = 90 kilometers.   Since the problem doesn't specify the direct distance between the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane, a reasonable assumption would be that the distance from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane is the difference between the distances from Bribie Island to each location. However, with no direct measurement given, let's assume a direct path exists as the problem implies a straight route:   - Assume Sunshine Coast to Brisbane as a direct travel leg without additional distance data provided.3. From Brisbane to the Gold Coast:   This segment is direct as calculated from the distances provided:   - Distance from Brisbane to Gold Coast = 170 kilometers - 90 kilometers = 80 kilometers.4. From the Gold Coast back to Bribie Island:   - Distance = 170 kilometers.Now, let's sum up the total distance traveled:- Bribie Island to Sunshine Coast: 70 kilometers- Sunshine Coast to Brisbane: (Assumed as direct or some logical distance in absence of exact data)- Brisbane to Gold Coast: 80 kilometers (Direct calculation from 170 km to 90 km)- Gold Coast to Bribie Island: 170 kilometersThe total distance traveled is:( 70 + 80 + 170 = 320 ) kilometers Therefore, the total distance traveled by the resident is:# 320"},{"question":"Professor Smith, an expert in military strategy and Reconstruction Era policies, is organizing a series of lectures for his students.

Since the choice of quote is independent of the choice of colors, we simply multiply the number of color combinations by the number of quotes.There are 4 quotes available, so for each color combination, there are 4 possible posters. Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique postersTo find the total number of unique posters, multiply the number of color combinations by the number of quotes:[3003 times 4 = 12012]Therefore, Jamie can create 12,012 unique posters using different combinations of colors and quotes.# 12012"},{"question":"An event planner is coordinating medical services for a large-scale music festival that will last for 3 days.

Jamie also observes that the player's average shooting accuracy for the game was 50%, meaning they made half of their attempted shots. If the player attempted 10 more shots than the total points they scored in the game, how many shots did the player attempt in total?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of shots attempted by the player given the information about their scoring and shooting accuracy.1. Calculate the Total Points Scored:   The player scored points in four quarters:   - First quarter: 12 points   - Second quarter: 8 points   - Third quarter: 15 points   - Fourth quarter: 10 points   Total points scored = 12 + 8 + 15 + 10 = 45 points2. Determine the Shooting Accuracy:   The average shooting accuracy is given as 50%. This means the player made 50% of their attempted shots.3. Set Up the Equation for Total Shots Attempted:   Let ( x ) be the total number of shots attempted. Since the player made 50% of the shots, they made ( 0.5x ) shots. Since each made shot corresponds to a point, the total points scored (45 points) equals the number of successful shots made:   [   0.5x = 45   ]4. Solve for ( x ):   To find ( x ), multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:   [   x = 45 times 2   ]   [   x = 90   ]5. Check the Additional Condition:   According to the problem, the player attempted 10 more shots than the total points scored. Thus:   [   x = 45 + 10   ]   [   x = 55   ]   This step reveals a contradiction in our initial equation since the player cannot attempt 90 shots if they only attempted 55 shots. We need to re-evaluate our solution.6.

Determine the time for rest periods:   - There is a 5-minute rest period after each drill.   - Since there are 3 drills, there will be 2 rest periods (after the first and second drills).   - Total rest time = 2 rest periods × 5 minutes/rest period = 10 minutes.4. Calculate the total duration of the training session:   - Total duration = Total drill time + Total rest time = 45 minutes + 10 minutes = 55 minutes.Therefore, the total duration of the training session is 55 minutes.# 55"},{"question":"In ancient Macedonia, there was a small village that initially had 50 families living in it. Over the years, the village experienced several changes in its population due to historical events. During the first migration wave, 15 new families moved to the village. Later, 10% of the total families decided to leave the village to explore new opportunities elsewhere. However, a second wave of historical significance brought in twice as many families as those who had left. How many families were living in the village after these demographic changes?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's go through the series of changes step by step:1. Initial Count of Families:   - The village initially had 50 families.2. After the First Migration Wave:   - 15 new families moved to the village.   - New total = Initial families + New families = 50 + 15 = 65 families.3. Families Leaving the Village:   - 10% of the total families decided to leave.   - Families leaving = 10% of 65 = 0.10 * 65 = 6.5 families.   - Since the number of families must be an integer, we interpret this as 7 families leaving (round up).4. After Families Left:   - Total families after some left = Families after first migration - Families that left = 65 - 7 = 58 families.5. Second Wave of Families Moving In:   - Twice as many families as those who had left came in.   - Families that left = 7, so families moving in = 2 * 7 = 14 families.6. Final Count of Families:   - Total families = Families after some left + New families from the second wave = 58 + 14 = 72 families.So, the final number of families living in the village after all the demographic changes is:# 72"},{"question":"An event planner is organizing an international conference and has invited a sociologist to speak about social shifts and globalization.

After researching, they decide to include three categories of wine: Red, White, and Sparkling. They want to have twice as many Red wines as Sparkling wines, and three more White wines than Red wines. If the total number of wines they plan to include is 35, how many wines of each type should the entrepreneur include on the list?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's define variables for the number of each type of wine:- Let ( R ) be the number of Red wines.- Let ( W ) be the number of White wines.- Let ( S ) be the number of Sparkling wines.According to the problem, we have the following conditions:1. The number of Red wines is twice the number of Sparkling wines:   [   R = 2S   ]2. The number of White wines is three more than the number of Red wines:   [   W = R + 3   ]3. The total number of wines is 35:   [   R + W + S = 35   ]Now, we need to solve these equations step-by-step:Step 1: Substitute ( R = 2S ) into the equation for ( W ):[W = 2S + 3]Step 2: Substitute ( R = 2S ) and ( W = 2S + 3 ) into the total wine equation:[2S + (2S + 3) + S = 35]Step 3: Simplify and solve for ( S ):[2S + 2S + 3 + S = 35 5S + 3 = 35]Subtract 3 from both sides:[5S = 32]Divide both sides by 5:[S = frac{32}{5} = 6.4]Since ( S ) must be an integer, we realize there may be an error in calculation or interpretation. Let's check the problem constraints again:We correctly used the conditions and equations, so this indicates a mistake in the problem setup or given constraints. Assuming the problem setup is correct, let's consider that the constraints should be adjusted to allow integer solutions.Given this discrepancy, I'll assume there was an error in the problem conditions or the result expectations; the problem should typically be designed to allow integer solutions. Please verify the constraints or provide additional context to resolve this.However, if we assume the constraints are indeed correctly set for an integer solution, the approach would yield a different integer ( S ) under correct conditions. Let's try another approach:Check if any simplification could allow integer solutions under close conditions:Try ( S = 5 ):[R = 2S = 2 cdot 5 = 10][W = R + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13]Total:[R + W + S = 10 + 13 + 5 = 28]This does not meet the total wines condition of 35, indicating an error in assumption or conditions. Therefore, the question as posed might need reassessment to ensure integer solutions unless further clarification or adjustment is provided.Under standard conditions, you would recompute or verify problem constraints based on expected integer outcomes. Thus, the result as initially computed doesn't fit standard integer wine counts, prompting re-evaluation of constraint setups or intended integer results."},{"question":"Jamie lives in New Hampshire and is very environmentally conscious.

Determine the number of tasks processed by the new system per day:   - Current system processes 40 tasks per day.   - The new system increases task processing by 25%.   - Increase in tasks = 40 tasks/day * 25% = 10 tasks/day.   - Total tasks processed per day by the new system = 40 tasks/day + 10 tasks/day = 50 tasks/day.2. Calculate the additional number of tasks processed per day:   - Additional tasks processed per day = 50 tasks/day (new system) - 40 tasks/day (current system) = 10 additional tasks/day.3. Calculate the additional revenue generated per day:   - Each task generates 3 in revenue.   - Additional revenue per day = 10 additional tasks/day * 3/task = 30/day.4. Determine the number of days needed to recover the implementation cost:   - Cost of implementing the new system = 5,000.   - Number of days to recover the cost = Total cost / Additional revenue per day = 5,000 / 30/day.5. Calculate the result:   - Number of days = 5,000 / 30/day = 166.67 days.Since the company cannot operate in fractional days, we round up to the nearest whole number because the cost is only fully recovered at the end of a complete day. Therefore, it will take 167 days to recover the implementation cost.# 167"},{"question":"A subway driver works 5 days a week and drives 8 hours each day. Due to successful collective bargaining, the driver receives an additional pay of 2 per hour for every hour worked over 35 hours in a week. The driver's regular hourly rate is 20. Calculate the driver's total weekly earnings, including the extra pay for overtime.","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weekly earnings of the subway driver, including any additional pay for overtime work.1. Calculate the Total Hours Worked in a Week:   - The driver works 5 days a week.   - Each day, the driver works 8 hours.   - Total hours in a week = 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours.2. Determine the Number of Overtime Hours:   - The standard work week before overtime is 35 hours.   - Total hours worked is 40 hours.   - Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Standard hours = 40 hours - 35 hours = 5 hours.3. Calculate Regular Pay for the First 35 Hours:   - Regular hourly rate = 20.   - Regular hours = 35 hours.   - Regular pay = Regular hourly rate * Regular hours = 20/hour * 35 hours = 700.4. Calculate Overtime Pay for the Additional 5 Hours:   - Overtime pay is 2 extra per hour over the regular rate for overtime hours.   - Overtime hourly pay rate = Regular hourly rate + Extra pay = 20 + 2 = 22.   - Overtime pay = Overtime hourly rate * Overtime hours = 22/hour * 5 hours = 110.5. Calculate the Total Weekly Earnings:   - Total weekly earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = 700 + 110 = 810.After performing all these calculations, the driver's total weekly earnings, including the extra pay for overtime, is:# 810"},{"question":"Alex and Jamie are both part-time sales associates at a trendy clothing store.

Assess the vehicle capacity:   - The minivan can carry a maximum of 7 passengers, including the social worker.   - Therefore, the minivan can carry 6 family members at a time (since the social worker is the 7th passenger).4. Calculate the number of trips needed per appointment:   - Since the minivan can carry 6 family members at a time, and there are 12 family members in total, we need to split them into 2 trips per appointment (12 members ÷ 6 members per trip = 2 trips per appointment).5. Calculate the total number of trips for all appointments:   - There are 12 appointments in total (as calculated in step 2).   - For each appointment, 2 trips are needed.   - Therefore, total trips needed = 12 appointments × 2 trips per appointment = 24 trips.Thus, the social worker will need to make a total of 24 trips to ensure all family members attend their appointments.# 24"},{"question":"Ms. Johnson is a caring educator who supports 12 homeless youth in her community.

This year is the Year of the Dragon, and the student finds out that their birth year was also the Year of the Dragon. If the student is currently 24 years old, in what year were they born?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the year of birth and the current year based on the Chinese zodiac cycle. The Chinese zodiac cycle consists of 12 years, each represented by a different animal. Since the student was born in the Year of the Dragon and this year is also the Year of the Dragon, the student's age must be a multiple of 12.Given:- The student is currently 24 years old.- This year is the Year of the Dragon.Step-by-step solution:1. Since the student is 24 years old and the zodiac cycle is 12 years, the age 24 implies that the student was born exactly two full zodiac cycles (24 ÷ 12 = 2).2. Since this year is the Year of the Dragon and the student is 24 years old, the student's birth year must also have been a Year of the Dragon that is two cycles back from this year.3. To find the student's birth year, we subtract their age from the current year:   - If this year is the Year of the Dragon and the current year is denoted by ( Y ), then:     [     text{Birth Year} = Y - 24     ]4. The problem doesn't provide the specific current year, so let's denote this year (the Year of the Dragon) as ( Y ).5. Therefore, the student's birth year, also a Year of the Dragon, is:   [   Y - 24   ]6. Since the student was born two cycles (24 years) ago, the calculation is consistent with returning to a Year of the Dragon.Final Answer:# Y - 24"},{"question":"Jamie's child loves watching Nickelodeon shows and spends time each week enjoying their favorite episodes.

Additionally, you prepared 20 special Eurovision trivia cards to entertain your guests. During the party, each guest, including yourself, participated in a trivia game where each person received an equal number of trivia cards. How many trivia cards did each person receive?","answer":"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:1. Identify the total number of people at the party.   - You invited 15 friends.   - Including yourself, this makes a total of ( 15 + 1 = 16 ) people.2. Determine the total number of trivia cards.   - There are 20 special Eurovision trivia cards.3. Distribute the trivia cards equally among all guests.   - Since there are 16 people and 20 trivia cards, each person should receive an equal number of trivia cards.   - To find how many trivia cards each person receives, divide the total number of trivia cards by the number of people:   [   frac{20 text{ trivia cards}}{16 text{ people}} = 1.25 text{ trivia cards per person}   ]4. Determine if equal distribution is possible.   - Since distributing 1.25 trivia cards per person is not feasible (as you cannot distribute a fraction of a trivia card), we must reconsider our approach.   - In a real situation, you would need either more trivia cards or a different distribution method since it is not possible to equally distribute the 20 trivia cards among 16 people.Therefore, since the problem asks for how many trivia cards each person receives when divided equally, the answer is that each person receives 1 trivia card with 4 trivia cards remaining undistributed. However, strictly by the problem's wording asking for an equal number, we find:[text{Final number of whole trivia cards each person receives is } 1.]# 1"},{"question":"The CEO of a company is reviewing a report with the product owner about the product roadmap.
