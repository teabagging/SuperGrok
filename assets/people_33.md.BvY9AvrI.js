There are 12 neighborhoods in the community, and each neighborhood has 20 households. However, after distributing sandbags to 7 neighborhoods, Sam receives a report that another storm is approaching, and he needs to distribute an additional 5 sandbags to each household. How many sandbags does Sam need to distribute in total to all the households in the community?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:1. Determine the total number of households in the community:   - There are 12 neighborhoods, and each neighborhood has 20 households.   - Total households = 12 neighborhoods × 20 households/neighborhood = 240 households.2. Calculate the initial distribution of sandbags:   - Sam plans to give each household 15 sandbags initially.   - Initial sandbags needed for the entire community = 240 households × 15 sandbags/household = 3600 sandbags.3. Calculate the additional sandbags needed after the report:   - After distributing sandbags to 7 neighborhoods, Sam needs to distribute an additional 5 sandbags to each household in the community.   - Total households that have received sandbags so far = 7 neighborhoods × 20 households/neighborhood = 140 households.4. Determine the number of households that still need the initial 15 sandbags:   - Households still needing initial sandbags = 240 total households - 140 households = 100 households.   - Sandbags needed for these households = 100 households × 15 sandbags/household = 1500 sandbags.5. Calculate the additional sandbags required for all households:   - Additional sandbags needed for the entire community = 240 households × 5 additional sandbags/household = 1200 sandbags.6. Calculate the total number of sandbags needed:   - Total sandbags needed = Initial sandbags already distributed (7 neighborhoods) + Initial sandbags for remaining households + Additional sandbags for all households.   - Total sandbags = (140 households × 15 sandbags/household) + 1500 sandbags + 1200 sandbags   - Total sandbags = 2100 sandbags (for 7 neighborhoods) + 1500 sandbags (remaining households) + 1200 sandbags (additional)   - Total sandbags = 2100 + 1500 + 1200 = 4800 sandbags.Therefore, the total number of sandbags Sam needs to distribute to all households in the community is:# 4800"},{"question":"A thriller writer is planning her new novel and wants to create a suspenseful sequence of events leading to a shocking twist ending.

She knows that each cow needs 3 kilograms of protein and 2 kilograms of fiber daily to maintain optimal health. Emma has two types of feed: Feed A, which contains 1 kilogram of protein and 0.5 kilograms of fiber per kilogram, and Feed B, which contains 0.5 kilograms of protein and 1 kilogram of fiber per kilogram.  Emma decides to mix these feeds to provide exactly the required nutrients for one cow. If Emma uses 4 kilograms of Feed A, how many kilograms of Feed B will she need to meet the cows' daily protein and fiber requirements?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of Feed B Emma needs to mix with 4 kilograms of Feed A to meet the daily nutritional requirements for one cow. We need to satisfy two conditions: the cow needs 3 kilograms of protein and 2 kilograms of fiber.Let's define:- ( x ) as the kilograms of Feed A (given as 4 kilograms),- ( y ) as the kilograms of Feed B (unknown, what we need to find).Feed A contains:- 1 kilogram of protein per kilogram,- 0.5 kilograms of fiber per kilogram.Feed B contains:- 0.5 kilograms of protein per kilogram,- 1 kilogram of fiber per kilogram.The requirements per cow are:- 3 kilograms of protein,- 2 kilograms of fiber.Now we can set up the equations based on the information provided:1. Protein equation:     [   1x + 0.5y = 3   ]   Substitute ( x = 4 ) into the equation:   [   1(4) + 0.5y = 3   ]   [   4 + 0.5y = 3   ]   [   0.5y = 3 - 4   ]   [   0.5y = -1   ]   [   y = -2   ]2. Fiber equation:   [   0.5x + 1y = 2   ]   Substitute ( x = 4 ) into the equation:   [   0.5(4) + 1y = 2   ]   [   2 + 1y = 2   ]   [   y = 2 - 2   ]   [   y = 0   ]The two equations derived give us a contradiction. The solution for protein gives ( y = -2 ), which is not feasible as it implies a negative amount of Feed B. The fiber equation yields ( y = 0 ), meaning no Feed B is needed for fiber requirements if 4 kg of Feed A is used. Since a realistic solution must satisfy both nutritional requirements with a non-negative amount of feed, let's check the initial conditions and calculations again:The protein requirements can't be satisfied with 4 kg of Feed A alone, since:- 4 kg of Feed A provides 4 kg of protein (which is more than needed) and 2 kg of fiber (which meets the requirement exactly).Therefore, if Emma uses 4 kg of Feed A, she cannot satisfy the protein requirement with the given proportions unless she reduces the amount of Feed A.

The artist can complete 2 murals per week. The company has a fleet of 15 trucks, and each truck will have a mural painted on it. How many weeks will it take for the artist to complete murals on all the trucks in the fleet?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for the artist to complete murals on all 15 trucks, given that the artist can complete 2 murals per week. Let's go through the solution step-by-step:1. Determine the total number of murals needed:   - The company has a fleet of 15 trucks.   - Each truck will have one mural painted on it.   - Therefore, the total number of murals needed is 15.2. Determine the number of murals the artist can complete in a week:   - The artist can complete 2 murals per week.3. Calculate the number of weeks required to complete all murals:   - To find out how many weeks it will take, divide the total number of murals by the number of murals the artist can complete per week.   - Number of weeks = Total number of murals / Murals per week = 15 murals / 2 murals per week = 7.5 weeks.4. Consider the practical implications of partial weeks:   - Since the artist cannot work for a fraction of a week, they will need a whole number of weeks to complete all the murals.   - Therefore, the artist will need to round 7.5 weeks up to the nearest whole number, which is 8 weeks.Therefore, the artist will take 8 weeks to complete murals on all the trucks in the fleet.# 8"},{"question":"Jordan is a star athlete who is grateful for their agent's support in managing their busy career.

Calculate the Number of Bags Loaded in 30 Minutes:   - Using the new rate, determine how many bags Alex can load in 30 minutes:     [     1.8 text{ bags per minute} times 30 text{ minutes} = 54 text{ bags}     ]Therefore, if Alex applies the supervisor's efficiency strategy, he can load 54 bags onto the conveyor belt in 30 minutes.# 54"},{"question":"Maria is a digital archivist working on a project to catalog historical documents related to Brazil. She has 120 digital documents to organize, and she plans to categorize them into 4 different themes: Culture, Politics, History, and Geography. Maria has already categorized 30 documents under Culture and 25 documents under Politics. She wants to ensure that each theme has an equal number of documents by the end of her project. How many more documents does she need to categorize under History and Geography to achieve her goal, assuming she will categorize the remaining documents evenly between these two themes?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many documents Maria needs to categorize under each theme so that the number of documents is equal for all four themes. Here's the step-by-step solution:1. Determine the total number of documents for each theme:   - Total documents = 120   - Themes = 4 (Culture, Politics, History, Geography)2. Calculate the target number of documents per theme:   Since there are 120 documents and 4 themes, each theme should have:   [   text{Documents per theme} = frac{120}{4} = 30   ]3. List the documents currently categorized:   - Culture: 30 documents   - Politics: 25 documents   - History: 0 documents (as not yet categorized)   - Geography: 0 documents (as not yet categorized)4. Calculate the number of documents needed to balance the themes:   Since each theme should have 30 documents, let's check for History and Geography:   - Culture already has 30 documents, so it doesn't need more.   - Politics needs (30 - 25 = 5) more documents to reach 30.5. Calculate the remaining documents to be categorized:   - Documents already categorized: (30 + 25 = 55)   - Remaining documents: (120 - 55 = 65)6. Distribute the remaining documents evenly between History and Geography:   Since Politics needs 5 more documents to have 30, we first assign these documents:   - Remaining documents after assigning to Politics: (65 - 5 = 60)   - These 60 documents are to be distributed evenly between History and Geography.7. Calculate how many documents each of History and Geography will receive:   [   text{Documents per remaining theme (History and Geography)} = frac{60}{2} = 30   ]   Thus, History will receive 30 documents and Geography will receive 30 documents.Checking our distribution:- Culture: 30 documents (already complete)- Politics: 30 documents (after adding 5 more)- History: 30 documents- Geography: 30 documentsThis distribution ensures each theme has 30 documents.# 30"},{"question":"Mr. Johnson is a compassionate manager at a local bank who knows that many of his clients face challenges with their loans.

Understand the room and furniture dimensions:   - Room dimensions: 6 meters by 5 meters.   - Furniture:     - Sofa: 3 meters long.     - Two armchairs: 1 meter wide each.     - Coffee table: 1 meter in diameter.2. Identify the distance requirements:   - All pieces of furniture require at least 0.5 meters of clearance between them and any walls or other furniture pieces.3. Plan the layout:   - Sofa placement: Choose a wall to place the sofa. Let's place the 3-meter sofa along one of the 6-meter walls. This means it will run parallel to the longer wall, leaving 3 meters of space on that wall. Since the sofa requires 0.5 meters of clearance on each side, it will occupy a total length of 4 meters along that wall (3 meters for the sofa plus 0.5 meters clearance on each side).   - Armchairs placement: Place the two armchairs along one of the 5-meter walls. Each armchair is 1 meter wide, so they together take up 2 meters along the wall. Adding the clearance of 0.5 meters on each side of both armchairs adds 2 meters total clearance, so they take up 4 meters together along the wall.   - Coffee table placement: The coffee table has a diameter of 1 meter, requiring a radius of 0.5 meters. Including the clearance of 0.5 meters around it, it will require a circular space with a diameter of 2 meters (1 meter for the table plus 0.5 meters clearance on each side).4. Check if the furniture fits:   - Sofa placement check: The sofa needs 4 meters along the 6-meter wall, which fits with additional space.   - Armchairs placement check: The armchairs need 4 meters along the 5-meter wall, which fits.   - Coffee table placement check: The coffee table requires a 2-meter diameter space, so it can fit in the center of the room, assuming the room is not crowded by other furniture due to the clearance requirements.5. Calculate the remaining space:   - The sofa and armchairs are placed against the walls, so they don't take up central space apart from their clearances.   - The coffee table occupies a central circular area of π(1/2)^2 = π/4 ≈ 0.785 square meters.6. Calculate total area and used space:   - Total room area: 6 meters * 5 meters = 30 square meters.   - Used space: The coffee table is the central piece, and it takes up 0.785 square meters.   - Remaining space: 30 square meters - 0.785 square meters ≈ 29.215 square meters.7. Conclusion:   - The furniture can be placed without violating the clearance requirements.   - The remaining available space in the room is approximately 29.215 square meters.# 29.215 square meters"},{"question":"The editor-in-chief of a prestigious history journal, Alex, is eagerly awaiting the next publication from a renowned historian.

How many days in total will Alex spend reviewing the articles and preparing the editorial?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of days Alex will spend both reviewing the articles and preparing the editorial. Let's break it down step by step:1. Calculate the total number of pages of articles.   - Alex is expecting 4 articles, each averaging 25 pages.   - Total pages = Number of articles × Pages per article.   - Total pages = 4 articles × 25 pages/article = 100 pages.2. Determine the number of days Alex will spend reviewing the articles.   - Alex reviews 15 pages per day.   - To find the total days needed for review, we divide the total pages by the number of pages reviewed per day.   - Days for review = Total pages ÷ Pages reviewed per day.   - Days for review = 100 pages ÷ 15 pages/day.   Let's perform the division to find the exact number of days:   [   frac{100}{15} = 6.6667   ]   Since Alex cannot work for a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number. Thus, Alex will need 7 days to complete the review.3. Add the days spent preparing the editorial.   - Alex spends an additional 3 days on the editorial.   - Total days = Days for review + Days for editorial preparation.   - Total days = 7 days + 3 days = 10 days.Therefore, the total number of days Alex will spend on both reviewing the articles and preparing the editorial is:# 10"},{"question":"Emily is a library science student fascinated by the potential of blockchain technology for managing library operations.

A plant whose price is the average of the least and most expensive plant.First, let's identify the least and most expensive plants from the given prices: 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40.- The least expensive plant is priced at 15.- The most expensive plant is priced at 40.Next, we need to find a plant whose price is the average of these two prices:[text{Average price} = frac{15 + 40}{2} = frac{55}{2} = 27.5]We need to check if there is a plant priced at 27.5. However, this exact price is not on the list of available prices (15, 20, 25, 30, 40). Therefore, we need to reconsider the approach, as none of these prices match exactly.Let's verify the calculation again: The average of 15 and 40 is indeed 27.5, which is not available.Given the constraints, it seems there might be a mistake in the question or the interpretation of the average condition. In typical problems of this nature, we expect the average to match one of the available prices exactly.To proceed, let's reflect on standard assumptions or possible interpretations:- It's possible that rounding or a specific choice was implied, but not directly stated.Let's try an alternative approach by re-evaluating potential interpretations of the average condition:1. If we instead try to find a valid combination within these constraints, the closest available prices to 27.5 are 25 and 30. Let's reconsider:   - If we interpret the average choice flexibly or as the closest practical price, we could choose 25, which is available.In this scenario, if we choose 25 (the nearest to the average), the total cost becomes:[15 + 25 + 40 = 80]Therefore, the total amount spent on these three plants would be 80.#80"},{"question":"The CEO of a multinational corporation has decided to acquire a rival company to expand their market reach.

However, they realized they had an additional supply of 36 pencils, 24 notebooks, and 60 stickers left over.If they want to use up all the remaining supplies to make as many complete gift bags as possible, how many additional gift bags can they prepare?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional gift bags Fei and Alex can prepare using the leftover supplies. Each additional gift bag requires the following:- 3 pencils- 2 notebooks- 5 stickersWe are given that they have leftover supplies as follows:- 36 pencils- 24 notebooks- 60 stickersTo determine how many complete gift bags can be made from these supplies, we need to find out how many gift bags can be made from each type of item separately, and then take the minimum of these numbers (because each gift bag needs all three types of items).1. Determine the number of gift bags possible with the leftover pencils:   Each gift bag requires 3 pencils. With 36 pencils, the number of gift bags possible is calculated by dividing the total pencils by the pencils needed per bag:   [   text{Number of gift bags from pencils} = frac{36}{3} = 12   ]2. Determine the number of gift bags possible with the leftover notebooks:   Each gift bag requires 2 notebooks. With 24 notebooks, the number of gift bags possible is calculated by dividing the total notebooks by the notebooks needed per bag:   [   text{Number of gift bags from notebooks} = frac{24}{2} = 12   ]3. Determine the number of gift bags possible with the leftover stickers:   Each gift bag requires 5 stickers. With 60 stickers, the number of gift bags possible is calculated by dividing the total stickers by the stickers needed per bag:   [   text{Number of gift bags from stickers} = frac{60}{5} = 12   ]4. Find the minimum number of complete gift bags that can be made:   We must take the minimum of the three numbers calculated above, as this will determine the maximum number of complete gift bags that can be assembled with the leftover supplies:   [   text{Minimum number of additional gift bags} = min(12, 12, 12) = 12   ]Therefore, Fei and Alex can prepare 12 additional gift bags using all the remaining supplies.# 12"},{"question":"A spiritual advisor visits three different patients each day to provide solace, guidance, and prayers during their recovery.

If each drink costs 1.50 and Maria spends a total of 54 on drinks, how much did Maria spend on snacks?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Maria spent on snacks, given the information about the drinks and the total cost.Step 1: Determine the number of people attending the gathering.Maria invited 18 people, and this includes Carlos. Therefore, the total number of people attending, including Maria herself, is:[ 18 + 1 = 19 text{ people} ]Step 2: Calculate the total number of drinks needed.Each person is to have 2 drinks. Thus, the total number of drinks required is:[ 19 times 2 = 38 text{ drinks} ]Step 3: Calculate the cost of the drinks.Each drink costs 1.50. Therefore, the total cost for the drinks is:[ 38 times 1.50 = 57 text{ dollars} ]Step 4: Compare the calculated total drink cost with given information.However, it is stated in the problem that Maria spends 54 on drinks. Let's re-evaluate the number of drinks based on the given total cost.If the total spent on drinks is 54 and each drink costs 1.50, we find the number of drinks by:[ frac{54}{1.50} = 36 text{ drinks} ]Step 5: Re-evaluate the number of guests based on the drinks.If 36 drinks are available and each person is supposed to have 2 drinks, the number of people that can be served is:[ frac{36}{2} = 18 text{ people} ]This means the total number of people, including Maria and Carlos, is 18, not 19.Step 6: Calculate the amount spent on snacks.Maria bought 3 boxes of snacks, with each box containing 12 packs. Therefore, the total number of packs of snacks is:[ 3 times 12 = 36 text{ packs} ]We don't have the price per pack or per box, but we know how much Maria spent in total. She spent 54 on drinks, and the total amount spent on drinks and snacks together can be calculated by subtracting the drink cost from the total spending.Since the only information we do have is the total spending on drinks (54) and the total spending (which the problem doesn't directly provide but implies there's no other spending), the remaining amount is what she spent on snacks.The problem states that Maria spends 54 on drinks. Therefore, the remaining balance of the total amount spent is the cost of the snacks. Since the problem doesn't indicate any other expenses, it's assumed that the snacks were the only other expense.Thus, the total amount spent on snacks is:[ 54 - 54 = 0 ]Final Step: Correct interpretation.Based on the problem statement and determined information, Maria spent 0 on snacks since all calculations align with the given condition that 54 was spent on drinks, and no additional spending information is provided. However, there seems to be a misinterpretation in the earlier calculations. Let's readjust, since the problem's logical consistency must align with the final answer.Given the earlier error in problem interpretation, it is likely that the total amount spent on drinks alone was misinterpreted. If the problem explicitly states 54 was spent on drinks, then the remaining cost, assuming all information is correct, would typically equal the cost of snacks purchased. No explicit calculation error aligns with this, which implies a direct problem case misinterpretation.# 0"},{"question":"Raj is a professional cyclist who narrowly missed qualifying for the 2022 Asian Games.

Ator, a renowned mathematician famous for their work in combinatorial structures and network analysis, is designing a new series of interconnected nodes for a math-themed amusement park. The park includes a network of paths connecting various attractions, with a total of 15 attractions. Each attraction is directly connected to 3 other attractions using paths, forming a web-like structure.If Dr. Ator decides to add 5 more attractions to the park, and connects each new attraction to exactly 3 existing attractions (without adding new connections between the existing attractions), how many connections (paths) will there be in total when the new attractions are added?","answer":"To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:1. Initial Connections Calculation:   - We start with 15 attractions, each connected to 3 other attractions.   - Since each connection involves two attractions, counting each connection twice, the total number of connections is:     [     frac{15 times 3}{2} = 22.5     ]   - Since the number of connections must be an integer, this indicates a potential misunderstanding in the problem statement regarding the network structure. However, let's assume the problem implies a type of graph where these numbers are consistent, and re-examine it.   - Let's assume that the network is a valid graph and the calculation of 22.5 is incorrect due to an interpretation error. A configuration that fits is starting with a graph like a 15-node cycle or ring, which has 15 connections.2. Adding New Attractions:   - When 5 new attractions are added, each connects to 3 of the existing attractions.   - Since none of these connections are between the new attractions themselves, each new connection adds exactly one new path.3. Additional Connections Calculation:   - Each of the 5 new attractions gets 3 connections, thus:     [     5 times 3 = 15     ]   - These are 15 new connections added to the previous total.4. Total Connections:   - Sum the original connections and the new connections:     [     15 + 15 = 30     ]Thus, the total number of connections (paths) when the new attractions are added is:[boxed{30}]The final number of connections in the network after adding the new attractions is 30."},{"question":"A writer of sea-themed novels is preparing for a book signing event.

To make the model, they need to calculate the total force required to lift a 5 kg weight using a robotic arm. Dr. Marie knows that each segment of the robotic arm can exert a force of 10 Newtons. The robotic arm has three segments. First, Dr. Marie calculates the force due to gravity on the weight using the formula: Force = mass × acceleration due to gravity (where acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s²). Next, she determines how many segments need to work together to lift the weight. If each segment can exert a force of 10 Newtons, how many segments are needed to lift the weight?How many total Newtons of force are the segments collectively exerting when lifting the weight?","answer":"To solve this problem, we will go through the following steps:1. Calculate the force due to gravity on the weight:   The weight of the object is given as 5 kg. The formula to calculate the force due to gravity is:   [   text{Force} = text{mass} times text{acceleration due to gravity}   ]   The acceleration due to gravity is approximately (9.8 , text{m/s}^2).   Therefore, the gravitational force on the weight is:   [   text{Force} = 5 , text{kg} times 9.8 , text{m/s}^2 = 49 , text{N}   ]2. Determine how many segments are needed to lift the weight:   Each segment of the robotic arm can exert a force of 10 Newtons. We need to find out how many such segments are required to provide at least 49 Newtons of force to lift the weight.   To find this, we divide the total force required by the force exerted by one segment:   [   text{Number of segments} = frac{49 , text{N}}{10 , text{N/segment}} = 4.9   ]   Since the number of segments must be a whole number, and 4.9 rounds up to 5, Dr. Marie will need 5 segments. However, since the problem states that the arm has only 3 segments, we need to check whether all 3 segments can lift the weight.3. Calculate the total force exerted by all segments collectively:   Since we have 3 segments, the total force they can exert collectively is:   [   text{Total force} = 3 , text{segments} times 10 , text{N/segment} = 30 , text{N}   ]   Since 30 N is less than the required 49 N, the given number of segments is insufficient to lift the weight.

Verify the Total Funding:   Let's add all the contributions together to ensure they meet the required 15,000:   - Government Grant: 6,000   - Private Donor: 4,500   - Community Fundraising: 500   Total Funding:   [   6,000 + 4,500 + 500 = 11,000   ]   Since the goal is to ensure the project is fully funded, let's re-evaluate the contributions. It seems there is an inconsistency. The private donor's contribution should ensure the total funding reaches 15,000.5. Re-evaluate the Contribution Needed from the Private Donor:   Given that the total funding with the current calculations only reaches 11,000, and we need 15,000, the private donor should contribute the remaining amount after accounting for the grant and fundraising event:   [   15,000 - (6,000 + 500) = 8,500   ]   Therefore, the private donor should contribute 8,500 to fully fund the project.#8,500"},{"question":"A fashion designer is planning a runway show with an immersive dining experience to complement their new collection.

Calculate the new speed:   - Original speed = 10 units   - Increase in speed from adding A blocks = 4 A blocks × 5 units per A block = 20 units   - New speed = Original speed + Increase in speed   - New speed = 10 units + 20 units = 30 units2. Calculate the new strength:   - Original strength = 12 units   - Increase in strength from adding B blocks = 5 B blocks × 3 units per B block = 15 units   - New strength = Original strength + Increase in strength   - New strength = 12 units + 15 units = 27 units3. Calculate the new intelligence:   - Original intelligence = 15 units   - Increase in intelligence from adding C blocks = 6 C blocks × 2 units per C block = 12 units   - New intelligence = Original intelligence + Increase in intelligence   - New intelligence = 15 units + 12 units = 27 unitsNow, we compile the new attributes of the creature:- New speed = 30 units- New strength = 27 units- New intelligence = 27 units# (30, 27, 27)"},{"question":"Youssef is a Moroccan citizen who is passionate about digital governance.

The route has 5 scheduled stops, and at each stop, 12 passengers board the bus. The manager wants the driver to be efficient and timely, ensuring the bus completes the route in exactly 60 minutes. If the bus spends 3 minutes at each stop for passengers to board, and the travel time between each stop is equal, how many minutes does the bus spend traveling between stops during the entire route?","answer":"To solve the problem, let's break down the given information and calculate the required travel time.1. Total Time for the Route:   The entire route takes 60 minutes to complete.2. Time Spent at Each Stop:   There are 5 scheduled stops. At each stop, the bus spends 3 minutes for passengers to board. Therefore, the total time spent at stops is:   [   5 text{ stops} times 3 text{ minutes/stop} = 15 text{ minutes}   ]3. Time Available for Traveling:   The total time of 60 minutes includes both the time spent at stops and the traveling time between stops. Given that 15 minutes are used for stops, the remaining time for traveling is:   [   60 text{ minutes} - 15 text{ minutes} = 45 text{ minutes}   ]4. Calculate the Travel Time Between Stops:   The bus travels between stops 4 times (between the first and second stop, second and third stop, third and fourth stop, and fourth and fifth stop). Therefore, the time spent traveling between each pair of stops is:   [   frac{45 text{ minutes}}{4 text{ travel intervals}} = 11.25 text{ minutes/interval}   ]5. Total Travel Time:   The total travel time is the sum of the time for all travel intervals:   [   45 text{ minutes}   ]Thus, the bus spends a total of 45 minutes traveling between stops during the entire route.# 45"},{"question":"Sophia loves decorating her home with a classic, clean style and prefers using bright and light colors.
