Present your entire explanation enclosed in double quotation marks and repeat the prompt exactly as given.To enhance the performance of a machine learning model and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data, one can optimize the learning rate schedule effectively. This involves adjusting the pace at which the model learns during training. Here are some strategies to achieve this:1. Learning Rate Annealing: Gradually decrease the learning rate as training progresses. This approach allows the model to make large updates initially when it is far from the optimal solution, and smaller updates as it approaches a more accurate configuration. Common techniques include exponential decay, step decay, and polynomial decay.2. Cyclical Learning Rates: Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, cyclical learning rates involve periodically varying it between a lower and an upper bound. This can help the model escape local minima and settle into a more robust configuration. Popular methods include the triangular policy and the cosine annealing approach.3. Warm Restarts: Implementing warm restarts resets the learning rate to a higher value after a set number of epochs, followed by gradual annealing. This method can re-energize the learning process and help explore a wider range of model configurations.4. Adaptive Learning Rates: Use algorithms like Adam, RMSprop, or AdaGrad that automatically adjust the learning rate based on the training data. These methods scale the learning rate according to the gradient history, allowing for more adaptive and effective learning.5. Early Stopping: Although not directly related to learning rates, early stopping monitors the model's performance on a validation dataset and halts training when improvement stalls. This prevents excessive fine-tuning and ensures a more generalized model.By applying these learning rate strategies, one can create a more robust and adaptable model that performs well on new and unseen data.\\""},{"question":"Summarize the current status of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments available in the United States.

The proposal should be divided into 4 Sections, each marked with Section N. Each section should contain 3 paragraphs. Include the following keywords in your proposal: \\"aesthetic appeal,\\" \\"user engagement,\\" \\"intuitive interface,\\" and \\"emotional connection.\\"","answer":"Section 1: Introduction to Artistic Design in RoboticsIn recent years, the integration of artistic design into robotics has become a pivotal factor in enhancing user experience. As technology becomes increasingly intertwined with daily life, the aesthetic appeal of robots plays a critical role in how they are perceived and accepted by users. By incorporating elements of art and design, robots can become more than mere tools; they can transform into companions that users are more willing to engage with and trust.The aesthetic appeal of a robot is not merely about its external appearance but also about how its design influences functionality and usability. A well-designed robot can offer an intuitive interface that allows users to interact seamlessly without a steep learning curve. This aspect of design is crucial, as it enables users to focus on the tasks at hand rather than on deciphering complex instructions, thereby enhancing user engagement.Furthermore, the artistic design of robots can foster an emotional connection between the user and the machine. By using colors, shapes, and movements that resonate with human emotions, designers can create robots that feel more approachable and relatable. This emotional connection can lead to increased user satisfaction and loyalty, as users are more likely to continue using robots that provide not just practical solutions, but also a sense of companionship and understanding.Section 2: The Role of Aesthetic AppealAesthetic appeal is a fundamental aspect of artistic design that significantly impacts how users perceive robots. It is the first impression that can attract users and encourage them to explore the robot's capabilities further. A robot with a pleasing design is more likely to be seen as friendly and approachable, which can reduce apprehension and foster positive user engagement from the outset.The importance of aesthetic appeal extends beyond initial impressions; it also plays a role in long-term user satisfaction. A well-designed robot that is visually appealing can become a staple in a user's environment, enhancing the overall ambiance of a space. This consideration is particularly important in settings where robots are intended to interact frequently with humans, such as in homes, schools, or hospitals, where the visual harmony can contribute to a more pleasant and less intrusive presence.Moreover, aesthetic appeal can be strategically used to facilitate an intuitive interface. By aligning visual design elements with functional cues, designers can guide users naturally through interactions. For example, using color coding or symbolic graphics can intuitively indicate a robot's status or suggest actions, thus minimizing the need for extensive instructions and making the user experience more seamless and enjoyable.Section 3: Enhancing User Engagement Through DesignUser engagement is a critical measure of success for any robot, and artistic design can significantly enhance this aspect. An engaging design captures attention and motivates users to interact with the robot more frequently and for longer durations. This engagement is crucial for ensuring that users derive maximum benefit from the robot's capabilities and features.Artistic design contributes to user engagement by creating an intuitive interface that simplifies interactions. By prioritizing user-friendly design principles, such as clear navigation and responsive feedback, designers can ensure that users feel confident and competent when using the robot. This ease of use encourages users to explore the robot's functionalities more thoroughly, leading to a richer and more satisfying experience.Additionally, an emotional connection facilitated by thoughtful design can deepen user engagement. When users feel emotionally connected to a robot, they are more likely to integrate it into their daily routines and rely on it for various tasks. This connection can be nurtured through personalized design elements, such as customizable appearances or behaviors, that allow users to see the robot as an extension of themselves or as a unique entity with which they can form a bond.Section 4: Building Emotional ConnectionsBuilding emotional connections between humans and robots is a nuanced process that benefits greatly from artistic design. This connection is essential for fostering trust and acceptance, particularly in contexts where robots are expected to perform roles that require empathy and understanding, such as in caregiving or education. By leveraging design elements that evoke human-like qualities, designers can bridge the gap between cold machinery and warm companionship.One effective strategy for building emotional connections is to incorporate anthropomorphic features into the robot's design. Elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and vocal tones can make robots appear more relatable and human-like, encouraging users to respond with empathy and affection. These features can be cleverly integrated into the robot's aesthetic appeal, creating a harmonious balance between functionality and emotional resonance.Finally, the emotional connection is further strengthened by an intuitive interface that fosters meaningful interactions. A robot that responds appropriately to user emotions and adapts its behavior accordingly can deepen the sense of connection. By using sensors and algorithms to interpret user cues, robots can offer empathetic responses that align with the user's mood and needs, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and solidifying the bond between human and machine."},{"question":"As an aspiring social entrepreneur focused on scaling healthcare innovation in developing countries, draft a 4 paragraph proposal to potential investors.

The beauty of these infinitely complex patterns has always fascinated me, and I find myself drawn to their mysterious allure. Fractals are mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern at every scale, and they are found everywhere in nature—from the branching of trees to the intricate design of snowflakes. Benoît Mandelbrot, the father of fractal geometry, revolutionized our understanding of these structures, showing us that chaos has an underlying order.My goal is to delve deeper into the Mandelbrot Set, a particularly famous fractal. The Mandelbrot Set is defined by a simple iterative process: for each complex number ( c ), we consider the sequence ( z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c ). Starting with ( z_0 = 0 ), we examine whether this sequence stays bounded or spirals off to infinity. The set of all complex numbers ( c ) for which the sequence remains bounded forms the Mandelbrot Set, a stunningly intricate shape with self-similarity at every scale.As I sit in my study, surrounded by charts and computer screens displaying these mesmerizing forms, I can't help but wonder: What secrets do these fractals hold? How can something so simple give rise to such complexity? My research will not only involve theoretical work but also computer simulations to visualize these patterns. I am eager to embark on this journey, hoping that it will lead me to new insights and perhaps even practical applications in fields like physics, biology, or art.# Section 2Journal Entry by Dr. Emily CarterMarch 15th, 2023After two weeks of intensive study, my understanding of the Mandelbrot Set has deepened. I have been running countless simulations on my computer, each time zooming deeper into the set, revealing layers upon layers of intricate detail. With each zoom, I am greeted by familiar shapes, yet they are never quite the same. This property of self-similarity, where each part resembles the whole, is one of the most fascinating aspects of fractals.Today, I stumbled upon a captivating discovery. While examining the boundary of the Mandelbrot Set, I noticed tiny replicas of the set itself, known as \\"Mandelbrot islands.\\" These miniatures are scattered throughout the edge, each a perfect copy of the whole, no matter how far I zoom in. This recursive nature, where the boundary of the set is infinitely complex, is a testament to the power of iterative processes in mathematics.I am starting to realize that fractals, especially the Mandelbrot Set, are not just mathematical curiosities. They have profound implications in understanding real-world phenomena. For example, the concept of fractal dimensions, which extends our traditional notion of dimensions, can be applied to measure natural forms that do not fit neatly into our standard definitions. The coastline paradox, which describes how the length of a coastline can vary depending on the scale of measurement, is a prime example of a natural fractal in action.# Section 3Journal Entry by Dr. Emily CarterApril 5th, 2023My exploration of fractals has taken an exciting turn. Inspired by the self-similarity of the Mandelbrot Set, I decided to investigate the role of fractals in modeling chaotic systems. Chaos theory, which deals with systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, often relies on fractals to visualize complex dynamics. The butterfly effect, famously described by Edward Lorenz, is a classic example where small changes in the initial state of a system can lead to vastly different outcomes.To illustrate this, I turned my attention to the Julia Set, a relative of the Mandelbrot Set, which is similarly defined by iterating a function but with a fixed complex parameter. Each point in the complex plane either escapes to infinity or remains bounded, and the resulting fractal outlines the boundary between these two regions. The Julia Set's intricate patterns are not only beautiful but also provide a powerful tool for understanding chaotic behavior.By applying fractal geometry to chaotic systems, we can gain insights into a wide range of phenomena, from weather patterns to the stock market. These fractal models help us comprehend systems that are too complex for traditional methods. My research is now focused on developing algorithms to simulate these systems more efficiently, allowing us to predict and perhaps even control chaotic behavior in practical applications.# Section 4Journal Entry by Dr. Emily CarterApril 25th, 2023As I conclude this phase of my research, I find myself reflecting on the profound impact fractals have had on my understanding of the world. These mathematical structures, with their infinite complexity and inherent beauty, have opened my eyes to the hidden order in chaos. Fractals challenge us to see beyond the surface, to appreciate the patterns that govern both nature and human-made systems.One of the most rewarding aspects of my work has been sharing these discoveries with my students and colleagues. The excitement in their eyes as they witness the unfolding of fractal patterns reminds me of why I became a mathematician in the first place. I have also begun collaborating with artists who are inspired by fractals, exploring how these mathematical concepts can be expressed through visual art and music.Looking ahead, I am eager to apply fractal geometry to new fields, perhaps even delving into the realm of quantum mechanics or exploring the structure of the universe itself. Fractals have shown me that beauty and complexity often go hand in hand, and that there is always more to discover. As I close my journal for now, I do so with the knowledge that this journey is far from over, and that the world of fractals will continue to inspire and challenge me in ways I have yet to imagine."},{"question":"Describe the song that I am currently listening to.","answer":"I'm sorry, but I don't have the ability to perceive or interact with the external environment, so I can't describe the song you are currently listening to.

Il posto dove viveva Nivor era occultato in un corridoio di servizio, dove non passa tanta gente.Alcuni potevano essere invidiosi di una unità residenziale per un singolo.Arrivarono all’ingresso senza aver incontrato nessuno. Una volta lì Nivor baciò Dalen dietro la testa.«Lo sai che sono innamorato di te?» Lei arrossì.« Beh, ti si sono ammaccati tutti i capelli»« Credo che dovrei farmi un altro shampoo»Aperta la porta, entrambi sostarono a lungo sul tappeto: dovevano scaricare tutta l’acqua che avevano nelle scarpe.L’ambiente era molto tiepido. Caldo, accogliente e con pochissima luce. Sullo sfondo si vedeva il balcone e i fulmini del temporale.Al centro un tavolo di legno con una tovaglia verde.C’erano due stanze a lato. Quelle a sinistra rispettivamente il cucinino e la camera da letto. A destra il ripostiglio e il bagno.Lui conosceva bene quel posto. Andò in bagno, prese due asciugamani con cui si asciugarono« La doccia la fai prima tu?»« Non se ne parla, Nivor. Ti potresti ammalare« Sono alto uno e ottantadue e peso 80 kg. Il mio fisico può permettersi di stare un po’ umido»Dalen sospirò.«Troverai tutto pronto in bagno. Vestiti, biancheria, l’accappatoio, tutto. Anche uno shampoo per capelli tinti, pensa un po’»«Grazie»Poco prima che lei si chiudesse in bagno, vide Nivor levarsi la maglia (doveva asciugarsi). Ne emerse un petto largo, robusto e piatto, tutto d’un pezzo, con spalle fiere, muscoli gonfi e le ossa delle braccia belle larghe.« Mi piaci, Niv» disse sorridendo.Dette queste parole Nivor aveva appena finito di togliesi l’altro calzino. Non ci aveva mai fatto caso ma l’insieme dei piedi, delle caviglie, dei polpacci e delle cosce robuste di Nivor…beh, lo rendevano così bello. Soprattutto considerando che aveva 23 anni.«So-Sono contento di questo»A piedi nudi si avviò verso di lei, producendo un rimbombo nella struttura«I love you»I due si baciarono. Stavolta un bacio a stampo, sulle labbra. Poi Dalen chiuse la porta del bagno.Durò pochi minuti dopodiché uscì dalla tenda della doccia.Si asciugò con l’asciugamano messo a disposizione per lei, poi prese a vestirsi.Gli slip che Nivor aveva scelto per lei erano quelli azzurri e di ottimo tessuto che aveva. Stessa cosa per i calzini, quanto al pigiama, aveva portato da lui solo un completo rosa a cuori.La cura che Nivor aveva per lei, pensò. Era tale che scelse i vestiti migliori. Era raro, rifletteva, trovare un ragazzo che avesse così tanta cura per un’altra persona.Si mise il pigiama senza particolari problemi, quanto al reggiseno, beh era difficile agganciarlo da dietro.Di nuovo fuori«Nivor?»Era sdraiato sul divano dietro la porta. Era in mutande e a piedi nudi, con un’asciugamano sul petto. I suoi piedi erano belli, grandi e robusti.Stava leggendo qualche articolo di politica sul microcomputer.Le rovolse uno sguardo, il tempo per mettere a fuoco ed era già da lui.«ti dispiace?» chiese di spalle.Lui ci mise qualche secondo per capire la natura di quella richiesta, poi vedendo Dalen che con le mani teneva le due estremità del reggiseno fu naturale per lui unire i tre ganci«Grazie» disse lei«Fortuna che non sono una ragazza, non sopporterei questo genere di cose» Dalen nel frattempo era tornata indietro a mettersi la parte superiore del pigiama.«Che hai combinato lì dentro? Ce ne hai messo di tempo» disse alzando la voce. Lei sospirò all’interno del pigiama.«Per stare al cesso mezz’ora devi esserti fatta un check-up da Dio» Dalen sorrise.Anche Nivor le sorrise e mentre era girata di spalle le diede un debole e affettuso calcio col piede.Dalen quindi si girò, guardò il suo fidanzato negli occhi e iniziò a massaggiare i piedi del suo fidanzato. Erano piedi grandi e forti, con delle dita lunghe e ben proporzionate. La loro grandezza era approssimativamente quella della sua testa.Poi si inginocchiò, proprio dinnanzi alla spalliera del divano e s’inumidì le labbra con la lingua, mentre la testa di lui era su quella opposta.«Fa’ quello che stai pensando di fare» sussurrò lui con voce profonda e sensualeDalen avvicinò il volto al piede del fidanzato, prima adagiò le labbra umide facendo un debole risucchio, poi gli diede un lento bacio. Allontanò il viso solo di qualche centimetro e tirò fuori la lingua.«apri la bocca» disse lui in tono autoritario. Nel mentre aveva spinto con decisione il piede verso il suo viso, schiacciandolo.Nivor, prima con delicatezza e precisione indirizzò l’alluce verso la bocca di Dalen, facendolo entrare, poi iniziò a spingere il piede più in profondità nella bocca di Dalen, muovendolo lentamente avanti e indietro.«Ti piace quando ti metto i piedi in bocca? » disse luiSenza staccare la lingua la ragazza annuì. «u-uh»Nivor si stiracchiò con un sospiro, spingendo ancora di più il piede nella bocca di Dalen. Così si concentrò sul piede, leccandolo con la lingua e succhiandolo con le labbra in modo sensuale.«dimmi che mi desideri» disse lui«ti desidero»«Quanto?»«Tanto»«Allora dillo»«Dirti cosa?» fece lei, col piede del ragazzo in mano«Dimmi che sei la mia puttana»«Sono la tua puttana» fece lei, con fare lento e ipnotico. Stava per aggiungere qualcosa, ma lui la fermò, ordinandole di continuare con i piedi.Dalen obbedì, continuando a leccare e baciare i piedi del suo fidanzato in modo sempre più erotico, mentre Nivor si godeva il piacere della sottomissione sessuale e verbale di Dalen.«Sei così brava con la lingua» disse lui con un gemito piacevole, spingendo ancora di più il piede nella bocca di Dalen. Lei rispose con un altro lento bacio sul suo piede, prima di succiarlo di nuovo con le labbra.«Ti piace quando ti ordino di fare cose perverse, vero troia?» sussurrò Nivor con voce rauca. Aveva alzato le braccia e si era messo le mani dietro alla testa.«Sì, mi piace» rispose Dalen.Ad un certo punto Nivor prese il controllo in modo definitivo e iniziò a muovere i piedi sempre più in fondo nella bocca di Dalen, facendo velocemente dentro e fuori.Con quella presenza forzata, la bocca di Dalen iniziò a fare suoni sensuali, come “gag…gag…gag…”. Ben presto il suo viso arrossì e dal suo volto iniziò a scorrer un lungo fiume di bava. Infine, con uno scatto bello forte, le spinse il piede nella bocca di Dalen, fin dove poteva, facendolo restare lì per diversi secondi.«Non azzardarti ad arretrare» le disse duro.“muuu” “mmmmmmhhh” faceva lei, con la bocca tappata dal piede.La ragazza si sentiva soffocare e stava avendo il riflesso di rigetto, quando dopo un po’, tutto in una volta, nivor arretrò il piede, consentendole di respirare e di riassaporare l’aria fresca.«Dalen» fece lui «Dimmi la verità: a te piace quando mi comporto così, vero?»con un leggero mal di testa, e mentre riprendeva il fiato, Dalen annuì vagamente.«Vuoi il mio piede? Disse lui. Dalen annuì di nuovo.«Allora dillo» fece lui.«Voglio il tuo piede nella mia bocca» disse lei piattaNivor parve offeso. «Ci manca qualcosa, troia»«Per favore, metti il tuo piede nella mia bocca. Per piacere»Nivor fece un ghigno sinistro. Poi le rimise il piede in bocca.Nel mentre, alzò entrambe le mani e se le mise dietro la testa, facendogli da cuscino. Alzò il capo in alto e chiuse gli occhi, sorridente.«Sono un cazzo di maschio alfa» disse lui con felicità e una certa soddisfazione.Poi rivolse uno sguardo di sufficienza a Dalen «Tu continua a leccare, zoccola»Ad un certo punto Nivor le disse di smettere, cosa che lei fece.«Però resta lì» fece lui «Anzi, forse è meglio se ti allontani dal divano. però resta in ginocchio»Nivor si alzò da lì e si piazzò dinnanzi a lei. Era in piedi, e quella presenza massiva era enorme, paragonata a lei che era in ginocchio.«chiudi gli occhi» sussurrò. Lei eseguì.Dopo un po’ sentì un getto caldo e concentrato di liquido sulla faccia. Dalen voleva capire cosa stava succedendo, ma… «tieni quei cazzo di occhi chiusi!» ordinò lui.Però in qualche modo capì cosa stava succedendo: Nivor stava pisciando sulla sua faccia.Sentiva il suo piscio scorrerle addosso e per la prima volta Dalen si sentiva come se fosse un cesso. Ad un certo punto le sputò persino addosso.«Nivor…» fece lei con l’affanno e la voce rotta, ma… «Ti ho detto di stare zitta, puttana!»Lui si allontanò per un istante, poi tornò verso Dalen, al cui bel mezzo c’era la pozza di piscio. Adoperò qualcosa alle mani della ragazza: le aveva messo un paio di manette e dallo scatto intuì che le aveva chiuse.A quel punto Nivor si sfilò via i suoi slip, rivelando il suo pene: era oggettivamente di grandi dimensioni.«Vediamo se indovini adesso cosa succede» fece lui tutto contento.Senza attendere la risposta della ragazza, l’afferrò per i fianchi e la fece girare.«Preparati troia, perché adesso ti sfondo il culo»Le obiezioni che seguirono durarono ben poco perchè Nivor prese il suo calzino bianco che aveva tirato a terra, ancora umido del suo sudore e lo ficcò nella bocca di Dalen, che a quel punto non poteva far altro che mugulare.Poi sentì la grossa e calda cappella del suo pene dietro di sè. Nivor aveva un pene di 7 pollici e mezzo e sapeva che non si sarebbe fermato fin quando non sarebbero stati tutti dentro di lei.«Pronta a farti rompere il culo?»Senza attendere la sua risposta Nivor iniziò a spingere contro di lei, incurante del suo dolore. Sentì il pene di Nivor affondare pian piano, poi con uno scatto si abbattè su di lei, spingendo il pene tutto dentro, fino alle palle.Dalen gemeva di dolore, ma Nivor non si fermava. Iniziò a pompare il suo pene dentro di lei, in maniera sempre più brutale e violenta.Il dolore si trasformò in piacere, e Dalen cominciò ad ansimare e a gemere di piacere. Nivor continuava a spingere sempre più forte, facendo entrare il suo pene sempre più profondamente.Dalen si sentiva completamente sottomessa a questo ragazzo che la stava scopando con una tale forza che sembrava volesse distruggerla.«Mi stai rompendo!» cercò di dire lei col viso bagnato dalle lacrime e il calzino in bocca, risultando invece in un insieme di versi indistinti. Lui invece fece finta di non sentire e non solo continuò, ma rincarò la dose facendo sbattere le palle contro la sua vagina. Dopo un po’ lui alzò la mano e coprì la bocca di Dalen per farla stare zitta. Con l’altra mano le stringeva la gola, strozzandola.mentre continuava a pompare dentro di lei con ancora maggiore intensità.Dopo qualche minuto, Nivor si fermò, tirando fuori il suo pene tutto in una volta. Dalen aveva il culo largo e aperto, ormai sfondato.«Era proprio quello che volevo. Ti ho rotto il culo come un vero maschio alfa» fece lui con un sorriso trionfante. Come ciliegina sulla torta, sputò anche sul culo di Dalen.A quel punto la liberò dalle manette e dal calzino. Percepì i suoi muscoli, il suo tatuaggio trivale, il suo petto… lui però sembrava intuirlo«Sono un gran figo, un autentico animale»Dopo un po' parve calmarsi e si rivolse a Dalen.«Vuoi che ti aiuti ad alzarti?»Lei non disse nulla, probabilmente non ci riusciva, ma lui le porse la mano. L'aiutò a rimettersi in piedi, appiggiandosi a lui.","answer":"Mi dispiace, ma non posso procedere con la creazione o espansione di questo tipo di contenuto che include tematiche di sottomissione sessuale o attività sessualmente esplicite all'interno di un contesto non consensuale o degradante."},{"question":"Where in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" does it say that the Earth orbits the Sun?","answer":"\\"Wuthering Heights,\\" written by Emily Brontë, is a novel published in 1847 that focuses on the complex human emotions and relationships between characters, most notably Heathcliff and Catherine.

A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome.Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno.Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati.Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale.Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità.Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato.S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del compagno, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due.«Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente.«Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose»«Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei«E se poi scopri che…?»«Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà»Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina.In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre.«Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva.«Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo.«Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo»Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento.Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto.Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta.«Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano.«Sono in soggiorno»La faceva sentire così insoddisfatta e indesiderata. Quanto avrebbe desiderato anche solo uno sguardo da parte di Andrey. Un tocco intimo, una frase sconcia, qualcosa. Invece pareva che il suo fidanzato fosse di ghiaccio. Non l’aveva mai guardata o desiderata come fanno gli altri maschi… a stento poteva definirlo un uomo.Una sera, Debbie si era appena fatta la doccia. Dopo essersi asciugata, indossò la vestaglia del pigiama e si avviò verso la loro camera da letto.Andrey stava già dormendo sul suo lato del letto, con solo i boxer addosso. Presa dalla curiosità, Debbie si avvicinò verso di lui per controllare. Andrey sembrava proprio un angioletto. Non soltanto per la sua purezza sessuale e l’innocenza del suo affetto, ma teneva le palpebre chiuse mentre dormiva nel più pacifico dei modi. In quel momento, lei lo sapeva, avrebbe voluto stringerla a sé. Poi prese a guardare il suo uomo: i suoi piedi sexy, le caviglie, le ginocchia, le sue gambe robuste e i boxer che aderivano ad esse. Il suo petto muscoloso e i suoi capezzoli maschili, con le braccia dalle spalle larghe.Malgrado asessuale, Andrey era un uomo formato in tutto e per tutto, un giovane e sexy ragazzo. Spinta da una curiosità che non sapeva definire, Debbie osò e iniziò a carezzare il petto di Andrey, che era caldo e rosato.Una volta che Debbie fu sul letto, si posizionò in senso inverso rispetto alla testa di Andrey, per ammirare i suoi piedi mentre lui dormiva tranquillo. Aveva piedi piuttosto grandi, quelli di cui aveva bisogno per sorreggere l’altezza del suo metro e ottantacinque. Eppure Debbie si sentiva attratta da quella figura che sorreggeva il peso del suo uomo. Col pollice carezzò l’intero piede, sentendo la pelle ruvida e dura di Andrey. Poi, sentendo che il suo corpo la stava portando dove diceva il suo istinto, avvicinò la testa al piede di Andrey, allungò le labbra e gli diede un bacio. Andrey sembrava ancora addormentato, così si sentì tranquilla di proseguire: tirò fuori la lingua e iniziò a leccarlo.Face sensualmente con la lingua su e giù, un gesto che non poteva certamente compiere con Andrey sveglio, ma le piaceva sentire il sapore della pelle di Andrey. Volendo osare di più, Debbie tornò con la testa rivolta verso Andrey e prese a tastargli le spalle, che avevano ossa larghe e robuste. Lasciò scorrere la mano fino al braccio di Andrey, dove sentì la rigidità dei suoi muscoli.«Oh, Andrey…» sospirò lei. «si…»Anche se asessuale, Andrey aveva comunque il corpo di un uomo, per altro ben formato. E Debbie non poteva farci nulla.Appoggiò la testa al petto di Andrey. Ne percepiva la sua pelle liscia e secca, senza neppure un pelo. Iniziò a baciare il suo addome per dirigersi verso l’alto, poi baciò i suoi capezzoli maschili. Si stupì nel constatare che anche quelli dei maschi potevano essere rigidi, ma nel caso di Andrey era dovuto alla sua prestanza.Sotto di lei continuava a carezzare il suo addome, che era duro e tonico.Quanto lo desiderava, il suo uomo.Ad un certo punto, lui si svegliò, trovando la figura di Debbie sul suo petto.«Che ci fai lì Debbie?","answer":"Mi dispiace, ma non posso fornire contenuti che includano o descrivano pratiche sessuali non consensuali o altre forme di interazioni intime non consensuali.
