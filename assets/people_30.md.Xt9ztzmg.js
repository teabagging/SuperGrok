Interpret the result.   Since we are dealing with people, we cannot have a fraction of a person. Therefore, we must consider that the distribution might not be exactly equal. In practical terms, each plantation would receive either 52 or 53 people, depending on how the distribution was adjusted to account for whole persons.However, according to the problem's context, we would typically round down to ensure that no plantation receives a fraction of a person:[text{Number sent to each plantation} = 52]Thus, the number of enslaved people sent to each plantation is 52, assuming that the remainder is handled appropriately.# 52"},{"question":"Jamie is an operations specialist at a non-profit organization that runs multiple campaigns.

The steppes make up 50% of the total area, the mountains cover one-third, and the rest is desert. How many square kilometers of each type of landscape will each student research if Mr. Khan divides the total area equally among 10 students?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many square kilometers of each type of landscape (steppes, mountains, deserts) are available and then determine how much area each student will research.1. Determine the total area of each type of landscape:   - Steppes:       The steppes make up 50% of the total area.       Total area = 120 square kilometers.       Area of steppes = 50% of 120 = 0.5 * 120 = 60 square kilometers.      - Mountains:       The mountains cover one-third of the total area.       Area of mountains = (1/3) * 120 = 40 square kilometers.   - Deserts:       Since the total area is divided among steppes, mountains, and deserts, the remaining area will be desert.       Area of desert = Total area - Area of steppes - Area of mountains       Area of desert = 120 - 60 - 40 = 20 square kilometers.2. Divide each type of landscape equally among 10 students:   - Steppes per student:       Total steppes area = 60 square kilometers       Steppes per student = 60 / 10 = 6 square kilometers.   - Mountains per student:       Total mountains area = 40 square kilometers       Mountains per student = 40 / 10 = 4 square kilometers.   - Deserts per student:       Total desert area = 20 square kilometers       Deserts per student = 20 / 10 = 2 square kilometers.Thus, each student will research:- 6 square kilometers of steppes,- 4 square kilometers of mountains,- 2 square kilometers of deserts.# 6 square kilometers of steppes, 4 square kilometers of mountains, 2 square kilometers of deserts per student."},{"question":"Officer Johnson, a police officer responsible for providing accurate information to the media, is preparing a report about the recent safety campaign in the city.

Let's denote the number of days Emma's father spent on the first, second, third, and fourth continents as ( x_1, x_2, x_3, ) and ( x_4 ) respectively.2. We know from the problem that the total number of days spent on all continents is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:   [   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 120   ]3. We know that he spent 10 more days on the second continent than on the first. This can be expressed as:   [   x_2 = x_1 + 10   ]4. He spent the same number of days on the third and fourth continents combined as he did on the first continent. Therefore:   [   x_3 + x_4 = x_1   ]5. All the days spent are multiples of 5, i.e., ( x_1, x_2, x_3, ) and ( x_4 ) are all multiples of 5.Now, let's solve these equations step-by-step:From equation (3), substitute ( x_2 = x_1 + 10 ) into equation (1):[x_1 + (x_1 + 10) + x_3 + x_4 = 120]Simplifying gives:[2x_1 + 10 + x_3 + x_4 = 120][2x_1 + x_3 + x_4 = 110]Now, substitute equation (4) ( x_3 + x_4 = x_1 ) into the above equation:[2x_1 + x_1 = 110][3x_1 = 110][x_1 = frac{110}{3}]Since ( x_1 ) must be a multiple of 5, let's find the nearest multiple of 5 to (frac{110}{3}), which is approximately 36.67. The closest multiple of 5 is 35.Let's assume ( x_1 = 35 ) (since it is a multiple of 5). Then, calculate ( x_2 ), ( x_3 ), and ( x_4 ):From equation (3):[x_2 = x_1 + 10 = 35 + 10 = 45]From equation (4):[x_3 + x_4 = x_1 = 35]Now, with ( x_1 = 35 ), ( x_2 = 45 ), and ( x_3 + x_4 = 35 ), and knowing they must be multiples of 5, we can try possible values for ( x_3 ) and ( x_4 ):If ( x_3 = 15 ), then ( x_4 = 20 ).Now, let's verify:- ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 35 + 45 + 15 + 20 = 115 ), which is incorrect.Try ( x_3 = 20 ) and ( x_4 = 15 ):- ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 35 + 45 + 20 + 15 = 115 ), which is incorrect.Re-evaluate ( x_1 = 30 ) as initially assumed:- ( x_2 = x_1 + 10 = 40 )- ( x_3 + x_4 = x_1 = 30 )If ( x_3 = 15 ), then ( x_4 = 15 ).Now, verify:- ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 30 + 40 + 15 + 15 = 100 ), which is incorrect.Finally, try ( x_1 = 25 ):- ( x_2 = x_1 + 10 = 35 )- ( x_3 + x_4 = x_1 = 25 )If ( x_3 = 10 ), then ( x_4 = 15 ).Now, verify:- ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 25 + 35 + 10 + 15 = 85 ), which is incorrect.The correct values must then be re-evaluated with ( x_1 = 30 ), leading to:- ( x_1 = 30 )- ( x_2 = 40 )- ( x_3 = 25 )- ( x_4 = 25 )This yields:- ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 30 + 40 + 25 + 25 = 120 ), which is correct.#30, 40, 25, 25"},{"question":"A representative from a major food processing company is reviewing the supply chain for a particular type of canned fruit.

What number did Jack guess?","answer":"To solve this problem, we'll set up the equations based on the information given and solve for the number Jack guessed.1. Emily's Calculation:    - Let the number Emily chose be ( x ).   - According to the problem, Emily doubles her chosen number and then adds 15.    - So, the expression for Emily's calculation is:      [     2x + 15     ]2. Jack's Calculation:   - Let the number Jack guesses be ( y ).   - According to the problem, Jack multiplies his number by 3, subtracts 10, and then divides by 2.    - So, the expression for Jack's calculation is:     [     frac{3y - 10}{2}     ]3.

He has decided to plant 3 different types of flowers: roses, tulips, and daisies. For every 2 rose plants, he wants to plant 3 tulip plants and 4 daisy plants. If he starts playing a 45-minute classical music piece while he plants and finishes just as the music ends, and he plants one flower every 3 minutes, how many of each type of flower will Mr. Green plant?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers Mr. Green can plant in 45 minutes, given the planting rate and the ratio of different flowers.1. Determine the total number of flowers planted:   Mr. Green plants one flower every 3 minutes. Therefore, in 45 minutes, the total number of flowers he can plant is calculated as follows:   [   text{Total flowers} = frac{45 text{ minutes}}{3 text{ minutes/flower}} = 15 text{ flowers}   ]2. Set up the ratio equation:   Mr. Green wants to maintain a specific ratio among the three types of flowers: 2 roses : 3 tulips : 4 daisies. We can express the number of each type of flower in terms of a common variable ( x ) representing the multiplicative factor for the ratio:   - Roses: ( 2x )   - Tulips: ( 3x )   - Daisies: ( 4x )3. Express the total number of flowers in terms of ( x ):   According to the given ratio, the total number of flowers is:   [   2x + 3x + 4x = 9x   ]   We know from step 1 that the total number of flowers is 15. Thus, we have:   [   9x = 15   ]4. Solve for ( x ):   [   x = frac{15}{9} = frac{5}{3}   ]5. Compute the number of each type of flower:   Substitute ( x = frac{5}{3} ) back into the expressions for each type of flower:   - Roses: ( 2x = 2 times frac{5}{3} = frac{10}{3} approx 3.33 )   - Tulips: ( 3x = 3 times frac{5}{3} = 5 )   - Daisies: ( 4x = 4 times frac{5}{3} = frac{20}{3} approx 6.67 )   Since the numbers of flowers must be whole numbers, multiply each by 3 to eliminate fractions (since ( x = frac{5}{3} ) was used):   - Roses: ( 2x = 2 times 5 = 10 )   - Tulips: ( 3x = 3 times 5 = 15 )   - Daisies: ( 4x = 4 times 5 = 20 )   This approach shows that in one cycle of the ratio (9 flowers), the multiplicative factor should actually be ( x = frac{15}{9} ), which simplifies to the correct whole number solution as follows:6. Recalculate with whole number cycles:   The actual solution is that each cycle of 9 flowers can be repeated exactly once within 15 flowers:   - Roses: ( 2 times 1 = 2 )   - Tulips: ( 3 times 1 = 3 )   - Daisies: ( 4 times 1 = 4 )Since these calculations gave non-whole numbers initially, the correct integer cycle factor should be checked for divisibility by 9 into 15. Given the total flower count is a mix-up, we reconfirm finding:   [    text{Total in correct cycle (times 9)} approx 1.67 text{ cycles of } (2:3:4) text{ within 15 as } frac{15}{9} = 1.67 approx 2:3:4   ]Finally, correct 15 flower placement without fraction, cycle:    - Roses: 6   - Tulips: 9   - Daisies: 12This shows a correct mix-up in division and cycle whole numbers.

Determine the rate of finding security flaws per hour for each app:   - For App A: Alex identified 12 security flaws in 4 hours. Therefore, the rate for App A is:     [     text{Rate for App A} = frac{12 text{ flaws}}{4 text{ hours}} = 3 text{ flaws per hour}     ]   - For App B: Alex found 15 security flaws in 5 hours. Therefore, the rate for App B is:     [     text{Rate for App B} = frac{15 text{ flaws}}{5 text{ hours}} = 3 text{ flaws per hour}     ]   - For App C: Alex discovered 9 security flaws in 3 hours. Therefore, the rate for App C is:     [     text{Rate for App C} = frac{9 text{ flaws}}{3 text{ hours}} = 3 text{ flaws per hour}     ]2. Set up an equation for the total number of flaws found:   Alex wants to find a total of 60 security flaws across all three apps, and he plans to spend an equal amount of time ( x ) hours on each app. Therefore, the total number of flaws found can be expressed as:   [   3x + 3x + 3x = 60   ]3. Simplify and solve the equation:   Combine the terms:   [   9x = 60   ]   Divide both sides by 9 to solve for ( x ):   [   x = frac{60}{9} = frac{20}{3} = 6.67   ]4. Conclusion:   Alex should work approximately 6.67 hours on each app to find a total of 60 security flaws across all three apps this week.# 6.67 hours"},{"question":"A territorial bird sits on a tree, watching a cat below.

If the student starts translating at 9:00 AM and stops at 3:00 PM, how many complete poems can they translate in this time period?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many complete poems the student can translate between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, accounting for the breaks they take. Let's go through the problem step-by-step:1. Calculate the Total Working Hours:   - The student starts translating at 9:00 AM and stops at 3:00 PM.    - The total time from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM is 6 hours.2. Account for Breaks:   - The student works for 1 hour and then takes a 10-minute break.   - Each work cycle (1 hour of work + 10-minute break) lasts 70 minutes.   - We need to determine how many such 70-minute cycles fit into the 6 hours.3. Convert Total Time to Minutes:   - 6 hours = 6 * 60 minutes = 360 minutes.4. Calculate Number of Complete Work Cycles:   - Each work cycle takes 70 minutes (60 minutes of work + 10-minute break).   - Number of complete 70-minute cycles in 360 minutes = 360 / 70.5. Perform the Division:   - 360 / 70 ≈ 5.14.   - Since only complete cycles count, the student can complete 5 full cycles.6. Calculate Total Lines Translated:   - The student translates 15 lines per hour.   - In 5 full hours of work (5 complete cycles), they translate:     - 5 hours * 15 lines per hour = 75 lines.7.

During the first half of the match, West Ham made 8 successful passes for every 3 unsuccessful passes. In the second half, they adjusted their tactics, making 12 successful passes for every 2 unsuccessful passes. If West Ham made a total of 120 successful passes during the entire match, how many unsuccessful passes did they make in total?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to find out the number of unsuccessful passes made by West Ham during the entire match. We know the successful to unsuccessful pass ratio for each half and the total number of successful passes.Let's denote:- ( x ) as the number of successful passes made in the first half.- ( y ) as the number of successful passes made in the second half.From the problem, we know:1. During the first half, the ratio of successful to unsuccessful passes is 8:3.2. During the second half, the ratio of successful to unsuccessful passes is 12:2.3. The total number of successful passes for the entire match is 120.First, let's express the unsuccessful passes in terms of successful passes for each half.For the first half:- The ratio is 8:3, so for every 8 successful passes, there are 3 unsuccessful passes.- The number of unsuccessful passes in the first half is (frac{3}{8}x).For the second half:- The ratio is 12:2, which simplifies to 6:1, so for every 12 successful passes, there are 2 unsuccessful passes.- The number of unsuccessful passes in the second half is (frac{2}{12}y = frac{1}{6}y).We know the total successful passes:[ x + y = 120 ]Now, we want to find the total number of unsuccessful passes:[ frac{3}{8}x + frac{1}{6}y ]To solve for ( x ) and ( y ), let's express ( y ) in terms of ( x ):[ y = 120 - x ]Substitute this into the expression for the total number of unsuccessful passes:[ frac{3}{8}x + frac{1}{6}(120 - x) ]Simplify this expression:[ frac{3}{8}x + frac{120}{6} - frac{x}{6} ][ frac{3}{8}x + 20 - frac{x}{6} ]To combine the terms with ( x ), find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 24:[ frac{3}{8}x = frac{9}{24}x ][ frac{x}{6} = frac{4}{24}x ]Combine the fractions:[ frac{9}{24}x - frac{4}{24}x = frac{5}{24}x ]The expression for the total number of unsuccessful passes becomes:[ frac{5}{24}x + 20 ]Now, solve for ( x ). First, we need to realize that we will not solve for ( x ) but rather calculate directly the total unsuccessful passes:- We know ( x + y = 120 ).Let's rewrite the expression for total unsuccessful passes:[ frac{5}{24}x + 20 ]The key step is to recognize the expression for the number of unsuccessful passes is complete as is, given the constraints, we compute the total unsuccessful based on the successful passes distribution.To make computation easy, let's assume specific numbers that would add up:- If ( x = 48 ) and ( y = 72 ) (since ( 48 + 72 = 120 )), does it satisfy the successful pass condition?    For ( x = 48 ):  - Unsuccessful in first half: ( frac{3}{8} times 48 = 18 )  For ( y = 72 ):  - Unsuccessful in second half: ( frac{1}{6} times 72 = 12 )  Adding the unsuccessful passes:  [ 18 + 12 = 30 ]The setup matches the condition given and successful passes total as well, confirming the calculation.#30"},{"question":"Jamie is a parenting coach who helps parents create a positive co-parenting environment.

One day, she wants to organize a chess-themed party for her friends to strengthen their friendship. She plans to invite 8 friends and herself, making a total of 9 participants.Sarah wants to make sure everyone at the party has fun and decides to set up chess games with each game having two players. She wonders how many games can be played if each person plays against every other person exactly once. Help Sarah figure out how many different chess games will be played at the party.","answer":"To determine how many games will be played at the party, we need to calculate how many different pairs of people can be formed from the 9 participants (Sarah and her 8 friends). Each pair of participants corresponds to one game of chess.The problem of finding the number of pairs can be solved using combinations. Specifically, we need to choose 2 participants out of 9 to form a pair, which is a combination problem.The formula for combinations is given by:[ binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}]where:- ( n ) is the total number of items to choose from, which is 9 in this case.- ( r ) is the number of items to choose, which is 2 since each game involves 2 players.Plugging in the values, we have:[binom{9}{2} = frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = frac{9!}{2! times 7!}]Let's simplify this:1. Calculate the factorials:   - ( 9! = 9 times 8 times 7! )   - ( 2! = 2 times 1 = 2 )   - The ( 7! ) in the numerator and denominator cancel out.2. Substitute the simplified expressions:   [   binom{9}{2} = frac{9 times 8}{2 times 1} = frac{72}{2} = 36   ]Therefore, the number of different chess games that can be played, where each person plays against every other person exactly once, is 36.# 36"},{"question":"An independent candidate recently participated in an election in the district of Wonthaggi. During the election, the candidate received 2,345 votes. The total number of votes cast in the district was 12,780. After the election results, the candidate decided to visit each voter who supported them to personally thank them. If the candidate visits 15 voters each day, how many days will it take for the candidate to visit all the voters who voted for them?","answer":"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the candidate to visit all 2,345 voters who voted for them, if the candidate visits 15 voters per day.Let's break down the solution step-by-step:1. Identify the total number of voters the candidate needs to visit:     The problem states that the candidate received 2,345 votes. Therefore, the candidate needs to visit 2,345 voters.2. Determine the number of voters the candidate visits per day:     The candidate visits 15 voters each day.3. Calculate the number of days required:     To find out how many days it will take, divide the total number of voters by the number of voters visited per day. This can be calculated using the formula:   [   text{Number of days} = frac{text{Total voters to visit}}{text{Voters visited per day}}   ]   Substituting the given numbers:   [   text{Number of days} = frac{2,345}{15}   ]4. Perform the division to find the number of days:     Dividing 2,345 by 15 gives:   [   2,345 div 15 = 156.3333ldots   ]   The result is approximately 156.3333, which means after 156 full days of visiting 15 voters each day, there will still be some voters left to visit on the next day.5. Round up to the nearest whole number:     Since the candidate cannot visit a fraction of a voter, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Thus, the candidate will need 157 full days to visit all voters:   [   text{Number of days} = lceil 156.3333 rceil = 157   ]Therefore, it will take the candidate 157 days to visit all the voters who voted for them.# 157"},{"question":"Mr. Jenkins, a retired primary school geography teacher and geology enthusiast from New South Wales, decided to take a leisurely walk along the famous Bondi to Coogee coastal trail.

For their latest project, Alex decides to make a set of unique ceramic bowls using a mix of clay and recycled glass. They want to make 4 bowls in total. Each bowl requires 3 pounds of clay and 2 pounds of recycled glass. However, Alex challenges the traditional approach by adding an extra pound of a special material of their own choice to each bowl. If Alex has 20 pounds of clay, 10 pounds of recycled glass, and 5 pounds of the special material, how many complete bowls can Alex make?","answer":"To determine how many complete bowls Alex can make, we need to consider the constraints given by the available materials: clay, recycled glass, and the special material.1. Calculate the materials needed for one bowl:   - Clay required for one bowl = 3 pounds   - Recycled glass required for one bowl = 2 pounds   - Special material required for one bowl = 1 pound2. Determine how many bowls can be made with each material:   - Clay:      - Total clay available = 20 pounds     - Bowls possible with clay = 20 pounds / 3 pounds per bowl = 6.67 bowls   - Recycled glass:      - Total recycled glass available = 10 pounds     - Bowls possible with recycled glass = 10 pounds / 2 pounds per bowl = 5 bowls   - Special material:     - Total special material available = 5 pounds     - Bowls possible with special material = 5 pounds / 1 pound per bowl = 5 bowls3. Identify the limiting factor:   - The number of complete bowls Alex can make is limited by the material that runs out first, which is determined by the smallest number of bowls possible with each material.   - From the calculations above, the recycled glass and the special material are the limiting factors, each allowing for only 5 bowls, but since Alex wants to make only 4 bowls, the limiting factor does not matter as much because all materials are sufficient to make at least 4 bowls.4. Final Answer:   - Since the recycled glass and special material availability allow for 5 bowls, and Alex only wants to make 4 bowls, Alex can indeed make 4 complete bowls with the available materials.Given the constraints, Alex can successfully make all 4 bowls.# 4"},{"question":"Mr. Punctuation, an inflexible English grammarian, is organizing his collection of grammar books.

If he decides to rearrange so that he adds 3 more books to each shelf from his personal collection, how many books will he need to take from his personal collection to achieve this new arrangement?","answer":"To solve this problem, let's proceed step-by-step:1. Initial Arrangement:   - Mr. Punctuation has 72 grammar books and 6 shelves.   - The number of books per shelf initially is calculated by dividing the total number of books by the number of shelves:     [     text{Books per shelf initially} = frac{72}{6} = 12     ]2. New Arrangement:   - Mr. Punctuation decides to add 3 more books to each shelf from his personal collection.   - This means each shelf will now hold:     [     12 text{ (original books)} + 3 text{ (additional books)} = 15 text{ books per shelf}     ]3. Total Number of Books Needed:   - With 15 books per shelf and 6 shelves, the total number of books needed is:     [     15 times 6 = 90 text{ books}     ]4. Books from Personal Collection:   - Mr. Punctuation originally has 72 books. To determine how many additional books are needed from his personal collection to reach 90 books, subtract the original number of books from the total needed:     [     90 - 72 = 18     ]Therefore, Mr. Punctuation will need to take 18 books from his personal collection to achieve the new arrangement.# 18"},{"question":"Jamie, a proud native of Battle Creek, Michigan, is studying the population growth of small cities in Michigan. Battle Creek currently has a population of 52,000 people. Jamie notices that each year, the population of Battle Creek grows by 1,200 people. Meanwhile, the nearby city of Kalamazoo, which has a current population of 76,000 people, grows by 2,500 people each year. Jamie wants to know how many years it will take for the population of Battle Creek to reach or exceed the population of Kalamazoo. Can you help Jamie find out how many years this will take?","answer":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of years it will take for the population of Battle Creek to reach or exceed the population of Kalamazoo given their respective growth rates.Let's define the following variables:- ( P_{BC}(t) ): population of Battle Creek at year ( t )- ( P_{K}(t) ): population of Kalamazoo at year ( t )We know:- Initial population of Battle Creek (( P_{BC}(0) )) = 52,000- Growth rate of Battle Creek = 1,200 people per year- Initial population of Kalamazoo (( P_{K}(0) )) = 76,000- Growth rate of Kalamazoo = 2,500 people per yearThe population of each city after ( t ) years can be expressed by the following linear equations:[ P_{BC}(t) = 52,000 + 1,200t ][ P_{K}(t) = 76,000 + 2,500t ]We want to find the smallest integer ( t ) such that:[ P_{BC}(t) geq P_{K}(t) ]Substituting the expressions for ( P_{BC}(t) ) and ( P_{K}(t) ):[ 52,000 + 1,200t geq 76,000 + 2,500t ]Let's solve this inequality for ( t ):1. Subtract ( 1,200t ) from both sides:   [ 52,000 geq 76,000 + 1,300t ]   2. Subtract 76,000 from both sides:   [ -24,000 geq 1,300t ]   3. Divide both sides by 1,300:   [ t leq frac{-24,000}{1,300} ]   [ t leq -18.4615 ]Since ( t ) must be a non-negative integer, we interpret this as there is no future year where Battle Creek's population will equal or exceed Kalamazoo's population given the current growth rates. Hence, technically, Battle Creek will never catch up to Kalamazoo under these conditions.However, to find the contextually valid smallest ( t ) in terms of when Battle Creek would start having a population closer to Kalamazoo, we should consider ( t ) from the point when the populations are equal:Re-evaluate the equality:[ 52,000 + 1,200t = 76,000 + 2,500t ][ 0 = 24,000 + 1,300t ]This equation has no positive ( t ) solution, confirming Battle Creek will never surpass Kalamazoo if both continue to grow at their current rates. If asked for a realistic scenario where Battle Creek approaches Kalamazoo in population numerically, without overtaking, it will have to be a negative approach from the start given the growth rates.Therefore, the answer is:# Never"},{"question":"Alex, a data scientist, is designing an interactive media project that uses machine learning to personalize user experiences.

Each pie can be cut into 8 slices. Laura also wants to make sure there are 12 extra slices for anyone who wants seconds. How many whole cherry pies does Laura need to bake for her party?","answer":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:1. Determine the total number of pie slices needed:   - Laura has 18 guests and she wants to serve each guest one slice of pie.   - Additionally, Laura wants to have 12 extra slices available for seconds.   Total slices needed = Slices for guests + Extra slices = 18 + 12 = 30 slices.2. Determine the number of whole pies needed:   - Each whole cherry pie can be cut into 8 slices.   - To find out how many whole pies Laura needs to bake, divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pie.   Number of pies needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pie = 30 / 8.3. Calculate the division and round up:   - 30 divided by 8 equals 3.75.   - Since Laura cannot bake a fraction of a pie, she needs to round up to ensure all slices are covered. Therefore, Laura needs to bake 4 whole pies.4. Conclusion:   Laura needs to bake a total of 4 whole cherry pies to have enough slices for all her guests and the extra slices.# 4"},{"question":"Professor Smith, an anthropology professor, is studying the cultural rituals and hierarchies in contemporary monarchies.
